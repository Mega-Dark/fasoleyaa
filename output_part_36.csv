"Had a Keurig 2.0 (with carafe) for a number of years.  Despite issues with the display panel, it made good coffee.  When it finally quit, I came to Amazon to get a replacement.  Didn't really need the carafe feature so went with the ""Classic"".When I unboxed it, I ran several reservoirs of water through it to clean it out.  First couple of cups of coffee were pretty good.  However, I noticed quite a bit of ""leakage"", both water and coffee on my countertop.  The sequence went like this.Turn it on.  While the tank heats up, water begins to drip from the needle.  Once the tank is up to temperature and the heating light goes out, just over 2 tablespoons of water sit in the catch pan.Insert a pod and brew some coffee.  Coffee seems to brew OK.  Once brew is over, the pump refills the tank and the heater comes on.  Once the heater comes on, more water drips.  If I remove my cup, it ends up in the catch pan.Finally, remove the pod.  The pods still drips quite a bit.  If I use one of my reusable pods, the coffee is quite a slushy mess.  Also, once I lift the handle, more water pours out the back.  Some of the this water spills into the inside of the unit and drains out onto my counter.  After a few cups the pan is fairly full and need emptying.I read many posts and viewed many videos about leaky Keurigs.  The were all about ones well used.  Mine was new.  So I returned it to Amazon and was willing to try another unit.  The new unit has shown none of the issues as the previous one.  No drip when it heats up.  When coffee cycle is done, no further drips from the needle.  No ""flood"" when I remove the pod.  The coffee grounds seems well packed and devoid of excess water.So far, glad I swapped them.  I give Keurig 3 stars for having this issue in the first place, but the 2nd unit seems to function fine (for now).  I give Amazon 5 stars for sending the replacement even before I shipped the return."
The k cup holder assy is much more flimsy than my last unit. The water pump is much louder. No more built in filter assy.
Bought mine November 2023. Stopped working completely September 2024. My first one lasted for a good length of time. This one not even a year.
"I purchased this as a replacement for an old Keurig I'd had for 15 years. This model is basically the same as the old model but seemed to provide easier adjustment for volume to fill travel cups, which was more of a ""settings"" configuration on my old Keurig. As it turns out,  I  now have to run the new Keurig twice to fill both my morning coffee cups AND my 20oz commuter mug because 10oz is the highest setting, which is inconvenient and especially irritating for the first cup in the morning."
"Our first Keurig lasted eight years so when it quit we bought a new one.  I knew when I opened the box the new one was not going to last. It is all plastic and made cheap. Its less than four months old and its not working. I have since found the stats show this machine weighs 0.68 lb. Less than 1 pound Compared to other machines of this type weighing 8 to 9 lbs. You can find different weights for this machine on every one you look at on line.  Now I read the reviews, There are many many one star reviews with the same problem. I should have known it was junk.  Starts to make a cup of coffee then shuts off.  We just bought a box of 80 pods. Great timing. So far customer service has been no help.  They turned down my first attempt at getting them to back their warrantee.  They say they need proof of delivery.  Amazon didn't give any proof of delivery because delivery was delayed.  I sent the photos of the machine they require so it is obvious I received it. I sent everything again. we'll see. ---Six days later.---  Well they still didn't accept my pictures. They sent a UPS shipping label to  return the machine. ---Ten days later.--- They sent a new replacement.  We received the new one on Monday it is now Friday and the new one is doing the same thing as the first replacement.  You start to make a cup of coffee when you select the cup size the machine shuts off. I called again. Again they sent a shipping label to return this machine. I have returned it. They now have all the machines and I have heard nothing. It has become a joke with my wife as to who gives up first, them or me.---two days---Just got an email from Keurig saying replacement machine three is on the way. I think the replacements are the machines someone else sent back for replacement.---11/17/23 just received replacement No. 3. I tried it and it works!! It came in same box I used to return No. 2 so its not new. We'll see how long it last. Hope I can use up those 80 k cups.---11/21/23-- No.3 Just failed. same thing I unplugged it. Will let it cool down and try again. Well they sent no. 4 and it is now 4/5/24 and it just failed. Same trouble.  4/10/2024 Just received no.5.  A different model machine. Looks better. Its been nine days and its still working. So maybe it is."
"I purchased this to replace the exact same model that I had used daily for several years - no issues, no mess - it just wasn't making a good, hot cup of coffee anymore.  It seemed like the logical choice to purchase the same make and model, but the quality just isn't there anymore.  The water reservoir leaks all over the counter because of a design change removing the small, recessed area that it should set down into, and the coffee is not nearly hot enough.  I'm no coffee snob by any means, but unless you drink your coffee really fast, plan on rewarming each cup in the microwave (doesn't matter what kind of mug I use- it cools way too quickly). I'm also getting coffee grounds in each cup, regardless of brand being used. Unit is not as heavy as the previous one (same make and model, mind you), which to me means, it's not made as well.  Returning and beginning the search for a new single cup brewer."
This cheap Keurig coffee maker lasted 3 days past point of Amazon return. I have been using Keurig maker with k-cups for at least 12 years. This one was defective. Fortunately Keurig has 1 year warranty and good customer support. A new maker is on the way. It might be smarter to buy from store so return is easier / not have to wait for replacement.
"If you are selling a 3+ year old model you should disclose that info.Had a coupon in the box to buy up to 5 boxes of coffee pods at 50% off if you register, which I would have used.Unfortunately coupon expires 9/21/2021Really!!!Coffee maker so far is greatI would give it 5 stars and seller 2 stars"
"First time I have ever bought a Keurig where the filter and filter holder were not included. It never occurred to check in the description because the others I bought, over the last 20 years, all included everything. Frustrating and disappointing. Should have known by the price that something was missing.  Caveat emptor."
"We used our last Keurig coffee maker for over six years until it gave out.  I ordered the same exact one and this one definitely feels cheaper.  Like everything else, I have no expectation of getting any kind of longevity out of this one."
"I had one is these 10 years ago and this was a good deal.vi feel like the last time I had one, it turned itself off after awhile. This one does not. Came home from work and it was still on and felt hot.... Uh.... Not good. Debating on returning it"
"Just ordered and received product. So light weight, not at all solid construction. Not sure if I will keep. Enclosed was a coupon for 50% off k-cups if register the product. Coupon expired last month! Will not buy another from Amazon."
"My previous Keurig failed again. I suspect this is the 4th that I have purchased. I love the concept of the Keurig and descale every 90 days to ensure the unit keeps functioning. Unfortunately, over time, they do indeed clog and descaling will no longer make it work. This new unit does not AUTO turn on when you open the reservoir to insert your k-cup. You must turn the unit on, lift the lid, insert k-cup and then press the size cup you desire. Many more steps then it's predecessor. Fortunately, I went back to my previous model, inserted a paper clip and was able to clean out the unit sufficiently to produce a cup of coffee, but not like new."
"The coffee it makes good but the material its made of is chintzy and be aware it makes only 6,8,and 10oz of brew.. The filter  is extra cost of $19.00."
"I originally bought a Keurig classic coffee maker back in 2011. We had it for about eleven years without any issues. Our machine was always clean and worked fine. The only reason we had to get rid of it and buy another this past fall was because Florida palmetto bugs took a liking to the water reservoir too much and the coffee ground that had probably built up inside the machine over the years (in areas that we couldn't clean without taking it apart).We went with this Keurig Classic coffee maker because of our good experiences with the last one. But we could tell this wasn't going to be as reliable or good early on but still had some hopes. The quality in parts is cheaper. It has no heft or durability. After two months, we noticed an issue with the water reservoir - it wasn't brewing as much water per the cup sizes and would sometimes turn off as soon as we turned it on (and we had turned the automatic option too). We still managed to get it to work by drying the drain to the reservoir despite zero help from Keurig support. This week was the last straw to get a refund/return - I woke up before work to find the machine was running on its own and had spewed what was left in the water reservoir all over the counter. The lights were not on or anything. It was just running on its own. I tried cleaning it out, drying it off, turning it off, drying the reservoir drain, etc. As soon as I plugged it back in the outlet, the machine kept spewing whatever water it had left without the reservoir in tact. It's like it keeps wanting the reservoir to be filled with water to just keep running and brewing it out. Keurig instructed us to unplug the machine, dry it off, and and tap the bottom??The lack of quality in the product, the issues it has, the lack of support by Keurig is obvious as to why I gave this a low score and we're looking for a different coffee maker."
"I am a stumbling zombie until I get my first cup of coffee in the morning. Not a good time to put a kink in my early morning routine.I recently purchased my third Keurig K-Classic Coffee Maker.  I've been using this Keurig model for over 10 years and have always been very happy with them.Not this (third) one!When there is still at least 2 cups worth of water in the reservoir, the 'Add Water' light comes on.  I've found that if I lift the reservoir up and out and then replace it, sometimes the machine will work.  Not always.It appears to me that the quality and dependability of this machine has declined. I will think long and hard before I purchase another Keurig coffee maker."
"We have used Keurig products since they came on the market. This machine was such a disappointment. It doesn’t matter if you use pods or filters, you will end up with grounds in your coffee, and sometimes on the counter. It’s being returned today."
"We finally had to replace our dinosaur of a Keurig that has lasted us over 5 years. Keurig has changed the number of ounces for a large. My solution is now to brew a medium and a small size from one pod into my mug to get the same size I got from my old Keurig. Otherwise, my mug is just over half full. We are actually debating a return to a carafe of coffee as both of us need to do this now. The carafe would take the same time to brew as 4 cups in this."
"It’s a decent coffee maker.  I bought mine for guests to keep in the guest part of the house, as I don’t like the smell of coffee.  Imagine my surprise, though, to learn that once the machine is “primed” there will always been a certain amount of water inside the actual body of the brewer that can never be emptied out.  So if I store it for long periods, it’ll always have existing water.  That’s a HUGE design flaw, in my opinion.  You can find something better for a lot less money."
"Cord is much shorter, hard to find a plug…..also ordered on July 16 , came with coupons that expired June 30th"
Doesn’t have a clock for programming and it didn’t come with a water filter? So now I need to buy one
"Multiple issues Keurig is less than one year old. I would suggest not purchasing the Keurig from the Keurig company processed through Amazon as your return window is too small. I’ve had multiple issues of the coffee maker, not working properly, sputtering, shedding off mid cycle. Having to clean needles constantly, sometimes that remedy the problems only for a short Time. This will be the second time. I’m having to contact contact Keurig to see if they will send me another coffee maker as I continue to have problems."
"I  am disappointed. The water is not very hot and I do not even like super hot drinks. I have to use two pods to make my normal 14-16 oz cup of coffee I have each morning. One pod and the 8 oz of water is way too weak for me.The pods are expensive.  I did buy reusable filters so I can use my own coffee and save money. But that is messy since you have to wash out the filters after each use, Also the coffee is weak and has residue. What a hassle. This is way more work to get a decent cup of coffee than my old $15 small coffee machine from the drugstore.Also you can use your large cups if you remove the tray. My kids like using the hot chocolate pod, so once in awhile they will use that.  I am the only one who drinks coffee. I would return this but I waited too long. It is 90 days now. I have tried everything, multiple brands of pods, using my own favorite coffee, different filters. I think the fact the water is not very hot and goes through the coffee in seconds, will not get the flavor I ever want. 100 bucks down the drain. This is not even that convenient. You have to refill the water after just a few cups or it will not brew for you. Update- I went to Reddit to see if anyone could recommend a good coffee that had a stronger flavor and they recommended found Peets Major Dickerson blend , or death wish coffee, which I have not tried yet. Also I discovered you can brew  these coffee pods twice. That made a difference. I brew the Peets Major Dickerson blend twice on the 6 oz and get one good strong cup out of it.  Then I brewed the medium french roast blend I bought twice on the lowest water oz, 4 oz and got a decent cup out of that Try it.Water still cools off quite fast and other people said that is just how these are. Suggestions were made to heat your cream and cup up first. I bought this for convenience, not more work. But at least now I can get a decent cup of coffee out of it."
"Ok  what's the fuss I just don't get it the coffee pods are crazy expensive and you need at least 2 pods to get a good size cup of coffee if you use a large cup otherwise its coffee flavored water.1st you have to buy the best coffee for the best  results at about $1.00 a pod,2 you have to make it small if you want a good cup you'll need another pod to make a good cup of coffee To get a 16oz  cup and it is good and should be for a $2.00 in Home cup of coffee than I read that you can buy a resuseable pod and make your own cup isn't that the same as a regular coffee maker.I did the math comes out to about $30 a pound to use this machine with a regular coffee maker you can buy Starbucks for about $10 a pound and make a delicious cup of coffee . In conclusion the machine works great and fast only buy good coffee enjoy instant hot water and be ready to spend $20.00 a week to have a Keurig experience.Oh I forgot some of the pods can be duds.Update,I got use to the Keurig and found some good deals on the pods a 8oz cup one pod is about .50 a cup not all that bad  may have overreacted at first but once I shopped around and found some inexpensive pods i really starting to enjoy the machine the convenience factor is amazing and this particular model is made very well .So you may ask why only three stars well  it's because after a month of use the reservoir started to  leak once you start useing the Keurig the 40 oz  reservoir seems small so I returned it and got one with a bigger  80oz  reservoir may be if you don't have to refill it as often  you to reduce the wear and tear on the water plastic reservoir didn't crack the one I would place it in the machine when the machine warmed up  The reservoir leaked  anyway I sent it back and got a bigger one this particular model is a quality product for minimal use"
Felt it was very cheesy.  Not as nice as the one I had. No filter was includeD
"I bought this item for work.  About a month into using it, I would turn the Keurig on in the morning and hit the brewing cup size.  As soon as I hit the cup size, the Keurig would turn off.  It only happened here and there but still frustrated me.  I would unplug the Keurig to see if that helped.  About 2 months in, I went into work, turned the Keurig on and it just turned off.  After that, it would not stay on and would not even heat up.  I have a Keurig at home and that has never happened to me.  I couldn't return it cause it was past the 30 days.  I called the manufacture company's customer service and they were very easy and nice to deal with.  They are sending me a new one! The power issue was the only problem I've had with this item.  Hopefully the new one doesn't have this problem!"
"Mine lasted 3 months. While it worked, it performed well. However, certain cups would give problems until I learned you have to puncture it twice to prevent the machine from shutting off automatically due to a buildup of pressure. Then eventually, it just started shutting off less than a second after turning it on. Did a bunch of troubleshooting but nothing worked. Eventually just threw it away out of frustration."
This is my third Keurig and it is much noisier than the other two. Both the initial heat cycle and the brewing are noticeable loader than the previous units.I probably will not get another Keurig when this unit gives out. The convenience is nice and the brew is acceptable but not great. The reason I ended up with a third one was the fact that I'd just bought a three month supply of K-cups when the last unit died. 😕
Need handle for water container
"This is very a very basic Keurig. I miss the “strong” option I had on my other one more than I thought I would. My “3” score is because sometimes when I hit the button to make the coffee, the machine turns off! If that continues, I will return it."
"I replaced one from years ago because it finally gave out and got this one same day. That’s the only positive, this unit for the cost not worth it. Building quality, less features and much slower. Had I known, I would have spent $30 more at Macys where I could have opened"
I was very disappointed it didn’t have the new 5 hole punch going into the K cups.  The result is you’re not getting the full flavor of the coffee in the cup like the new machines that is always featured in their ads.
I'm having to put the setting on large cup the mmn small just to fill my coffee cup. The same cup i used for the cheap one I had.  I was hoping to get a quick cup of coffee before going to work.
I purchased this Keurig in November 2023 and it stopped working in April 2024. I only brew two cups a day on average so there is absolutely no reason it should have stopped working. I contacted the manufacturer and have had no response from them. Very disappointing customer support!Updated to add: I finally received a response after writing this review. They replaced my keurig after showing proof of purchase and returning the old machine.
Would be helpful if it is indicated that it does not come with the water filter kit so I can purchase it at the same time. Now I have to wait for it to arrive before I can use it
Purchased 9/1/24.  Worked fine until 11/1 . When I put the coffee pod in and press the button the unit cuts off.  It doesn’t want to cycle.  I tried unplugging Hopi but would reset.  No luck.  I plan to call Krueg Monday
"Feels cheap, everything plastic.  Cannot program water temperature or turn on time.  Shuts off when adding water.  Definitely should have  upgraded!  It is a pretty color."
8oz and 10oz measurements are inaccurate. Takes a long time to 0make 1 cup. Coffee once made is hot but I still have to microwave it for 20 seconds.
"Keurig stops brewing in the middle of making a cup of coffee. I'm not as happy with this one, as it replaced my old Keurig I had for 10 years."
"This is our second Keurig Classic coffee maker. We had the first one for several years before it developed issues. It would pop a couple times, the low water light would flash, the power light would flash, and the medium blue light would come on. We only used the large size. It did nothing after that. We had it long enough to replace, so we ordered a new one. It makes good coffee, but it makes much more noise in the heating cycle, much noisier than the previous Keurig. With an electric automobile and electric yard equipment, this is now the noisiest machine we own."
I ordered this for my wife since her other Keurig went kaput. Why wouldn’t there be a water filter wand in the machine? It was just delivered.
"My previous kuerig broke after 10 years (seems like a good life)! So, I decided to purchase another one. I am very happy with my purchase. Works great! It’s pretty basic, but always makes good coffee! My one complaint is that the cord is really short, had to order an extension cord to reach the plug in my kitchen, also, feels a little cheaper than the passed model I owned, but works well for the price point! I have an elite Kuerig in my office and it is a nicer quality, but the coffee tastes the same :)Would buy again!"
"While it’s very plastic and cheaply made, it would still, and does, make good coffee. At least as good as such a machine could really be expected to make. The serious rub here is the needle that punctures the pod is inadequate to ensure 100% success.  Failure to puncture properly results in a horrible mess of expelled coffee grounds. Yuck!!  More times than a decent product should ever experience. Our prior, still operable machine, NEVER had such events. We have used such Keurig machines for nearly two decades and now find dissatisfaction."
"This is my third keurig coffee maker. The first one I got was a single cup one. Worked ok but not big enough. The second I had until last year. Served me well until it simply stopped heating yesterday for no apparent reason. So I bought this one. It does not come with a filter, it is comparatively slow to heat, and does not make large cups of coffee. I think it says 10 oz max, but is less than that. My old one went up to 12 oz. The reservoir is also smaller. Granted Keurig offers many versions of this but I am unhappy with this model. If you want a really quick large cup of coffee, Find a different one or a different brand."
"The product did not come with the filter package, who would think you have to order separately? Not happy"
"First time I have had an issue with a Keurig but after less than 2 weeks, the K-cup maker turns off when I attempt to make a cup of coffee. I have notified them and I will see how they respond. Purchased through Amazon.Follow up. The Keruig company has continually played games with my attempt to get a working replacement. They have denied the return due to ""issues"" on how I have submitted my return request. Made 4th attempt to meet their ""criteria"" for the replacement on Dec 4. Will see what happens, but I doubt I will ever buy a product from them in the future.Follow up, Keurig finally decided to replace the item after numerous attempts."
This kerug is much slower than my last one. It takes 4 minutes to heat up.
"Keurigs rarely last a long time. You've got to know this going in. In the past few years I probably buy one at the rate of one a year. Eventually, the coffee will not be as hot and a Keurig will sputter grinds everywhere like a petulant child. So I had to replace my last one. During a pandemic, I was not going downstairs to Staples so I bought off Amazon after reading the reviews.BIG Mistake. Huge, as Julia Roberts would say in Pretty Woman.This was highly rated, but I discovered a few things that are annoying. It is very hard to figure out how to make one cup of coffee and I've been using Keurigs for years. Ridiculously complicated system but you learn it eventually.I sadly learned that one pod equals the smallest button of 6 ounce coffee on the Keurig equals half a cup of coffee which means you'll be buying double pods and that will be very expensive. If you try to stretch it to a full cup it tastes like crap. Traveling with this huge piece of machinery, even from one room to another, is hard. It is heavy and if you carry it with the water filter and tray in place the whole thing will fall to the ground. Carry it in pieces instead.Benefits - It gets hotter than any Keurig I've used in the past. I also like that you can separate and clean the water filter. Ultimately it will do in a pinch but I miss my older Keurigs. I'll be returning to those next purchase. The price was right here though, and I got a bunch of coffee - terrible tasting though it is - as part of the deal."
It’s extremely lighter than the older model. It’s all plastic. Rather chintzy
"I just bought this Keurig in July and the descale light came already to be cleaned. I have tried, to descale it and it's not working. This is the second one I have had to deal with regarding descaling and it not working properly afterwards. I am not buying another one, this is crazy. I will buy something other than Keurig moving forward."
"This is my 4th Keurig coffee maker and I am displeased with how cheaply made it is. Previous makers had a metal grate over the drip pan, this one has a thin plastic grate. The previous reservoirs were larger, more durable and had a hinged opening for easier access.  Truthfully, the only positive is that it brews a cup of coffee."
"The coffee machine itself seems fine (I haven't used it yet but I pumped some water through to clean out any dust for when I use it in the morning, and it seems fine. Quiet and water flow is strong.) but I was preparing my filter when I suddenly realized that they never sent me the part that snaps into the resevoir that you put the filter into (no clue what it's called). I can use the machine without it, I just can't filter the water, so the coffee won't taste as good... but if I'm spending this kind of money on a coffee maker, I'd hope they'd send all the parts that go with it.I messaged the seller. If they send me the part for free I'll give it a better review because it seems like a good coffee maker, but if they tell me I have to buy that part separate I'm definitely updating it to one star."
I purchased this in July. Now the coffee maker will not draw water up into the system- when it tries to it shuts down completely. Would not recommend. I spent $130 on this purchase.
"It works, but makes a lot of noise"
"Staff are complaining of problems with this unit.  It leaks, does not make full cups once size if selected and it continues to drip long after done brewing when you open it to remove the k-cup.  I purchased this on 7/1 and it is now 9/10; my return window closed 8/7!  Uggghhhhhh so frustrating."
"Why did pay 130.00  for a KEURIG,  and have to purchase my  own filter.  Your cost would be maybe  2.00. KEURIG can afford include a necessary part to have the best cup of coffee.  I have had many KEURIG. I continue to support this brand!  SHAMEFUL!"
"This model has a known defect, on top of all of the other Keurig defects that we commonly see. Lots of people know about the float sensor problem, where the unit will do nothing but show the add water light despite there being water in the unit (fixable: the float is just stuck, get it unstuck). This model has another weird problem. The motor on this unit is quite a bit less powerful than the old one (trade-off: it's quieter), and if a sufficiently large air bubble gets trapped in the tubing, it just... stops working. The add water light comes on. You'll sometimes get a belch of liquid feeding back into the reservoir.(I stole this fix. I figured out the problem, but the use of the reservoir was someone else's and quite inspired).The fix: force some water into the unit while it's attempting to pull some water in. The easiest way of doing this is to use the reservoir itself: pull it up an inch, start the unit as if you were making a cup, then ram the reservoir back down into place hard. Might take a few tries. It pushes water into into the system, where it'll sputter back to life by magic.Keurig knows about this problem. They must. It's a design flaw and takes 20 minutes to figure out. But their support will blame anything else: your current, your water, misuse of the unit... whatever. A more cynical person would say that they're trying to push more and that's why it's not been fixed.Anyway. 3 stars. I use the unit a lot when it works. I use it for lots of other things that need hot water. But I've had several problems with it, so I think that people should go with another model."
"I bought the Keurig from Amazon Jan 18, 2018.  It quit working in September when it started the infamous short-cupping Keurig makers are known for.  I just realized after logging in to leave this review I could have returned the unit because it was under warranty when it broke.  But now it is February 17, 2019 and the warranty is one year.When this unit was about a month old, the water pump began making a very loud rattly sound.  It was loud to the point of irritating.  We just put up with the noise until it quit working due to short-cupping.I opened the unit to repair today and instantly knew it had been repaired before, by someone other than Keurig.  The dead-giveaway is most of the silicon hoses are bound to their inlets/outlets with common plastic zip ties.  These ties are ok to use if not applied too tightly, but someone pulled them very tightly increasing chances for a leak because the hoses will eventually break if bound too tightly.  KEURIG DOES NOT USE THESE TIES.  They use a hardened silicon band to eliminate the chance of leakage.  There were also red lines and scribbles made with an ink pen on almost all of the hoses and valves making me think the one who refurbished this unit was double-checking his assembly effort.The reason this unit failed to fill the cup is because of a defective solenoid water valve.  I replaced the valve with a spare I had from another unit I use for ""parts"".  The reason it failed is because the neoprene seal in it had a hole in it. The seal lost its elasticity and instead of being dark black and pliable, it was light gray and brittle - an indication of age and wear from a considerable amount of contact with hot water.Tip:  There are several reasons for Keurigs to short-cup.  The best known reason is coffee grinds get in the needles in the top and bottom of the cup housing.  The simple fix is to unclog the needles with paper clip.  We discovered the only time our needles clog is when I am the last to use the unit.  I noticed my wife closes the housing slowly & gently.  I typically slammed it shut like a pickup truck hood.  Now I close it like my wife and it hasn't clogged since!  Another reason for grinds in the top needle is a faulty check valve (stuck open or slight internal leak) in the line that feeds water to the top needle.Other reasons for short cups - there are 2 solenoid water valves that fail, as well as a small air pump.  The water pump can fail to fill the tank and the water entry at the bottom of the reservoir can get moldy/scaly (can easily clean).  There are 2 check valves that can fail (stuck open or closed, or internal leak).  The least common reason is a pressure switch on the electronic control board where you select cup size.I love a working Keurig - thankfully I know how to repair them; otherwise, I would not pay to replace them as often as they break."
"Comparing this coffee maker to previous ones we've had, as well as other Keurig's owned by friends, this particular one is quite a bit slower. Not a problem for us, but would've looked at a different model had I known."
"Need to return this coffee maker , won’t work"
"I've cleaned this several times, bought different cups, it doesn't matter, I cannot get a full cup of coffee and the add water indicator comes on before it needs water. Not happy!"
We bought this to replace our original 15 year old keurig that has recently been pumping slower and slower. This brand new machine sounds like it's about to die. The pump is so slow and seems to struggle. It has also shut off a few times when choosing the cup size. The only attribute I care about on the new machine is that it heats the water quicker and hotter than the old one. We're still keeping the old one for a backup.
"Doesn't brew with a proper amount of water, coffee undrinkably strong. Rapidly approaching the end of my rope with unreliable Keurig products."
"I have discovered two cool features of the Classic not everyone knows about...1) Auto shut off - It powers off right when you hit the brew button. Really gets the blood boiling!2) Counter Clean - It sprays water all over the counter when brewing. That counter needed cleaning anyway!Maybe that's enough to help you decide.Seriously, I've had this thing a week and it already is randomly performing the above. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. The powering off issue can be circumvented by holding down the brew button for a few seconds. Seems silly, but it works. The water shooting out is a mystery. I assume a couple of coffee grains from the K cup got stuck and then passed through? Who knows?I am concerned this thing won't last very long but if it sprays water again combined with the powering off issue, I'll send it back. You can just tell it is nothing compared to the older models. This weighs half what the older model did. I had that one for several years and it developed a leak at the reservoir, so I threw it out and bought this. Huge mistake ! Huge!So save yourself and hold onto your older Classic models like your life depended on it!"
Weak coffee.  I have a $70 model that makes better coffee.Next.time I'll buy two of them instead
Constantly trips my breaker. Electrician said the Keurig creates an arc that causes the circuit breaker to trip
"Very disappointed. I have 2 other Keurigs, but I wanted a red one for my kitchen. I got it the first week of September and it worked perfectly until mid-November when it stopped perforating the top of the pods properly and won't brew a cup of coffee. Amazon won't allow a return after 30 days and Keurig recommended I use Keurig pods instead of my preferred ones even though my other 2 Keurigs perforate and brew my preferred coffee pods perfectly and this one did for over 2 months before it quit working. Very unhappy with the product and the customer service."
Nice machine that makes good coffee but the one exception is the difficulty of inserting the water reservoir.
Doesn’t always work or fill the cup even 1/2 full.  It is getting better
"These K cup coffee makers are a bust financially for most people.  While they do produce a high quality cup of coffee,I get a better cup by grinding whole beans of my choice into a standard two cup (advertised as 5 cup) cone drip coffee maker.I bought this K55 for my X in San Diego, because other businesses in her office building were not making coffee, but using it, orstealing her creamer in the building break area fridge (also got her a mini fridge). After working in many offices for over 40+ years,I know this is normal, as lazy people will justify just about anything as long as they do not have to take responsibility.She is very busy, grabs a cup in the morning at home, and then another at the office; this is her routine, and it works for her.If you are like her, then this machine, and the cost may work for you.If you are like me, and have the personal time (1 minute) to grind your own, then this is the best way to go, as you get better tasting, higher quality coffee at a fraction of the cost of using a K cup machine.  I payed 1/4 the price for my drip coffee maker, and get 5 pounds of great whole coffee beans for 30 to 40 bucks; Do you realize how long 5 pounds of coffee lasts?All this aside, this machine works well (her home machine is a K55, and is three years old), and I hardly ever turn down a cup of coffee, no matter how it is made with the exception of the frothy, creamy, chocolate. air injected garbage that ""you know who"" produces at a totally ridiculous price."
"There are quality control issues with this unit.  I also believe there are design flaws.  I am very familiar with this unit as many friends have it, and I have used it without incident.  However, from the very start, my unit was hit or miss: sometimes it would brew and sometimes it would just shut off with no output.  When it did brew, the output was very low: 10%-25% of what the output should be.I carefully cleaned all of the nozzles with a paperclip to make sure there no blockage on both the three nozzles above the coffee pod and the one nozzle/pin below it.  (If there is anything impeding flow from any of these tiny points of failure the machine stops.)  I made sure I was using official Keurig pods.  Never worked right.When I could think of no other options I contacted the Keurig. To their credit, I got a live knowledgeable person with almost no wait.  They walked me through some diagnostics.The output was fine if there was no pod.  If there WAS a pod, output was low.  Support person said I have a fault pod basket, that had a malformed output needle that impeded flow.  She is sending me a new one, hopefully one that works.The Keurig design has very sensitive points of failure.  If there is any abnormality of flow among these four very tiny channels, the machine will malfunction.  To keep it operating, you need to constantly be checking the nozzles, descaling periodically, using filtered or bottled water. etc.  That was manageable however.The problem is that their manufacturing quality is insufficient for the design of the machine. Now made in China, the manufacturing quality control does not meet the tolerances required by the design.  Once revered machines the Keurig brewer is now cheap junk.Sadly, Keurig is not what it once was.  Founded in 1992, Keurig was known for quality machines.  However, they were purchases by Green Mountain Coffee in 2006, and then in 2016, Keurig Green Mountain was acquired by a private equity firm.  These changes may have had an effect on the quality of the hardware.I would not recommend this machine, and will probably throw mine out.  I don't expect the new part that they are sending me to be a long-term solution."
"While it worked it was awesome, great coffee and very quick and easy.Now all of a sudden it is having issues. I haven't had a cup of coffee at home for 4 days!"
"I received this product without a filter stem or filter and inquired with the company as to these items missing and was informed that they no longer come with those items, strange that they build them to have a filter system from the start but now they are extra items that are no longer needed but nothing has changed on the specs of this item."
"This machine is slow and noisy. It comes from the manufacturer WITHOUT THE INTERNAL FILTER HOLDER OR FILTERS WHICH MUST BE PURCHASED SEPERATELY. Keurig Tall Handle Water Filter Starter Kit, Comes with Handle and 2 Replacement Water Filters, Compatible with Select Keurig Coffee Makers4.7 out of 5 stars 2,8771K+ bought in past month$12.99 List: $19.08"
It was missing the filter and the holder for the filter it was a 50 series and luckily that’s what I already had so I took the mechanism out of the old one and put it in the new one. It did not come with one or a filter but I had both not happy about it.
We had a Keurig for years and we finally had to replace it.  We have had some issues with this one.  It wants to shut off for no reason.
"Let me start by saying this product works well and is exactly as described. If you are looking for a solid, nice looking Keurig that accepts reuseable k-cups - this machine is for you.Here is the thing: I like a good cup of coffee. I mean a really good cup of coffee. One might even call me a coffee snob. And there is probably an episode of Portlandia inspired by coffee snobs like me. I like to think I could give Agent Cooper a run for his money.Does any of this sound like you? If so... DO NOT BUY A KEURIG!!!The main reason we bought this thing was because of the amount of coffee we'd end up pouring down the sink with our normal pot (the hubby and I are down to one cup a day). We thought buying a single-serve Keurig with reusable k-cups was the perfect solution. And maybe it is if you plan to use the pre-filled store-bought cups (not an option for us); however, the reusable k-cups by default make a super watered down cup of coffee. Bleck!After A TON of trial and error I've figured out a hack* to make a pretty good cup of coffee using local beans and the reusable k-cups. However, it was proceeded by a ridiculous amount of terrible cups of coffee first.Hindsight 20/20, I should have just stuck with the french press or bought a pour over.In sum: 3 stars for my experience, 4 or 5 stars for the actual product.* If you are interested in the hack I found, let me know and I can post a link here for you."
"Bought this because our last Keurig coffee maker stopped working after five years. Anyway, ordered this unit and it arrived within 24 hours, which was great.I read all the instructions and followed every step; however, when selecting the largest setting, only get half a cup."
"After doing a LOT of research, I decided to order this coffee maker.  Taking into account the negative reviews, my personal experience is a mix but mostly on the positive side.Some of the reviews mention the plastic smell/taste.  It WAS there but only for the first few pots.  After the first few, it's totally gone.  And regarding the quickness of how fast it makes coffee.  It works well enough for me.  It's done before I know it.  It's got a lot of really nice features and it brews coffee hotter than any other coffee maker I have ever had.  AND It's about the only one with this capacity in this price range.I run filtered water and in combination with the in-machine charcoal filters, it makes a darn good cup.  And by the way, I picked up a pack of these filters http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013H3UMEU and they work great.  Plus, they are WAY less than the Cuisinart brand ones.The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars is for one reason.  When you go to fill the water reservoir, the lid doesn't open far enough to use the coffee pot.  You have to get real creative when you reach the end of the pour.  Is that a deal killer?  Not really, it's just a minor annoyance and the primary reason I didn't feel this coffee maker was 5 star worthy.Bottom Line:  This is the best coffee maker I have ever owned.  Although it's not perfect, (and can it be for this price) I am very happy with this coffee maker and I'm sure you will be too.UPDATE:  3 1/2 months later it has stopped working correctly.  The water reservoir no longer empties completely.  Towards the end of the cycle, the unit will start this series of clicking and chunking sounds, like it can't siphon the water.  The maker will make its series of beeps like it's done but there will be ""4 cups"" worth of water left in the reservoir.  I only use soft water that has been filtered.  It's the only water that has ever gone through the maker.  I make about 6 pots per week on average.  I am also diligent about changing the little charcoal filters.Another thing to note.  It seem to be boiling off a LOT of the water and as a result there is a large amount steam coming off the machine.  This has ruined the underside of my cabinet.  Do NOT get this unit and put it under a cabinet. I now pull it out from under the cabinet when I am making a pot.UPDATE #2:  As it turns out, it appears that the maker just needed a good cleaning.  I ran a solution of CLR and ALL kinds of lime chucks came out.  After that, it ended up working properly again.  Note to self:  When the machine says it needs to be cleaned, clean it.  It knows more than you do.  It's part of Skynet.UPDATE #3:  4 Months after purchase.  The black coating on the warmer plate is flaking off.  This is pretty disappointing."
"I have this coffee maker and I used it multiple times a week for about eight years.My review is below, but first - what just happened!When using it today, I happened to hear the glass carafe making a few ""tink"" sounds as if the glass was stressed or about to break, so I walked into the kitchen and noticed a lot of steam coming from above the coffee maker as well as from within the carafe, accompanied by a strong burning smell. I realized the coffee maker was getting much hotter than it should be, and I saw the the screen indicated ERROR, so I quickly unplugged it.I'm so glad I was near the kitchen when this happened, since at the very least the carafe would have shattered, and even worse - it could have caught fire! Judging by the smell which stayed in the kitchen for a while - what I thought was steam may have been smoke.So - that's why I'm now hunting for a new (and different) coffee maker.If you are still considering buying this model, some points of review:-It makes good coffee, and brews it nice and hot. I like the ""Bold"" button to get a slightly stronger brew.-All the settings and programming features work well. I've programmed it many times, and it always works. There might be a little clock drift over time - I think it loses a minute every month or two.-The design was by someone who doesn't have cabinets/cupboards. If they do, they don't have anything else on the counter. In order to put the coffee in or add water, you have to completely pull the coffee maker out and away from overhanging cupboards so you can open the top completely and lean it back so it stays open. The lid is 8 inches deep (tall), so it needs a lot of clearance. Every coffee maker I've had before this had a smaller lid for the coffee basket, and slots where water can be poured into the top instead of a lid.-There is a thin layer of black paint on the burner/heating pad. If the coffee maker runs with any water or condensation on the underside of the carafe, it can cause the paint to flake off. This happened (thanks to someone else in my household) shortly after I purchased this coffee maker, so the the heating pad always looked kind of cheap with the pealed paint."
"I have had many coffee makers from Mr. Coffee in college days to some really upscale brewing machines!! my old Cuisinart was 13 years old and served me well. the thermal fuse went, and it simply wouldn't heat up and brew any longer. Decided it was better not to change brands, so I decided to buy the newer version, (but without the bean grinder built in since I rarely used that feature), and with the larger capacity carafe. Looks the same, programs the same, (which is not exactly intuitive), and has the same sort of cap for the carafe... but in the details was the devil! The lids to the carafe sort of click in place... my old one did perfectly. this one is a little tighter and seems not to really ""SEAT"" in there... pouring the water into the machine was about the same (which you have to develop the skill to avoid spilling into the coffee compartment), but the lid and where it seals at the mouth of the carafe to pour the water allows the water to leak out the sides when pouring at a steep angle, or when pouring the water in with a full 10-14 cups... water all over the counter... comes out of the carafe not like a stream, but more like a waterfall and at the edges it sprays the departing water in a wide band of water, making aiming the water into the oddly located reservoir entrance about impossible without spilling water... and it is both at the beginning of the pour when over 10 cups and always at the last cup due to the angle you have to hold the carafe to get the last bit of water out.... (The carafe's have a unique shape at the upper edge compared to many other manufacturers... but the 14 cup one seems to experience a bit more of this issue than my old 12 cup machine... As the carafe rises from the bottom to its top it tapers especially at the upper edge... I think this is the design flaw and combined with the plastic top not having a perfect seal, it is simply prone by design to these issues.If the lid tilted back farther than just 90 degrees vertical you would have a better chance... if the plastic lid to the carafe had a better seal around its edges, if the glass pouring lip or the indentation where the water leaves the carafe were modified a bit, I think they could work this out...BUT..... it does still, after a bit of wiping up, make a good tasting coffee... and it keeps the coffee at a perfect temperature for me. I just wish I could have a cup of coffee BEFORE having to contend with this process to make one!!"
"This BKSP1 (black stainless appearance) 14-cup coffeemaker replaced a 12+ year old Cuisinart 12-cup unit we used until it finally quit working.  Great coffeemaker and it produced great coffee.  My research to replace the old unit settled on the BKSP1 model and Amazon delivered straight-a-way.I got it all cleansed out, programmed and set up for begin brewing at 4:45 the next morning.  It brewed a great pot of coffee and all worked wonderfully ... EXCEPT that the clock on the BKSP1 was running FAST. It had ""gained"" almost an hour since I had set it up the day before.  Thus the coffee was actually brewed at ~3:45AM.I reset the clock and kept watching it as I would walk by the coffeemaker and noted that it was gaining time or running FAST. I went through this for several days and finally sent a message to Amazon C.S. and they immediately replaced with another BKSP1 and I returned the original unit.I went through the setup process with the #2 BKSP1 and was hopeful that the clock would keep proper time ... however it did not.  The clock on the #2 BKSP1 also ran FAST.  The coffeemaker worked just fine in all regards ... save for the clock running FAST.So, I reached out to Cuisinart/Conair C.S. with this ""fast clock"" issue and they replaced the #2 BKSP1 with the #3 BKSP1.  I did all the setup with #3 and lo & behold ... the clock on the #3 BKSP1 also runs FAST.  All other elements work just fine, brews great coffee, but the clock just has a mind of it's own.So (you can guess what is next), I reached out to Cuisinart/Conair C.S. (again) with the fast clock issue noted in graf above.  A ticket was established and I was shipped a #4 BKSP1 to replace the #3 unit.Can you see where this is going?  The #4 BKSP1 unit was set up and put into service and the clock on #4 also runs FAST.So ... it appears that there is something common going on with the BKSP1 model units.This time I called Cuisinart/Conair C.S. (I had been establishing all other tickets via the inter-web and e-mail).  The lady with C.S. was simply excellent and she noted my BKSP1 ticket history and said she would have another unit shipped out straight-a-way. She asked if I still wanted the same BKSP1 model or would I want to get the SP1 model (SP1 is the brushed stainless appearance).  I figured what the heck ... I would get the SP1 this time.In a couple days I received the #5 SP1, got it all set up and ready to brew coffee the next morning at 4:45.  I would glance at the clock on the #5 SP1 as I walked by the unit and the clock was ACCURATE.  I was again hopeful that the clock would hold and keep proper time.At 4:45AM the brew cycle started and it actually was at 4:45AM.  The clock held it's accuracy for one day at that point.It has now been 3-days and the clock on the #5 SP1 is ""spot on"".So (there is the 'so' word again) I noted on the boxes the coffeemakers were shipped in had the countries of manufacture stamped on them.  The BKSP1 units were all manufactured in China. The SP1 unit was manufactured in Indonesia.  AHA - I said. There is a manufacturing plant issue going on.I did an extensive observation letter to Cuisinart/Conair about my situation and thoughts of what is going on.BTW - In addition the BKSP1 units all dripped extensive moisture droplets down the back side of the unit when the top lid was opened to removed the coffee grounds. This had me wondering if there was a leak as there was water all over the counter under the BKSP1 units.Turns out the drip lip on the upper back of the BKSP1 appears to be 'flat' without adequate slope to have the water droplets flow back into the reservoir.  Also the drip lip is not as deep as what I noticed on the SP1 units.I also observed (on both the BKSP1 and SP1 models) that there is a lot of moisture condensation that collects on the upper front panel where the control buttons are located. To me this could affect the electronics that I'm guessing is located near or behind this panel.Ergo couple items of note for Cuisinart/Conair:1) Production molds for the BKSP1 and SP1 are NOT the same between the China and Indonesia manufacturing plants.  Thus the drip lip issue noted above.2)  The chips/electronics being used in the China plant for the BKSP1 are defective and can't keep proper time.All-in-all ... The Cuisinart 14-cup coffeemaker is an excellent product and works very well and produces great coffee.  Save for the units (in my case) that are manufactured in China where the chips/electronics they are using just don't work.  Adding to that the manufacturing mold difference that slightly changes the size of the drip lip on the upper back.I would suggest getting the the SP1 model and keep your fingers crossed that it is also manufactured in Indonesia as opposed to China.  At least until such time as changes are made in the manufacturing facility in China to correct the noted issues.Cheers,Nolan K."
"This copper-colored coffee maker, my second Cuisinart, isn't a bad coffee maker.  It matches my kitchen decor perfectly, isn't hard to set up initially, and brews fairly quickly.  While I like the idea of the little filters, I'm still unsure how effectively they improve the taste even after years of using them.  Unfortunately, it doesn't brew near as hot as my previous maker, which is a *huge* disappointment.  Sidebar 1:  Because I don't set a time for coffee making, I didn't try out any of the associated options.  Sidebar 2: Haven't tried the descaling/cleaning feature yet, will follow up.  I'll add that I'm doubtful because the old vinegar-and-water tried and true method works just as well, if not better, and is far less complicated.  That was especially true with my previous Cuisinart."
"I’ve only made two 1/2 pots of coffee so far so I can’t speak to many of the other complaints about this maker of over flowing coffee grounds for large brew pots or leaking water, but based on some other flaws I think it has, I will assume it would be likely.  While the coffee it makes is good and the many smaller features are nice (variable auto shut off time, carafe temperature setting, clean indicator/button, bold/regular setting, user set ready tone, and 1-4 cup setting) it has one or two other major design flaws that are a BIG negative to me.  It should probably deserve a 2 or 3 star rating just for being able to make a good cup of coffee, but if people are like me when researching a product, I only read a few of the 5 star and 1 star reviews if there are thousands to choose from, so I’m giving it a 1 star in hopes more people will be aware of what I feel are it’s poor design.The biggest negative in my opinion is the carafe design.  The plastic rim around the top, and it’s size, make it impossible to completely pour all the water out of it and into the the top of the machine for filling.  The only way to completely empty the water to be used for making the coffee into the top, is to totally turn the carafe upside down, otherwise the plastic lip on the top of the carafe will retain un-brewed water.  The location and size of the fill area on the top in the back corner is difficult to fill because of the size of the carafe and the lid of the coffee maker not folding far enough back out of the way to tilt the carafe more – count on spilling water over the back or side.  So unless you want to use a different container with a long spout to add water to the coffee maker, you will be frustrated by this design flaw EVERY time you fill the machine to make coffee.  The coffee maker this is replacing a Gevalia coffee maker that I had gotten for free several years ago for trying their coffee, and it had a second hinged lid on the top that would open and lay flat so you could pour the water in unobstructed.  It also had a carafe with a lip that was all glass with no obstruction to retain water.Second negative is the length of the power cord.  My old Gevalia coffee maker has a 39” cord.  This maker only has a 24” cord with a thinner wire gauge.  So you need to consider where you will be placing this coffee maker  in relation to your wall plugs.  I don’t like to position my maker under an overhead cupboard because the steam that comes out during the brewing process will ruin the underside of the cupboard.  Plus it would be impossible to fill the maker while under the cupboard.  So Cuisinart has saved literally a few pennies by giving you a very short power cord at your expense.  Cuisinart explains the reason for the short cord in their manual as “A short power-supply cord is provided to reduce the risks resulting from becoming entangled in or tripping over a longer cord.”  Unless you are walking on your counters or rolling around on them, I don’t see this as a valid reason for a shorter cord.  You be the judge on whether Cuisinart is looking out for your best interest and providing a good customer experience or only concerned about their bottom line.  There is short, and then there is too short.  They should have just simply told the truth – we saved a few pennies by giving you a short cord.Another thing that I find annoying is the blue backlit display.  While this doesn’t affect the coffee quality, it is annoying.  My old maker had a digital display, but it wasn’t lit up.  This maker has the ability to turn the “ready tone” on or off and set the auto-shutoff time, it should also have the ability to turn off the backlit display if desired or an auto shutoff of the backlight after a certain amount of time.  Don’t know if this uses any more electricity than a plain digital display, but I would suspect it does.  While this feature may just take some getting used to, I would prefer to not have that blue backlit display always glowing in my kitchen.  I have enough other appliances in my kitchen that display time, I don’t need my coffee maker to glow another clock in my face.When I started writing this review I was undecided whether I would keep this coffee maker or return it.  As I finished writing this, I grew more annoyed  and decided I didn’t want to hate this coffee maker every time I went to fill it and spilled water all over the counter – there are better ones out there.  Also, keep in mind that the 14 cup carafe is BIG and if you don’t usually make a full pot of coffee go with a 10 or 12 cup model, it will be easier to handle.  I’ve included some photos of my old coffee maker design features versus this Cuisinart’s features and you can see I would have been taking a few steps backwards using the Cuisinart.  I am now looking at the Braun models as they have the same features as the Cuisinart, but with a more user friendly carafe.Update 10/11/19:I returned the Cuisinart DCC-3200 and bought a Braun KF-7150 12 cup coffee maker, which was even a little bit cheaper.  It has all the same features/settings as the Cuisinart except it didn’t include a coffee measuring scoop (which I didn’t need anyway) and it doesn’t “beep” when the coffee is done brewing .  There is a small flashing light on the Braun that stops flashing when it has finished brewing.  The extra charcoal filters that I had bought to use with the Cuisinart also fit the Braun.  The Braun has a longer power cord (33”), a full glass lip on the carafe which allows you to pour the entire contents into the top of the machine when filling it with water and a lid that will flip up with your thumb to make filling the carafe with water very easy.  The clock on the Braun is an unobtrusive display with a black background and white numbers.  The Braun also makes a decent cup of coffee.  A few simple little design features on the Braun that make it much more user friendly and it has a 3 yr. warranty – same as the Cuisinart."
"For the price, I expected Cuisinart to deliver a great cup of coffee on the first use. It’s a coffee maker not a satellite…how hard can it be?  To be equitable, the unit is sturdy, attractive and easy to operate. It seems to take longer to brew but I can get a cup as it brews. It has taken much longer than expected to hit the coffee to water ratio. When I used their guide, the coffee was too strong. If I don’t pour coffee straight over the cup, the carafe drips on the counter. Every time. I would have returned the unit but I keep thinking that I will master its idiosyncrasies. I refuse to be defeated by a small appliance that does produce a tasty cup once I learned to use less ground coffee."
"WHAT I REALLY DON'T LIKE ABOUT THIS MACHINE:  The plastic top for the carafe doesn't have a hinge...it is just one plastic piece that you have to bop with your fist to pop in place (and dig off with your fingernails when you go to wash it).  Sometimes it seems like the lid is in place but when you go to pour your coffee it falls into the cup.  I called the company about this and they did mail me a new carafe (so good customer service) but this doesn't fix the basic problem.  At this price point the carafe should have a hinge type top that affixes to the handle and doesn't fall off.I usually just buy a cheap B&D type coffee maker because they all do basically the same thing and I like basket style filters (cheaper).  But I noticed my son's Cuisinart coffee maker had a warming plate that allowed you to adjust the temperature (W,M, H).  My B&D (which I only had for about 16 months died prematurely) so I ponied up the $ for the almost double-the-price Cuisinart ($75) to get an adjustable warming plate.  It does have alot of other features that the B&D didn't have (Bold flavor button, pre-set  ""on"" time, ""clean"" button and unfortunately a ""cone"" filter).  The machine is working well and makes good coffee but I don't use alot of the features  (tho I do like the adjustable warming plate).Unfortunately, I would not spend the money to buy this machine in future."
"As I was looking for a new coffee maker to replace another one, I found reviews on how reliable this particular model was. I purchased it; however, it has been a less-than-stellar experience. I have tons of coffee grounds in my carafe. When using the paper filters, this is not an issue, but why have a mesh filter if it doesn't work? I never had this problem with the Ninja coffee maker that I previously had. Disappointed in the overall performance of this coffee maker.  I would not buy it again based on the mess it makes with the mesh filter."
"The product itself is fine...for now. Down the line I'm not sure if all will be well. Just wanted to let you know the packaging was all beaten, battered. Almost wondered if this had been a return from another customer.This review won;t let me attach a picture. I took several views of the carton prior to pulling out the coffee maker. That's why I mentioned not sure if the product is okay. I made a pot of coffee, seems okay but the lid on top of the coffee maker was extremely hot when I opened it to remove the coffee grounds. That worries me. We've had this same coffee maker only in black for 20 years and I never felt that heat on that one. Wanted this on record. If you have a way for me to attach the pictures I already took please let me know."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Overall, the coffee maker is ok and makes good coffee.  We have harder water but it seems we have to clean the maker quite often, more often than with other makers we’ve had.  It can take up to an hour to brew a full pot of coffee and maybe because of the hard water?  Not sure.  I couldn’t figure out why there was a puddle of water behind the maker all the time.  Thought it might have been a leak but finally figured out it happens when you lift the lid.  Any condensation in the lid runs out the back . Tired of having to use a dish towel when lifting the lid.  Time for a different brand."
"Purchased 2/1/2023, enjoyed using it daily. Unfortunately it stopped working today, 12/4/2024, it will not brew the coffee, it just makes clicking sounds. Have purchased many variations of this coffee maker over the last twenty years, most of them lasted at least three years. Going to try a different brand this time around."
"I should have known by getting a white-ish coffee maker, it requires work! This is just a heads up that the lid of this coffee pot will stain very quickly!! I wash it every night with soap and a scrub brush. Then I clean it twice a week with baking soda, vinega & lemon juice. As you can see after having this only 2 months, it is nearly, permanently stained. Also, the glass of the coffee pot is exceptionally finicky, in the way that you also have to wash it out with hot water and soap (not a standard, obvious quick wash), but it has to be really washed, to remove cloudy look and/or a line, EACH day! INSIDE the lid of the coffee maker, where are you would place the filter, it is also an area that collects little coffee grinds that requires cleaning. It will clean easily if you pour water all down in there, but then the water goes through the hole onto the element, is all. So to clean it with a cloth is a bit tricky because the coffee grinds collect and you can only get it with the corner of the cloth, it’s narrow. Yes, these are points that may not be important to some people, but I am only doing this review for those who may find this important. Yes, it does look pretty on the counter. I bought this one for looks and not as much functionality and low maintenance. We have always had stainless steel coffee pots and coffee makers and they are less maintenance. Just FYI :) We only bought this as a back up to our Nespresso machine (which we LOVE and yes, Nespresso has an excellent recycling program unlike Keurig. At least when we bought ours 7 years ago) that we have decided to take a break from using, for various reasons. So there you have it. :)"
"By the 3rd day the machine was malfunctioning and while still making coffee, sputtering and spraying grounds throughout the interior of the machine.  Contacted Cuisinart and received NO response.  Sad, no one stands behind their products anymore.  Chalk it up to another single sale company."
"Coffee Maker works great, as expected.  However the the top plastic rim does appear to sealed to the glass carafe.  Every time water is poured into the coffee maker or coffee into a cup, there is liquid allover the counter top."
"I thoroughly searched to find a replacement for our 10-year old, beloved Capresso Team 453, that seamlessly ground beans and then brewed them into a flawless cup of coffee.  My husband and I knew that it would be almost impossible to find a new machine to measure up.  Little did I know how sparse and meager the findings were.  There was no grind-and-brew option that did not have serious issues (fires! huge leaks!), so we settled for buying a separate grinder and an automatic drip coffee maker.Neutral• There is a great deal of condensation (as others have mentioned) in the main section.  I see that others have been daily wiping it, but I have decided to see if it turns into a problem before I do anything to alleviate it.  I will update in a few months either way.Pros• We like the Bold feature, and use it often.  It slows down the entire brewing process, allowing the grounds to have more time saturated with the hot water.  You can choose to use the 1-4 to do the same thing with smaller amounts of coffee.• The ""Brew Off"" feature is also handy.  I love knowing that it's going to turn off before the coffee starts getting that burnt taste.• The ability to turn off the “coffee is done” beeping tone was a selling point.  Of course I wanted the best coffee maker for the money, but this feature made the decision clear for me.• We like the option to make 14 cups.  Previously when entertaining, we would automatically have had to make 2 pots right away.• It is nice that the #4 cone filters are readily available.• The plastic basket clicks nicely into its holder, and works well.• The aqua LED color is pleasant, although quite bright.• The taste of the coffee seems comparable to that of our beloved former coffee maker.  (We buy a particular mix of whole beans that we love, for a blend that is so good that it is a travesty to add flavoring to!)• I like that you can clearly see how much water you're pouring into the reservoir.  Because it is so hard to pour water into the reservoir without dripping when using the carafe, (NARROW reservoir opening), I am using a drinking glass to pour the water in.  The markings make this possible.Cons• The pause ‘n’ serve feature does not work well.  It drips onto the warming plate about half the time. I have found that it does work better if you have the handle centered, versus the handle being far right or far left of the options.• The temperature options for the carafe's warmer do not offer enough range of temperature.  The Low setting should be low enough for people like me, who like to drink their coffee immediately, and who are sensitive to temperature.  Let the people who love their coffee very hot choose the High setting. The Low setting on this machine makes it hot enough so that I would immediately burn my lips/mouth if I even sipped it.  To compensate, I have been using the leftover cold coffee that my husband and I use for iced coffee.  Of course, it is annoying to have to add an extra step every time to the pouring of your coffee.  I will either have to keep using the cold coffee, or start using refrigerated creamer, which I do not want to have to do. This lack of options caused the first star to come off the rating. I checked the temperature of the coffee in the carafe with an instant-read digital thermometer immediately after brewing 8 cups, when the carafe was on Low: 186 degrees.  Immediately after being poured in my mug, it was 180 degrees.  The temperature when the carafe setting was on High was 190 immediately after brewing 8 cups. I was going to check the temperature in the carafe when set on the Medium setting, but after seeing only 4 degrees' difference between Low and High, I didn't bother . . . definitely not much choice in warmer settings.• I read others’ reviews about the lid not coming off easily.  I passed off their negative reviews as being too picky.  It turns out I was wrong. I was used to a lid that was hinged, and eased up gently, through gravity, when pouring.  The old lid also popped off easily when you wanted it to, but not until then.  This new lid annoys me greatly, even though it seems like a negligible problem, and caused the loss of the second star. You cannot leave the lid off to brew coffee, either.• My entire kitchen is white, and so I would have loved the option to have this coffee maker available in that color.  The black/stainless look is a bit jarring in my kitchen, but no stars were removed for this lack of choices."
"Selected this coffee maker with the hope it would be superior to my earlier model.I find that the mechanism the dispenses the water over the coffee grounds is TOO CLOSE to the grounds.  This part is always covered with small bits of coffee grounds and stains.  This also results in my coffee grounds spilling over the basket/paper filter into the pot of coffee.I use a good portion of coffee grounds as I like my coffee very strong.  It seems that the manufacturer assumes the measurement of the coffee is less than my desired amount resulting in the mechanism getting covered with coffee grounds and stains.NOTE:  I am also using the BOLD setting.  I am unsure if this causes the water dripped into the grounds to remain there longer thus causing the coffee grounds to rise up to hit the mechanism dispensing the water.I have not inserted the ""filter"" that is provided.  Unsure that this would change/impact the taste of my coffee.The pot has a nice way of attaching the cover.  It pops on and off nicely and securely.The pot's inner top part is not smoothly curved out to ensure that the coffee is poured out completely--rather an edge is there trapping a small amount of coffee and any coffee grounds that made their way into the pot during brewing.This is my first product made by Cuisinart and my expectations were high.  While will continue to use this coffee maker, I feel somewhat disappointed in the noted exceptions to a possibly good/great product as given above."
"Made great coffee while it lasted. Today, it just completely stopped working. For a machine that cost more than $100, that is not very good quality. Disappointed.UPDATE: After submitting original review, I contacted Cuisinart Customer Service. Luckily I had held on to my instruction book/warranty and saw that I was still within my three year warranty. Their response was awesome. They replaced my broken coffee maker. So I changed my review to three stars -- the machine did break down, which isn't great, but their customer service, and warranty support, was awesome. A three year warranty is really pretty good. Better than most electronics. And to stand behind it without question is great customer service in my book. When my new one eventually dies (they all do) I will buy another one from Cuisinart."
"This is one of several I have purchased over the years.  This one was just fine, till the time change.  Clock no longer works and we now have to start manually. Too late to return."
"I bought this in 2016, it lasted 4 year then started leaking.  Bought the same one in 2020, and here I am in 2024 with the same leaking problem."
"This was my 3rd Quisinart coffee machine.  the Prior versions also leaked as described below; which is why they have a video on their website about.  But I just dealt with it.  In summary, After flipping up the lid to retrieve used Coffee grounds, water leaks Down the back and underneath the machine. Also when I pour a cup I'm always left with a few dribbles of coffee on my kitchen counter. Must be some faulty design with the lid. Finally, I contacted customer support to notify about the clock running 3 hours fast every 24 hours. So I couldn't use the programmable feature. They told me I had to cut the cord, email them a picture of the cut cord and then I would get a new machine within 12 to 15 days. Sorry, I can't go without coffee for 12 to 15 days. My next coffee machine will not be a Quisinart.Update to the above review: I increased it to a 3 star rating since they delivered my replacement coffee maker 3/4 days after I submitted my warranty request."
"The coffee maker is very good, keeps the coffee hot but trying to pour water into the reservoir is a mess.  I would bet if I’m not really, really careful close to 3/4C of water is dripped down the side.  In fact, it’s so messy & irritating that 3 weeks after getting it I’m ordering a different coffee maker.  We make about 4-5 pots every morning so this is just to annoying & exasperating."
"I should have paid attention to others who pointed this out, but the pour on the thermal decanter is terrible.  Kind of dribbles out the first few cups and you will literally have to turn the carafe upside to get the last cup or two out.  This results in spilling.  The small opening makes the carafe hard to clean, too.  We went back to our heated base model."
"I have no idea how this coffee maker is rated so high, honestly.  We have had this coffee maker for a year and a half, only to wake up a few days ago to a flood of water all over the counter from leaking.  Now it has stopped working completely, while we were in the process of investigating how to fix it!  My last drip and espresso combo model was a Krups and it lasted 15 years.I did a copy and paste of a review below from March 2, 2014 (Posted by:  ""Cal Bear"") in which they had this same issue.  They outline this very issue.  The support was not there, and they did the troubleshooting re: how to fix it in six in-depth steps.  This coffee pot is not worth it. Piece of junk, never again. Super disappointed.----------------------------------We loved this coffee maker and the tasty coffee it produced. But after just a year of ownership, it started leaking water out of the bottom when we filled the reservoir. We did a Google search and discovered this is a widespread problem with these units. There are two internal rubber water hoses which get brittle very quickly and leak clear water out of the bottom as (or before) the coffee maker can make a pot of coffee. We always staged our coffee on a timer the night before and suddenly started awaking to floods on our kitchen floor dripping off the counter. We finally realized it was the Cuisinart, so we started filling and brewing as fast as possible and then wiped up the mess with paper towels. It also didn't seem very safe having an electrical unit sitting in a puddle of water, so we did some research and figured out how to fix the problem and keep our Cuisinart working! Cuisinart wasn't very helpful and even denied the problem existed, yet there are hundreds of complaints on the web detailing the problem.Here's what we pieced together from various sources:1. You need to remove the base plate to access the silicone rubber water hose (or hoses) that have gone bad. The unit has two of them that sit just below the hot plate (the heat obviously makes them brittle). To remove the base plate, you will need a Torx #10 security screwdriver. They cost about $5 at a hardware store (or on Amazon).2. You also need to order some replacement hose you can cut to fit. Go to McMaster-Carr (sorry, Amazon doesn't allow links) and key in part number 5236K73. It's the same high-temperature silicone rubber tubing semisoft, 3/8"" ID, 5/8"" OD, opaque red hosing as in the coffee maker. Food safe and heat resistant. The hose sells for $2.59 per foot and costs about $9 with shipping and tax. One foot is plenty...each hose is about 4 1/2 inches long.3. Unplug the coffee maker and turn it upside down. There are 4 torx screws holding the base plate. Two are under the rear rubber feet grommets that need to be popped off to access the screws; the other two are in the ""open"" holes in the middle right/left sides of the base plate. There are no screws underneath the front rubber feet grommets;4. Once the four screws are removed, the base plate comes right off. You'll be looking at the bottom of the hot plate and two red rubber hoses attached to aluminum tubes. The hoses are held onto the metal tubes by two black metal spring clamps, which can be removed by pressing the edges together with your fingers (easy). When I looked at mine, the right hose had a clearly visible crack where the clamp held it to the tube. Once the clamp is removed, the hose detaches easily from the metal tubing. The other end of the hose seats into a plastic nipple at the base of the water tank;5. DON'T TOSS OUT THE HOSE YET! There is a small plastic backflow protection device inserted into the hose. It's small...a tiny plastic cage with an ""X"" design and a very small plastic ball inside. I got mine out by putting a screwdriver in one end and pushing it out the other. Be careful not to lose the little ball. Mine bounced across the kitchen floor.6. Cut the new hose to length, insert the backflow protector into the hose at the metal tube side, pinch the spring clamp back into position to hold the hose on the metal tubing, push the other end of the hose onto the plastic nipple at the base of the water tank and VOILA!...repaired Cuisinart coffee maker with no leak good for (hopefully) another 18 months!"
"I've enjoyed Cuisinart coffee maker for the past 25 yrs, I've replaced my 12 cup stainless version 3 times in the pass 25 yrs I consider that a good value when they last 7 yrs there abouts. The coffee maker # 4 and 5 I decided to try the 14 cup version well #4 failed within 14 months Cuisinart was awsome and honored the warranty sent out a new one within 48 hrs well now #5 is failing in the same manner and well it's been approx 14 months  we only brew one pot a day, needless to say we're out of warranty, I'm going back to the 12 cup version there ole standby version. I believe it's odd that the 14 cup version has issues with the circuit board controls they fail like clockwork so I'm going back to the original SS version of 12 cup because they held up for many years. The coffee maker isn't my only Cuisinart kitchen appliance I have 3 other appliances made by Cuisinart and they still function flawlessly after 10 yrs. I'm truly baffled by only 14 months life out of a simple design coffee machine. And certainly not happy about doling out money for yet a third coffee maker within 39 months."
"My unit did not come with a charcoal filter. Mostly I purchased this for my parents and I was hoping for a more intuitive set it and forget it system, but that really isn’t the case. I’m giving it 3 stars mainly because it still managed to make a decent, well balanced cup."
Had it for less than 11 months and it started leaking from the bottom. This is the third one I have had and everyone of them have leaked. I do like the 4 hr. Shut off and the 14 cup size. Don’t think I will buying it again.
I wish I could return this product but I opened the box and used only one time.  I don't like the way the carafe lid stays on when filling up water.  Does not open must remove lid.  I wish it never purchased this coffeemaker.
"I have purchased Cuisinart coffee makers consistently for over 20 years, largely because of positive reviews from Consumer Reports as well as my own personal experience.  After renovating my kitchen, last year I decided to purchase a new Cuisinart DCC-2300 in white to match my new kitchen as well as replace my previous black DCC-3200 which had stopped functioning after four years of every day / all day usage.  My new white model was beautiful and worked perfectly for about 18 months.  But over this past weekend my white Cuisinart DCC-3200 started leaking water all over my counter and floor in its ""Program Mode"" to make coffee before I woke up the next day. After programming the DCC-3200 to brew 12 cups of coffee the next morning, I noticed upon waking up that only about five cups of coffee had been brewed... the rest of the tap water poured into the reservoir the previous evening was on my counter top and floor.  In addition to having to clean up the leaked water, I was concerned about the electrical hazard of my Cuisinart DCC-3200 sitting in a puddle of water in my kitchen. Now after less than 2 years of use I am forced to purchase another $100 coffee maker.  I checked Consumer Reports and the DCC-3200 is still a top-rated model, so I will probably purchase another white DCC-3200, despite the relatively large number of negative reviews on Amazon as well as Consumer Reports and Cuisinart web sites.  I wish Cuisinart would fix the problems reported in these negative reviews even if the fixes and quality control upgrades lead to higher retail prices.  I still love this coffee maker for the quality of coffee it brews in addition to the aesthetics of the machine's design and color."
"I took Cuisineart for the brand...It's a little more expensive than the other one but it should do better...No...It's just doing the coffee...The coffee is as expected, good...But there are a few annoying little issues you shouldn't have when you pay a little more:- Graduation between tank and jar does not match or too much water is lost as steam... Put 8 in the tank if you want 6 in the jar...- It's too easy to spill the coffee if you serve it too quickly- And the tank is not removable, so it is not convenient to fill.So choose something else..."
"I've had 3 Cuisinart coffee makers over the years, all very similar to this model. Loved them. Then I needed a another one for an apartment.My biggest issue is less than a year after purchase, some rust started to appear through flaking paint on the hot plate. I had always dried it after use, so this was a surprise. Fast forward to 2 years later and it looks like the picture. The rust is abrasive and bumpy, and scratching the carafe, ultimately weakening it. I never had this issue with the other Cuisinart coffee makers, have had the same water, and used the machines the same way over the last 20 years. My suspicion is that they coatings or metal on these hot plates was changed along the way to save on manufacturing costs.I reached out to customer service since there is a 3 year warranty. They labeled this issue that so many others have as ""cosmetic,"" and therefore not covered under warranty. It was suggested I try white vinegar to remove the rust which did not work. Nothing but sanding this down and repainting it will fix the abrasive surface. I found this response to a very known issue disappointing.This was my main issue, and one I was asking for an immediate solution for whether it be a replacement hotplate that I could install, a pro repair, or a replacement unit. However, I may as well give the rest of my pros/cons for the unit.Pros: 1. Coffee tastes good, doesn't get burnt taste from hot plate. 2. Buttons and controls very easy to use, as are general functions to make it work. 3. Large carafe.Cons: 1. Coffee grinds basket has to be set just right, and unseats very easliy. If it's slightly off, the spring function backs up the water and overflows grinds back into the water reservoir, which then run back through the internals into the basket again. t's avoidable when careful, but when you're groggy and just trying to get some coffee made, it's easy to miss this. A good metaphor is playing the game ""Operation"" except instead of being buzzed, you have a MESS of coffee grinds to clean up inside the coffee maker. 2. The carafe easily leaks when you are pouring it into the reservoir when 8+ cups are in it. You have to pour it sloooowwww to prevent this. Not a huge deal. 3. The carafe top which Cuisinart has been using for years has small openings in the top and bottom that the coffee drips through. The problem here is you can't fully clean this. If you have this top on an existing coffeemaker, I dare you to poke a Qtip around through the holes. Gross.So, that's my spiel. Used to love this brand, pretty bummed they're leaving me hanging. Will move on from here."
"It's beautiful a beautiful unit. It's easy to program. However, the coffee it brews is tasteless and slightly burnt. I removed the charcoal filter to see if the taste improved...it did slightly. After 6 attempts, I think I might have to send this unit back.Here's what I've tried to troubleshoot the brew taste. 1) Opened a fresh can of Lavazza and a fresh can of Illy coffee to make sure I was using the best, quality grounds. It didn't help, the coffee brewed was tasteless brown water. 2) Tried the same Lavazza coffee in my pour-over...coffee tasted and smelled delicious....so I verified my taste buds and sense of smell was on point. 3) Tried the regular setting vs. strong setting...coffee didn't taste good.  4) Tried 1-4 cups vs. 10 cups...coffee didn't taste good.  5) tried a paper filter vs. the basket that ships with...no difference.Perhaps, I have a bad unit? Other reviews, seem to indicated this unit makes great tasting coffee. Bummer for me. Luckily, I still have other ways to brew a good cup of coffee (pour-over, Clever Dripper, and my Keurig Supreme)."
"This is my second Cuisinart coffee maker - same model. I only replaced the 10+ year old one because the hot plate was getting so crusty I was worried it would quit on me and it looked kind of gross. The truth is the new one works like a coffee maker is supposed to - it brews coffee, and from my experience, it does a decent job. It has some nice features, programable, auto off feature, boldness adjustment (not sure what that does, but pick what works for you), 14 cup size. The not so decent feature, you are supposed to be able to pull the pot out mid brew to pour a cup of coffee - well that does not work at all. Even when the pot is done brewing, and you pull the pot out whatever liquid may still be in the basket will drip onto the hot plate (causing the crusty grossness that took the last pot 10 years to develop). This one will likely be in the garbage much sooner. Also, on the second brew something happened and the water was stuck (wouldn't flow) which is interesting because the basket doesn't hold water at all (even tested it in the sink to see if it would hold any water and it does not), so coffee got all over the inside making clean up a nightmare. Bottom line - I would say it's a bit over priced. There are probably better options out there I wish I had tried one."
"I use a Melitta unbleached #4 coffee filter. I don’t use the gold mesh filter.﻿ I’ve used the same coffee blend for the last 25 years which is Peet’s dark roast House Blend. I brew the Cuisinart equivalent of 4 cups, which is about 16 ounces of water and I use 1 ounce of coffee.I have previously used Bunn coffee makers, as well as the old original Keurig K50 or K55. Bunn and the old Keurig machines all made a dark balanced coffee that was complex, well developed, and nuanced. Bunn machines now get terrible reviews for flavor and longevity. The old Keurig is still available but I want to get away from all the plastic. My review is based on this Cuisinart compared to my old Bunn and Keurig machines.Below are my experiences with four different types of brewing on this Cuisinart machine.Using just Brew selection - brew time was 5 minutes. A pretty flavorless cup of colored water.Bold selection with Brew - brew time was 6 minutes. A bit better than just using the regular brew selection only, but basically still a light tasting cup of slightly darker colored water.Using the 1-4 cup selection with Brew - brew time was 8 minutes.  Coffee was stronger and darker than regular Brew and regular Bold Brew. Still no depth of flavor or complexity or richness developed. It was darker and stronger. Even though this brew was still a one note flavor, I liked it better than either one of the regular Brew selections.Using 1-4 cup and Bold selections with Brew - brew time was 9 minutes. This was bolder and stronger than any of the others. It almost began to develop some complexity, but still didn’t quite make the mark. This was my favorite brew grouping of all of them. It took 9 minutes to get a good flavorful brew from this pot making 4 cups of coffee."
"I like this item very much, except that the clock jumps ahead in time for no apparent reason. It inch-ups in time, and sometime within the day, it spikes so high that it is hours ahead in time. I would have returned it, but this didn't happen until after my return time had expired. Other than that it works well and is esthetically pleasing."
"Overall this is a great coffee maker at a great price. Solid build with a great design and intuitive functionality. This is a replacement for a near identical Cuisinart coffee maker I purchased in 2016 that lasted a long time with heavy use. Makes a great cup of coffee!However, the carafe design, especially the lid and pour ""spout"" are annoying and could use a much needed redesign. Removing the lid to fill the carafe and reinstalling it on the carafe is a chore in itself. The spout on the carafe is too ""flat"" and not rounded enough so when you pour coffee at any angle it spills and leaks all over the counter. This is also true when you are using it to fill the water reservoir. Have a towel handy when you are using it. I hope Cuisinart addresses this issue soon and allows their loyal customer base access to a viable (and more functional) replacement carafe."
"I was excited to finally get a new coffee maker and this had the features we were looking for. But there were 2 things I over looked when picking the maker out that ended up making us send this coffee maker back. 1st the display screen is back lit blue and always on. Not a big deal for most. But really annoying when you are sensitive to light. 2nd the lid for the Carafe snaps on. Our old one would flip open, making it easy to fill with water or to clean. It poured really nicely, but we have had a lid like this in the past that broke rather quickly. I Made one pot of coffee before sending it back. And it tasted great! I wish I could get it without the blue light at least and then I'd be able to convince my husband it was worth the change in normal routine. 🤷‍♀️"
"I purchased this coffee pot to replace another Cusinart coffee maker that I had for years. Let me first say that this is a large coffee make, 14 cup capacity. I didn’t think that would bother me but we really didn’t  need the larger capacity. Not worth the extra size if you don’t need the extra cup capacity. I wish I would have gotten a smaller pot. My fault. My three stars is not for this reason though. The thing that really bugs me is that you can’t pour all the water into the machine because the lid does not give you enough room to pour everything out of the pot into the Machine. It’s really annoying."
"I bought this as a replacement for my coffee pot (same model), that after years of faithful service, finally went out. Though I was able to get a great ""lightning deal,"" the quality seems to have decreased. I'm not sure if mine is a one-off, but I'm disappointed.The lid is completely uneven. It shuts, but there is a noticeable difference between left and right sides. The heating element is also off kilter. It dips forward. The gold filter seems to sit very loose in the basket, compared to my older version. Feels less secure.The machine works, but quality control has slipped significantly."
"We ordered this in Feb 2024.  We make a full pot every day.  After about 6 months, we noticed that we had to reset the clock often as it ran fast.  Today it was 2.5 hours ahead, just 12 hours after setting it. We rely on the clock/auto-start to have coffee ready when we get up. It takes a while to brew a full pot. I've contacted the manufacturer so maybe they can offer a solution.I also find it nearly impossible to pour without coffee running down the side of the carafe onto the counter."
"This is a coffee maker without any bells or whistles.Features:- There's a timer- The heating element stays on for max 4 hours but can be set to less. It shuts off after 4 no matter what for safety.- It beeps when ready and when the heating element gets turned off. Sound can be turned off with a simple button.- A few temperature levels to pick from- bold optionThe big flaw for me was the top lid. So much water condensation gathers there. When you open it to make coffee, there's some condensation water that drips down the back. I saw pics from people where the bottom of their machine was all rusty, I imagine this is why. It's worrisome but once I bought a tray that you can put the machine on (one that slides and pulls the machine towards you easily) I stopped worrying about it because now water goes on the tray and just dries up and my counters are protected.The carafe has a pop off lid, not one that pivots open when you push at the handle. Took a bit to get used to it but I don't mind it. I feel this carafe pours much better than my old one and I don't get as many water spills but you still need to be careful and patient when pouring the water :). Pouring coffee though has been so much better. I don't spill at all anymore. My previous carafe was a nightmare to pour coffee with, always spilled, but not with this one."
"I had this coffee maker shipped in Amazon box. That outer box arrived in good shape. The two inner Cuisinart boxes were all torn up. I mean crushed and holes. Those boxes were installed in the amazon box that way. I just knew it arrived broken. After unpacking, everything was in tact. I had a small dent in the side next to the cup window. I installed filter and filled with water. Unit seems to work with no leaks. This unit has three year warranty and I have pics just in case. Beware."
"OK, this is probably my fourth Cuisinart I buy them because I like the flavor. It stays hot enough for me but what really gets me angry is the pouring part on the carafe it splashes everywhere and it drives me nuts. They sent me one free one with the first maker now nobody helps me with the last one I purchased. I am done with Cuisinart. They need to fix the carafe Why doesn’t anybody complain about this? ? I’m finally done with Cuisinart. It’s sad because I really like the coffee maker. I hate the pouring part of water part Can’t take it no more! I only kept buying them because they last long and my husband likes them. I mean, when you pour the water from the crarafe to the water tank to be specific."
"We got this coffee maker four years ago after our previous Cuisinart died (that one lasted close to a decade, if not longer). It was basically the updated model with a larger pot, and we do go through all 14 cups many days.This machine makes a very good, solid pot of coffee, and it looks great on the counter. But there are some major usability issues.First, the lid over the hopper doesn't open far enough to pour all the water in. So you're at a tricky angle trying to fill the reservoir. Second, the pouring spout on the pot itself is an odd shape. It looks fine, but if you pour from a full pot, you WILL spill water or coffee everywhere unless you pour EXTREMELY slowly and carefully. We had to start keeping a towel next to the pot specifically to catch all the water that pours down the side of the pot when filling the reservoir.But perhaps worst of all is the overflow hole on the back of the machine. It's there so that if you overfill the reservoir, it will spill out the back instead of... idk, into the machine? But the problem is that it's placed JUST above the fill line. So if you're making a full pot of coffee, which we do every morning, you pull the machine out from the under the cabinet to open the lid and put in coffee and water. Then fill the reservoir to the top. Then push the machine back under the cabinet where it belongs. Even if you're pretty darn careful, that motion causes the water to slosh and pour out the overflow hole. So we get puddles of water all over the counter, under the machine, everywhere, every morning.UPDATE, just a few days later: We took a closer look at the coffee maker after it died for good, to see if we could fix it. Turns out the puddle wasn't entirely from the overflow. Something broke with the water pump, so it was leaking water all over itself. That explains why the small puddles suddenly got much bigger. No wonder it died. So this thing broke within just 3 or so years, hard to say exactly when, but for the price, it did not last nearly long enough. We're trying another brand now.And it seems that constant puddle has taken a toll. This morning, it made one final pot of coffee, shut itself all the way off, and declared itself dead.If this were a cheap machine I'd give it 4-5 stars. But for all these little flaws, which should have been caught during development, and the fact that it only lasted four years, I deduct points."
"I ordered a new product, never been opened. This coffee maker had been returned with a note from previous buyer saying it had a defective hot plate. Same message was on the outside packaging box. If I’m getting a previously boughten product, shouldn’t I be charged accordingly, because I paid for a new product. I’m keeping it because product seems to be okay, but I didn’t want one that has been previously sold and returned."
"With it's included goldtone permanent filter, this coffee maker made such good coffee that I set aside my French Press for a couple years.  The coffee is hot, not roof of your mouth scalding hot like commercial makers, but a good degree of drinking level hot.  There's no reason to ever turn it down from it's hottest setting though.  The only thing we really didn't like about it was that four hours was the maximum time the warmer plate could be set to keep it warm, which it did a good job for those four hours.  After 2 and a half years of making 6-10 cups of coffee once per day, almost every day, the heating element went out, when making a rare 14 cup pot while we had guests over. Though some of the plastic around the warming plate melted at the same time, but the next day it wouldn't even heat the water.We like the quality of the coffee this thing makes, but frankly, we expected it to last a lot longer considering the price.  Even a cheap $20 Mr. Coffee lasts longer than this did.  If the warmer plate stayed on for more than four hours and if Cuisinart had a better reputation for supporting their products, we'd probably buy it again, despite the semi-short-Gevity of our first unit.UPDATE 071318:  after killing most of a day reading contradictory reviews for dozens of other coffee makers here on amazon, we decided to stick with what we know and bought this again, that way we at least have our old carafe should we have an accident with the new one.  We might should have upgraded sooner, as the new unit heated the coffee a lot hotter than our old had been, even before the heating element melted.  The beep that lets you know when it's finished brewing is a lot louder too and the display is brighter and easier to read, oddly.We almost bought a BUNN, but it seems that they're quality has become very inconsistent as well since they started outsourcing overseas.  And for a one pot per day household, we just couldn't come to terms with the thing keeping the water warm 24/7.  Having a full pot (only 10 cups) of coffee in just 3 minutes seemed a trivial perk for a one pot per day household in an era where energy efficiency is such a huge concern.  Not to mention taking up twice the counter-space.  With their owners being just as divided on the products reliability, it just wasn't worth paying almost double what the Cuisinart was currently going for.Turns out our first unit is still under warranty, so I'll update again after contacting them to report whether or not we get the same run-around others have reported or not.  Pics show our new Cuisinart on the counter and closeups of where the old one melted, which the paint on the warmer must have peeled off at the same time, as we'd never noticed it before."
Carafe leaked when pouringDid not keep coffee hot as advertisedCoffee tasted good though
"We have purchased this coffee pot several times over the past 5-6 years. Like the 14 cup size. Our most recent purchase allows water (when filling) and coffee when pouring to run down the coffee maker and all over the counter.  Each process is a clean up.Contacted manufacturer and they sent us a new lid.  That seem to help for a month, then it is back to the same old problem.We do not pour the water/coffee to fast. Did not have this problem in previous same model pots.  So; this Black Friday buying a different brand, just tired of the mess.  Something in the manufacturing process must have changed.  Beware when buying."
"As everyone, I have had lots of coffee makers, but for the last year, I drink black coffee. I could seriously tell the difference the first time I brewed coffee with this maker. So next day I tried pushing Bold. Nope, I will have to add an extra scoop to try to gain the flavor. So far, it is like coffee water. Weird."
"This started off fine. Works fine. Timers great. Easy to clean. BUT after just a few weeks, it's tripled the time it takes to make a single pot of coffee! It's been cleaned monthly, with coffee pot cleaner internally and soap and water externally. From 15 minutes to now 45 minutes to brew a pot of coffee. That's ridiculous!"
It brews the coffee. It does what it is asked to do. And it tastes good. Like coffee. But here’s the issues that after a couple months of owning this I just can’t get past. The lid. What a pain. I forget where I put it every single time I fill the carafe. And I feel like it’s not going to snap back on in the near future. Filling the maker with the water is the worst. Maybe if the lid could be lifted up slightly it wouldn’t leak so bad. It leaks worse with the lid off. So I’m not sure what the problem is. It doesn’t leak when I’m pouring my coffee in my cup. I don’t get it. The lid for the coffee maker should be hinged at the side not at the back. It is next to impossible to fill it with water with the lid in the way. And the area the water is supposed to go into is way too small. So it’s the whole filling part of this coffee maker I have an issue with. At least once the battle is over you can have some delicious coffee to celebrate.
"The overall look is very good, modern. However when first turned on it sounds like it is dying. After pouring a cup of coffee the carafe doesn’t easily slide back into place. It has to be forced to be placed back on the warmer….the coffee is good but…."
With every pot of coffee which is every day I have to dry the top of the pot.  Lots of condensation .  Have to clean it with every pot which as I said before is every day.  Disappointed  in this coffee pot.
"I love Cuisinart products, and needed to replace our aging Cuisinart coffee maker.  This one was highly rated by a consumer reporting agency, so I placed my order and awaited for the next day delivery.  And I waited.  After it arrived a week + later (a lengthy wait for it to arrive but I figured it was worth it, Cuisinart makes a good cup of joe) I was excited to unpack it, plug it in and brew a fresh pot of java.  OOOhhhh, the aroma of a good cuppa. . . . but there was something bothering me as it brewed.  I poured a cup and savored the fresh brewed aroma.  The coffee came out great as usual, but as I sipped my brew I realized the annoying blue LED clock panel is enough to make me return this product.  Too bright, the wrong color and totally annoying.  I have a night light already, I don't need another one casting a UFO glow across my kitchen.  Turn it off?  Not an option.  Cover it with electrical tape?  Why spend $100+ bucks to brew coffee only to deface the maker with tape.  Unplug it?  Well, an option but why have it then?  I have reached out to Cuisinart to find out if all their makers are equipped with this cheap clock panel, and will decide whether to keep it or return it with their reply.  Until then, I pulled out the old maker and re-boxed this one.5 MARCH UPDATE:  I heard back from Conair (parent company of Cuisinart?) with a list of coffee makers without the annoying blue LED ""UFO"" clock.  They are:DCC-2650P1DCC-T20P1SS-GB1SS-12DCC-1200P1DGB-550BKP1CHW-16I ultimately decided to keep the coffee maker and ""fixed"" the ufo invasion by using colored cellophane cut to slip over the offending bright light (it slid in behind the panel and before the LED panel).  It toned the light down enough to not bathe the kitchen in its eerie glow.  Yellow cellophane made the panel appear green, which is softer and more comfortable to the eye."
"Coffee tastes great, i like the features, etc.  HOWEVER...  It is basically impossible to pour all the water out of the carafe into the reservoir when you want to make coffee.  The design of the lid, the opening, and the carafe itself combine to leave you with a few tablespoons of water still in the carafe when filling the machine to make coffee.  You either have to fill it with some other sort of pitcher, or upend the carafe and spill water into your coffee grounds, on the counter, on the side of the machine, etc.  Would not buy again simply for this design flaw."
"At first use we loved this unit, and it was highly reviewed. But, we've come to discovery that 10-20% of the time, the basket overflows with coffee/grinds which pour grinds into the carafe and/or into the feed water reservoir.Before you dismiss this as ""user error"" - I spent way too much time troubleshooting this device.If the basket is not snapped all the way down, it will definitely happen (we check this every time).If you do not get the carafe EXACTLY in the middle of the heat plate - it might happen (we try to check this every time). That 10-20% of the time is due to the plunger valve being skewed just enough that the basket can't drain fast enough, but it LOOKS like everything is set correctly. You should NOT have to do an inspection/audit every time you want to make coffee.The reason this is shameful and embarrassing is that all it would have taken is some decent care & design from manufacturer. You know, basic testing before releasing it, but quality just isn't important anymore. The basket could easily have a better snap feature, instead of it loosely sitting on top. The carafe lid could have a wider dome that triggers the discharge valve across a larger area. The heat plate should be designed to be the exact size of the carafe bottom - so that it only fits in 1 space.I'm still debating returning it, because it's such a hassle. It's extremely frustrating to buy a ""good"" item and for it to have such terrible, but simple, flaws. For now I literally ripped out the plunger valve so we just need to remember that we can't grab the carafe mid-brew."
"I do t know why this gets rates so well. The machine has two major issues. You can barely use the coffee pot to fill the machine, it the cover blocks the pot from easily pouring into the machine causing spills. The lid to the pot also doesn’t have a hinge. You have to completely remove it to rinse or fill the pot. Lastly and this is not critical but this is a 14 cup machine so be sure you want a larger than normal coffee machine, it’s bigger than it looks."
This is an update: The coffee maker works and I’m surprised. Never ever have Amazon deliver in mfg box!! I didn’t for this but I guess when they saw another order that I was ok with mfg pkg they must have though this would make it to Hawaii unscathed. NOT!!I will just say that I haven’t yet plugged this in but it may be broken already as it was delivered in it’s storeshelf box which is torn and was open!!! No tape no nothing to keep the box closed!! They didn’t even bother to put it in an Amazon box!!! It took almost 2 1/2 weeks to get here. The last one I ordered didn’t even have a shipment date at 3 weeks after ordering!! I am really disappointed in Amazon over the past year or so! Their service is getting lousier and lousier!! I will update this review if I am lucky and it works once I plug it in and set it up.
"At the time I'm writing this review, it's actually 6:17 am. However, you can see from the photo that the coffee maker thinks it is 6:55. This is the amount of time it has gained over a months time. It has to be reset every week. An incredibly tedious task for a technology that has existed a long time and generally without issue. I wasn't aware clocks could be manufactured incorrectly these days. For a spendy product from a company with a good reputation, it is a little shocking. I've had the coffee maker for over 4 months now and just submitted a warranty request. We shall see.As far as making coffee, it does that job perfectly well. I love the reusable filter.In comparison to the Cuisinart maker it replaced, it seems subpar. And not just because of the clock. The plastic and steel materials seem very light, flimsy, and not particularly well made. Especially feel this way about the handle.I can't say I'd purchase this again. Hoping it's just a one off and the company makes it right. Will update later with result."
"I keep going back and forth between this and my French press. If I had the patience, I'd do pour-over. French press takes second place as I can brew for my wife and me relatively quickly, though cleanup is slightly messy. This is the easiest method from start to finish; however, the flavor will always be on the watery side no matter what settings you choose, and adding extra grounds to make up for that doesn't work so well. The stainless does rust, though its not too hard to clean up. Three stars for convenience!"
"Got this to replace a Klarstein that is no longer made and died, (might be the reason). This one looks nice but when setting it up I noticed that the two rear stabilizer feet have no rubber piece. So the coffee maker isnt level and wobbles front to back. I'm pretty sure it hasn't been opened before, or used. Bad quality control? I'm going to try and fit something to correct the problem. Only 3 stars for now!Update....see photo. I cut off these two fins. Now the coffee maker sits level."
I have owned a lot of drip coffee makers in the past.  This coffee maker is the most poorly designed one I have ever bought. The water tank is in the back and splits in two. They are so narrow that emptying the carafe results in water flowing into the filter and down the outside of the unit and an forces an awkward pouring method. The cover for the water tank and coffee and filter area interfers with filling the water tank as well. It needs to be more flexible so you can push it back to give better access to filling water tank. Keeping the lid off the carafe until after you fill the water tank makes it a tiny less messy. When pouring a cup of coffee the pour spout design causes coffee to leak down the side of the pot and onto the counter. I gave this coffee maker 2 stars because the best thing it has going for it is it makes hot coffee. Hotter than any other coffee maker I've had . Even after adding my creamer it is still hot.
"We had a Cuisinart coffee maker for about 8 years before it sprung a leak.  We loved it so much we bought another.  It's a good looking machine however I'm not a fan of the blue LCD screen and blue buttons (just my personal opinion).  The reason I rated 3 stars is the coffee doesn't get anywhere near as hot as my old machine - even on the highest temperature setting.  For me, I like my coffee HOT and this machine falls a little short."
"Cuisinart really missed on the design of this coffee maker. First, the carafe drips when you pour the coffee into the cup. It drips when you fill the water chamber so your filter and /or coffee gets wet. Next, when you pour the water into the water chamber you can't fit the carafe anywhere around the lid because it won't fit. So now you can't completely empty the carafe. I was so disappointed I  put coffee maker garage and purchased a different one!"
"The product arrived in a damaged box, but the coffee maker was packed well and in good condition."
"Make no mistake, this makes a great cup of coffee.But the carafe lid situation is surprisingly annoying. The lid just doesn’t fit well on the carafe. In order to use the carafe to pour water into the water well, which is how I make my morning coffee, one has to remove the entire lid. That is the lid doesn’t flip up because there’s no hinge on the handle.There’s two problems with this: one, It’s very awkward to pour the water into the water well and it’s extremely common, I’d say 80 to 90% of the time, for the water to slosh so when you’re pouring it into the water well it’s spills onto your counter or onto the coffee maker itself.Two, and this is my primary complaint, putting the lid back on the carafe is not as easy as it should be. Most of the time the lid doesn’t snap back on. That means that when you are finished brewing your pot and you go to pour a cup of coffee it pours all over the counter. So annoying.MOST annoying Is that I know about the problem and I scrutinize the lid placement every single time I make a pot of coffee. And yet, even with the scrutiny, it still doesn’t adhere  correctly and I get coffee on the counter.To me as a consumer this seems like such an easy fix. But alas I’ll have to live with it. Because again, it does make a great cup of coffee."
My husband loves it.The coffee coming is hot and strong just the way he likes it.
"This unit, I have had exact units, is very loud when making coffee"
"This is an average drip coffee maker. It does its job of making coffee and nothing further. I purchased during Prime Day for much less than the current $100 price tag. I would be disappointed if I bought it for the current price as I don’t think it’s worth $100 as it’s very basic. If it’s on sale get it, but keep shopping if it’s not."
"I wanted a non toxic coffee maker and this was considered to be one so that was my main reason for the purchase.  It had a chemical smell when it arrived so that concerned me.  The glass craft leaks when pouring. It is ok, but not sure it works any better than coffee makers half the price."
"The Cuisinart DCC-3200 makes very good coffee, is attractive, and overall is an excellent coffee maker except for one major flaw.  The clock jumps ahead by 20 minutes, 30 minutes, or even 40 minutes relatively quickly.  Being one that programs the coffee maker to brew a pot of coffee in the morning, this problem is clearly unacceptable.So far I'm about to return my second DCC-3200 to Amazon just in the past couple of weeks.  With the first unit, I noticed that the time had jumped ahead by more than 40 minutes in just a few days time.  I called Cuisinart customer service and was told to unplug the coffee maker for 30 minutes, plug it in again and reset the time.  They told me that if that didn't help, which it didn't (the time jumped ahead again), to return the coffee maker to Amazon.  I did that and ordered a second one thinking that the problem might have been a one-off.  My second one arrived yesterday.  Long story short, I encountered the same problem.  In just one day, the time jumped ahead 25 minutes.  So, I called Cuisinart again this evening.  I was on hold for a while when someone answered the phone.  When I started to explain the problem again, the call was dropped!!  So, I called again and was on hold for 50 minutes before someone answered.  Once again, I explained the problem and was again told to return the unit to Amazon.  Three times is not a charm in this case; I will not order another Cuisinart coffee maker.Take note.  I should have read the reviews for the DCC-3200 on Cuisinart's web page for this coffee maker.  There are at least a dozen comments from reviewers stating that they have had this same problem with the clock jumping ahead by tens of minutes."
This probably won’t last long. It is cheaply made.
Too big for the counter. Too tall
"I purchased our  DCC-3200W in 4/2019. At the time it was $80. Over all its made good coffee, kept coffee warm and was easy to use. For me, these are the very very basics a coffee maker should feature. However (for us) with a cost of $80+ (its now listed at $99+), Id expect it to meet more criteria- here are the problems with it:1. It leaks.. Somewhere out of the bottom every morning there is a bit of water to clean up. Its not even an 1/8 of a cup, but enough to form a small pool on the counter. This has been going on for at least a year. Nothing a quick wipe doesn't take care of, but my $25 Mr Coffee never leaked2. It is rather difficult to clean inside the water tank. I LOVE the idea of the filter and that is easy to change and manage- however because of the brew lid positioning, wiping out the 14cup tank is nearly impossible. Doing the regular cleaning option  with vinegar and cleaning setting isnt enough- it really needs to be wiped down occasionally too. You cant with this unit3. The Heating plate started flaking/rubbing off within months of getting it. I KNOW this happens with virtually all coffee makers, but I really expected more than 2 mos from this machine .4. Getting an error message erH on the display now. The manual has NO troubleshooting or error code listing, neither does Cuisinarts website. The best I can do with this error code is searching online and finding a cuisinart grill with this error code which MAYBE means ""error: too high of temp"". Who knows- and the website is no help, nor the customer service number- They want a serial number that is supposedly on the bottom of the unit- but we cant find it.I KNOW coffeemakers dont last forever, but as this has a 3 yr warranty I did expect it to make it to year 2.  And while Im grateful for the warranty (fingers crossed they honor it!), its been a real struggle to get even basic help from Cuisinart.It DOES make good coffee!! But over all, I really expected more for the cost. And with the heating error code, I dont trust it's safety, so I guess I'll be looking for another coffeemaker- since Cuisinart is dragging their feet on helping me.UPDATE: after the mystery error code above (erh)- I unplugged for 24 hours per troubleshooting ""reset"".. The unit no longer brews. I contacted customer service and they indicated based on the serial # that I purchased this unit in 2017 ... I didn't I have the receipt dated April 2019! I quote from the Cuisinart rep "" The serial number is stamped on the day you purchase- so we know you purchased this in May of 2017"" WHAT????? They are literally saying they ""stamp in the base machine plastic the day you purchase this the serial number"". Total insanity to throw your warranty out the window.  Total disappointment ..(photo 1- heating plate flaking. Photo 2: bottom of unit- water damage from leaking unit and no serial number)"
"SECOND UPDATE:  This evening I tried using the white vinegar/water mix to clean the pot out.  It would stay on clean mode for only a minute or so, then I had to keep resetting it.  After 20 minutes or so of this nonsense, I poured all the water out and attempted to run pure water through it.  NOTHING.  Not one light would go on.  The coffee maker is dead as a doornail.  No coffee tomorrow morning.  A $99 pot shot to hell for no reason I can ascertain.  I am SO disappointed in Cuisinart.  I have a Cuisinart food processor I've had for over 20 years.  It still works great.  But Cuisinart's coffeemaker doesn't stand up to the standards that have allowed my food processor to still be in wonderful condition.  Have they started making these things in China?  Has someone bought the company out and lowered their standards?  I have no idea.  I just know I'm sick at heart about having to toss this beautiful machine in the dumpster tomorrow morning.UPDATE:  In the last week, this beautiful coffee pot, which I've adored until last week, has started leaking water.  I'm in the habit of putting the coffee and water in at night and pressing the Brew button when I get up in the morning.  About a week ago, I noticed that the water level in the morning wasn't at 4-1/2; it was at 4.  I thought I'd simply misread the scale the night before.  The next morning the water was again at 4 instead of at 4-1/2.  Then I noticed that the counter where the coffee pot sits was soaking wet.  How or why it's leaking is a mystery, but I can't have my counter top soaking wet every morning, so I'm going to put the water in in the morning right before I press the Brew button.  I'll see how that works.  It seems to be a pretty slow leak otherwise all the water would be out of the pot and on the counter, so hopefully this will work to keep this beautiful pot useful.  I've also put a doubled up heavy towel beneath the pot in case my plan doesn't work.  Unfortunately, the warranty ran out back in January of 2018.  I think I'll try to contact Cuisinart about the problem.  I have no idea how good their customer service department is.I read all the reviews of this and many other coffee makers before deciding this one was the best and purchasing this coffee maker.  So far, it is.  But it's only been 2 or 3 weeks of using it.  It doesn't leak, it doesn't overflow--as some of the bad reviews have said theirs did.  I use the bold function because I like very strong coffee.  I haven't tested how well the coffee would come out not using the bold function because I'm happy with the coffee that comes out using the bold function.  The one thing I have noticed is that if you really want 6 full cups of coffee, you have to fill the water to 6 and just about a half.  Ditto for the 4 cups.  Fill the water line to 4-1/2.  I do wind up with a bit of coffee sediment on the bottom of the pot, but I'm not troubled by that because the last few ounces of coffee in the carafe I usually don't want anyway.Bottom line, this coffee maker is working very well for me.  No leakage, no overflow.  No getting coffee grinds all over the inside of the lid the way my previous coffee maker caused.  If anything goes wrong, I'll let you know.Update:  It's been a year now and the coffee pot is working very well indeed.  I still smile every morning when I hit ""Brew.""  The only thing I don't like is the ""tone"" for when it's done.  I turn that off because it's awfully high-pitched.  When I hear it, I panic for a couple of seconds thinking a smoke alarm has gone off.  Other than that, great coffee maker."
"I will say that the coffee maker I bought for work is durable, but that's about it that I like. All is surprisingly poor. It is difficult to pour water in because there is limited space. I tilt the coffee maker on an angle to do this. What matters is that it is not as good as my $20 Mr. Coffee!I Use one scoop of coffee for the Mr. Coffee. I tried using tone scoops for the one at work and t is way too weak. (And I do press the button that is supposed to make it stronger.) It also had a metallic taste for months. I found I have to use two scoops of coffee to make one mug. I am using the same water, so there is no other conclusion than this model is deeply disappointing. I wish I could trade it in for another Mr. Coffee!"
"Do you want to have to make coffee with a flashlight in one hand to see what's happening?  Do you want to have to hold the entire machine upside down and have some hit your sink, some your countertop, and some your floor every time you make a pot of coffee?  If so, this is the machine for You!  PM me and I'll send this one.This is going back. If I had a wedding invitation sitting around from people I don't like, I could use it for that, but there's no one I know who deserves this. Here's my experience. I got exactly the right grind it said to get.  Everything's a trick to see on this thing. It's my first coffee pot ever where I was sitting there for my two ""maiden voyage brews"" with a flashlight. Yep, I wheeled up a kitchen chair so I could be eye level with this marvel of post-modernist design and still couldn't see, say, the water levels without a flashlight in a very well lit kitchen. No flashlight is included, by the way, and I would say that's a real oversight with Cuisinart.I put in clear water first for a cleansing run through as recommended  -- no coffee, gold filter only. Everything seated properly as I've read from people, with a nice click to assure it's all in there properly. I put it up to the 10 cup mark, turned it on, and it does steam a lot -- I got 4 1/2 cups of water through it. The reservoir was empty -- good news from what others have said. I almost celebrated that. But don't get out the champagne flavored grounds yet if you get this far after ignoring this review and bought this thing.The gold filter was totally backed up and full of water. I've read that the logical 2 reasons for this are too fine of grounds but there were no grounds. And improperly seated part where the filter goes but it was snapped right in.  Getting that empty wasn't easy -- I had water on the countertop, sink (where I was hoping to get all of it), and even the floor.  My husband, in the next room, tried to make some small talk with me right about then. And nope, Cuisinart also forgot to include coupons for local marriage counselors.So I thought, I'll run some coffee through it aiming at 6 cups, take the gold filter out (in case that is intrinsically an issue), put a supplied paper filter in carefully, and filled the water to 8 hoping for 5 - 6 cups.  I got 4 cups barely which would be ok -- I could live with that but when I checked the reservoir, guess what?  Water all backed up in the filter just like when I ran it through with nothing but water. Still needed flashlight.  Still haven't had the nerve to hold the pot upside down again to get the coffee out of the filter area.The bottom line for me is -- I just want some decent stinking coffee. I buy really good coffee and just want a machine that won't screw that up.  I'm sorry my Mr. Coffee died. And this isn't fancy, by the way, it's just freaking difficult. I do not want to have to make coffee with a flashlight to see what happened or feel I have to turn three times to the right, stand on one foot, spit in the sink, and recite an ancient incantation praying the coffee pot does its thing.  I do not want to have to empty out a part of the machine not made for emptying out and have to mop up my countertops and floor.  I just want to push the ""on"" button and have it make coffee. Is that too much to ask?  With Cuisinart -- yes it is.  I'm just not messing with something so obnoxious. Making coffee should be easy -- hot water over ground coffee, walla.  Cuisinart has blown that simple formula.I'm heading over to a store tomorrow and grabbing the first cheap Mr. Coffee I see and I'll bet anything it will be a lot better than this.  Highly unhappy.  (And my husband didn't like the Cuisinart toaster I bought last year but I thought he was just being cranky although he's the only one of the two of us that makes toast. I'll revisit that appliance.)"
"Bigger is not always better.  We've had this 14 cup now for just over a year.  Already replaced once under warranty as the black paint on the heating pad peeled off and rusted.  We've used this second one now daily.  The inner grounds basket is no longer staying locked in place.  On this unit there's a little locking arm, gizmo, to hold the bigger basket it place.  The sneak a cup plunger requires the basket to be held firmly otherwise the carafe lid does not work that plunger properly.  If not held firmly in place the plunger just lifts up with basket so it doesn't fully open when the carafe is in place.That little arm has weakened and not longer engages with the inner underside of the maker.I've contacted Cuisinart for a replacement basket.  This is a design flaw however.  I don't recall this little arm gizmo thing on the 12 cups we had for years.  The arm gizmo piece if not very thick.  This is a hot area.  Day in and day out heat.......  It will sooner or later lose its tension.It could be the opening through which is slides and is suppose to engage, its a little lip you can see underneath where the carafe lives and where the plunger fits through, is also problematic.  That could be fatiguing as well.  Appears at this point to be the plunger on the grounds basket to me.  Its lip, tension, etc.,all flimsy.Picture of that little arm gizmo piece on the basket and how its fatigued, and the engaging lip/locking lip has lost its edge.Hopefully Cuisinart will send a new basket and I'll test my theory......We had the 12 cup for a very long time.  Never had a problem with paint peeling on the warming pad nor with the inner basket not holding firm.  May go back to a 12 cup model.Feb 2018 update.Well I'm on my second coffee maker.  Second one doing same thing as the first.  I don't care if the paint stays on the heating pad.  Its paint and it gets hot.  Its going to come off.  The problem is once it comes off the thing starts RUSTING.  See attached.Feb 2018.  Cuisinart did step up again and is replacing mine.  There is something wrong with this paint bonding.  Hopefully they've addressed it........."
Purchased the coffee maker in October of 2021. On December 3rd of 2024. The coffee maker quit working. It has always been kept clean both inside and out. Paid nearly $90 for it. We are a two person household. It should have lasted longer than three years. Not worth the money. Made decent coffee while it lasted.
"I purchased this unit because i owned its predecessor for about 10 years.  I replaced that one only because it was knocked off the counter into the sink while it was being cleaned & some of the functions did not work properly after that.  I figured the thing didn't owe me anything after 10 years & they weren't really designed to go bouncing around the kitchen, so no harm, no fowl.  Time to replace.The first odd thing when i unpacked the new unit & got it cleaned/set up for use was that i noticed that the measurement gradients for the reservoir & the carafe were off.  I measured the coffee out as i had for the prior 10 years, filled the reservoir to the same point that i had in the prior 10 years, used the same cup that i used for the prior 10 years, & came up with an extra 2 OZ of coffee.  I figured, well, that's annoying but easy enough to compensate for - movin' on.So now, 3 years later, i notice that there is some build-up on the warmer plate.  It's in a somewhat dark spot on the counter, so i did not notice it sooner.  I got a warm, soapy sponge & started to clean it.  It wasn't long before i realized this wasn't going anywhere.  I scratched the buildup w/my finger nail & smelled it.  Sure enough, not coffee but oxidized metal.  Not a happy camper.All of the other functionality is still there & it still makes great coffee, but Cuisinart can do better on a $100 coffee maker.  HARM + FOUL = DEAL BREAKER.  How long before this thing rusts through & shorts out, maybe creates a fire hazard?  I rarely write a review, but this is a solid NOT RECOMMENDED.  I'll be replacing this unit with something else.  Also - called Cuisinart.  They do not stand by their products.Good luck, folks..."
"1st off, I does make rich, dark HOT coffee.However, this is a really old style drip brewer. Very cumbersome. The filter basket grip could be better. Make a better basket retrieval handle.The reservoir that holds the cold water for brewing has a very small opening in the back corner so you have to have the brewer pulled completely out in the open. Very small opening to pour 14 cups of water. So many things need to be done this brewer to update it. Very old style. Not happy. Gave 2 stars because it does make and hold HOT coffee wglhich I love!!!"
"I thought I'd get a better quality product but the  Cuisinart name didn't live up to my expectation.  The product is just okay but the customer service and warranty just isn't there.  My clock has never worked properly, runs fast and unless I want to reset it everyday the autobrew feature is pointless.  It's loud, like really loud while brewing. I reached out to the manufacturer since it's only just been more than the Amazon return window.  Their solution,  sure we'll replace it but you need to cut the cord, send a picture of the cord,and then wait 2 weeks for us to send a new one.  GtFO. So you have a bad product and now I have to trust you'll send me a better one.  No way.  I had a Hamilton beach last me 5 years with NO issues. Save your money and get something with better company backing.Edit: They did come through with a replacement without the craziness but I would still look for a better product."
"It makes coffee just fine except for one thing. The ready tone will not work. I have tried it with the button in the on and the off setting but nothing. This is the 3re cuisinart coffee maker I have been through in about 2 weeks. Got the other 2 from walmart. So, I will keep this one just because I'm tired of having to swapping them to find one that the ready tone works. I'm sure there is a way to make it work but don't know what it is. Do you have any info on that? If so please let me know."
"For the price point of this coffee maker, considering my last Cuisinart one that I had before this one was a red color that was mostly a stainless steel body, I was expecting and read in the product description of this one that this one would also have a mostly stainless/metal body, even though it was colored.  It is entirely made of plastic… I mean all of it!  It looks like matte plastic when you see the “umber” color in person.  I’m very disappointed and debating sending it back considering how expensive it was.  I can’t speak to the durability as I just received it… just disappointing to wait 4 days for a new coffee maker to show up and it not make me happy since it looks cheap and the umber color is a blaw tan/bronze color."
"Makes coffee well. Which isn't saying much, as making coffee is super easy. Really all you do is spray hot water on top of a filter filled with grounds; not that complicated.But the way coffee makers work, pressure pumps the steam up into the showerhead. There, it condenses and rains back down upon the coffee grounds. This all works great.Until you open the lid.Condensed water droplets accumulate on the lid during the brewing process. The way this lid is designed, when you open it, those droplets drop down the back of the machine, onto the counter - Sometimes directly over the incoming electric wire!It's a minor inconvenience, but a recurrent one. Built right into the design of the lid's catchment system. Most of the droplets seem to funnel back into the reservoir, but not all. You just have to wipe off the back of the machine and the counter every time you use it.I live in a humid climate, this may be related.Also, I rated 1 star in the ""easy to clean"" category. Do not interpret this to mean it's harder to clean than most coffee makers. In fact, what I mean to say is that ALL coffee makers are hard to clean. Over the course of a year or two, mold will accumulate in the reservoir. You have to clean it out, I think  with some descaling process, but I don't relish the thought of pouring vinegar or chemicals into my coffee machine.I think that's why they make these things so cheap; people just buy a new one every year or two."
"This coffee maker looks nice on the counter, and makes a reasonable cup of coffee. That is pretty much the extent of it's virtues.Design-wise this coffee maker is completely disappointing due to 3 extremely poor choices made by Cuisinart:1) Reservoir fill location - The reservoir sits within the same compartment as the coffee basket. This would not be a problem if the carafe spout was able to effectively pour water, but stay tuned for #2.2) Carafe spout - This is possibly the shallowest pour spout I have ever seen on any product. It will only permit the thinnest trickle of water, any more and it overflows the front of the pot to pour water all over the counter. If you have a full 14 cups of water in the carafe this shallow angle means you will have to start your pour from high up, causing additional spilled water when you don't perfectly align the stream with the small reservoir opening. Since the reservoir is in the same location as the grounds basket this also means water will slop into the basket, and then drain onto the heat plate area making a further mess.3) Carafe lid - The lid is not physically attached to the rest of the coffee pot, it just sits on top like a cookie jar lid. In order to use the carafe to get water to fill the reservoir you will have to remove the lid to fill the pot. It's very easy to forget to reattach the lid before putting it back into the maker. If the lid is missing it will not open the spring-loaded valve to let coffee drain from the basket area, causing the basket area to overflow boiling hot coffee once you turn it on. As an added bonus, when you realize this and put the lid back on, the basket will drain into the carafe faster than the small opening allows. Your coffee will overflow the sides of the carafe and down into the heat plate. All of this would be avoided if the lid was attached to the carafe with a hinge like in every other coffee maker.I had high hopes for this device based on the quality of a few other Cuisinart items I own, but sadly it's just a rebranded $40 plastic Mr Coffee with a steel veneer glued on."
"The filter holder goes in strangely.  You must force it into place before putting the filter basket in - if not, the spring release underneath will not open and you will have coffee all over.  It does overflow on a regular basis anyway - I can't recommend this one.  The water needs to drain better.  I think it was designed by lawyers with government regulations in mind rather than coffee drinkers.  You will find better choices. My advice is to keep looking."
"Easy to use, coffee is excellent and the hot feature is great however after only having this item for 4 months the clock started losing time.  When we programmed the brew for 5 am we found that the coffee had already shut off.  We reset the time and by evening it was off by almost an hour.  So having defects with Cuisinart is not unusual.  This is our 3rd Cuisinart coffee maker and will be our last.  Their customer support is non existent and if you don’t purchase an extended warranty you are basically stuck with a defective item."
I just received this and am preparing to make my first pot of coffee when I see this on the top. It feels like something hot melted the spot.  I'm disappointed.
Within 6 months of purchase. The yellow helmetfaded on the top of the helmet. Too much sun?Truly disappointed!
"We had our old Cuisinart 14 cup brewer for eleven years.  It worked great.  Just got old and was hard to clean after years of use.  So, we decided to go with this one - looked the same.  It is a piece of JUNK.  STAY AWAY from it. WE RETURNED IT.  It will make coffee, BUT other than that, this thing will be a paperweight on your counter.  READ the other reviews about the clock and the filter basket/anti-drip design, and you will see why I'm warning you to STAY AWAY - FAR AWAY.  I'm surprised Cuisinart puts their name on something with these TWO HUGE FLAWS:FLAW 1. The clock GAINS like 3 to 5 minutes every day or so.  If you plan on setting the coffee program timer, you'll need to change the time and then see what it ""really is"" at the time you desire it to start.  Oh, and you'll need to make that calculation daily.  We wanted the timer to start the coffee in the morning, NOT force us to calculate a daily math problem with WHAT TIME will this clock be at!!!  I'M AMAZED THAT IN 2023 YOU WOULD SHIP A PRODUCT WITH SUCH CHEAP, FAULTY ELECTRONICS!!  C'mon guys - a digital clock that CAN'T KEEP TIME??????  IN 2023!!!!!!!!!!!!FLAW 2. The filter basket and the little anti-drip ball is a PITA.  On our old pot, you just put the basket in, put the filter in, put the coffee in, and start brewing.  On this one, if you DO NOT PUSH THE BASKET DOWN FIRMLY before you start the brewing, (you will hear it click) the little rubber valve on the bottom of the filter basket ""may"" remain closed, and what you'll get is a wet mess on your countertop. AND, don't even dare to try that trick where you ""Pull"" the pot out to poor a quick cup while it's brewing and then put it back to finish up!!  If you do, you will have a mess!!  Although this pot states it has this ""Anti-Drip"", ""Auto Pause"" feature while brewing, it does not. - At least it doesn't have it where it works cleanly or properly.So, we just had to return this thing.  PLEASE be aware of that second flaw with the filter basket or you WILL be cleaning up a lot of messes.  Hard to see how their last 14 cup model could keep time and drop the coffee in the actual pot with ease, and this one has these ""issues""....."
"Brewed great for almost 6 months (purchased at the end of February 2024). Then it stopped brewing full pots of coffee. I keep up with cleaning the coffee maker and that still didn't keep it working. Customer service said they would send a return label to my email in 24 to 48 business hours. In a day and age where you can send an email to the other side of the planet in just a few seconds, Cuisinart can't send a return label to my email for 24 to 48 hours. Then I must box the unit and bring it to UPS. Of course that is to be expected, but what was not was the fact that I must then wait until they receive the unit until they send the replacement. Which I have to add will take an additional 7 to 10 business days. Ridiculous that in today's world that I must wait for so long to get this remedied. Of course when I try to bring up my dissatisfaction, I am advised that a manager will listen to my complaint and take what I said under advisement.  Not happy at all. So hard to find a decent coffee maker that will actually last. Most definitely almost impossible to find a company that cares about their customers who will go above and beyond to make a wrong, right."
"After our older Cuisinart wore out, we purchased this model on Amazon's strong recommendation.  What a mistake.It is very hard to poor from the carafe as it spills very easily even with a steady hand. We end up pouring over the kitchen sink because of this.The red cleaning light comes on more often than it should and sometimes leaks.There is no way to dim or turn off the light and it is pretty bright at night. It would be great if you need a night which we do not need.We are in the market again because this particular model has become a real pain. We cannot recommend this particular model in good conscious."
"We bought a Cuisinart coffeemaker in 2018, and just replaced it with the same model in 2024. We saw many of the issues that other reviews pointer out, but we got another Cuisinart. Why? Well, reviews indicate that cheaper ones seemed to fail quickly, and more expensive ones also failed in the six year life that we got from our mid- range coffeemaker. Now we know what to do to prolong its useful life, and at moderate cost. Maybe we will get 6 years again.So far, it seems better than our earlier Cuisinart- it flags when cleaning is needed, and it drips less, and like the older one, it isn’t all plastic."
"Not a bad coffee maker, comes out very hot and all but the filter is smaller then my 12 cup coffee maker, so if you do the math and put the right amount of grounds in the filter it overflows and puts grounds and muck in your coffee. If you only want to brew 10 cups this works fine but I bought it for the amount of coffee I could brew."
"I bought this along with the coffee grinder made by the same company.  At first I thought I was going to like this and return the grinder. But the opposite has come to pass.  I'm about to return this coffeemaker and keep the grinder.  I thought Cuisinart was the expert on coffee.  They've had all this time to perfect a coffeemaker and they haven't.First of all, it's sloppy.  If you prematurely pull out the pot while it's brewing, the coffeemaker is supposed to stop (and does).  But only after some coffee spills and sputters onto the hot plate.  Also, the coffee pours through the white top of the coffee pot, which stains the top.  But don't worry, you're gonna love cleaning up that unnecessary coffee mess every day.Second of all, it's dishonest.  Who came up with the measurement for a cup of coffee?  It's certainly NOT the quantity that a real person drinks. If you make (supposedly) four cups of coffee, you'll barely have enough to drink on your own.Third of all, back to the sloppy part.  If you don't remember to remove the grounds after you've brewed your coffee, water will condense in the coffeemaker and eventually water droplets will begin to appear on the inside face of the clock.Finally, let's talk about coffee brewing.  Along with this coffeemaker and the grinder, I bought some very expensive beans. (The ones recommended by Consumer Reports, in case you're interested).  Although I experimented with many different grinds (from course to extra fine), I could never bring out the full flavor of those expensive beans.  And then it hit me: I was using a drip coffeemaker.As I'm writing this, I have ordered three coffee percolators.  I had to order three because the quality of products sold to Americans is so pathetic, the only hope I have of finding a good percolator is to try out three of what seem to be the best, find the good one and then send the other two back.Which reminds me of another point.  With this coffeemaker, you're brewing your coffee in and through plastic.  I would prefer to percolate my coffee in metal.  (I was hoping to find a glass and metal percolator but they don't seem to exist on Amazon.  Only glass and plastic).Our parents (or grand parents if you're younger) had it right.  Why are these drip coffeemakers so ubiquitous?  Because people who don't appreciate good coffee want their brew in a hurry.  Well, haste makes waste.  I have come to realize that a good, rich cup of coffee requires time and love to produce.The type of person who freshly grinds their coffee beans is never going to use the automated timer feature of this coffeemaker.  I have come to realize that drip coffeemakers are for a certain type of coffee drinker.  If you drink store bought ground coffee and you don't mind leaving the grounds out overnight before the coffee is made, this coffeemaker is the cat's meow.On the other hand, if you're the type of person who eschews the rat race, the type of person who appreciates and deserves a full-bodied, rich-flavored cup of coffee, then you will save yourself a lot of time by passing on this model and investigating the percolator section of Amazon.  I don't know why it took me so long to figure this out.  Perhaps we're more influenced by others than we imagine.Whatever it is, I've come to realize that when it comes to coffee, our ancestors did it best.  Indeed, when everything is said and done, there's no school like old school."
"I bought this as a replacement for my high-end Krups (forget the model number) whose warming plate died.  It was approximately a year and a half old.  I had a 12-cup Cuisinart ""Extreme Brew"" coffee maker a few years ago, which was more solidly built and the coffee was a lot hotter.  This DCC-3200 is not hot enough for me to stop microwaving a few seconds (43-45 seconds) after using real cream.  I don't want coffee that is going to burn my mouth, but I should not have to microwave it.  This machine is lightweight.  I have to hang onto it while pouring water into it.  I did not have to do that with my recent Krups.  The warming plate keeps automatically going for two hours.  I had to call Cuisinart about that because that is not shown on the display.  The rep told me that to change it, you'd have to hold the brew button for a couple of seconds.  (It doesn't say that in the manual).  I also like a coffee maker to beep when the brewing is finished.  I've read comments on coffee makers that I owned where they complained that the beeping was too loud and bothered a migraine sufferer.  I would think, ""Yeah, right.""  Well, I'm warning you that this beeping is very loud.  Like louder than a fire alarm.  I'm serious.  It really scared my cat.  I had to turn it off.  Nevertheless, I would recommend this coffee maker if you really need the 14-cup capacity.  Otherwise, the 12-cup models would be easier to manage.  Well, maybe not.  The reason is that 12-cup models do not have the capacity for the amount of coffee that you have to use (in my experience).  It creates a situation of a small amount of coffee grounds getting into the finished pot of coffee.I do like the backlit display.  That's another thing that went wrong with that Krups.  The information on the display disappeared.  I guess that the LED/LCD light fades away somehow.  This machine looks very nice on my countertop."
"I've had this unit for about a month now and here are my observations. In terms of Technology, it has everything you would need. And easy to set clock and timer and the ability to change the strength of the coffee or Brew less than five cups at the touch of a buttonThe two issues I have with the coffee maker of this. First, where you have to pour the water into the reservoir, is actually quite challenging. The way the lid flips up it Slips Away from the front of the machine towards the back yet that's exactly where you need to pour in the water. So if you're not careful it's quite easy to spill water all over your counter or get it in the coffee grinds basket.The other complaint I have is the coffee pot that it comes with. This unit is nearly $100 and I'm extremely disappointed that it came with such a cheap coffee carafe. The lid on this thing is made of thin flimsy plastic. And it seems the heat from the actual coffee maker has worked it over time. Now it is quite difficult to snap on properly.And where the plastic handle meets the glass carafe, water has now seat in between the handle and the carafe so sometimes it just drips randomly. Also the lip around the top of the coffee pot is made of plastic. And water also gets trapped underneath there. So you need to be careful to dried upside down, then flip it over and try it right side up so all the water drips out of the lid off the coffee pot.In the scheme of things, these might be minor things to you. But they're annoying says that a $100 coffee pot shouldn't have. Next time Cuisinart should make the plastic on the coffee carafe pick her so it does not work and make the handle that is affixed to the glass carafe better so water does not get in the back there. Also it would be helpful if the place to fill the water was on the side instead of the back of the unit so that I could get a picture or cop with water in there a lot easier. Still, it does make good coffee and the feature to set the hold temperature of the carafe is nice."
"I bought one of these in April 2021 and found it to be a good basic coffeemaker.  However, in Jan. or Feb. 2023 it completely stopped working.  I contacted the company and as the unit was still under warranty, they replaced it with an identical one which I received in Feb. 2023.  However, last week (about July 10, 2024) the clock quit working and on July 14 the entire thing stopped working.  I contacted the company again but this time they said the warranty was now expired so they would not replace the unit.  The best they could offer was a 20% discount on a new coffeemaker.  I declined and told the rep that I didn't want to take another chance on a Cuisinart after one quit in less than two years and another in less than 18 months.  Question to readers:  is it unrealistic to expect a coffeemaker to last longer than that?  Purchase this with caution."
"We enjoyed the coffee made by this and it was pretty easy to use. However, we have had it for about 14 months and it has started badly leaking.Taste and brewing capacity were great, but durability is not."
"This is the third unit I have purchased over the past several years.  It's a basic coffee maker that does a good job, for a while.However, the burner unit has a flaw.  It is essentially painted 'pot metal' welded to the water heating element below. I know, I disassembled one.  No matter how diligent you are in cleaning the burner surface, the paint soon wears away, and the pot metal first starts to rust badly and then soon crumbles.These units have a 2-year warranty, and Black and Decker is very good about replacing them, after you pay nominal shipping.  A date code is stamped on the prongs of the electrical plug.  They require you to cut the plug off and email them a close-up image of the code as a part of the exchange.It's a decent coffee maker.  I just wish they would use stainless steel for the burner.Update:  I quarter-folded a sheet of foil and bent the corners to make an octagon.  I placed this on top of the burner to protect it from coffee spills.  It seems to be working quite well to minimize wear and tear on the burner surface."
"After years of using only Mr. Coffee, low end to middle of the road models, this is different.  I chose itbecause with my very hard water, I did not want some ""permanent"" filter system.  I also happen to ownmany of the basket style paper filters.  This model has a removeable filter basket that uses the  flat bottom basket style of paper filter.The carafe has markings that do not agree with the side of the machine when it says 12 the machine says 10.  I like the carafe for pouring well and having a very comfortable handle.The on  switch turns on a green light, that is obvious, assuming you are not standing too far to the side.The clear panel to see the amount of water are only on the right side which for me is a problem.  This make no sense because the most open side to pour the water is on the left.  Where my coffee machine is located it is very hard to see the right side. I'm used to makers with water viewing ports on both sides.  Being black in color, in a dimly lit early morning kitchen, the water level when looking down inside is impossible to see.The next negative seems like a major design flaw.  The lid collects FAR more condensation and moisture than any Mr. Coffee I've owned.  The lid has no lip or inside rim to sit down into the reservoir as my Mr. Coffee had.  ALL the water on this lid runs out the back, down the machine and ontothe counter top!  I have found a partial solution, which is to crack the lid the night before and let someevaporate overnight.  It is not a perfect solution however.The next negative is,  unlike Mr. Coffee where there is a rotating arm that holds that basket down, the only thing holding this basket down is the lid.  It has a bit of a molded in catch  but I am sure if and when the lid warps from heat, it is unlikely it will catch.While the grab a cup pause feature is designed to work via a spring on the bottom of the filter basket, this one does not work as well as all the Mr. Coffee ones did.  This one always drops coffee on the hot plate to sizzle and burn on.  Not coolI probably would not buy this again."
"Is a standard coffee maker. nice setup. I got this so i can use any coffee grounds and dont need to get high end custom espresso cups or keurig cups or whatever, every time. (sooo expensive to do that and it gives such little grounds that last so short!!) also i like how you can decide how much coffee you want or get, and what you do with it after. once your grounds are used up you can choose to compost them. I can use them for the garden fertilizer (neat trick for those green thumb homebodies out there)."
"I’ve used the Black & Decker coffee maker for five months now and agree that it brews coffee like the Mr. coffee does with basically the same process. But I do need to say that the grab-a-cup of coffee feature on the Black & Decker always lets coffee drip down onto the heater element below, where the Mr. coffee coffee maker rarely would drip coffee onto the heater element below. Another difference is that when closing the lid, the Mr. coffee version of this was much easier to position to get it to close properly, where the Black & Decker requires a little bit more fiddling.I guess that’s all to say that I think the Mr. coffee is easier to use and doesn’t drip coffee onto the heating element below and this Black & Decker version doesn’t really do anything better, but only the same as the Mr. coffee.I’m contemplating just throwing away this Black & Decker basic coffee maker and just getting another Mr. coffee since I like the Mr. coffee version better."
"If you need a cheap coffee maker this one is hard to beat.  But it's average at brewing good coffee.I'd had several of the same top-rated Bellas for some years, and they no longer make that model.  So I tried a top rated Cuisinart-- mediocre coffee.  Same with the faux-Brauns from China (nothing like the old Aromasters from Germany I've had for years.  I just wanted a good, basic machine for under $100 that made good coffee.The Black+Decker isn't it, but frankly it's as good as the ones costing 3 times as much.  So I kept it and when I finally found one I really liked I kept it as a spare."
"I'm trying to get away from a Keurig and go back to basics with the Black and Decker, but we haven't quite found our way back yet..the one oz. difference between this machine and the recommended amount of water and grounds needs some further work, but it's only been a few weeks..I'm trying using Chock full of nuts and Kirkland Columbian Dark Roast..we'll get there...the machine is good, if not we have an unopened Cuisinart 14 cup!"
"Have two things I didn’t like about this coffee maker, the filter holder has to be in just the right spot for the lid to close completely and even though I use just enough coffee grounds to cover the bottom of the filter, there’s always a bunch of grounds that end up in the pitcher.Overall, it’s okay for the price, but honestly I’d spend a little more to buy a better one."
"We bought this earlier on in 2024 and eventually replaced it with another coffee machine (Ninja, also bought on Amazon).A few months after we bought the machine, a plastic piece broke which was supposed to hold the spring in place. After the piece was broken, basically the coffee would continue to drip when the glass pot was not in place. We continued using it for a bit.The flavor was not super consistent."
So it worked wonderfully but it’s hard to fill with water. I ended up spilling water on the front while filling it and now it’s fried and I can’t program it anymore. I had it 2 months
"Nice coffee pot but I feel like it doesn’t make very hot coffee. It’s just luke warm and I like my coffee hot, I’ve had to microwave my coffee to get it hot"
"The filter basket does not sit well in basket holder. The lid was very hard to open, and it's cheap. This is a step down for Black and Decker."
The measurements are totally off.  I measure 2 cups of water and the fill line goes to 2 1/2 cups and the glass fills to 4 cups.
"One problem, it will be trial and error with the amount of coffee you use so you get the flavor you desire"
For the price it's an decent coffe maker. Sometimes it won't start  brewing until I smack it around a lil.
"Nice little coffeemaker but.... No matter what, still hot or after cooled, when lid is lifted to remove basket with grounds, the condensation that collects on underside of lid goes down the back and sides of maker then all over counter. So if you don't mind mopping up the counter a bit after every use, this is a ok buy for price."
"It works. It makes coffee just fine.However, there are many small things that are annoying. And that is all they are - annoying things...You have to snap the top lid closed to brew coffee.The coffee grounds basket never sits in nice and straight.The lid to the carafe is awkward to take off. You feel like you are going to break it every time.When you lift the top lid, there is so much condensation, it spills over the back of the coffee maker all over the counter top if you don't open it slowly.Again...it makes coffee. It works. It is just has these annoyances that you have to deal with on a daily basis."
"This was to replace a coffee maker that started leaking water at the bottom.  This had great reviews, so I bought it.There's so much condensation under the lid after you make a pot, that lifting it - even hours later- causes a good amount of water to run down the back onto the counter.  This was worse than what I had.When you pull the pot out to ""pause"" the drip, it still drips a good amount on the warming surface.It's a little bit awkward trying to line up the pot with the drip when you are putting it back in, and it's hard to know when it's lined up right.  I'd have coffee spilling down the side, so that was telling me it wasn't lined up.  Shouldn't be that hard.Pouring water into the reservoir  is also a little awkward.  Easy to hit the edges if you don't have a steady hand.  When it's 5 a.m. and I'm pouring water I don't want to have to be exact in the placement.The water dripping down the back when you lift the lid seems like a design issue.PROS - Coffee tastes fine and it's inexpensive."
I gave this to my Mom so it’s not my everyday machine.  It’s not expensive so you get what you pay for.  I use two filters and twice the amount of coffee to get a decent cup.  The basket fit is clumsy and not well designed. Spend more money on a better unit.
"Brews really quick and super easy to clean. My only con is that It only stays on for 2 hours. It will reheat the pot relatively quickly, but I would prefer if it stayed on for 4 hours like my old one. I guess it was my fault for not throughly reading the description"
"Great for the price and does everything it should, my only complaint is the coffee is nuclear hot.  I enjoy a hot cup of coffee but when an entire ice cube can melt in less than 20 seconds and you still can't drink the coffee it is a bit too hot."
We ordered two of these nice coffee makers because we’ve had them before and they brew nicely. We need two for the holidays to always keep fresh coffee brewing.One coffee maker is functioning great but the other new one went electronically bizerk. The settings wouldn’t hold the functions and after three minutes the digital numbers all turned to vertical and horizontal lighted lines racing across the display panel 🙃🥴😵‍💫.
"The coffee maker look like used,very disappointed"
"All features work just fine. The overfill hole in the back is the product of a bored designer wanting to inflict evilness? After water pouring out the back the first time you fill the coffee pot like any other normal human, your learn to not fill the pot so much. Then i noticed the coffee taste was stronger then i preferred meaning this thing was a 12 pot coffee pot making sure you didn't dare try to sneak in an extra cup or two. I mean the nerve of some people, right? Why make the pot capable of holding more than the reservoir?  One day after dumb ol me filled the pot normally again and soaked the countertop, i put a piece of tape over the offending overfill hole. Now its works like its supposed to, and i can go back to my prefered grind measuring device. I'm talking about filling to 1"" or more from the lip, not to the brim. Filled just like you have always seen a pot filled."
"My cat could knock this off the counter, the machine is made of cheap plastic. Expected more from Black & Decker! I only use this for family events not for every day so I'll keep it.  Also, you have to line up the stream/basket exactly otherwise you will have a coffee flood (I learned this). Not just slide the coffee carafe in place and you're good to go.  Nope, double and triple check that all lines up! Again would return if I used this every day."
The coffee maker was great for two or three weeksThen after a month started to leak as the coffee brewedNow it’s normal for the coffee maker to brew 10 cups and spits out 2 cups from below the coffee maker.  Daily we get 10 cups of coffee and a wet countertopMakes weird popping noises when the water starts leaking from the bottomUnsure if it’s a product flaw or a mishap during manufacturing… nonetheless I wish I would’ve purchased a nicer product
"Easy to program, but it’s so noisy! Clunks and sputters likes it’s a piece of big equipment. So if you’re very noise conscious, and setting the timer for 4am and it’s not right by a bedroom, it’s fine. Doesn’t bother my husband, he can sleep through a freight train. Scared the crud outta me the first time I heard it, not anymore."
I wanted to be more environmentally friendly and get away from those plastic pods.  This coffee pot is ok...serves the purpose.  I would not suggest brewing more than 6 cups.  Flimsy but look at the price so understandable
"Works ok but I think the auto shut off is too quick.  It only keeps coffee hot for 2 hours after brewing.  So when I brew coffee early for work, it's cold by time anyone else gets up."
"For the price I didn’t expect much especially the way things are made now a days but this coffee maker, used daily, lasted only 11 months.  My prior machine lasted 5 years.  Disappointed"
While this product is priced very reasonably it had some issues.  The aggravating was that the carafe dripped every time while pouring into a cup. I donated it to goodwill and made another purchase.
"I’ve used Black and Decker coffee pots for many years and had stopped shopping other brands because of how pleased I was. I ordered a new one that looked like what I had, but it wasn’t and I didn’t know until past the return date. You cannot remove the carafe top for this model so that it can be washed in DW and it’s difficult trying to hand wash with an unremovable top. There is a stain in the bottom of the carafe that will not come out so maybe I got a used product? The carafe never looks clean with handwashing and I try! It holds on to moisture inside the water well so I have to prop up the top for it to dry out and it takes hours. The coffee tastes okay but the inconvenience is a headache. Not a good beginning to any day. I’ll be pitching this one soon and getting another brand. One other thing: it states in Instructions if there are any problems to please call the company. I did. No concern shown whatsoever."
Just functional - but good hot coffee.  Basket does not fit tightly.  Auto shut off is best feature.
The spring loaded stopper in the basket broke after less than 6 months of use.
"Bought this almost 2 years ago and it’s done what it’s supposed to do. About 6 months ago it started leaking water from underneath so we find a puddle of water under the front pretty much daily. Overall, it completes the assignment. This is also a replacement so I’ll likely look at a different brand next time."
"I had decently high hopes for this coffee maker, as it was purchased to replace my (seemingly) comparable Mr. Coffee coffee maker. This not only comes nowhere close to the quality of my Mr. Coffee coffee maker, but I have nothing but negative things to say about it. Not a single positive comment, other than that it made coffee.Here are the issues I had:- Shoddy assembly was the first issue I noticed - the basket filter did not even sit in place. It's as if it was made for a completely different coffee maker. You almost have to force the lid down to keep it in place because the basket continuously moves around and does not fit in the designated grooves.- The noise! This thing is loud and makes the most obnoxious ""bubbly steaming"" sounds I have ever heard from a coffee maker. The noise echoed throughout my entire house, to the point where my friend came out to ask if it was broken. I wish.- The entire product is made from the same cheap plastic you would expect from something on Temu. Poorly assembled and did not come with a reuseable filter basket.- Lastly, the coffee itself - the drip process is as poorly designed as you can imagine, as it continuously overflowed the basket and got loose grounds in my coffee every time. Seriously, it looked like there was a brown ""glaze"" sitting on top of each cup I poured.Stay away from this coffee maker. For $30, I expected a decent coffee maker at the very least, but this thing was returned as soon as I made a cup in my old, broken, and leaking Mr. Coffee coffee maker. The difference is remarkable, and not in a good way.Bad product."
"This brews coffee so fast and is very easy to read with the bright digital display. It makes a good cup of coffee. However, the basket doesn't sit flat when the carafe is in the coffee maker, making it to where the lid won't go down without some maneuvering and wiggling on your part. Also, the basket has a handle on it that sits to the right, the same side where you have to pour in the water, so it hits the handle if you're not careful and splashes a little bit. Whoever designed that was not thinking at all.  Other reviewers have said how very loud the coffee maker is, but I didn't find that at all. It was just the same as my last coffee maker. It has a delayed timer on it so you can set it up to make coffee the next morning, so that's nice. One more thing, my last coffee maker would ""ding"" when the coffee was ready, this one does not do that.  You can just kind-of hear when it's done. Overall it's a good basic coffee maker."
"This is a decent coffee maker, however I bought it to replace a very old Mr. Coffee machine, and find it to be a downgrade in some ways.1) It's much noiser for some reason, and while brewing it sounds like the machine is going to break or something, when really it's just operating normally. I wondered what it was doing other than heating up some water and sending it through a spout.2) Opening the lid to pour water in requires two hands. That's annoying if you're already holding the water in your other hand, and you have to set it down to open up the lid.3) Putting the carafe back in the coffee maker is also tricky with one hand, though it is possible.4) If you have the carafe in place, the cup where the coffee grounds go does not sit flat, it tilts all over the place while you're trying to pour the coffee grounds in. Just kind of annoying.Other than that, it's pretty much a basic coffee maker and works fine. But it's not the seamless experience that I was used to."
"After a month of use, here are our impressions regarding this coffeemaker.First the good: the coffee it makes is flavorful and is kept at the proper serving temperature.Now the not so good: this unit is very lightweight, to the point that upon use it scoots around on the counter. The coffeemaker is short enough to fit on top of the counter and under the wall cabinets. However, it has to be slid forward in order to lift the top to access the filter basket and add the water. The top cover locks down onto the unit and the ""steal a cup"" feature secures the carafe so tightly that it's not possible to remove the carafe without using the other hand to stabilize the base in order to disengage the pot from the unit.in short, we wish we had our old Mr. Coffee back! There are better choices."
"I bought this coffee maker 2 years ago and I have to say I'm a bit disappointed. The glass carafe is fragile as all get up. I never dropped it or bumped it- but either way, the blasted thing cracked a couple days ago. I never been one to abuse glassware, but this is next level special. I had a funny feeling about how shoddy the carafe was at the time of unboxing.Thankfully I had saved the glass carafe from the $5 Dollar General impulse purchase I got some 6 years ago that had died at the time of the purchase of THIS coffee maker- just in case. Well, my gut feeling proved right. So right now the main machine works as intended, but I'm using the glass carafe from a $5 DG coffee maker that's ironically far superior in terms of toughness and longevity."
"Very disappointed.After over 10 years our simple Mr. Coffee drip coffee maker finally quit working. It was simple and had all the features we enjoyed – it was relatively quiet when brewing. The filter basked for paper filters fit only one way and was obvious when not seated correctly.  The opening where the water needed to fill the reservoir was larger enough to easily fill the reservoir with the carafe. It had a little beep when the coffee was finished brewing – our favorite feature.  It had a little beep when the coffee had sat for 2 hours and turned off automatically.  It had a stronger brew option. It was programmable for turning it on. The numbers on the carafe were easy to read. When the lid was raised the steam moisture would drain only back into the reservoir, not onto the counter.After all these years and probably millions of drip coffee makers that have been manufactured, they still have NOT figured out how to make one right for the average daily coffee drinker.  First the filter basket is so loose inside the top of the unit it doesn’t even appear to be the right part for the coffee maker. If the basket is not perfectly placed on top of the carafe lid the valve to release the hot coffee will not open and the inside will flood over with coffee grounds.  Number 2 – when the lid is lifted after a brew the moisture from the steam runs down the outside back of the unit and onto the counter.  Number 3 – the numbers on the decanter are very small and difficult to read. Number 4 – the tab on the filter basket sticks out into the area where you pour the water into the reservoir, so I have to pour it very precisely or the water hits the stab and splashes all over.  Number 5 – it makes loud brewing sounds due to the thin plastic design. Number 6 - It does not have any option for brew strength. Number 7 - It doesn’t beep when coffee is finished brewing and no beep when it shuts off after 2 hours. It appears whoever is designing these coffee makers does not actually use them.I will happily pay for the extra cost of the features that I believe would make using a drip coffee maker every day more enjoyable.  I have drunk coffee for over 60 years."
"I would rate this coffee maker better if it didn't have one big flaw.  Every pot comes with grounds in it! For whatever reason the coffee always has grounds in it. Either it runs faster than the filter cup can handle or the filter cup valve on the bottom doesn't open enough.  You lose a cup (or more) of good coffee each pot unless you are willing to strain it into a cup. Second issue is the 2 hour shut off is not selectable.  Most makers have a 2,3 0r 4 hour selectable timer."
I've used this coffee maker extensively now for almost a year and I like everything about it except the spout that delivers water to the filtered basket has poor regulation. If you fill up the basket with substantial grounds to try to brew a large pot then the water level gets too full and grounds end up bypassing the filter and getting inside the coffee pot. Kind of annoying and ingesting the grounds gives you huge caffeine jitters. Only way to mitigate this is to brew small pots frequently.
"I’ve had problems with this coffe maker leaking and today it flat out flooded the counter into the floor. It’s awkward to fill the reservoir at the back and many times I’ve had spills while filling. At other times, it’s leaked from the bottom somehow. But Today it leaked the whole 12 cups all onto my counter and floor. I’ve put up with it as it makes a good cup of hot coffee just like I like it.Now it’s completely blown out."
"Black&Decker 12-Cup Digital Coffee Maker: When I read the reviews for this coffee maker, I was encouraged enough to order one.  The display and programmable time work great.  Unfortunately, the reviews did not relate the leaking from the lid, when opened to remove the used grounds.  It seems to be a poor design, which does not contain the moisture from the brewing process; when the lid is opened, all the moisture runs to the back and along the edges, dripping outside the machine.  My prior machine leaked around the carafe, where it was plastic to glass.  Maybe the B&D carafe will fit my old machine and I will have a coffee maker that does not leak.  I would not recommend this coffee maker."
Losing most of the water as it brews and I could see the water vapour going out but not making it into the  pot. Hence it is taking too much time to brew just two cups of coffee and I will have to just keep on adding water to get two decent cups of coffee and is very frustrating.
"Great for the value, but I don’t expect this to last super long."
"The machine seemed fine. The Sneak-a-Cup"" spring/clip broke the first week."
"Bought this hoping for a solid, middle of the road, inexpensive coffee maker. I was right on one of those! It's inexpensive, but not really solid or middle of the road. It's okay, but that's all. I was expecting more from Black/Decker. The stop-brew function always allows a healthy drip of coffee to hit the heating plate when you remove the carafe and I think that's why the enamel is coming off the plate. Also, condensation causes water to drip pretty much all over, less during the brew cycle, but all over the counter when you open the top after brewing. Also it sometimes takes a little wrestling to get the carafe off the heating plate; not sure what's going on there. Overall, it makes an okay cup of coffee, but I'm disappointed that the details of the user experience seem to have been overlooked. Like I said, it's fine, but just barely."
"Purchased this coffeemaker when my old Mr Coffee died.  Satisfied with its overall operation,I have one somewhat negative comment.  The coffeemaker brewing cycle is VERY LOUD.  VERY.  Just keep that in mind, if you are thinking about purchasing this product."
"I loved this coffee maker; however, it only lasted 8 months before the hot plate failed and so did the coffee maker. I so wanted to love the ease, convenience, and price....but I do not want to replace a coffee maker every 8 months...."
"Sad to say after this happened i tried to look up a replacement basket but could not find one. Aka, can't use the coffee maker. Be careful how you handle the carafe, it could cause the spring bottom part to rip clean off apparently!"
"The actual coffee maker and pot work wonderfully, but the coffee carafe is a hassle to clean as the flip top doesn't come off, you can't wash it in dishwasher, it's always hand wash. Otherwise it's perfect and the price is great."
"Very disappointed in Black & Decker on this one.  Pot is difficult to get in under the filter tray and filter bowl is very picky on how it has to be set in place, it's somewhat rolly polly like and doesn't sit in flat.  The size of the cup numbers on the side is so very small and very difficult to see, especially when there are existing moisture lines.  But the worse part of the design is the top lid.  It comes down OVER the maker itself.  This causes it to constantly drip water ever time it's lifted or closed.  Very messy.  This is also where the filter bowl being rolly polly and not sitting in place quite right comes into play.  You might have to play with the filter bowl a bit to get it to close.  And the more you open and close the lid, the more water drips.  I am currently only mobile via a knee scooter so I'm working from home.  I drink coffee 24/7 so to make it easier and more convenient for me, I moved my coffee maker to a little wooden table I set up by my desk and placed a wicker type placemat under it.  The constant dripping of water every time it's opened and closed, I can't catch all of the drops before they hit the placemat/table, so it's damaged the top of my table.  Over all, I'm just really disappointed.  I bought this one because of Mr. Coffee's insistence of messing up their designs also!  And I've bought B&D coffee makers before and they were much better than this one.  I guess all coffee maker companies are just determined to go away from their old school designs which worked VERY WELL!  Hell, just 2 years ago, my 19 year old Mr. Coffee coffee maker died!  I guess I'm starting to sound like my dad, unfortunately, they just don't make things like the good ol' days!  Bottom line, I do NOT recommend purchasing this one!"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            For a quick purchase, I got what I paid for: a coffee maker.The clock can too easily be changed because there is no lock on the clock, so be careful with moving around the machine.The power cord is about 24 inches long so I needed to change the location on my counter and use an extension cord.The box it came in does not say the filter size needed (just says basket) for the machine nor do the instructions.Very easy to use, performance-wise."
"I bought this coffee maker because there were so many positive reviews.  I've had it about a week and I keep finding things wrong with it!  As others have said, it is very noisy, popping and sputtering well after it has brewed a full pot.  The brewing basket doesn't sit reliably in its place and you have to rely on popping it in with the lid.  It leaks water on the counter, not sure why.  Overnight, the condensation does not go away and I find a drippy wet coffee maker in the morning.  And if I was lazy and didn't remove the coffee filter and grounds, they are a soppy mess and drip on the way to the trash.  Disappointed and I will go back to my reliable Hamilton Beach."
"I’ve purchased this brand of coffee maker on and off my whole life. And while it does make a decent cup of coffee. The burner plate coating is wearing away at an alarming rate. I’m properly cleaning it after use,  making sure it’s not sizzling on any dripping coffee when I’m pouring a cup, but I’ve never seen this happen before so fast. My concern is it could overheat the carafe and cause it to crack without that protective coating at this point. Also first cup is great, but second cup is bitter in a very short time. Way less than auto shut off time. I believe it’s connected to the burner plate coating wearing off."
It works but the temperature plus the burner is way too hot.  Don't be too cheap like I was.  I hit the power button as soon as it perks
"I had one of these coffee makers for about 7 years and was very happy with it, until it suddenly quit working one day, which wasn't totally unexpected considering its age. I promptly replaced it with a new B&D coffee maker.Surprisingly, this one quit working after only a couple of months. So I bought another one. After only a month, it makes hissing and popping noises occasionally (long after brewing is complete) and the coating on the warming plate is already chipping away. The lid design may have been modified though I cannot verify. After raising the lid, condensation on the lid of my older model would roll down and drip back into the holding tank. On the new model, condensation falls off the lid and leaves a puddle on the kitchen counter behind the coffee maker. At first I thought there was a leak until I discovered where the puddles were coming from.If this one quits working, I will switch to another brand. I won't purchase another B&D and urge caution to anyone considering buying this particular model."
"So I did read the reviews about the ""leaks"" but I thought I'd try it anyways for the price. It does make coffee really fast which I love. The problem is the condensation on the inside of the lid drips ALL over ! Not just when you're opening it but randomly all day. I can hear it roll down and sizzle when the heating element is on. When I open it , water dumps all down the sides and back. Seems the dripper part may also drip down the pot randomly as well . Not impressed. I'm constantly wiping down my counter where there's pools of water. Now it's not a ton but on my butcher block countertop I'm not trying to have water sitting all day. The plus of this maker other then how fast it works is that the coffee does taste good. I'm sure it could sit on a tray and avoid countertop spills. But it has me wondering if the burner is going to go out of water is dripping on it every day unnecessarily."
"First of all, I use my coffee maker just to make hot water. I drink, hot tea or instant coffee, and on occasion instant oatmeal.First pouring water into the product early in the morning when you’re not awake is an ordeal because if you miss it’ll go straight through and go to the heating plate right through the whole system. So you have to be careful I know it’s just water, but it’s Annoying.The next issue is the Warming plate gets too hot and actually causes the water to bubble or pop. I’m sure this isn’t normal.But other than that, it works fine.Because of those issues, I probably would not buy it again for the reasons above how I use it. But for coffee would be fine."
Ours is fairly new and within three months the carafe started getting stained brown. The unit still works well but the carafe looks terrible.
"That’s it. I didn’t read the entire description. Ended up returning and getting our old stand-by, Mr. Coffee, with a 4 hour shutoff."
"I purchased this coffee maker because price was good and looks good. However when I set it up I didn't realize that the window for water volume was on the right, would have preferred on the left because of where I have it sitting. Also did not realize it doesn't come with a feature to make the coffee stronger ( bold button). Also inside, attached to the lid, is where the water runs out, instead of a separate dripper that goes over the coffee filter. This makes it harder to open the lid while the coffee is being brewed if you want to add more coffee, extra water, or pour already made coffee through the filter again to make it stronger. However, it works good and looks good. Added this -- Just over 2 months after purchase, the coffee pot just quit working. Light is on, no sound from inside, not used long enough for any oils build up, just stopped. Calling warranty dept. Monday to see what they will do."
"Easy enough to set up and brews quickly. It is not drip-free when you ""sneak-a-cup"".  It also dribbles when pouring if not done very carefully.  The hot plate is already losing paint after 3 months use even though I quickly wipe up drips. Had similar Mr. Coffee, plate also lost paint and failed to keep brew very warm. I guess both were made in China by same manufacturer.  Would not purchase again."
"We recently moved into a new home. My husband is low maintenance and purchased this coffee maker. Less than 3 months in the lid to the coffee carafe is broken. Just do yourself a favor and buy a nicer one. Otherwise you’ll be spilling coffee all over and dropping the broken lid a few times a week. It’s slim fit so it fits just fine in the counter. Takes regular filters, but my husband is cheap and is still using cone filters to save money since we already had them and it works. It only leaks coffee when our broken lid falls off. It would taste better if my husband liked better coffee."
It is all right at this price. I am not a big fan of coffee making but if you're a coffee person and it's significant the taste and temperature of the coffee for you then I would recommend a better option at a higher price. The only thing lacking is that the coffee this machine pours is not hot.
Both of these stopped working shortly after buying. First first only lasted 6 months. Second less than a month but I couldn't get out to return for refund or replacement in time (my bad). Don't know why on well water with high mineral content but we always filter our tap water before putting in coffee maker or drinking.
"First one came only in black and decker box and the hard plastic was cracked so leak out water before brewing. Returned it but have not been refunded  yet not sure why. Bought again and it was boxed inside to extra boxes and works great. Hope refund shows up, never had an issue like this with Amazon"
"Coffee pot works fine. Just noted a couple of things that could have been designed better. First is the tab on filter holder, it extends into place where you pour water. Either have to be careful not to hit it and spill, or put water in first. Second, when you're opening cover on the top to remove used grounds, there is a lot of condensation that runs down. Another potential messy situation if not careful. Grounds manage to get into coffee somehow. I would pick another coffee pot."
"I’m very disappointed in this coffee maker. I thought it would be amazing based on the reviews but maybe I got a dud or something. I’ve been using it for a couple months and no matter what I do, the brewer coffee does not reach the 12 cup capacity. It only brews to 11-11.5 cups. The coffee maker is quiet but I’ve never gotten the amazing coffee aroma that we all love from it like I did with my Ninja. I miss that. Finally, the coffee lacks richness. I’ve used a variety of different coffee types, amount of water, etc. It just barely tastes like coffee. I would not recommend."
"Coffeemaker good, but Washable brew basket missing"
Only stays hot for 2 hrs.
"I purchased this B&D Coffee maker out of necessity due to the fact that my Cuisinart after 1.5 yrs started to have electrical issues (burning wire smell) and had to be thrown out.For another $40+ I regret not purchasing a more heavy duty model.MINUS:  The B&D model does not have an internal filter like other brands I've owned.I regret not buying a better model and should have paid the extra money initially for the replacement.I'll continue using the B&D as it basic, but know better for the next time - which will probably be soon."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It’ll get the job done. It’s nothing fancy it works well enough. I think you get what you pay for fair coffee maker for a fair price.
The coffee maker works great. Easy to operate and coffee taste good. But......the design of the lid is terrible.After brewing (even hours later) when you open the lid the water that has accumulated on the inside now runs down and drips off down the outside and on the counter! I just might send it back :(
"I bought one of these in July and it is great, no problems.  I bought another in November and the enamel on the heating unit was wearing off within a month.  I returned it for a replacement, and the seller was very good about that.  I received the replacement in December and the enamel on the heating unit is wearing off even worse than the prior one.  It's too much bother to return it at this point, especially since I did not keep the packaging. I'll just be looking for another brand.  I don't understand why the quality has gotten worse since July. It's a shame because otherwise it's a great coffee maker, fits my needs and makes a good tasting cup of coffee.  If you do buy this one, I'd caution you to keep the packaging in case you need to return it."
The coffee maker does work; but for some reason the one I got leaks water everywhere. In order to prevent the leaking I have to tilt the coffee maker backwards. I only cost me $20 so it's not worth my time to return it.You get what you pay for I guess.
"The description and the outside of the box says it has a washable basket, opened the box and no washable basket so need to buy filters"
"This produce has worked fine for close to 9 months.  This morning, parts of the drip mechanism simply fell apart and spewed coffee all over us.  The last Black and Decker coffee maker i owned lasted for nearly 5 years.  This one didn't even make it a year."
"it makes the coffee ok, but when you pull to get your container out the whole pot goes with, i will buy me another one."
"This is a good coffeemaker but its terribly noisy!!  I use the Auto setting on the mornings I get up for work, and the first time it turned on I thought someone was breaking into my house. Once I figured out it was just the new coffeemaker, all was good. Now I don't have to set my alarm anymore because like clock work this machine starts chugging away at 6 am just in time to get up."
"It worked great for almost exactly 1 year of once-a-day use.  Just up and died. I did order another one. Hope it lasts longer, I just did not have time to shop for something as big a part of my routine as a coffee maker.  i would have thought that a Black and Decker would last longer. I guess I just have to add Black and Decker to the list of used- to-  be  dependable companies."
". The spring for the basket broke after 45 days.  Bought March 3 broke April 25!!!  Waste of money spend on better quality product. The window for Amazon returns is over.However, I reached out to the product company. They stood by product and offered replacement part and/or part. Customer service representative at Spectrum was very knowledgeable of the product and the issue. Because of the customer service rep communication skills and outcome of the issue at hand I updated my review to 3 stars."
"I purchased this coffee maker in May 2024. For the first couple of months, I loved this product. Easy to clean, poured coffee with no drips, simple to use. October 2024, the heating element now only keeps the coffee lukewarm. I have to reheat my coffee in the microwave for each cup. Sad part is, I don’t use it everyday, I don’t make full pots, and I didn’t use it for a full month, because I was traveling away from home."
"There a ""plunger""  in the center of filter holder which allow you to remove the carafe without coffee dripping out when filling the mug.Well, it worked fine for some time but, the ""plunger"" started to stick and would not go down when removing the carafe, causing coffee to drip on to the heating plate.Eventually, heat plate rusted so bad, I got rid of it and bought a new machine...no use cleaning permanently rusted heating plate."
"Very light, cheap plastic. Slides around on the counter as your trying to fill the receptacle with water. Basket does not seat properly and rocks around inside the pot. As usual, you get what you pay for. I will be be buying a better coffee pot."
"We were replacing one of these that was worn out.When the new one arrived, the plastic was so thin that it had a hole poked in it by the pour spout on the carafe - even though the package was not damaged. I sent it back and got a more expensive, but much better quality coffee maker that I am completely happy with."
"I have had a few B&D coffee pots over my lifetime. They are always an inexpensive coffee pot option. But now, I am finding the lid over the basket does not latch, steam gathers on this lid and drip down all around the front and sides of the pot. It is slow, taking on average 5 or more minutes for 1/2 pot. No option to just turn on the warming plate, just 1 button that will engage the brew cycle. The hot water from the spray nozzle sprays with bursts, shooting coffee grounds out of and around the filter basket, causing grounds in the coffee. I had to either waste another filter to filter grounds from my brew or use one to cover the grounds to prevent splash out. I was desperate as my 13 yr old Ninja coffee bar gave up the ghost. I should have spent more and got a better machine. I will put this one away for emergency need in the future and buy myself a quality machine with features."
Very delicate pot. One little tap and it shatters. It also leaks when you pour. Easy to use timer.
"I had the coffee maker for a while and used it every few days for about a year. Then all of the sudden, it stopped sending water from the back into the brewing area. The water just sits in the back, heats up, and evaporates."
The re-usable filter that is supposed to come with this was not in the package.
"Used this ~$35 coffee maker for 13 months. Maker works as promised but the pot is very thin. The lip chipped in the first 2 months, but I kept using it. The bottom cracked when I bumped it on the table. New pot was $22 so I bought the whole same maker for ~$33. Handle the pot with care!"
We received this December 3rd and the knob that allows you to pull the carafe out to pour a cup of coffee while it is still brewing is now broken. It is the 9th of December. I am really disappointed in this coffee pot.
Have not tried it but right off the bat in Two Sealed boxes .I think themanufacturer forgot to put the washable filter in box so annoying.Ill let you know how it actually works after I buy a washable filter because to reorder a New omit will still be missing.box says it’s in there but no it’s not
"Like many of you, I’m a review reader and writer as I like to read up on what I buy beforehand and like to give an honest review as well. With this coffee machine, I read a ton of positive reviews, so I purchased it. I only read one that sounded like the one I got, so take this with a grain of salt.I make 1/2 a pot here at home with this Black and Decker maker, then I go to work and make a full pot with a newer Mr. Coffee (both units priced about the same). Day and night difference!  The Black and Decker 1/2 pot takes 25 minutes, yes 25 minutes, before it finally stops with its God awful sounds going on constantly the whole time. Crack, pops, pows, you name it and it makes it. Loud. It’s in the kitchen and we have to turn the tv up in the bedroom, no lie. I have owned quite a few coffee makers in my 64 years, and this beats all! Secondly, the basket (floats) in position where you’re not sure it’s positioned where it supposed to be. It doesn’t have that drop in, positive feel. You’ll find yourself checking it several times to make sure. At least I do. Sorry Black and Decker, but I would probably stick with tools.  The Mr Coffee full pot takes 9 minutes and gurgled at the very end of the cycle for about 18 seconds. Quietly. The basket has that positive positioning where you know it’s where it’s supposed to be. There is absolutely no comparison. Like I said, maybe I got a dud or maybe people don’t mind the carrying on this thing makes, or maybe they’re just not true coffee drinkers like I am, but mine is definitely going back!"
"I choose this due to B&D being a good brand; and it was a gift.  After 4 months, he's now telling me it isn't working; problems with the water system.  He takes good care of things, so it's not a matter of care.  Disappointed in the quality!"
"I had my previous one like this for a few years, before replacing it with this one! This one the switch broke in a few months! Then to get a replacement, because it was out of the Amazon guarantee, I had to go thru the mfg. It took me 2 months to get my replacement! They had me cut the power cord and wanted a picture of that plus $7.50 for postage! I had trouble sending the picture??? and had Covid around Thanksgiving, that delayed me, but there still has to be better way! Cutting the cord, I understand, because there is a lot of fraud out there, but having to pay for shipping on a defective product within 6 months is excessive! Mfgs should demand better quality for their products. Either from their own employees or the mfg producing them!"
"I liked the opening for filling; ease of cleaning, quiet brewing, held hot temperature, used paper round filters.But have no idea why it just didn't work one day. Now trying to decide if I should buy another one. Not happy with the Cusinart I tried and returned."
Description states it has a washable basket filter.  It does not contain a true washable filter just a washable basket that requires an additional filter.  I would not have purchased had I known this.  Using an additional filter it makes fine coffee.
"This is a basic coffee maker, it's fine."
"As my profile name says, this is my first ever review and a feedback for anything I bought anywhere online. I felt like doing it because I have some spare time over Christmas and also I hope someone will find this helpful.If your primary criteria for choosing an espresso machine is the looks, don’t read further. Choose this machine as my opinion it is the best looking machine on the market as of right now. If on the other hand you are assessing other features, keep reading.Bough this machine 3 weeks ago. Was away for a week on work travels and used it effectively 25 times. Made around 15 espressos and 10 cappuccinos. in two weeks. I owned two espresso machines in last 5 years and these were half the price of this one so you understand where my base line or the previous knowledge is.IssuesThe first issue is around excess amount discharged of water in the bottom tray (you will see it because Breville obviously even made a floater that flips red when it is about to overflow).Issue 1. Bottom tray was overflowing with water after using the machine 15 times. I thought this was strange, emptied the water and continue using the machine and this time I was monitoring the level of water in the bottom tray. After 10 further drinks (mostly espressos and a few cappuccinos) the tray was half-way full. I did not think this was right so I gave Breville support a call. They were very responsive and called me back. I explained the situation and the gentlemen I spoke with said it is a normal operating condition for this machine and that end-user is expected to empty the tray after a while due to, as he stated, 3 events taking place:- Event 1, When you switch the machine on it automatically drains any stale water from its pipes into a tray so that a fresh water from the plastic container is used. I see this as a positive and a smart function for the machine to do and can confirm not much water is discharged into a tray.- Event 2, Machine drains a certain amount of water after every espresso made into a tray in order to get rid of any water in internal pipes so, so no water under pressure is left in machine pipes as this prolongs the life of a machine. I confirmed this whilst on a phone to him and there was not much water discharged in the tray.- Event 3, Machine drains a certain amount of water after using steamer for e.g. milk frothing. Again, as explained this is so any excess pressure is released from the pipes as well as any water. Here, a large amount of water was released in the tray as I tested this whilst on the phone to support.My assessment of this issue is, if you have the time to change empty the tray after roughly you made 15 drinks and stress about whether the water will overflow in you espresso tray then consider this a non-issue. This normal operating condition is not listed in the manual or brought to consumer’s attention when choosing this product. This is obviously known to Breville since they went as far as designing a smart flipping floater turning red when the tray is full. However, they do not consider this too much of a hinderance to users.The next issue number 2, again as per my conversation with the support is a normal operating condition. Steamer pipe was blocked. I had to use a cleaning needle, supplied with the machine, followed by switching on the steamer to get it to work. This is after frothing the milk for around 10 cappuccinos I made using this machine, last one yesterday. The support said it may be because I used whole milk, and I think I did. Again, this normal operating condition/best practice is not listed in the manual or brought to consumer’s attention when choosing this product. This is obviously known to Breville since they went as far as supplying a cleaning kit with this machine all with specifically designed needle. Obviously, they do not seem to consider this too much of a hinderance to users.Issue number 3 is to do with coffee grinder feature usability. You cannot tell how much coffee has been ground (the grinder will go on as long as you keep the porta filter basket/handle pressing the grinder switch). As a result every coffee you make will taste different.Now, in summary, I am returning this product since I cannot afford the time to maintain it (empty water, clean). Although making a coffee is a ritual, I do not feel like I can get use to this machine. It would require too much of my attention to maintain and learn how to operate it. Also, I want to be able to use any milk type without a fear it will clog the steamer pipe and lastly the coffee tastes differently every time I make it (this last one would take some time to get use to the machine which admittedly I did not allow for). Although I am a coffee lover, I cannot justify the price of this espresso machine with having all the basic issues I listed. And for whomever over-engineered the self-cleaning functionality of this machine, and the person who approved it, they have done it to the detriment of usability and have affected the end product result at the end of the day.The next section are my suggestions on how to improve this product in the future, so for Breville Product Owner, in case they ever read this.1. Have a light at the top of the grinder dispenser so that I can see how much coffee has been ground. Maybe have both options available to users, unlimited coffee grinding (needs light to see) as well as the exact amount2. Find a better way of cleaning the machine than discharging a lot of the water in the tray - this is a burden to end-user. See suggestion 3.3. Instead of on/off steamer switch, have a knob controlling how much steam to use. This will help with cleaning the pipes as well as stopping excess water discharge in the tray since the user can simply release any excess steam with the knob. Not as easy with on/off switch, not to say impossible4. Grinder dial numbers are hard to seeHope this helps."
"(First image: my machine disassembled, waiting on parts. Second image. Replacement pump from Amazon. Thanks Mr Bezos..monopoly or not, your Amazon empire helps me greatly!)If you would normally spend $3-4 on a latte or espresso drink of some sort from your local coffee shop, then this machine will pay for itself in less than one year. If you learn how to pull clean shots, use freshly roasted coffee, and learn to texture milk decently, you WILL be able to make quality espresso drinks with this machine, hands down. As many espresso machine reviewers will point out, someone could use a $10,000+ machine and if they don't know what they're doing, their espresso shot will taste like burnt dirt.So, thus the three stars. If this is your only objective: make espresso drinks at home for 1-2 people (because it's a single boiler and you can't pull a shot and steam milk at the same time, plus the steam power is just OK, taking 1-2 minutes to steam milk for one drink), save money by not buying a daily $3-4 drink, then this may be a perfect machine for you...BUT, beware that this machine is not future-ready. I have owned this machine now for 4 years, so I have gotten my money back several times over, but I am have also really become excited about espresso and how to take my espresso shots to the next level, make excellent microfoam milk and make drinks for a party of 6, 8, 12. This machine will not cut the cheese.And to add insult to injury, my Barista Express just died. Within a week, the shot pull button started buzzing and now I can't pull a shot, can't steam milk, can't even get a cup of hot water. All signs point to a bad solenoid valve or a bad pump or both.Good luck getting a solenoid valve assembly for this machine. I am actively trying to do just that. I found the pump here on Amazon, and although I have an engineering background, I think anyone can take this machine apart if they are so inclined to give it a try. It's not that hard. But you have to have the parts to fix it. The solenoid valve assembly is apparently special order from a third party seller. I tried calling Breville and was promised a call back in 1-2 hours, but never received a call back.So, where does this leave me? Well, with a $700 machine that I may have to toss or send to Breville to fix for $500 (an outrageous proposition, given that the entire machine costs $700, the pump is $40 and the solenoid assembly is $60...if I can ever get my hands on a replacement part). I am the guy who would buy an espresso drink every day, so I got my money's worth. But no one wants to feel like that's all they get out of a $700 investment. I encourage you to contemplate the same before you purchase this machine.I will update here if Breville ever calls me back and if they offer a reasonable solution to fix my broken machine...To all those with working Barista Expresses, pull a shot for me. For all of the 8,000 plus positive reviews, I was one of those too until my machine broke. I'm curious how long many of those reviewers have owned their machine. I should also add that I am meticulously OCD about taking care of my machine...I flush the group head after every shot. I clean the steam wand meticulously after each steamed cup of milk. I use only bottled spring water in the water tank. I clean regularly with original Breville cleaning tablets and I still regularly change my charcoal filter even though I use spring water...the machine will fail with time, and it should be able to be fixed easily like every other quality espresso machine brand that I am now coming to learn about.UPDATE: Breville did call me back, After posting a message on their online chat. No one specifically return my phone call however. So I guess, lesson learned. Use the online chat and don’t call. If necessary, the person on the chat will call you like they did for me. The service charge to fix the machine is only $191. The service charge includes replacing the entire unit if necessary. To Breville’s credit, they were helping me arrange for service well past 8 PM. They also pay for shipping of the unit to Breville and back to the consumer and offer a six month warranty on their work. You literally just take the machine sans any of the easily removable parts to a UPS location and they will package it up and send it at no cost to you. That is pretty excellent customer service.I honestly think that this is pretty reasonable. If the pump and solenoid valve assembly together are about $100, then I am only paying $100 to have Breville fix the machine.  it would not be worth my time to take the machine apart, and worry about changing the parts out for $100. I put the machine back together in about 15 minutes and I am shipping it off to Breville to be fixed. I guess all of this does go to show you that Breville stands by their products. However, my point about this machine not being appropriate for high-volume entertaining still stands. If that may become your goal, the dual boiler Breville machine might be the right ticket for you."
"Great machine for making our coffee drinks and has saved more than it cost us in the two years we've owned it. Two major complaints though. The frother is dangerously loud... Like painful in a small space. Second, the grinder has to be tapped while grinding or the beans will not freely fall into it. Two major issues. I probably should have addressed them initially and gone a different route, but here we are two years later. I finally broke and had to say something about the glaring issues this machine has."
"TLDR at bottom.I purchased this in December 2022 and in May 2023 the machine stopped working. This is exactly 6mo of daily use. The machine was wiped down after every use, I allowed the backflow water to run after using the steam wand, etc. I took care of the machine by running the appropriate clean cycles as well as de-scaling at the appropriate times. Water filter was replaced and I only used filtered RO water as well as the recommended settings for brewing.The Espresso Machine stopped working over 3 weeks ago (May 7) and was unable to build-up pressure for the portafilter. I did the appropriate troubleshooting steps, watched YouTube videos, read online forums and read through Breville support articles for FAQs. Since this is a $700 machine, I knew that some research and love and care would have to go into the ownership of it. This isn't just a nespresso pod machine that I get out once a week when I have friends over. This was a huge investment and I was treating it as such.After spending a few hours over the course of a couple of days troubleshooting, attempting to make sure all steps were completed on my end, I contacted Breville support. Their e-mails always read ""We aim to reply within 24 business hours"" - they always hold up to that end of the bargain but their solutions and e-mails don't actually offer any fixes to the problem. It's like their single metric for customer support is how fast they can reply to inquiries and e-mails for service requests.They asked me to complete troubleshooting steps, run descaling cycle, try the rubber pad within the portafilter to do a ""pressure check"" etc. I again went through the steps, provided appropriate pictures and information about the machine and its symptoms. Eventually they said to send the machine to them and they would perform service to fix it. I am thinking, okay great, they will fix it, it's under warranty, I'll have my machine back and running with 2 weeks or so.It is now May 30 and I still have not received the shipping box. They were very adamant about shipping it in their box that they provide, otherwise I would have mailed this back on the first day. I have sent multiple inquiries and e-mails to them asking about the box and I keep being told to wait an additional 4-6 days or 5-7 days, depending on the representative who responds. The tracking number shows the box sitting somewhere but not even in-transit. I called attention to this and they replied of course within 24 hours to let me know that I needed to wait a few more days.I called on the phone last week and was on hold for 20minutes before I received an automated message asking if I would like to receive a callback rather than waiting on the phone any longer. I said yes and still have not received a phone call. We just had a 3 day weekend but it has been over 2 business days without receiving a call. I e-mailed again and said multiple times that this was unacceptable and that a solution still has not been found. I very quickly received an e-mail simply telling me to wait another XX amount of days.At this point I think Breville customer support is a scam and they do not stand by their product. They have constantly put me off and told me to wait another XX amount of days a dozen times. There is no urgency or responsibility on their part. I don't think they care if their machines break after 6mo even if you are paying $500-$900 for them. I receive better customer support for kids' $30 Paw Patrol bike helmet.I took care of this machine, like I said it was an investment. I had never spent this much money on a kitchen appliance, let alone a machine that makes espresso. At this point I absolutely regret buying this Breville machine because I now have a $700 not-even-paper-weight. It's just been sitting in my house for over 3 weeks now, not making espresso.TLDR --Maybe you will get lucky and nothing on the machine will ever break or wear down. I took care of mine by the book and it broke down after 6 months. If it's a problem that is above your skills to fix, Breville will not take care of you and you will be left with a broken $700 investment."
"The good: Nice and shiny metal with lights and  gauge. Looks beautiful on the counter.I used to have a capsule machine....maybe I'm spoiled.The bad: It is sort of a mess to use. Lots of spilled coffee grounds every time you use it.,Getting it to produce a decent cup takes lots of fiddling with grind and choice of baskets.Not sure the grinder is worth it.""Tamp the the grounds down with 40lbs of force""  >Seriously?? I guess it gives baristas strong forearms... that is 1/2 a bag of concrete or a big bag of dog food equivalent  of force."
"The machine operates perfectly except for the fact that we have to constantly empty the bottom tray, which fills up with water after half a dozen uses. It appears this is a fairly common issue, and has been going on for years. We love the looks and functionality/ease of use, BUT the leak issue is a deal-breaker. Also, either the foamer has too much pressure or I'm not adept enough at it to properly use it. Even when you insert the nozzle deeper into the milk, which is not what the video recommended, it still splatters.Mark & SavinaHayden, ID"
"Purchased November 2013.ORIGINAL REVIEW (September 2015): This machine has just enough functionality for me to consistently pull God shots as long as my beans are fresh and I choose the right grind. I have had this machine for nearly two years pulling 1-2 shots a day, and it has been quite reliable until now. I maintain and clean it regularly. However, recently it has started to vibrate loudly when I am pulling shots, and I think the pump may be failing. Many other people in online forums have complained of buzzing noises just before their unit failed. I am contacting Breville to see if they can help me identify and fix the problem. I paid over half a grand for this machine, so I'm hoping they can help! If you spend over $500 on an espresso machine, I imagine you want it to last at least 5 years if not 10.UPDATE # 1 (November 2015): Breville replaced my machine with a refurbished machine (Certified Remanufactured).UPDATE # 2 (December 2015): Replacement machine 1 started sharing the same problems as the original. Over the past few days it has also started to make rattling noises and sometimes it cannot generate sufficient pressure. As before, I have been decalcifying monthly and using the water filters, even pre-filtering the water before I put it in. I have also been cleaning the unit with the tablets whenever the Clean Me light turns on.UPDATE # 3: (January 2016): Received replacement machine 2 (certified remanufactured) from Breville. Machine makes loud rattling noises but works OK.UPDATE # 4 (March 2016): I have received two replacement machines under warranty after the original machine and the first replacement stopped working due to a manufacturing or design defect. The third machine (replacement machine 2) has now also stopped working. I have done the backflush cleaning with the tablets every time the Clean Me light comes on. I have decalcified (with vinegar) on a monthly basis without fail. I have pre-filtered the water with a high-end Stage 4 filter before putting it in the tank, and I have even used the carbon filter in the tank too. I am afraid I now must update my review to 1 star. Breville has great customer service, but this particular machine design is not one I would recommend if you plan on making espressos for more than a few months. You can find videos of my failing machines and the rattling noises on YouTube.Description of the symptoms:Sounds:- “Wao-wao wao-wao” whining sounds, especially during pre-infusion, and usually occurring the instant I touch the button- Uncharacteristic rattling, sometimes right when I press the button, and also sometimes during the “extraction” phaseSights:- No water exiting into cup, regardless of whether there are grounds or not in the portafilter, and regardless of how many times I press the button- Pressure shown as zero or very low on pressure gauge- Small amounts of steam squirting out of the steam wand when I’m making coffee- Water collection tray fills with water although no water comes out the portafilter, indicating that perhaps that the water may be leaking into the bottom of the machine.UPDATE # 5 (April 2016): I again contacted Breville, and they agreed to take the machine in for repair. They agreed to pay the shipping costs. Once again, bravo for the good customer service!UPDATE # 6 (May 2016): I received the repaired machine, but found immediately that the repair had been unsuccessful! Makes you wonder if they actually tried to fix it, or if they just did routine maintenance and sent it right back. I again contacted Breville, and they agreed to examine the machine a second time.UPDATE # 7 (June 2016): The machine was returned again, but the grinder was returned broken (or not reassembled properly). I can no longer change the grind size by turning the knob. No matter which grind size I select, I always get coarse grinds. I carried out a thorough cleaning of the grinder to be sure, to no effect. I contacted Breville, who refused to service or replace the unit due to the out of warranty status, but instead offered me a 35% discount off the purchase of a new machine under $1000. I insisted and posted several videos of the problem on YouTube. I even tried taking apart the grinder myself to fix it, but Breville wouldn't give me a parts list or assembly diagram, so I couldn't really figure it out on my own.UPDATE # 8 (July 2016): I kept insisting, and finally (miraculously), Breville agreed to send me a replacement (certified remanufactured) machine. Thank you, Breville, for accepting responsibility for the quality and workmanship of your products! I am now using Dezcal instead of vinegar for decalcifying. Otherwise, I will maintain this machine well (as before) and see how it goes. Wish me luck!"
"******UPDATE!********We have had this machine for almost a year. I purchased it because I was under the impression from some comments that Breville's customer service was supposed to be very good. That has REPEATEDLY not been our experience. Every CSR has sounded bored, short and uninterested. No warm customer service here. My machine is under warranty still and as gasket went out. I called, very clearly explained the part I needed and the rude lady charged me for the replacement part. I get it home, and it's the WRONG part! I touched base with them via facebook and through their online customer service form multiple times. They have ignored every single attempt to contact them about this issue. Looking around on facebook, I see I'm not the only one having this experience. The machine is starting to make noises and their customer service isn't interested in honoring their warranty. It was a $600 machine that we have gotten about a year out of. I will never purchase from Breville again. I will be saving my money and going with a company that builds better machines that have a record of lasting 15-20 years.**********Original Post****************We have really enjoyed this machine! I am a first time owner and was hesitant about the learning curve. I had whole beans on hand that were a couple months old and I'm awful glad I had them to practice on. My recommendations for newbies and those on the fence about purchasing:1) Get on YouTube and watch several videos specific to this machine's operation. There are many good ones out there. Also watch general videos on espresso making, latte art, 101s. Most are short and informative, while giving newbies a decent point of reference to start from.2) When starting out, use cheaper whole beans to get the feel of grinding and tamping. Expect some spillage and some waste. It also gives you an excellent starting point for comparing those fresh roasted beans you'll buy after you get your technique right. ALSO, if you have a good, local coffeehouse, try a shot of their espresso if you've never had a straight shot. It's one thing to have a flavored latte, but it's a whole different animal when you want to know what a good shot should look and taste like first hand. Spent grounds are excellent organic matter for gardens, so definitely pass them along to a gardening friend if you don't have one yourself.3) Others have said this, Breville recommends it, but it's still worth mentioning. Make a method and stick with it. I started out with Kicking Horse 454 whole beans and also purchased Kroger's Simple Truth organic beans along with Sbx's espresso roast. All off the shelf with no roast date. I started on ground size 6 (where it was when I opened the box) and manually ground, tapped on the counter, ground, tapped, ground, tamped. When that didn't produce the desired pressure, I altered 1 variable. Usually ground size or tamping pressure. The 454 beans produced the correct pressure at ground size 5, while Sbx was a 1 and Kroger's was an 8. The crema varied greatly and you could definitely taste the differences between over and under extracted. Taste those shots, too. I now know what a seriously undesirable shot tastes like, simply because I didn't just chuck it out. Taste, taste, taste. Also, in order to find the right tamping pressure, I filled my portafilter and tamped with what I thought would be enough pressure, noted the results, pulled another shot while tamping with what I thought was too much pressure, noted the results and again with what I thought wasn't enough pressure. I don't have a scale to measure pressure at the moment, but that gave me a good idea of what was too much or not enough.4) After you've gotten comfortable with the overall process, buy some really good beans! We have a wonderful coffeehouse in our town and I got with the owner about buying some of his beans. He picked up his fresh roasted beans from Austin on Monday and I bought mine on Tuesday. These puppies were practically still off gassing! And let me tell you, the difference was out of this world! The crema was so thick, the shot was the pouring texture of warm honey, the flavors were pronounced, smooth, amazing! I did nothing different in my technique. The results using fresh beans cannot be overstated.5) The dual-wall filter is a life saving device for up and coming baristas. It is very forgiving and was the reason my very first shot was quite good! :) But, don't let that stop you from trying out that single wall basket. I had never operated an espresso machine, yet 2 days after unboxing it (and 2# of practice beans later) I was using the single wall basket to make lattes and Americanos for (some very honest) guests who were raving about how good they were. One even text me the next day saying she couldn't stop thinking about the vanilla latte she had. It CAN be done!6) Amazon has a pretty good return policy and though I haven't spoken with Breville's customer service department, from all indications in these reviews, they are excellent to work with. This made me feel confident that if the machine didn't work out, I wouldn't be stuck with a paperweight that I hated.Aside from all that,the machine is gorgeous. The steaming wand works, but I could definitely use some 1-on-1 training in milk stretching and microfoaming. From others that know about steaming milk, there seems to be some room for improvement, however I have been able to make some cute works of impromptu art by altering whatever foam pattern poured into my cup. (Think cloud watching.) The grinder is the best I've owned or used. Zero complaints.All in all, it's a great machine that I feel is a wonderful value. It has allowed me to learn something new at a comparatively low price. I feel the warranty is reliable and I would gladly recommend it to anyone that is willing to put a little time into figuring it out."
"I was under the impression this item was in “very good” condition. I received an item with several dents, rusted areas and missing so many parts! It’s missing 3/4 of the parts that are including with the machine, including the filter, milk frother. Luckily my brother had all these items on hand from a previous machine he had purchased."
I had this machine twice and the first time I changed it for a new one of the same brand because I could not find technical service available in the USA. The second machine failed again after two years and I could not find anyone to repair it. I decided to change brands…
"Bought in March 2020 because, well, needed espresso to get through.  Machine pulls a good shot most of the time, a great shot occasionally, and a bad shot about 20% of the time.  There is a learning curve to pulling a good shot.  You need to be prepared to readjust your grind amount and coarseness every time you put new coffee in the hopper.  And be prepared for a bunch of bad shots in a row if you change brands or roasts of coffee.  Have really loved having it, despite the increase in my espresso consumption!The reason for the 3-star rating -- it is now April 2024 and the grinder is going bad.  Have extensively researched to issue, and it seems we cannot repair it ourselves.  About half the cost of the machine to have Breville do it.  Call me old fashioned, but I feel like a 700dollar appliance should last more than 4 years.  Or at the very least, make the parts that could be expected to wear out (grinder) repairable by owner so I don't have to pack up a 15lb machine, send it through the mail and be without coffee for weeks.I've ordered a nice stand alone grinder so we can go back to pour overs if we decide to send it back, or just grind separately.  Hate that everything is just so disposable."
"This espresso machine is interesting. It appears easy to use based on easy to read buttons and settings but there is a lot more involved to get a good espresso shot out of this device. Grind quality/amount is the tricky part and will lead you to burn through a lot of espresso beans before you get it just right.Another challenge is getting the pressure right. I had to send mine in for a repair shortly after getting it because out of the box it was a lemon. The pressure never would climb to ideal range, at times the meter wouldn't even move at all. I just got this machine back yesterday and already it is working better than before but will require some tests to get the settings to personal preference.The steam wand works but beware it takes a while to heat up milk. The metal cup it comes with will get hot but don't be fooled the milk is likely still just lukewarm. You will have to steam it for a little longer after you can no longer hold your hand to the side/bottom of the cup.Cleanup is pretty easy. The tray slides out easy and isn't difficult to clean. I bought additional accessories to help in cleaning out the grinder. I do recommend occasionally cleaning out the grinder unless you don't mind remnants from past beans to mix with new batches.Aside from having to get a repair right away my only other gripe with the device is the height between the base and the steam wand. The metal cup it comes with is small and good for 1 drink at a time. It is much smaller than what usually a barista would use. The standard metal cup baristas would use would not fit with this device.Unrelated to the device itself, but regarding Breville customer service. They initially had me run a test on the device (a youtube video). When I ran the test and the results did not match what the video said I should get I informed Breville. They responded with a canned response indicating user error. I quickly responded indicating I disagreed with the assessment. I had previously experimented well over 30 espresso shots with zero consistency from the espresso machine. I also explained how the test they told me to run gave me results affirming the machine wasn't working properly. It wasn't until I sent that response that they offered free shipping to have it sent in for repairs. Breville emailed me once that my espresso machine had finished being repaired and was shipped but they didn't provide any sort of tracking, nor did they indicate what issue if any they found in their repairs, only a vague checklist of things they tested.Overall, I don't think I'd recommend this espresso machine based on how sensitive it is, having a lemon out of the box, and Breville customer service being a bit difficult. It can be nice to have but I'd recommend a different espresso machine that gives a more forgiving and better experience."
"For starters, I am a big Breville fan and I own the Breville infuser. Mine has worked well for two years now and makes outstanding coffee. I recently pitched in with my father-in-law to by my mother-in-law the Barrista Express. The function is basically identical to mine, so I set it up for them yesterday.I immediately noticed a problem with the pull. The gauge was not going up and it ""heated"" up way too quick. On mine, it takes 30 seconds or so to heat up, the Barrista did it within 2-3 seconds (i.e., way to quick). The pull was very off, no creme', and lots of air bubbles. I tinkered with the grind ( to make it finer) and tried everything I could think of. Eventually, I would try course(est) grind, finest grind, mess with the amounts of coffee in the group head, etc. I made sure water came out of the holding tank appropriately, it did; I tried reseting the machine, no luck; and I cleaned it thoroughly (even with the tablets in ""clean mode"") and took off the screen to make sure it was clear and clean. Everything external looked good to go but nothing worked. After multiple pulls, 2 to 3 hours, and a 1/2 bag of beans, I gave up.Then my father in law asked about the tea feature. On mine, it comes out in a continuous stream and fills an 8 once mug before it shuts off automatically. On his, it sputtered and spit before shutting off after putting out 2 oz of water. We confirmed with a measuring cup.We did some research and found out that our machine had symptoms of a bad thermocouple and/or sensor.He called customer service today and got ahold of someone. They walked him through all the standard steps but nothing worked for him. He plans to send it back tomorrow to Breville.I am SUPER disappointed because it is inconvenient, especially given that it is a high dollar item. I'd expect to take it out of the box, follow the set up instructions, and be pouring perfect coffee within 10-15 minutes. Now we have to go through all of this hassle to get a working machine back from the factory.It is worth mentioning the machine seemed to be perfectly packaged and I saw no evidence that we were receiving a machine that had been previously opened, let alone used (i.e., all tape was in the right spot, bags were sealed, etc.). There was no damage to the box upon arrival and the machine ""looked"" flawless.Like I said, I own a Breville and love it. This one was a huge dud though. I think if it was a working machine, I would give it 5 stars (+). The grinder (the added feature on this vs. mine) is fantastic. I am sure once we get a working machine, we will be singing its praises but not this one. Hope this helps.I just reviewed this post and would be remiss if I did not make an update - 11/18/2020After that debacle described above, the in-laws did receive a working machine and they use it daily. I do not remember the specifics other than it was a hassle (i.e, I could not tell you if it took a week to resolve or a month). I can tell you also that I still have my Breville and it still pours a mean cup of coffee. Looking back, would I still buy a Breville from Amazon? Yes."
Very loud and the reservoir leaks. Not sure if I got a defective item
"Machine looks great on my countertop.  Thats about it.  Im not a fan of it.  I like large cups of coffee.  Not a small tiny cup.  Ive looked up videos and i still dont get a decent cup of coffee.  To sum it up, i am still using my inexpensive coffee maker."
"I never write product reviews...this one is the exception. I simply thought I'd share my experience in the event it may assist others in their decision making.Santa brought us this on Christmas of 2019. Initially, I was pleased with the investment. Granted it lacked the power and feature set of more costly ""prosumer"" espresso machines, but, for the price, I was pretty impressed. I was able to get it dialed in and pulling relatively tasty shots fairly quickly. Invested in a few after market items like a new tamper, distribution tool and funnel which improved consistency a bit. All things considered, not a bad little unit.Then one day, about 2 months in, a loud snap/pop from the grinder set the grind size dial moving freely; the unit lacked the ability to hold the grind size constant and the grinder ratcheted horribly. After complete disassembly, inspection and reassembly I contacted Breville. To their credit, they contacted me rather expediently and, after a quick review of my description and video clip, authorized me for a new replacement unit, which I received relatively quickly. Customer service answered several questions, though I can't say the responses were overly warm or service oriented in tone. At least I had a functioning replacement.Again, about 6 weeks later I experienced the same issue with the grinder. I had to completely recalibrate the grind size and dosing, as the unit seemed to be grinding incredibly fine, and suddenly retaining a tremendous amount of grounds. I followed Breville's prescribed cleaning process, but to no avail. I contacted Breville 3 times via email with a detailed description of the issue, but never received a reply. Calling their support line only produced some pre-recorded message that didn't give me any options to talk to a human being. I always like to assume the best - everyone is busy and I appreciate that customer service is a challenging occupation- but after all of my multiple attempts to their primary support email and line, I'm left to assume that they've elected to stop responding in hopes that I ""go away"".Today, I find myself using the same unit, having altered my grind and dosage settings to get the yield I want and produce a decent shot. That said, I am thoroughly fed up with this unit. I noticed the steam output of the unit to generally be on the decline over the past 3 or so months; it is nothing like the floor model we saw at a local coffee gear reseller's showroom and it has become increasingly finicky. I preemptively descaled the unit, cleaned the wand tip, changed filters, use the same bottled water source time and time again. Brand new, this unit could produce a very respectable cappuccino foam, though I find myself routinely, now, trying to steam a pitcher of milk, only to find it completely devoid of foam and entirely too thin. I'll try a second pitcher only to yield the same results. No matter how hard I try I can not produce anything that will even begin to mark the crema's surface, and this is not for lack of knowledge or ""know how"". The unit, simply put, seems to be a sub-par and incredibly frustrating version of what I initially received.So, to summarize, were I to never have had any of these issues, I'd give this 4 or 5 stars for being a great little compromise on a respectable at home, entry level semi-automatic espresso machine. I give it 2 stars simply to be fair in the event that my emails are all in the black hole of cyberspace somewhere and that Breville would have sent me a 3rd unit in hopes that it would be free of defect. Frankly, I wish I could simply get a refund. I can in no way recommend the product or offer a vote of confidence in the long term service provided by the company. I am saving for and should have spent the extra $1,000 - $1,500 on a respectable unit from the get go, but now I know. Take my experience with a grain of salt...yours may be different...it's for you to decide whether you want to roll the dice on a $700 experiment with the product and Breville's service department. If you read through the negative reviews, you'll find those mirroring my own. Buyer beware."
"This was my first espresso machine. I wanted something that was an all in 1 due to counter space. If I had to do it all over again I would have just jumped into a Pro consumer machine with an independent grinder and figured out the counter space later.This machine seem to work great all the way up until the warranty date. Lol! Could just be my stroke of bad luck or maybe that's just typically when this machine starts having some sort of issues. I'm very particular about my things so I take care of it and clean it constantly and carefully.The most irritating thing about this machine is how inconsistent it is. I can literally do everything exactly the way I did it for the previous shot and 95% I'll get different results. It drives me crazy. Not only that, but for some reason now when the steamer is running. I have water dripping from the shower head. This started about 4-6 months ago, however, it seems to be getting worse. I checked the rubber gasket seal for the shower head and while it wasn't worn I went ahead and replaced it anyways. This really didn't help anything.Also, while the grinder does its job, it does have issues with lighter roasts. I've had to get jammed more than a few times, typically with lighter roasts I've noticed.Not only that, but Breville is almost impossible to get a hold of. Every time I call it says that they've reached their limit for the day for callbacks or customer service. When I do put in my information to get you to call back I never do which is extremely irritating and won the main reasons why I just kind of dealt with the issues I'm having. I just really hope I don't have to come out of pocket to fix this issue and if I do that is extremely cheap to fix or am I just completely upgrade all the way around to something higher quality and more consistent.I really want to love this machine, however it's extremely finicky."
"My wife and I love this machine (when it works), but we've been through three of them in less than 10 years.  We used it a lot:  we probably pulled about 6 double shots a day.  The first one was replaced free when it started leaking after less than a year.  The second one lasted about 2 1/2 years, but developed a problem with the grinder due to steam leaking into it.  We bought another and that one just died after less than two years.  It will not produce pressure any more.When it's new, it's a dream, but I'm convinced they only have so many uses in them before they go.  So as much as we like this machine when its new, we are moving on to something much more durable and repairable."
"I’m so bummed because I was so excited for this! This product is probably amazing for people who have the patience to go through bags and bags of beans to try and get the perfect grind size but it’s not me! I went through two bags of beans (fresh from my local coffee stand) and I could never get the shot to pull just right. I bought ALL the special tools that are supposed to help, followed all the instructions, watched so many TikTok’s and YouTube tutorials and it honestly just became not fun for me and way too complicated. Hopefully I will find another machine that will work better for me!"
"I received the coffee maker, assembled it, but it didn't work. The coffee grinder was malfunctioning. Initially, I thought I had made an error, but everything seemed to be in order. I searched for troubleshooting videos on YouTube and attempted to fix it, but to no avail. I was about to return it the next day.However, after watching one more video, I decided to clean the coffee grinder again.To my surprise, it started working. It's now been a few weeks, and it's still functioning properly. I later discovered that it was assembled in China. Nevertheless, it was disappointing that it broke down on the first day of use."
First thing is that the item send was wrong color but we needed and used it. We got an other brand ty
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I’ve had this machine since 7/25/24 and could not wait for it to arrive. It was fairly easy to setup, not too heavy and was packaged securely. Upon using it I noticed the pressure gauge was not working and didn’t understand why and hoped it would fix itself and was just a glitch. It’s now been 3 weeks and I just got in contact with customer support to help trouble shoot. I would recommend holding onto the packing incase you need to return it for some reason."
"What’s to say about this machine. It worked for the first week or so that I had it. Bought on Nov 5, started to malfunction on Nov 12. The machine makes decent coffee, unfortunately after a week it will no longer make a double espresso. Makes 1/2 once and shuts off. This thing is junk. It’s now a $700 paperweight sitting on my counter waiting to be returned.  Even though this is a Breville, it’s still cheap Chinese junk. FYI: Home Depot sells a clone of this machine for half the price, likely works just as well as this rebranded one. I’m going to find out shortly. I do not recommend this overpriced pile of garbage."
"I purchased this on sale to replace my four year old model which was putting out low pressure. I mistakenly kept it on the shelf for a couple of months before opening it and using it. Right from the start it would not produce enough pressure to brew into the expresso range despite varying grind size or grind amount and using different coffee brands.So I couldn’t return it as it was past the return date ( my fault). SO, I called Breville support and was routed to an overseas tech support. She said she was familiar with the model. I explained that I had the model and had brewed probably a few thousand shots so I was well aware of how the unit should perform and I informed her of the testing I had done and that I wanted to send it to a repair. I repeated this to her several times. Her response was that the new models don’t pressurize the same as old models I called BS on that !! You mean to tell me you  sell a product with a pressure gauge indicating the correct pressure to brew expresso and that it’s normal not to pressurize in that range ? So finally after about 20 minutes of this garbage she finally agreed to send me a return authorization. Based on the unit being bad from the start and the horrible tech support I will never purchase another Breville product.I gave my brother in law my four year old model with the same issues which needed a new solenoid valve assembly.Update: I sent out the Barista Express for repair and just received it back.IT DOESNT WORK ANY BETTER AT ALL !Will not pressurize to acceptable expresso range no matter the grind size or amount of coffee ground.Absolutely nothing in the return box to indicate what if anything was done to it. No invoice nothing.What total P.O.S. !!!!!!Update: Amazon sent me a return label, unfortunately I will Not get all my money back.Having a defective machine when new, sending it out for repair, arriving back as defective as it was out of the box and returning it, so for all my trouble with it,  it ends up costing me about $120.00"
"Long time ago I had an el cheapo Krups espresso machine and it was not a great experience. Somobody had told me that with espresso machines you can either use (moka) Bialetti for $20 or otherwise spend thousands as there was no middle ground. Unfortunately, I believed that story for too long. Eventually I pulled the trigger because I value the Breville brand and I am glad I did. While I continue to like Bialetti moka (more hot coffee), this espresso let me for the first time experience the great taste and aroma of Illy (Classico, beans).  That aroma was never present in Bialetti coffees. And I specifically mean Illy. Some other of my favorite coffees (Peet's Major D dark) didn't work that well so far. I'd be curious about Lavazza, Kimbo, Danesi... All of them may require grinding adjustments. The integrated grinder is good, I am not sure a standalone 'upgrade' would make that much of a difference.  A few years ago I had a $5k machine at work and a $2k grinder -- the results were NOT better than from my current Barista. BTW, I only use bottled (Poland) water. The one thing that you need to buy for this machine, right away, is a 54mm black plastic funnel, sold here on Amazon for about $15k -- to avoid some mess and small coffee loss from grinding. It works perfectly.Edit:Unfortunately, the machine started leaking around the portafilter. When this happens, the machine can hardly be used at all. Breville support doesn't exist. New gasket did not fix the problem. Eventually, googling around, I found how people repair their machines: you need about 2h to open up the machine and unscrew enough parts to get access to 4 screws that can get loose around the grouphead. Tightening them did the whole magic. The idea of the ""repair"" is very simple, but access to the 4 screws is anything but. On the positive side: I do have DIY satisfaction + I now know I can fix it again."
"Have really loved the machine. Our family uses it everyday and it makes a good espresso. Issues run into quality over time, for instance the grinder amount and the size of the grind ends up changing over time and after 4 years our water dispenser gave out. Disappointing as we took care and descaled the machine regularly"
"Let me say that I’m sure it’s partly human error but this unit is so inconsistent that I cannot place the blame on myself entirely. I use this unit for the double espresso feature, often running it twice for my morning fix, and it never makes the coffee the same each time. I have wasted multiple runs because the first was perfect pressure and the second was completely off. Nothing is changed between the runs and the process for preparing is the same so there is no reason for the issue to occur every time. I have tried different brands of coffee with no improvement and I still run the unit 3-5x before it gets to a point I can actually have drinkable espresso.I give it 2 stars because the espresso is fantastic when it works but it’s a constant source of stress and frustration in the morning, when I need little of both."
"Ok. I had my previous breville machine for over 10 yrs and it's still running! I had some issues with my grind and 2 yrs ago thought it would die (it didn't, I handed it down and it's still being used daily). That's why we upgraded to the barista express. We can't really go without our morning coffee (LO is espresso and mine is Americano).About a yr into buying it, we noticed a hairline crack in the protafilter handle. Granted it was probably there well before us noticing it as it was truly hairline and you'd have to see it in the right light and angle to notice it. My bad and I didn't call breville right away since it was 2020 and lots of other things were on my mind. Well, earlier this year I called them (still a hairline crack) and they said there's nothing they can can do as the warranty is one yr and no exceptions. I was truly disappointed as it's obviously a quality issue. The machine has been truly cared for as it was a splurge for us. Anyways, yesterday, the portafilter handle broke.I guess for an average buyer, is the coffee good? Yes! Is it easy to use? Yes! It is 'smart' to indicate cleaning/descaling? Yes! So overall, I have it 3 stars. The coffee is great and it does it's job. Why did I knock TWO whole stars instead of one? Well, it's mainly 1 down for quality (especially since I had an expectation coming in having had my old machine and knowing it's still running daily) and the other star down is for customer service. The only other brand I ever contacted for customer service in my kitchen appliances was ninja and ninja was 110 times better in every way they handled my concern. For what I consider a premium brand, breville really lacked in that customer service.If you are coming as a returning breville customer like I am, you'll be disappointed in lower quality (even the stainless steel is lower grade than our previous breville). But if you're new to the brand, it may be a better product."
I purchased this machine for my friend so I could have great coffee at her home as well as mine.This machine is very loud and doesn't reach pressure.
"This is a decent machine but many flaws. Grinded beans overfill the basket even on the lowest setting, takes forever to get good steam and too froth milk, machine constantly needs maintenance, and the cleaning products are not cheap. I never had to clean and descale my old cheap machine and it lasted for years. The water in the basin constantly needs to be emptied. Not real happy TBH. Wish I had tried others at this price point."
"The positive reviews have it right: This machine produces great espresso shots with rich crema and deep flavors. The steam wand works well and lets you micro-texture milk. I am getting beautiful cappuccinos and flat whites. The machine is a bit needy in how often it wants you to clean and descale it, and it seems to fill the waste water tray rather quickly. However, none of that is a deal-breaker or reason to deduct a star. I also understand that given the combination of high heat and pressure, gaskets will give at some point. The brew gasket blew after three years, but that's an easy (and cheap) fix.Now, after almost exactly four years (just days after the extended warranty expired) the machine died. When I plug it in, all buttons are dimly illuminated (not the typical blinking of the power button, etc.) but none of them are responsive. No espresso, no grinding, no hot water or steam. I called Breville, and here are my (limited) options: I can try to replace certain parts myself, but that's time-consuming and might not even lead to the desired result. Breville offered to repair/refurbish the machine for $300 (picked up and shipped both ways). But that's more than half of what I paid. They also offer a significant discount for any of their machines that cost less than $1,000--still a hefty investment.So, why do I say all this?  After you have read the glowing reviews that are often written within the first weeks, consider how long the machine might last before it needs repair. When I asked, the Breville rep guessed that in average 4 years is the time until repairs are necessary. I do not think that there are any quality control issues or cut corners in the productions. And I believe that it would be much more expensive to build an espresso machine that is more reliable. As odd as it might sound, I would be more inclined to have a $1,000 more solidly built machine repaired for $300 than one that costs less than $600."
A few months shy of two years it sprays water from the group head under pressure. I changed the group head seal which must be done usually each year. I used different portafilters and baskets to see if the basket was the problem. I removed and rechecked the new group head seal and cleaned. The whole thing still just leaks/sprays water when extracting.Two things. Breville reached out to me to start a solution. I got another group head seal on Amazon that did work. It’s third party and came with a different metal screen for what that’s worth and it has been working ever since. So the silicone seal should be replaced annually it’s just that when I replaced the seal it still had the problem. When I replaced the seal again with a new seal and metal screen off of Amazon then it worked fine. The seals are always out of stock on Breville website.
"Looks like a well built machine. Good documentation with instructions on how to setup the machine, and basic steps to make a decent expresso drinks.Mine arrived with these heavy dings on the side.  I was surprised it arrived with minimal foam at the top and bottom of the box but absolutely no side padding at all in the box.Performance so far? I haven't been able to pull a good coffee yet. My drinks are under-extracted and am not seeing enough steam pressure for frothing the milk.  I don't know if the machine is busted or my lack of skills.Disappointing given I was eagerly looking forward to owning a machine like this."
"I purchased this unit for Christmas and it is now Jan. 24th.  Have not been able to get the proper pressure build up and flow.  Great little machine which is why I’m not giving up or putting it down.  I came across a YouTube video were the poster claims a lot has to do with the consistency of the grind.  Like him I tried different grind settings with little result.  Today I followed his instructions on adjusting the grind basket’s number setting.  It’s set at #6 from the mfr., I turned down to #3.  With that adjustment at #3 and the machine’s grind setting wheel on #4 I was able to achieve max pressure.  The flow looked decent and the shot had quite a lot of the “creme” on top.  So far so good.  Will update on status and longevity of these settings.  May require small adjustments in the future, but for now pressure achieved all due the grind’s consistency.Update; 01/25/21,Side grind setting set to #5.  Pressure is holding perfect.  Wasn’t satisfied with shot size so back to research.  According to video reviews a double shot should be 2oz.  With that said the factory setting is off by about 9 seconds of flow to achieve the 2oz.  To make the proper adjustments I recommend using a scale to weigh and time the liquid flow.  Mine is set to about 2.2oz.  Créeme looks awesome, coffee isn’t as bitter, and the longer the flavors stay in your mouth you get hints of Cocoa.  Pretty cool actually.Definitely not a plug and play process.  It’s more like an art and science experiment to get the perfect results.  Why do think you get charged Barista prices when you go to a coffee shop.  It’s all about trial and error.  Also these machines are not industrial service style units.  Longevity will definitely be a concern.  However most is these reviews say that it failed within 3 years.  Think about it, how much have you saved in those 3 years by making your own barrista style morning beverage that usually sell for about $7.00?!?"
"This machine makes fantastic coffee, better tasting than most shops. Unfortunately I had two of them stop working after a year or two of making coffee every morning. Maybe they last longer for occasional espresso drinkers, but the two that I bought were not up for every day usage."
"- This espresso machine is inconsistent. Using the same beans, same procedures, following instructions and it’s not consistent. Sometimes it grids too much, sometimes just right, most of the time too little. Same beans, same settings!- Grinder requires frequent cleaning. I use a shop vac to suck up the coffee that gets stuck in the grinder. That helps for a couple weeks, then is back to tapping the bean holder to get them to drop into the grinder.- Descaling is tedious and must be done frequently. I have hard water, which may be adversely affecting my experience. Reverse osmosis filtered, but no water softener.- The “heated top” is a marketing gimmick rather than engineered. I do not believe it was designed to heat mugs but simply a byproduct of a machine that naturally gets hot. My $15 drip coffee machine gets hot on top, is that a cup warmer too?- Same beans, same procedures, same settings and the pressure is inconsistent. Some days it’s in the “espresso range” other days it’s above or below (i use their “razor” trimming tool).- The grinds catcher-tray holds water too, so it’s difficult to dump (don’t want coffee grinds down the sink because garbage disposal and can’t dump in trash because water) easiest is to dump outside, but no fun in winter.- Machine is wasteful; instructions have you run a cup with no coffee before each brew “to make sure it’s ready”. This is in addition to the excess that drains with each use. Plan on emptying/cleaning the three-piece catch trays daily.- “Time to dump water”, popup is a sticker that began peeling after a few washes.- Very difficult to remove and swap the filter baskets (one shot, two shots). Which also makes cleaning very difficult. Even after removing the filter baskets, I can hear and feel (when shaking) water beneath the (seemingly unremovable) plastic where the filter baskets rest. If I ever managed to remove that plastic, I wonder what disgusting surprise I would find.I have a $15 dollar generic bean grinder and $15 generic drip coffee maker that have been working fantastically for years with minimal maintenance effort. When compared to this $785 espresso machine that gives me more frustration than enjoyment, I’m ashamed at myself for splurging. The only reason I give it two stars is because it’s better than a $70 espresso machine I had once—not ten times better—just slightly better."
"Title says it all. It’s an amazing machine, except the built-in grinder seems to be the weak link. We’ve had it for over 2 years, and the first time the grinder failed, Breville wasn’t able to fix it after we shipped it to them. So they sent us an entirely new Espresso Machine.Just recently, the grinder started acting up again (new machine only 3-months old). We meticulously take care of it and tried troubleshooting per instruction manual and tech support instructions. No luck.The process for shipping it to Breville and getting a replacement took well over a month. If we have to do that again, we’re likely going to just pull the trigger on a higher quality Espresso Machine."
"Update 3/3/20  This machine has been inconsistent in everything.  We asked for a replacement from Amazon and they refused.  We went to return it, after they told us over the phone that we would get a full refund, only to find out they were going to charge a $100 stocking fee on a faulty machine.  We decided to keep it and work with Breville to fix it.  Now, there is absolutely no steam coming out of the wand.  I called Breville again, only to learn that this ""new"" machine we bought from Amazon in October 2019 (less than five months ago and only out of the box since the end of November) was manufactured in 2011!!!  Yes, you read that correctly.  Amazon sold us a nine year old machine as new and now won't stand behind it.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  Who wants to be out $600???  DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE FROM AMAZON!  Go through Breville if you want it.Update 12/19/19  We are changing from three stars back down to one.  This machine just doesn't produce enough pressure to make good espresso and then steam the milk.  We've tried everything and any change that's made lasts a short while before it's not working again.  My husband thinks there is no boiler in this machine - but rather it seems they use an instant hot water mechanism.  This machine is going back. We get better results with our Mr. Coffee espresso machine that is several years old and was $40.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-This was going to be a one-star review until this morning when we finally talked with Breville.  I have been using the machine for a couple weeks (waited too long to open the box to return it).  Before this purchase, I used an Estro Profi, which has lasted 26 years.  It was an amazing machine, but was starting to leak, so my husband bought me this to replace it.  It's still working well and we gave it to my nephew to continue using.  I expected this machine to work the same or better - but it just doesn't.  That said, after two weeks of using store ground coffee, I switched to beans and also switched to the non-dual filter, as instructed.  There was absolutely zero pressure and the coffee was horrible.  No crema, just black blech.  There also wasn't enough pressure to steam the milk long enough to make it hot.  I didn't want to tell my husband because I was afraid of hurting his feelings.  When the machine completely tanked when I switched to beans, I had to tell him.  We tried to contact Breville online, but realized our machine had no batch number, making registering also very frustrating.  They promised to get back to us within 24 hours.  They didn't.  We called and they promised a call right back, and they didn't.  Finally out of complete anger and frustration, we called again this morning and got a different message, and they did call back.  They walked us through making a shot, told us how to reset to factory settings, and also (get this... this is a big deal...) had us switch back to the pressurized filter. Apparently, the other is only good for a certain type of coffee and used within two weeks of roasting.  The directions didn't say that.  They said to use the pressurized (double wall) filter with store bought grounds, and the single wall filter with beans being ground by the machine.  When we made this change, it did work out better.  I'm still not impressed with the machine however, since it's so finicky and definitely not the same quality as the one we let go.  For this amount of money, I expect a heavy-duty machine that can steam 16 ounces of milk and will last at least 10 years.  This is not it.  It is okay - not great."
12/2/2018Opened the box. I loved this espresso machine. For almost a month I had beautiful espresso drinks in the comfort of my home.1/1/2019The coffee bean grinder suddenly stopped grinding. The grinder is making a screeching noise. I shut the machine off and unplugged it. Followed the guide on page 26 to clean the grinder. No luck. Still broken.Followed the guide to disassemble the grinder. (after buying a 10mm socket wrench). Cleaned and reassembled the grinder following the guide on page 26. Still no luck.I'm very disappointed that this espresso machine broke so quickly after opening it. I'm going to contact Breville support to see if they will fix the machine for me. It's unfortunate because I've already spent time and money trying to fix something that should have lasted years without issues.I will update this with Breville response.1/4/2019I called Breville and was on hold for about 40 minutes before a service member helped me out. She was very nice and after a few questions asked me to troubleshoot over the phone. As soon as she heard the noise my machine was making she told me they would do a product swap.  I had the choice of sending back my machine first (they would provide shipping) or have them send the new machine and then return the old machine (with a security deposit on my cc). Since I still had the original box I opted for option one.1/5/2019Dropped the machine of at Fedex1/9/2019The package has arrived to Breville1/15/2019I got a notification I will receive the new machine on the 21st.1/18/2019The machine arrived early.I've finally set it up. This machine sounds so much better than my first machine did. The only thing I thought was wrong with the first machine was the coffee grinder. However I'm beginning to suspect the whole unit was faulty.This new machine makes less screeching and grinding noises than the first machine did. I've only pulled a few shots of espresso but all of these have been significantly better shots than the previous machine.I'm leaving review at 1 star because I'm still very skeptical of the longevity of the machine. If this machine makes it more than a month I'll boost my rating but for now I'll leave it at 1 Star so people can see the negative sides to this machine
"This is a more critical follow-up to my earlier favorable review. Here's the earlier review first:Bought this when the Krups automatic espresso machine failed once again and once too often.This is a better machine--allows you to customize espresso temperature, and allows you to steam the milk to the temperature you want, which the Krups did not. Also, it's quite inexpensive for a machine of this caliber--a hundred dollars less than the Krups, and largely stainless steel instead of the Krups' plastic. Kudos to Amazon for allowing me to return the Krups after almost a year had passed. They asked me to explain why I thought this was appropriate, and when I did they accepted my explanation. Such a good company. Not perfect (hey, what happend to the photos in my Kindle edition of The New York Times?), but so much better than most U.S. corporations these days. As a small private investor, I generally avoid individual stocks--too volatile--and buy index funds, but I'm holding on to my Amazon.And now the follow-up:I continue to be amazed at the consistency of Amazon's customer service. Now for some bad news about my Breville: Quite predictably, and no fault of Breville's, I have to bring in my machine for service once or twice a year. The water here in LA is really hard on espresso machines. I've lived here for 16 years now and its affected every machine I've owned.  To date, I've have gone through $10,000 worth of espresso machines and I think my experience is probably not too far from average. However, the last time I brought in my machine -- amazingly there's only one company, Primo Espresso, that services these machines in Los Angeles -- they told me they'd service it so far as cleaning went, but that if it needed parts they wouldn't do the service. Why? Because their experience has been that getting parts from Breville is unpredictable and often takes weeks. This, understandably, pisses off Primo Espresso's customers who blame them for the delays. They've had enough.When you look at all the Breville reviews of all their machines, you'll find plenty of 5 star reviews -- they're good machines and as functional as any other good espresso machine (this is a fairly low bar, however -- these things are like 70s era Ferraris, all of them -- beautiful to look at, expensive to keep up and prone to eventual terminal failure). But when you look at the one star reviews, you'll see that service has been a continuing problem. Unfortunately, if the authors of some of these outraged reviews are even close to right, Breville hasn't taken ownership of this problem. In fact, one employee seems to have decided that Breville owners are enemies who need to be defeated.I'm forwarding this review to Breville for several reasons. First, I want them to repair the relationship with Primo Espresso. If they don't I won't be able to keep my Breville and a lot of LA area Breville owners are going to be really upset with Breville. Which brings me to my second reason: I've been a musician most of my life but in the process have owned small businesses -- recording studio, jingle house and television scoring business. So I know: being a small businessperson is really hard and if you don't get it right you go down the tubes. My San Francisco recording studio, Different Fur, is one of only two or three Bay Area recording studios (out of hundreds) left from the 60s. The only reason its still there is that I really paid attention to my customers. Eventually I sold the studio, but the following owners were all of the same mind. Patrick Brown, who owns it now, works at the business with unbelievable energy, treats all his clients like longlost friends and the business continues to thrive. What I see when I look at Breville is a company with good products whose reputation is in decline because of a single problem -- customer service. If they don't address it, eventually it'll kill them off. So I hope they  understand that this problem has to be addressed. If they do, by the way, I'll add to this review and tell you so. If you see nothing further, the problem's still there and I wouldn't recommend buying a Breville machine."
"My unit is 15 months old. My 3 friends that had same model said they had no issues, I had read reviews so I bought for the first time an extended warranty on a product. I have used filter water, the charcoal filters and descaled the machine as soon as the flashing or solid light was illuminated. Last week I illuminated before I went on a trip, portafilter , steam and water flow all normal. 3 days away I came back and the steam and hot water did not function. I called customer support, their training extends to if it doesn't function send it in for $264 to get repaired, they have no technical knowledge. I thought that I would de scale it again, the water and steam function worked fine during the descaling and also when I made a coffee again . Support's only input was that the steam and hot water may have scaled up or the switching function was  not working, they did not know if the switch was mechanical or electrical. They had no other input other than to send it in for $264 which is more than 30% of the machine cost. Breville should offer a longer warranty and also if a customer is not happy with support they should transferred to someone with technical knowledge."
"Bought this to replace a 5 year old 870 for which replacement parts are unavailable. I am / was unhappy with Breville when I discovered that many parts are unavailable so one basically has to buy a new machine when the Breville breaks or pay a hefty price to send it somewhere for repair. I didn't want to purchase another Breville but I found that it would cost hundreds more to get another machine with the 870's capabilities. I make mainly lattes and americanos with the occasional cappuccino and I want easy control of the grind, tamp, and milk frothing. These can be done with the 870. The pros; quick warm up time, small footprint, allows / requires user control throughout the entire coffee drink making process, has both single and double wall filters, water tank level easily seen, pressure gauge, pucks that come out dry and easily release from the filter, and built in grinder. The cons; loud, steam wand is just okay with milk frothing being quite slow, only a 1 year warranty, and lack of replacement parts. The grinder on this new machine is much louder than my old one but the grinder controls work better. . Evidently Breville 's quality control is hit and miss. I've had no problem getting the grind correct with either. The repair parts issue and having no confidence that this machine will last very long persuaded me to purchase an extended warranty. For $700.00 I expect to be able to buy replacement parts and extend the life of a machine. Durability and espresso quality were issues with the 2 De'longhi machines that I've owned so Breville is the only option at this price point, with these features until another manufacturer steps in. This is only a 3 star machine until Breville addresses these issues."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This was great for a while, then it came time to replace the gasket, as the old one had started to become stretched out and popped out from its seat.I tried reinstalling the old gasket, then I tried new gaskets from amazon.Those didn't work.I tried new ones direct from Breville.  Those popped out as well.This thing is designed to wear out fast. The portafilter rubs against plastic threads that auger the portafilter against the gasket.  This is just asking for trouble in the long run.Its not a wear part that can be easily replaced so I'm going to start working on a warranty claim.Update #1The warranty claim process is a nightmare.  Its going to be at least 2 weeks that I have no espresso machine.  This is also BY FAR the most expensive coffee maker I have ever purchased, proving that you don't get what you pay for with a lot of companies.  Definitely the first and last Breville product I'll ever purchase.This thing is engineered to fail within a certain time frame, and you can't expect it to last after the plastic grouphead parts wear.  They clearly were hoping to get it to last just past the warranty period then fail so that the purchaser would hopefully buy a new one at that point, but mine just failed a little ahead of schedule.My old Klarstein espresso machine lasted 4 years on the original gasket and the grouphead parts were all aluminum, which isn't subject to fatigue at the temperatures these machines operate at, unlike this one with what appears to be GFR Nylon or something similar holding the portafilter against the sealing gasket.Now I'm looking at this value engineering/planned obsolescence device that I intentionally purchased thinking repair parts would always be available, has me thinking to just go back to cheaper machines that aren't so painful to throw in the trashUpdate August 26, the same exact failure mode happened again, with a leaking plastic group head, this time after 3 months instead of 4, so Breville had me wait for a 2 week turnaround again, and this time sent me a brand new in the box machine.AND IT DOESN'T WORK.The new machine turn on and makes all the sounds its supposed to, but no water comes out through the grouphead or the hot water valve, or the steam wand, so there is a defect in the pump or the piping inside the machine.They've value engineered themselves into a hole, and I'm going to send it in for a warranty  for a third time.  Its insane how much money they are willing to lose in an effort to cut corners on quality.  I'm really hoping to just get my money back and try something else at this point.  Its pretty bad for them to charge $750 for a coffee maker than cant last more than a few months"
"We purchased two Berville Barristas and they worked fairly well until one didn't. I contacted customer service for help and their response was slow to non-responsive.BUT, the kicker is, I was sent a request to review their product this morning.....So I did :-)I gave them a 3-4 star rating, I don't remember which, based on the fact that we liked the product but didn't like they're customer service... or lack thereof.Breville responded stating they are ""moderating"" or in other words, not posting my review because it did not meet their ""guidelines"" for a review.Everything I said in the review was factual in nature. And not really much negativity other than the lack of cs but they apparently didn't like it.They show a 4.5-5 star rating depending on where you look. As I explained to them, any company can get a great rating if they moderate and/or delete low rated reviews. That's not how the system is supposed to work.They wouldn't post my review on their company site so I'm coming here, where I purchased the product, to post my review.The Breville Barrista machine works fairly well and brews a good latte. It can be challenging to dial in when/if you change coffee brands or types but overall, I like it.We had a couple problems with the one machine 3 weeks ago. 5 days after my initial help ticket, Breville responded with a couple generic Youtube links to solve the problem. I tried different procedures to resolve and ended up with another problem with the brewer and reported in kind. That was over two weeks ago. They did not follow up or further respond until I sent the product review in this morning. Only then did they contact me to follow up or try to fix the problem with the brewer.I received additional possible solutions to my problem. I will try the new steps to fix my Breville tonight and let you know how it goes.BTW, my Breville Barrista was less than a year old when I first contacted Breville regarding the problems."
"I purchased this in 2021 and as of a couple months ago it has lost complete pressure.  The wand spits out a stream of water instead of steam now too.  I've kept up with cleaning and descaling as well.I googled everything and even purchased a new pump to consider replacing myself ($30)... however I thought I'd reach out to Breville just in case.  They are going to have me ship it to them (no cost to me) and then they will provide me with a quote.  (From research it looks like it'll be $250 but the lady on the phone had no idea or even a range to give me).  Then from there I can decide what to do.I was offered a 25% discount on a new machine though.... after spending $700 on the first one I told her I'll wait and see what they say.  It's really frustrating that a machine that I really like and love using has quit after 2 years of use.**Also!!! She told me that if I touched the inside of the machine and replace anything, it will void them working on it and I would be required to sign a waiver.  This will also void them working on the machine in the future. JUST FYI for any of you that like to fix your own machines. If you touch it, they will refuse to work with you anymore.**"
"So we bought this in October 2023. We noticed that it could never do a full espresso shot. After a few months of tinkering with it, we thought maybe it was grinds, the press, etc. then eventually after 8 months we thought it was the pump… bought a new pump and sure enough… wasn’t the pump. Same issue. So I don’t really suggest anyone buying this."
"I’ve heard nothing but great things & have tried a friends & it was amazing!I finally got one & the milk wand straight up sucks! It takes forever to heat up milk. And then it’s not even hot. The measuring of ground coffee & shots are completely off. Somehow when I press the button for double shots, it gives me way too much! I have to scrape like 1.5 tablespoons out of the portafilter before it can even fit right when inserted into the machine to make shots. It’s very annoying since I spent almost $650 on this! It’s not a good barista/espresso bar at all, am disappointed. Oh also, when you use the milk wand, squirts out a stream of water for almost 30+ seconds, and you can’t use the milk wand without turning on the hot water spout first for like 2-10 seconds. Effing ridiculous.(Review by an ex barista with 2 years of experience.)"
"I purchased my unit 3 years ago. Since I've had the machine for a while, thought I'd provide prospective buyers with pros/cons:Pros:- Easy to use.- I've used this machine to make amazing lattes (Chai, Matcha and espresso) and Hot Chocolate. In fact my husband, a heavy coffee drinker, commented that he would never get lattes at a coffee shop because these were so amazing. - I loved the pressure gauge, it really helped me fine tune my grind/amount based on the coffee beans I was using.Cons:  - The machine leaks during extraction with water collecting at the bottom of the machine  - The lifespan of this machine is very short. After only 3 years of light espresso use and following cleaning instructions, there is no water coming out of the group head of my machine and no pressure building up, indicative of a bad solenoid.-  Poor Customer Support: I sent the machine to Breville's customer service that reported back that the unit was unrepairable because they no longer had the part or could not source it only to offer a 30% discount on a new machine. Not sure why parts aren't available for a unit that was less than 3 years old.- Due to the leakage issues, there was also rust built up inside the machine.Overall: -  The ROI just isn't there. For a machine that costs close to $700, you would expect it to last longer. The company does not stand behind the quality of its products and has demonstrated that with its poor customer service. If you buy this machine, your happiness with it will be short lived. There are a number of other espresso manufacturers there with better price/performance and product quality. I would skip this one in favor of those."
"This review accounts for a) the initial quality of the breville we bought and b) the warranty you can add on through Amazon with purchase. We've had this machine for a year and half, going on two. It started leaking 3-6 months in. As it was gifted to my by my partner, I didn't think to even say anything - but just started using an insane amount of rags every morning to line the back of the machine. A year in, my partner found out and told me he got the warranty with his Amazon purchse. Great! We send it it once. They send it back and a week later, the leak was back. We send it in twice... and they sent it back, leaking, but this time because THEY cracked the water tray. Now they want us to send it back AGAIN bc THEY broke our machine!! Each time we go 3 weeks without coffee (hard with a newborn) and each time I curse Breville's name for the machine we bought that leaked.When we are in the market again, I am hopeful one of Breville's competitors will have a machine in line with this one - as if it weren't for the leak, I'd sing Breville's praises.UPDATE:If like us, Breville sent you a LEAKY machine and IF like us you were hoping purchasing a 2 year warranty would PROTECT you... RUN, don't walk from this listing. We have sent the machine in a total of 4 times in 6 months. EAch time, the machine starts leaking 1-2 weeks later - their techs are apparently not capable of fixing leaky machines.  50% of the time they have sent our machine back IN WORSE CONDITION THAN WHEN WE SENT IT. Once they sent back a cracked water tray. (We bought a new one hoping not to send it in again..bc contrary to what the ppl in customer service think, we actually didn't want to send it back.) But... then it started leaking again, so we sent it in for a leak AND the cracked tray. We finally get it back, only to discover that they BROKE THE STEAMER KNOB off the machine - I now have to shove it into the machine every time I use it or it plops into my milk when I go to turn the wand off. We were under the impression that if we sent it in again, the fifth time, we'd be reimbursed. NOPE - You have to send it in FOUR TIMES for the SAME problem in order to get reimbursed a machine. Oh, but, even though THEY broke our machine (not once but twice)... we have to send it in again. This feels fraudulent. They shouldn't be allowed to NOT fix our machine and ON TOP OF THAT BREAK IT AND FORCE US TO SEND IT BACK. I BOUGHT THIS MACHINE TO USE NOT TO KEEP IT IN WHATEVER TECHNICIAN'S OFFICE YOU KEEP SENDING IT TO! STOP BREAKING OUR $500 machine and PUNISHING US FOR SENDING IT IN!!!!!!!!"
"The machine was never able to generate enough pressure to make a proper espresso. Tried everything from altering grind fineness, amount of grind, pressure, everything. Sending it back today. And the steamer was not great either."
"After different coffee types and a lot of bad pulls, I returned. I eventually dialed machine in, but coffee always sour and machine can’t go over ~9 bars, even with backflush plug! I purchased a $400 plastic semiauto machine and got almost a perfect shot on first try. Frothier gave better crème too. Go figure..."
"I had been saving $ for quite a while in order to purchase a machine similar to this one. Unfortunately, I have attempted to operate it over 20 times myself. I even had a friend who was a Starbucks Barista/manager for over 5 years & she wasn’t even able to “dial it in” properly. The water pressure would never hit the desired temp, hence the poor performance. This machine is definitely defective. I’d love to “trade up” to have a machine that is simple to use & works properly. Hopefully the company will be willing to work with me."
"I'll get to it in just a bit - I've had some trouble, *twice*.  But first, the pros-n-cons.Pros:  + Built in grinder has done a fantastic job over the year that I've owned the product. Like all grinders (and food prep equipment in general) it has to be cleaned for best performance. That said, it is one of the better grinders I've had at home - conveniently built-in.  + Pours a great shot! Once tweaked a bit, the machine performs predictably, and consistently (when working :-/ -- see below). The guests to our home constantly complement our drinks.  + The steam wand does a fantastic job - I am able to easily pour latte art with all brands of Organic Almond and Coconut Milk. It is a bit slower than a commercial steam wand, of course (30-45 secs or so to microfoam and correct temp), but quick enough to be able to create several drinks for friends. This is not a commercial machine, and should not (could not) be used in that capacity. You are looking at around three minutes-ish, per excellent latte.Cons:  + I am on my THIRD MACHINE in ONE YEAR. Unfortunately, after approximately three to four months each, on my first two machines, the solenoid began to have issues (""arcing"" sound; ""sticking""). No amount of descaling seems to permanently resolve the issue, and unfortunately, the issue begins to disrupt the ""pour"". Breville has been quite nice about the return; however, I have a feeling that I may end up -soon- without support as my warranty expires - at which point I will have a $600 espresso machine that doesn't work properly.  + The auto-grind selector doesn't seem to grind even amounts when selecting between one and two shots. In other words, if I tweak the ""perfect"" amount for a single shot, and then switch over to a double-shot, the dispensed amount is too much. This is easy to work around, of course, as I can manually turn down the dispensing amount for double-shots and up again, slightly, for a single shot. Just a bit of an observation, really."
"Less functional and less efficient than it initially appears. It is really tedious to duplicate your effort and the machine is only responsive to having that exact same combination of factors every time. On the first go around, getting everything tuned in took me a pound of coffee; but, will have to start all over depending on which beans I use next. Speaking of which, changing beans before the hopper is empty is a complete mess. If someone wants a decaf, you need to have a second grinder available. Upon receipt, the default settings for grind size, grind amount and pour volume were all way off. If you want that pressure gauge to climb up at all, will have to powder the beans, pile that grind up until it makes a mess and increase the pour volume considerably (two shot pour, was pulling 1 oz of espresso). Notably, I have also had to increase the shot temperature however have no way to know what the current settings are. The discrete little tamp is cool but getting that pressure right is the only way to pull a dry puck. A 30 lb click tamp is so important to getting this machine to work right, they should have provided a calibrated pressure tamp. The steam wand is either on or off, even though you still have to prime the steam a bit there is no way to vary the pressure - getting stuff up to temp takes quite a while and the provided steam mug is way too small to be practical (use it to prime the steam). You don't see it, but this machine is secretly peeing itself and you will have to empty the drain tray pretty much every time you use the machine. So, extra grinder, extra steaming carafe, extra tamp and some ongoing tuning and maintenance... Less might have been More in this case. In hindsight, Rancilio Silvia is more my style."
Never works the first time even from the start  Troubleshooting was no help and cheating was not either  for the amount of money the manufacturer should stand behind their product
"For the 6 years I had it, this thing made pretty decent espressos, would froth milk OK (never good enough to make decorative artwork), and provide quick hot water for tea.At around 6 years age, it began to leak out the bottom of the machine and the steam was no longer reliable. Seemed to still make OK espresso and grinder was fine.After watching some videos on disassembly and troubleshooting, I went through the process to determine what parts I might need to replace.  Or consider shipping it back.I cleaned it religiously, changed water filters regularly, we don't have hard water but I still decalcified it every 3 months during its whole life.Ultimately, I decided that this is not a solid state device, there are a lot of wear items and getting 6 years out of it was about all one could ask for.  So, in the e-waste box it goes and time to order a higher quality replacement.Summary: It's a great machine if this is your first foray into skipping the coffee shop.  Just don't think it's the last one you'll buy. Think of it like a wear item that will eventually need to be replaced."
"This coffee machine did very well. The taste was excellent, there were many accessories included, but the issues began arising after 1 week. The pressure wouldn’t rise. This had happened to a family member’s one, the same model. Wouldn’t recommend if you don’t want to return"
"I bought this machine in October of 2018 and it worked great for about 6-8 weeks and then the grinder stopped working. Because it was under warranty they replaced it immediately and it worked just fine until 2 weeks after the warranty expired in early October. However, as I write this they have agreed, since the grinder has gone twice in 12.5 months, to send me a new one. So, from a perspective of their customer service they have done just fine. However, I have doubts, especially after reading the comments here about the long term use of the machine, especially the grinder. I wonder about design flaws in the grinder quite frankly. However, I will give it another shot.Here are a few takeaways though:1. I also have a DeLonghi burr grinder that has worked flawlessly for 5 years and I plane to have some pre-ground coffee available to somewhat limit the use of the grinder to try and extend its life. Making sure you have high quality espresso beans with no rocks in it or oily beans to clog it up will help also.2. I gave up trying to call these folks...they either did not answer or stated I would preserve my place in the queue if I left my number....wrong, no calls back. So the best way is to email them.3. The machine makes fabulous coffee and from that alone I would have given them 5 stars but have the grinder go out twice in 12 months takes my rating down to a 3.4. It is possible that these integrated machines from anyone just do not work and the best thing to do is use a nice burr grinder and an espresso maker without the grinder built in.So, I would suggest reading all these reviews and while one normally throws out some of them, be warned that the problems people have encountered are quite real."
"I purchased this originally in 2019. It worked well for about 10 months and then the single and double espresso shot sizes started malfunctioning. The flow of water wouldn’t stop as it is supposed to at the appropriate dosage.It was under warranty and Breville serviced it for free. I didn’t think much of it back then and continued using it.Ofcourse 2 years later, it malfunctioned again, and this time again the same issue. I did some research this time around and am now surprised to see that the flow meter is known to go out every so often. I use filtered water and have a water softener. I clean and descale the machine at regular intervals. So clearly something is faulty with the flow meter that so many people have experienced the issue.I contacted customer service but now it is out of warranty. Little consideration to the fact that it is the same issue as last time, and that these products are not supposed to fail every couple of years. Imagine if that happened to your washing machine, which is about the same price as this machine!Now they are asking for $300 to service the machine. Really, $300 every 1-2 years for a $600 machine? Sounds like extortion.I made a mistake and bought another one for our second home, and am regretting it now. It’s only a matter of time before that also starts to give issues.When you buy this, consider the additional maintenance cost relative to other options where the upfront cost may be higher but it doesn’t require as much servicing."
"I have had the barista express for about 3 years now. I make 2-4 double shots a day often with steamed milk. This is not an espresso machine but an espresso  appliences.Most of the 5 star reviews appear to be from occasional users or those who had the machine for a short time but the real issue with Breville espresso appliences is long term reliability if you do use them a couple of times a day. These machines are made in china with mostly plastic tubing and valves insides. In fact many critical parts that carry pressure and or temperature are made of plastic.  This model has no boiler but simply heats the water on demand it has a rough vibration pump so no one should expect a consistent high quality shot out of this but you can argue that is not possible at this  price. The Barista isn’t cheap but it is much cheaper than a real Italian made espresso machine that will se you back at least 4K with a grinder. So putting the performance of this modest  appliance aside, the main issue is that it has a short lifespan.In my case the grind adjustment lever ( made of plastic) broke leaving the burr almost in contact with the basket meaning no coffee will grind. Breville machines are not user serviceable like a high end espresso machine so the only option is to ship the machine to factory and have them service it. In this case the cost was 50% of the value of a new machine for fixing the grinder lever  alone. Not really worth it.I had pulled some good shots from this occasionally but the pump had becomes very inconsistent lately perhaps signs of it giving in.So overall this is OK for someone who wants to use it occasionally perhaps few times a week but basically a disposable product for a regular volume user."
"I LOVED this machine.  Some cold mornings, it’s really what gets me out of bed and makes me excited to start my day.  When it works, it works really well.  I did a lot of research and after never using any type of coffee or espresso machine, I decided to buy it.  It was very easy to learn to use after watching 15 mins of you tube videos.  It is not intimidating and it looks really nice sitting on the counter.  My issue is with the quality and reliability of the product.  Our first unit started having issues around 3.5 weeks in.  The dial which determines if you’re going to get steam or hot water started to stick and not turn easily.  Since it was within Amazon return period, I exchanged it for the same unit.  Dealing with Amazon is easy.Fast forward to this week (6 months after receiving the replacement unit) and said unit has decided to not dispense the espresso.  There is zero pressure at all.  The unit will turn on.  It sounds like it’s working and then nothing.  I pulled out the book and went through all the trouble shooting and couldn’t get it to work.  Still zero pressure and a drip here and there from the port filter.  I watched multiple Breville and others on YouTube to trouble shoot what could be going on (we emptied out and put in fresh beans, made sure the grind wasn’t too big or too small; water was in unit; we even did cleaning cycles and descaling.  We used the part that causes pressure to back up and clean the unit- nothing..zero pressure.  I even dragged my engineer hubby into fixing it to no avail (he usually can get everything to work).  The unit is being packed up and shipped for repair to Breville.  They were pleasant to work with but I want my $600 plus machine to work and don’t want to wait weeks to get it back.  If I was starting this process of buying a unit, Imwould probably opt for a different unit given that I have dealt with having issues with two of them in such a short period of time.  If this until lasted even two years then maybe I could justify the cost a little more but two units in six months with different problems concerns me."
"Pros: It made great espresso, the grinder worked well, and it did a great job frothing milk.Cons: From the other reviews I've read, we were lucky ours lasted 3 years.  We made 2-3 espressos a day, and at almost exactly 3 years ours stopped pushing water through the portafilter.  It made the same loud buzzing noise it always did but water would just dribble out.  We did all the recommended maintenance and cleaning religiously so I don't think the fault was on our end.  After it broke, I read the one-star reviews here on Amazon to see if others had the same issue and noticed a lot of people weren't as lucky and theirs hadn't lasted as long.  I learned Breville doesn't provide replacement parts but will repair the machines for around $200-$300 (with shipping costs).  Unfortunately, the repairs weren't reliable; machines simply broke again, so I didn't go that route.Instead I did some research and it seemed like the solenoid valve was the most likely issue so I ordered one from a third party for around $60. It took around 3 months for it to arrive, and was fairly easy to replace, but it didn't solve the problem.  Today, while reading more reviews, I realized that the loud buzzing noise ours had made since day one (while the pump is running to make the espresso) was not normal.  I'm going to try and replace the pump (around $45) and see if that helps.  If not, I guess I'll sell it for parts.Since Breville doesn’t seem to provide either high quality products, or at least stand behind them with good customer service and replacement parts, I won’t ever buy a Breville product again."
"THIS REVIEW IS ON THIS MACHINE SOLD BY AMAZON WAREHOUSE NOT THE QUALITY OF THE MACHINE IT SELF.I bought this machine from Amazon warehouse, I was wary about it being used but considering the price it was at it was worth seeing the deal through.They marketed the machine as large cosmetic damage-- I was expecting perhaps various scratches a broken button or something of sorts but still a functional machine.Unfortunately, my fault I assembled all the parts for the machine up to the water tank and filter I plug in the power outlet; MACHINE DID NOT TURN ON. I waited nothing, change power outlets nothing, troubleshooted NOTHING.I was sent a defective item."
"The espresso machine worked great at first for the first year, but when it was at the 14 month period the grouphead/portafilter started leaking. At first I thought I just needed a simple 54mm ""seal showerhead"" which I brought one through Breville directly. However, that didn't didn't solve the problem for long. After replacing with a new ""seal showerhead"" it worked for about 4-6 pulls, and then the grouphead/portafilter started leaking.Instead I took to YouTube for troubleshooting and/or finding similar issues, and came across ""Kanen Coffee, LLC"" video #5071 describing a similar issue. Per the video recommendation I got a ""shim"" and it started to work again but only last for 3 pulls before the leak came back. After messaging the company ""Kanen Coffee, LLC"" from the YouTube video, and explaining my problem, they indicated Breville unfortunately made the grouphead with plastic and based on my description, they indicated the piece was more than likely defective. Additionally, they said there is no way to fix the issue because the grouphead part cannot be replaced. Therefore, now I have a $700 paperweight sitting around in the kitchen."
Love it. It took awhile to dial it in but it is nice. All in one.
"This is our second Breville, our first was purchased in 2015 and the pump has finally given way, after multiple uses daily.  My concern is the packaging used for the new machine. LOTS of styrofoam, all the different parts are packaged in plastic and the cardboard used for additional packaging is shiny so can’t be recycled.  So many companies are now doing a better job, I hope Breville will as well."
"This is a love hate relationship. I purchased the Breville BES870XL in late Nov 2015 as my first ""serious"" espresso machine. As many reviews indicated, it did take about a month to play with it and learn to make a good cup of coffee. Things I learned along the way. Getting a good fresh bean is important. Arabica is the best choice. Grind is important. Coarseness of grind and packing effect the pressure you get in the gauge. All of this is more important than the length of draw. At least when you are first learning. Sometimes too much information just muddies the water...so to speak. After a month or so, I could make a better latte or mocha than my local coffee stand, or at least we thought so. LOVED this machine!!! Since we had been spending significant money at that stand, the breville paid for itself pretty quickly.Now for the not so good. I cleaned the Breville devotedly according to the maintenance instructions on the Breville USA website. But even with consistent decalcifying and regular cleaning, I started having trouble around March. There was a loud buzzing noise at the beginning of the espresso cycle sometimes it would stop fairly quickly and the shot would pull. Other times not and I would have to shut off the machine and start over. A google search showed that this seemed to be an issue with these machines and sometimes repeating the cleaning cycle helped. So I did about 3-4 successive cleans. Yay! It seemed to help. I also switched to bottled water to help prevent further calcium build up. Ultimately, this turned out to be just a band aid and the buzzing was soon back. I called Technical assistance and they were very friendly and helpful. I mentioned that there seemed to be some information online about a common issue and the Tech support person replied that ""Well, there IS a valve..."" Hmmm. I would agree...yes there is a problem with these machines. On another note...Some of the reviews have stated that support promptly sent a new machine. As of spring 2016 this is no longer true. The customer assistance person informed me they were no longer replacing machines Breville sent me free packing materials and instructions to send my machine to Ohio where it was repaired and returned to me. It took about a week to go from western US to Ohio. Three days turn around at the factory and then several more days back to me. When the machine was returned there was still a very brief buzz at the beginning of the espresso cycle. But a check list was included saying everything had been cleaned and adjusted to ""specifications"". And it seemed to be working again. At least that was good. Now it is mid September I have been using this machine to consistently brew 1 to 2 cups of coffee per day and cleaning it regularly per instructions. It is broken again. It is currently putting too much water into the froth when trying to steam milk. Apparently this can be another issue with these machines. It is still under warranty and this will be my second call for service. On a good note...it has paid for itself in latte savings...and it was the least expensive of the machines we looked at. Good starter machine. I sure expected it to last longer though. I will get it repaired under the existing warranty and will use it until it breaks and can't be repaired further. Then will definitely look at something other than a Breville."
"Updated 26 April 2020:So, having spent too long trying to get this thing to work the way it ""should"", I was not able to return it and instead developed ""workarounds"".  Such as, to brew a double shot, set the ground amount relatively low, remove it, tamp it, and then re-insert it to add more grounds, then remove it and tamp it again.  If I pay attention, I can make it ""work"" - though clearly it's not working effectively or as promised.  HOWEVER - today just had a disaster.Needed to add water.  Removed the water tank, and carried it using the folding handle.  Filled to the fill mark, and was carrying it back when the entire tank just fell off of the handle, hit the floor, and shattered.  Frankly, that handle attachment (when looking at it now that it's removed) is simply insufficient to handle the weight of a full tank - filled to the very spec that Breville prints on the tank.  Now the unit is a brick, and I have to wait to either pay for a new tank and wait, or figure out something else.  There was water everywhere, and the tank is shattered to the point that it is absolutely not repairable.  Very very very very very poor design.  Never experienced anything like this before.I purchased this and was quite excited to receive it.  This is far from the first espresso machine I've owned.  I followed the instructions implicitly and completely for setup and preparation.  I used recently purchased (1 week) Lavazza Super Crema beans.The problem is that right off the bat, I couldn't get the pressure gauge to get ANYWHERE near proper pressure.  Setting the grind to 5 (as per starting recommendations) and the dose to ""middle"", the needle didn't really even go into the ""pre-infusion"" range.  I probably experimented with at least 20 attempts.  The closest I could get it was to turn the grind all the way down, and turn the dose up to where grounds were essentially falling off of the ports-filter.  At that point, I finally got the gauge to show it getting barely into the ""Infusion"" range.I emailed Breville support, but got no response.  I called, waited for a while, and then finally did the ""call back"" thing.  They called back 4 hours later, but obviously some people have jobs and don't stand in front of their Espresso machine all day long.  They (Breville) effectively has no real evening or weekend support hours.  Period.  That person said that if the coffee beans were not roasted within the last 3 TO 5 DAYS (No, that's not a typo) then it may not correctly dose and infuse with the single wall filter.  He said that this was the reason they provided dual wall filters.  I pointed out that every single bit of documentation shows that the dual wall filters are intended for pre-ground coffee, and he (Thomas Mulero of Breville Support) hung up on me.I am deeply disappointed in my experience with Breville."
"Returned this product after owning it for 4 weeks. I had a previous Breville model and it was great - wanted to try this model instead. After 4 weeks, the machine stopped pressurizing. I called support, they claimed it was my beans and that the filter cup was clogged (despite being 1 month old and I showed on the video call that it was not clogged). They said they would ship a bag of beans and a new filter cup. I use the dual wall cup for another week, and received the new beans (never received a filter). Tried the new beans with the original filter cup and still had the same issue. Called customer support again and spoke with the most condescending man I've ever spoken with. He was not paying attention, not helping, demanding that I quickly do things without providing reasoning or assisting. Halfway through diagnosing the problem, he put me on hold for 5 minutes and claimed he would call back once this was escalated. When he called back 2 hours later, he claimed that I needed to send it in for repair. It was a month old, and under warranty. I asked why they couldn't send a new one as we had spent 2 calls and over an hour trying to fix it via video and he said they just couldn't. He said it would take 3+ weeks to receive the product back and offered no other help. When I asked to speak with someone else, he said someone would maybe call me back in 48 hours. Given this experience, I will stay away from Breville products. I was extremely disappointed with how the customer service rep handled the call, and in the end he suggested that I return the product to Amazon as defective since I had 1 day left on my return window.Note: I had fresh coffee, had just ground the beans, changed the grind size, changed the filters, cleaned all the accessories, and tested for pressurization with the rubber filter. It was not user error given that the customer support rep could also not solve."
"I followed all the instructions but the pressure gauge wouldn't reach the gray line. I watched multiple videos about it and tried the machine many times, but it still wouldn't work. How can I fix this?"
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This espresso machine made great coffee until the grinder was broken. It started to make an unusual voice that would wake your neighbors up in the morning. Only 3 months after purchase.....
"It’s been over a month to test and to properly review. Since it’s such a popular appliance, I‘ll focus on my 2 main feedback instead of a full review.The hopper that feeds the beans into the grinder often presents an issue. Because it’s shaped like a bowl, the beans don’t fall into the grinder. I find myself with a spoon in hand to try to push beans into the grinder opening. I really wish there’s a bigger narrower hopper so gravity can do its job.Since it’s a single boiler, I am mindful to have the milk pitcher and towel ready so I can quickly switch from espresso mode to steaming milk. If there’s a pause before using the steamer, there’ll be a lengthier heat up period.My main regret is not getting a separate grinder. It may be a cheaper alternative but take up more counter space."
"This machine had worked like a champ ever since first purchase on 7/12/22.  So yes here I am some 19 months later to warn about this purchase.  I thought the machine had a 2 year warranty but alas it is only 1 year.  So problem developed that the machine would make pressure fine but would not deliver any significant liquid volume when pulling a shot (single or double). So I remove the shower screen head and to my dismay (evidenced by the attached image) the protective coating to the shower spray head is delaminating and causing black material (who know what it is exactly) to clog the spray head screen.  Open case with Breville (who states a prompt 2 business day follow-up) and finally after waiting 8 days with no response to my claim, I called back to customer service. The response was appalling. Too bad so sad it is a 1 year warranty and we cant (read won’t) assist you in anyway. So after spending $649.95 for this machine I’m left with a nice boat anchor.  Buyer beware."
"I had a cappachino maker years ago. I decided to research a really nice one for myself and my wife. The Breville had good reviews and price was not the most expensive (or cheapest). I read all of the directions twice. Then trouble shooting guide. Not that complicated. I packed the coffee into the cup with 40lbs of pressure to make it fairly dense. This ‘somewhat’ imprived the low pressure/temperature problem, but I the espresso still came out like warm at best. Then the grinder stopped working.To say this is a disappointment would be an understatement. There are other, more expensive espresso/cappachino machines with their owns problems (plus complaints of poor customer service). There does not appear to be a good quality machine on the market at this time…This kind of reminds me of the ‘top rated’ Toshiba HVAC system we installed 4 years ago. Nothing but problems. Service calls every 4 months, problem temporarily fixed, then fails again. Now going on 20k in service calls. Not enough to sue over according to our attorney… It is almost like the desire to engineer and build good quality equipment is a lost art.Btw, I leave positive reviews 95%+ of the time. This is the first negative review I have left in ages. Thank God thus failed within Amazon’s 30 days return policy."
It is just way way too expensive for what it does. You can buy a lot of Keurig for what this coffee station cost.
"Very disappointed in three ways.1. The filter funnel could be easily redesigned to avoid the possibility of locking it onto the head unit. Instead, the manufacturing company provides a big sticker warning you not to lock the funnel onto the head unit!2. There is a useless ""accessory tray"" stuffed behind the drip tray. It appears that the drip tray is intended to hook onto the acc tray so you can pull it out. It mostly does not hook on...forcing you to reach in and pull it out. Near impossible through the ~1 inch opening!3. The water tank is difficult to access for filling. The unit does not slide on the countertop, forcing you to try and lift and slide out to access. There are no good lifting points and you end up lifting water tank off trying to move the unit out from under cabinets. It is rather heavy.Poor user-friendly engineering."
"It's works good, but the taste of the coffee is not much different than other brand espresso machine"
"So I always try to start out with the good: Breville's Barista Express feels like its built well, very hefty and solid, and it looks nice on the counter. Also, it comes included with a wide range tools that are actually good quality (milk pitcher, tamp, leveler, cleaning tools, etc). This is where the good review ends.My experience became teeth gnashingly frustrating almost from the moment of unboxing. We (my husband and I) followed the ""quick start guide"" instructions included to the letter, and while they were easy to understand and follow, we soon found out that they did not include nearly everything a new buyer should know. The level of adjustment and calibration needed to get started is ridiculous, and we did every single thing the user manual suggested but NEVER got a good cup of coffee. I went through an entire bag of new coffee beans but the grounds never changed coarseness (despite following instructions to remove a pin and change ""range"" manually) or created crema at all (I know for a fact I did everything on my end to maximize this). The coffee was always bitter and thin! We eventually also noticed that the water pressure was very low despite the positive reading on the gauge.So after we tried everything we could we thought, ""maybe it's something we haven't thought of"" so we tried to call customer service. Almost all day the line was busy, and the two times it actually picked up, the call machine told me to ""leave my number when prompted to be added to a call-back list"" despite never receiving a prompt. Then it hung up on me! Dead end! So we were like ""okay maybe they're busy for Christmas, we'll just write a question on their support site"". When we went to the site, both the links for the manual's PDF and to contact customer support sent us to unrelated pages!! So basically, customer service for Breville products does not exist.It was at this point my husband and I decided keeping this product was not worth the time or effort, so we returned it. It should go without saying that if you spend almost $500 on anything, it should work as advertised, and if for some reason cannot you should have someone available to help!! What kind of company leaves you high and dry like that? (Dry because there was no coffee in my mug today kthnx) We are very annoyed and feel scammed. Don't let this happen to you!"
This machine lasted three years before the grinder continuously stopped working. Worked well for the first couple years.
"The only reason this gets 3 stars is that we like the espresso flavor.  This machine is poorly designed and the mess is insane.1) When grinding the coffee into the filter basket, it needs to be a heaping mount to tamp it into a shot. Grinds spill all over the machine.  I would recommend purchasing a dosing funnel for about $20- 54mm Dosing Funnel for Breville Barista Portafilters.  It saves a ton of grief.2) the conical grinder at the top is poorly designed.  after grinding one dose, you need to hit it at the top as the beans don't settle down to the bottom, resulting in an incomplete grind and fill of the filter3) the water reservoir is at the back of the machine.  To fill it you must remove it from the machine.  This means every time you fill it you have to pull the machine away from the wall.  The slot at the top of the reservoir is narrow.  unless you are extremely careful in filling it you will get water all over the outside.4) when the bottom tray fills up, it will tell you to empty it.  It is narrow and wide, which adds a challenge to carry to sink to empty."
"Great machine for homemade espresso but the portafilter effectively broke (narrow metal ring that seats the inserted coffee filter bent/separated).  Currently trying to figure out how to actually remove the basket filter now stuck in the machine and purchasing a new portafilter.  I've probably only made 120 brews, so pretty disappointing a key piece already broke."
Had u it for 15 months. 3 months out of warranty. Water pump failed. Not possible to get through to support. You get a blurb about phone trouble and they will call you back. Except they don’t. Tried for 3 weeks. Terrible support.Similar experience with a toaster. Nice unit. You paid top dollar and it doesn’t last.
"My grinder stopped working after 18 months. Looked up online and found several occurrences of the same issue, which is a defective sensor on the button the portafilter hits to activate the grinder (which you can find online for $5). Breville support gave me an inaccurate response over email (they sent me some step-by-step instructions on how to unclog the grinder) then never replied to my follow ups clarifying the issue. Called them directly and they charged $200 to fix the machine, plus you have to send it to them over mail (hint: it's very heavy). Don't recommend. Get a simpler machine and buy a separate grinder."
"I got this espresso machine because I saw it on a friend's house. Amazing coffee. I had the highest expectations with it. Very expensive for an entry level espresso machine. After I received it, I went through all pages of the user manual, every single online tutorial you can imagine and tested ALL setups possible. Different coffee beans, finer, coarser, hotter, colder, very well dumped, single wall, double wall.... literally every single way to make espresso coffees and not a single time I got the Gauge in the espresso range. At all! I've contacted their support, we made a video call, they tested the pressure, which was working moderately well, but even with them on the line, I wasn't able to get any coffee. Their official solution was: we'll send you one of our coffee beans samples. I explained that any espresso machine out there will work with any coffee bean. I explained that if this machine ONLY works with special brans, ""to date"" (which I tried and didn't work), it doesn't serve to my needs. It's just too expensive to be so little versatile. I hope this review helps other buyers still in doubt. I strongly recommend NOT to buy this. Get something else."
"I read all the reviews for this machine especially ""VR"".  I printed his review and followed all of the do's and don't.  Bought all the accessories.  We have not been able to dial in the correct amount of coffee to get the machine to flow evenly.  It just drips, and drips.  The biggest issue beside the drip/drip is the portafilter handle is hollow and water moves through it.  I called the 800 number regarding this issue and their is nothing they can do to not distribute old water into your expresso.  Pretty sad situation regarding both issues.  I do not recommend purchasing this machine if you have no knowledge of the amount of grinds to use.  We have watched several youtube videos.  we have tried to dial in the exact amount to no avail."
"What the description does not tell you, but I saw one in a local store, is that you have to do a TON of work to get a cup of coffee. That's fine if you want to be your own barista.Returned unopened package, it was received 3 weeks ago, but no refund yet. Not impressed."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I've had this espresso machine for months now so I've gotten to know it well and I have a long list of reasons why don't like it. 1st off it waists a lot of water I drink a few esspessos a day and about every 3 days I need to empty they water tray it's a significant amount of water! I hate waisting water! 2nd I can't get a good crema out of this machine I've watched so many videos on this specific machine on how to get a good crema but no matter what i try no crema. I've tried fine grinding it all the way up to course. I've bought tampers that are supposedly the exact amount you need didn't help. I've also experimented with tampering it down tight all the way to loose. I've used ulta expensive fresh beans measures out, still no crema I really hate this machine it was expensive and doesn't even give a crema. I had a really cheap espresso machine before this and it made a crema every single time! I feel terrible for spending so much money for this machine when my old cheap one was better. 3rd the water tray is magnetize to the storage tray behind it so when you try to pull this tray that's full of water out the magnetized storage thing is stuck to it and if your tray is full it spills water all in it while you are trying to release it's magnetic pull to the storage thing grrr!Update I bought my old espresso machine that I had before and made a video how it make a MUCH better espresso it's also much simpler and doesn't waste any water not to mention the coffee tastes much better."
"When I first got this, I was ecstatic... literally in espresso heaven! Everything was so slick and the crema was just perfect. I had worked mostly with my basic moka pots for years and had enjoyed a couple of lower-end machines. I was looking for real crema vs. steamed strong coffee (which, don't get me wrong, is delicious... but it was time.) So, I read and I researched. I finally pulled the trigger for this machine and found myself looking forward to getting up in the morning! No joke. I couldn't believe it myself.One morning, around the five and a half week mark, the grinder switch didn't work. No sound, no click, nothing. No ground coffee. Fortunately, I had another burr grinder and got my coffee.I set out to clean the Breville grinder so it would work again. It didn't. I followed instructions, watched YouTubes and even had a pro barista friend (shop owner and roaster) talk me through some possibilities. I thought I had it but still no grinding going on. The next day, it worked. OK. I figured something had been done correctly and now we were fixed. Two days later, no grinding.It was on and off for several days before it conked completely. Then, the unthinkable happened and the coffee was no longer crema. The machine stopped reaching the necessary bars to make espresso, so I was drinking, as my barista friends dubbed it, ""dirt water."" I was diligent with the grind, making sure to tamp the espresso for crema but still just dirt water. I had my friend grind me some espresso in his Rancilio and still didn't get espresso crema.So, I went back to my moka pots and started the return process on this. I fully believe this was a fluke. I can't imagine that this is something that happens often because the reviews are too good, so I'm writing this off but thought it was important to share.I have replaced this with a semi-auto Gaggia Classic Pro. It has no grinder and nothing fancy (so less to go wrong, I theorized) and, so far, I think I made a good choice!If you get this Breville, I hope it works out for you."
"We've only had this a bit over a month but so far we really like it. Good looking machine, great compact size, decent pressure for foaming milk, overall works very well and our cappuccinos are coming out better all the time. There are lot's of adjustments that can be made so it can take a few tries to work out grind, tamping pressure, water volume for shots etc, just what I was hoping for. If the rating was for the machine alone I would give it 4+ stars for sure.The downside is that as soon as I opened the box, there's was big notice ""This product contains substances that are suspected of causing cancer"". That's a paraphrase but it's essentially what it said. I called Breville and they weren't ready, willing or able to tell me exactly what those substances were or where in the machine they were, but assured me that all the parts that come into contact with anything that's consumed is tested to be safe. Apparently this is a California code thing and I assume (since Breville was absolutely useless and not helpful at all) it's probably some grease or lubricant that's used deep in the machine and is toxic if you eat a pound of it. I think it's quite lame that Breville is not more forthcoming about it and consider it a major weakness for the brand. I can't figure out what they're hiding or why but 1 star for customer service in this area. Really a shame. Also, I've read from other posts on line that the grinder can break down pretty quickly so we sprang for the 3 year service plan. I know those are generally a rip off but figured I'd cover myself on this one."
I have had one of these machines for almost 10 years and loved it. I bought a new one 2 weeks ago and it is defective it shuts off after three seconds of pressing the button to brew a double espresso.I tried to get a replacement through Amazon and they said NO. I Was willing to purchase a new machine while the other one was in Transit back.However they increase the price of $150 which is probably why they refused to replace it. Amazon told me I would not have any better luck with the manufacturer. Buyer BEWARE.  What kind of company doesn’t stand behind their 30 day exchange policy ? I will be looking at another manufacturer
I bought this machine and the expresso came out water more than half and very bad taste. Not pleasant at all so I can’t recommend it.
The machine doesn’t reach the right pressure for espresso brewing. It is not performing as expected. Now I am stucked with a $700 plus dollar investment that doesn’t deliver. Would like to either have a replacement or get it fixed.So far it is NOT RECOMMENDED.
"We liked it at first although we used it less often than we had planned. Unfortunately, the pressure gauge stopped working long ago, which makes it somewhat difficult to tell how well it’s working. Thus, it’s definitely not worth the purchase price. I do not recommend."
"Got this machine from “Its a Deal.” Huge mistake! Had it two days and it stopped working on the second try. We watched troubleshooting videos to make sure we were using it right and saw many others had the same issue with a defective product. So we tried reaching out to the seller. No response, so we returned item to It’s a Deal In it’s original packaging. I even used my dust buster to remove any coffee grounds left in the grinder. We get our refund of $394 of the original $699 purchase!! Do you know what absolutely ridiculous excuse “It’s a Deal” used for not refunding the full amount??? We sent it back USED, filthy, and still working.... so they justify keeping $300 as a “restocking fee” because they cannot RESELL it! Just so buyers are very warned about this seller selling defective and most likely refurbished products as new, we purchased this SAME product again, but this time through Amazon. It arrived last week and we have enjoyed ten cups of Awesome espresso since then! The machine is working great! By the way “It’ A Deal” do you want to see the photos of your machine taken when we sent it back??? It was packaged and cleaned perfectly and not how you claim! I will be happy to post those pictures right under your response! Buyers be very aware!!!! We should have known something was up when their return address was a residential apartment complex!! I will be taking this up with Amazon.  UPDATE: I finally got a response from this seller. He claimed he sent us troubleshooting information. He did... this morning at 9:23 a.m. THIS MORNING after I made this post and a week after we returned the machine to him! He also claimed it was out fault the machine didn't perform. We bought the exact machine last week directly from Amazon and it works perfectly! We also learned this seller distributes these machines out of his residential apartment at 5294 Bishop Street, Apartment D Cypress, CA. There is no company registered with the BBB called ""It's a Deal"" either. He kept $300 of the purchase price for ""restocking fees"" on a defective machine he states he can't sell again. If this is not the epitome of crooked and dishonest third party sellers on Amazon, I don't know what is! Stay away!"
messy all over the counter  frother is messy
"The unit is a very attractive looking machine. It had the features you would want for making the perfect espresso and drink for your taste. It grinds, portions and brews on with one unit.BUT, is it really worth the price tag? Honestly?.. No. Even on “sale” during Prime Days this cost over $600 with tax. You have to play with the grind setting to get it to brew just right, otherwise it over or under extracts. I would rather have saved a few hundred bucks and purchased something just as good but for less money."
"The Barista Express has a serious design defect: the screws above the shower gasket come loose and pressurized espresso blows out the shower gasket. You have to dismantle the espresso machine with special tools to fix it. I like the machine so much I ordered another one, but in 2-3 years when the new one blows, I'll have two to fix. Be warned, this is a factory design flaw on all of these machines. Read the 1-2 star reviews."
"Updated review a couple months after the warranty expired;Original review:I am really happy with this espresso machine. I love grinding the beans ""on demand"" right when going to pull the coffee. I guess that gives the freshest flavor.I have used home machines before. Always it was really difficult getting the coarseness of the grind and the packing of the head just right so that the pressure was correct to properly extract the espresso flavor from the grounds. The pressure gauge on this unit has totally taken the guesswork out of the process. I love it. I have been able to dial the coarseness of the grind and the strength of my tamping to get the pressure gauge to sit right in the middle of the desired range. This is giving me very nice crema on the espresso and a very reasonable extraction speed. I really like it.I also like having the integrated grinder so it's super easy to tweak the coarseness of the grind up or down just a tad.For steaming milk, the machine is not quite a perfect. When the machine just heats up, first a bunch of liquid water comes out, then it takes a minute for the steam to start. It would be nice if this was faster. HOWEVER, this is just a home unit at a very reasonable price: not a $3,000 commercial unit. So I think a little delay getting steam is fully understandable.Cleaning is reasonably easy. Though there probably could be a more graceful way of handling overpressure water rather than dripping it down below the tools tray. Why not drip it into the catch basin itself? Not a big deal. Easy.The one feature I would ask for would be a 1/4"" water connection so that households with plumbed filtered water can skip the water reservoir and just plumb directly to a filtered water line. But again this is just a $600 home unit rather than a multi-thousand dollar commercial unit so it's understandable this feature is missing. (But it sure would be nice.)We texture both regular lowfat milk for me and almond milk for my wife. Works well with both though strangely not all milks are created equal. Horizon organic milk textures particularly well.Update:I have now owned the machine 18 months. It's been out of warranty 6 months. And now it rolls over and die. No pressure. No coffee. No cleaning cycles. I am wondering if I have a $700 piece of garbage or if it'll be fixable, and how I'll get it to them to fix, and how much it'll freakin' cost me. Very very very unhappy."
The grinder is inconsistent both in density and quantity. The pressure is sometimes perfect and the next time it’s low. The liquid output varies between a few drops and the exact amount I’ve selected. I’ve wasted many pounds of beans trying to make this darned thing work and it’s still completely inconsistent. I **know** how to make espresso manually. This was supposed to automate the process.What’s worse is that I own TWO of these pieces of garbage. I bought a second when they were on sale. It was slated for use at my ski condo so it’s still sealed in the box. Watch for it on CL or FB marketplace!
"Wouldn't steam, first failure.  Then 4 months later grinder went out failure 2, then steam failed again failure 3, now it's out of warranty and whole water system doesn't work and they won't stand behind their product even with this failure history.  Complete junk!  Don't waste your money.  Company is zero help.  They sent me descaler powder and the entire water system doesn't work...genius!  I honestly would give them zero stars if I could."
"I bought this little Keurig, because of its compact size, specifically for my RV. It can be hard to find a single serve coffeemaker that has enough room for my tall travel-type mugs, but this one does. Most taller mugs hold 16 - 20 oz, so one could assume the little Keurig can brew enough to fill a 16 - 20 oz mug.No. Not really. At least, not without some awkward adjusting.Followed the instructions to run water through before brewing the first time. Then used my own brew in a compatible K-cup and brewed my first cup.PROS: The coffee is nice and hot. The little Keurig is compact, fits in a small space well. Like the color. Heats the water fast. Brews quickly. Easy to wipe clean. Lightweight. My compatible K-cup fits (mostly...sorta).CONS: What a waste of money! I'm sitting here shaking my head, wondering how Keurig let this model slide...To begin: water just spits out and into the cup below. I'm lucky I was using a tall Yeti, otherwise I'd be wiping all the hot water spots off the Keurig and the counter..Then to fill my 20 oz Yeti: first I hit the 10 oz button and let the coffee brew. Open the top, close the top, then I hit the 8 oz button. The Keurig complains about the water level, even though it's still 2/3 filled - so I fill it to the top (WHY???). Open the top, close the top, hit the 8oz button.It doesn't brew, so I do these steps all over again.It does complete the brew the second time I complete the steps.When I brew a cup of coffee, I don't expect to have to coddle the coffeemaker. I want to hit the button, walk away, and come back to my Yeti filled with steamy, hot coffee.I give this little Keurig big points for being compact and ultra cute (for a countertop appliance), but as far as brewing coffee for my Yeti?A fail.It doesn't matter if the price is good or not if I can't brew a simple travel mug of coffee easily and quickly.Keurig - you need to step up and fix this. I'm very disappointed; this build is cheap feeling and temperamental."
"I purchased this to have my own little personal coffee maker at my desk at work because the coffee drama in the breakroom was unreal. I've been using this Keurig for 3 months now and I can confidently say, I could and should have found a better model. The compact size is perfect for my somewhat limited space. I do love that I have 3 sizes of cup to choose from, and I was easily able to install the reusable K Cup so I don't contribute to the plastic problem more with those ridiculous disposable cups.However. . . . . . This unit is very loud for one thing. Not a deal-breaker, but wow! Coffee splashes everywhere so I have to wipe everything down after every brew (so, two to three times a day). And just this week, when I select the 10 oz brew, it spits out about 1/3 to 1/2 of that amount then just stops. So I have to open the top to reset it, and select 8 oz to get it to finish the job without overfilling my cup. Not sure what's causing that, but it is a concern, considering I've only had this little guy for 3 months.Overall, if I could go back, I probably would have purchased one of Keurig's higher end units. I got what I paid for, for $69.99."
"I have had the Keurig for about 2 months now and I primarily make my own k-cups. My family uses k-cups and I’ve noticed that the hole made on top of the cups is usually too big and coffee grounds are found in their coffee. For myself, I purchased the reusable cups and have forgotten to put the red rubber ring in the top a couple of times. Ok, that’s my fault, but there is absolutely no easy way to clean out the machine. Why I can’t get a cup specifically for my machine, I don’t know, but it’s infuriating each time I make a mess. I spend at least 45 minutes each time I forget the dang ring to clean it out of the top. And, I still find grounds in my coffee for days. So, 3 stars because it does work and you will get a piping hot cup of coffee. However, I don’t think that I can recommend this product based on my review above. Excluding my mistakes, you will still end up with some grounds in your coffee."
"I normally drink ground coffee and got tired of the mess that a filter and grounds can make.  Plus, 2 months ago my carafe broke, then 2 weeks ago the coffee maker broke.  So figured I would try one of these.  I make my coffee STRONG....I also only have one to two cups a morning.  Normal cups, not 10-12 ounce mugs.  Again, thought I would try these.  If you are use to strong coffee...you will not be satisfied. If you aren't, then you will love this thing. I have tried the French Roast and Colombian, set on bold.  The Columbia came out the strongest, but still lacking.  But I was smart enough to read the reviews and purchased a Keurig Universal Holder that works perfectly for this machine.  I packed it with my Colombian coffee...and BAM!  Not the same strength but good enough.  It is so fast and easy to do.  Yes, cleaning out the universal holder is not as easy as the k-pods, but easy enough and I don't have to deal with coffee grounds everywhere.  Next winter, I am sure it will be great for my kids with the hot chocolate action for it.  So I do really like it.  Now the bad.  Why does the 'add water' light come on when there is PLENTY OF WATER still in the tank?  Is this a defect?  Has to be because it doesn't make sense otherwise.  I will be contacting them to find out.  And really?  You want me to pay $17 more for a long plastic spike that holds a carbon filter, and includes only 3 of them? Wow.  But, other then that, I really do like it.Update: I have returned this maker.  It worked as it should, but as I said before, if you like your coffee strong, this isn't for you, and certainly wasn't for me!  After 5 cups of coffee on bold, different types, double caffeine, etc, I would start to 'feel' a little awake.  Freak'n ridiculous.  And the water thing....why does it say to 'add water' when there is at least 10 to 12 ounces still in the tank.  NOPE, not for me.  Moved on....."
"I just got mine in January and already it has stopped working.  I ran out of water one day and it stopped working even after I filled it.  Tried unplugging it, letting it sit and nothing has worked.  We used the reusable pods and they did something to the machine so we had to hold the lid down so it would brew.  Just not sure if it’s as durable as my older machine."
"the box it came in wasnt taked well and all it was covering it was the cardboard things and the plastic bag,but thats not the normal box you'd see this product in and wasnt packaged well,this seems to be refurbished or used. i bought it for the 59.99 price ,so im kinda mixed feelings about it,but the item looks okay and worked first try had a odd smell,but not to bad."
I had a Keurig for years and it was great coffee was hot. Fill the cup up no problem until it started a leak. I now have a new Keurig. It’s very cheaply made nothing like the other one. It doesn’t even fill a cup up for the highest point you have Very cheap plastic very very disappointed in the Keurig product.
"Here is what i dont like.  Add water to it - thats it, add water,  not TO FILL LINE.  Add enough water to make what tf you want.  Dont flash the Add Water bs light when the water is a hair below the ""Max Fill Line""  .  This is bs.  And i know where it was designed and by whom."
"I admit it. I am a coffee maker addict. I have 4 in my home and 2 at my office. Over many years I have owned almost every brand and type of coffee maker. I stand by Ninja as the best drip maker. Their barista line allows you to do just about any type of coffee you want. I have a Bielleti stovetop espresso maker and a larger espresso machine on my countertop.Above just to make a point, but let's talk about this little Keurig. I wanted a compact pod unit that I could use on those mornings that I  don't feel like messing with filters, grounds, tamper, etc. But I did not want to compromise on the taste. I love this little thing! Love the fact that you have 8, 10 or 12 oz option for cup size. Love the fact that it has a ""strong"" button. Push the strong button before you choose your cup size. The water tank holds enough for me to have two cups each morning for two days.  The coffee temp is hot.Remember,  the quality of the coffee you brew, no matter which type of brewer you use, depends not only on the appliance but also the coffee you choose. Enjoy!Edit: 4/26/23.  Well the Keurig curse has commenced. I hesitated to purchase because of problems with two previous keurigs. Actually three. Two at home, each just randomly dead after about a year. And yes, I descale. Now my little Keurig that could, can't. I've cleaned it. No matter which oz size you select, it brews about 2 oz and then slows to a stop. No more Keurigs!Edit: 06/23/23. Last edit. To be fair, had to edit one last time. Was going to toss it. Decided to try a last ditch effort. Watched tons of videos on YOU T. (you know what I mean)  I had already descaled x 2 even though no light had told me I needed to. Followed specific advice on one video. After de-scaling, I removed the keurig cup assembly and soaked it in a baking soda/vinegar/water solution for about an hr. Cleaned and dried it all. Took a needle and scraped in between all three tiny spaces on the small prong that pierces the keurig cups. It did have some microscopic coffee grounds stuck in it. Put everything back together, unplugged it, took off the water container, held it upside down and smacked the top of the machine a few times like a newborn. (No, I'm not crazy, that was part of the video)  Plugged it back in, filled the water container and it has worked fine ever since then. Changed back to three stars as it now seems to be ok, but it should make you pause when there are tons of videos on what to try before you throw your keurig away. Just sayin."
"I was given a Keurig Model B31 about 10 or 12 years ago as a gift. It has given me literally thousands of trouble-free cups of delicious coffee. I literally wore the word BREW off the button (see photo). It finally gave up the ghost on me a few days when it started leaking profusely. Foolishly thinking that 10 years of time to develop improvements would create an improved but still basic version, I immediately replaced it with the Model K-Express. After 5 cups of the same coffee I've drunk for many years, I have found:o  Even though it starts heating the water much faster than the B31, it takes longer- or at least just as long- to get a brewed cup of coffee than the earlier model. Which is unbelievable.o  The same coffee doesn't taste as good.o  It is remarkably- and again, unbelievably- louder, for most of the brewing process. The noise? Think Jeff Daniels in the bathroom scene in Dumb and Dumber.o  It is messier than the older unit. The B31 directed all of its water down in a single stream, with 100% of flowing into the cup. The K-Express ejects the output more as half pour and half spray, with the result that the counter around the unit collects little brown circles over a wide area (see photo). I never wiped a drop of coffee from the counter with the older model (using the same coffee cup).o  The spout from which the brewed coffee comes out is only about an inch from the wall of the unit. If you prefer a coffee cup which is wider at the bottom than at the top, some of the coffee will be on the exterior wall of the unit or on the counter.o  It is designed to have a filter installed in the reservoir, but a) it doesn't come with your purchase, and  b) you have to pay an additional cost for itPositives?o  It's cost-effectiveo  It's convenient: the 36 oz reservoir makes it much easier to have 3 or 4 out of every 4 or 5 cups of coffee you brew with virtually no tasks because you don't deal with water filling as often.o  You have a choice of three different cup sizes.o  It is similarly easy to clean, like its predecessor.I'm not returning it, just disappointed with it."
The descale light came on. I used half white vinegar and half water running the water tank. Now the keurig will NOT TURN on. We tried to resolve this but so far no success. I LOVE this coffee maker! I’ve had it 10 months. Any ideas to help?
"Stopped working 3 months after I received it. Contacted Keurig, sent the photos of QR Code and proof of purchase but was denied. They said nothing was valid, it was a used coffee pot and Amazon wasn't an authorized retailer. Good luck if you buy one."
"Got our K-Express yesterday. It was easy to set up and the coffee tastes good.  We’ve had other Kuerigs and all have had water filters, but this one doesn’t appear to, or at least it didn’t come with one. Yet the instructions are confusing!  In one place they say, “CAUTION: Kuerig recommends using only Kuerig My K-Cup Universal Reusable Filters . . .”.  In another they say “If you have a Kuerig Water Filter (sold separately), install it now”.  I read other reviews here and saw others saying they aren’t using a filter so we went ahead and set it up without. Kuerig’s site is no more help. So I’m still unsure whether a filter should be used or not and if so, what we need.Also, a flyer came in the box for a 3 month Brewer Care Kit, all the essentials needed to keep your Kuerig coffee maker running at peak oerformance. The kit includes water filters, but why would we spend the money on a kit we don’t need?If Amazon could clarify any of these things it would be quite helpful. Kuerig needs to do a better job with instructions. These units are not cheap.Last thing, I don’t care for the water reservoir being behind the unit. It’s awkward to get to and has no handle for lifting it out."
"The instructions say to install the filter, but it is not included and no instructions as to how to install once you purchase the filter holder and filter. Poor instructions and content description."
"I bought this for work, to be able to brew a quick cup of coffee.  In order for it to work properly I have to heat up the water then pour it in the water container, otherwise it the add water light comes on and it only brews about half of whatever setting you chose.  Its a little messy spitting out the coffee unless you have a tall cup there are coffee splatters all over the counter.  But in the end I can get a hot cup of coffee."
"Coffee maker arrived without the stem that holds the water filter. Coffee maker won't work without the stem. Not good! Fortunately,  I had a stem from the last Keurig pot."
"I ordered this Keurig to use with hot chocolate cups. If you follow the instructions, you shouldn't ever have a clogged needle, but the problem I found is that the flow of the water isn't sufficient to wash all of the cocoa powder out of the cup, leaving the final product watery and weak. I have to remove the cup and scoop the remainder of the power/sludge out of the cup and into the hot cocoa mug, then mix. Sorta defeats the purpose of having it in the first place, I suppose."
"Water basin full, add water light stays on , doesn't allow brew process to start. Have to fiddle with sensor every time for it to work. Best fix itself or it's going back."
I replaced a single use Keurig coffee machine that stopped working.  Don’t love that you have to add a lot more water than needed to make a cup of coffee for it to work.
"The color was not what I expected. Too deep red. Coffee Does not get hot enough for me. Overall, okay, I guess for the money i paid."
"Easy for when you only need one or two cups but it doesn’t get the water super hot, which affects the taste of the coffee."
I’ve used Keurig machines for years.This time I went with a cheaper model and I deeply regret it.the way it’s designed is fraud with mishap possibilities.if cup is not absolutely flat up against the machine the stream can miss and make a mess. If water tank is not seated perfectly water spills all over as machine pulls water from tank. I’ve had two major misfortunes since I got this model
"First, I’ve had this machine for over a year. This machine will fool you. There is a minimum of water required to have in the tank ALTHOUGH the minimum still allows you to brew another 12oz serving and still have about 6-8oz of water left. It’s annoying because there is clearly enough water to brew another cup without fear of damaging the heating elements but it will not let you. So basically you’re filling the water tank every 2.5 cups (12oz size). Roughly 30-36ounces. If you’re near a sink, who cares, but if you’re away from a sink, it’s an annoyance seeing so much water in the tank but yet you can’t brew a cup.I’m gonna experiment on how the machine determines the volume and hack it. If it’s by weight then I will just add some sterile weights."
"Very simple and easy to use but doesn’t come with water filter holder and I contacted Keurig and the representative replied that I’ll need to buy accessories separately. As you can see on the picture above, before filling the tank you’ll need the filter and its holder, the 2nd picture. The filter is important if you’re going to be using tap water."
"This did not work at all. It was used, so I knew I was taking a chance. Nothing I did made it work. Thankfully I'm married to ""Mr. fix it"". He had to take the guts out, but he got it working! I bought it for travel and now it will be perfect."
"The water resevoir is at the back of the machine, making it difficult to change. Everything else works fine. It's just a lesser machine than the larger one I had. I was replacing it, because the ""descale"" light won't go out even after cleaning."
Information on Amazon said unit is 1000 watts . It is listed on kurig as 1530 watts and that is on units table. I bought this to go in my camper that has a 1000 watt inverter that will not run this coffee maker. Please up date your sight.
Poorly constructed lids fall off
Does as stated.No fanfare.Is as expected.
"Like the features of this little gem, but feel misled that it was not stated that filters and  a filter holder had to be purchased separately.  As a result, we had to wait several more days before we could use it! Disappointing!"
"Within 30 days, it stopped working. That's with two cups of coffee a day. I can send it back, but finding a box for it is a challenge, and we won't have our beloved Bulletproof coffee until the new one (not a Kurig) arrives."
"This was a great coffee maker until it died 7 months after I bought it. It was working fine until the descaling light came on and I followed the instructions on the bottle of Keurig brand descaling solution. After letting it sit for 30 minutes, I went back to finish the process, but it wouldn't turn on. I tried all of the recommended steps for restarting it, but it's dead dead. I guess I'll be buying another one, because the size of it is perfect for my tiny kitchen, and I'm not interested in the kind without a reservoir."
I totally love the Kuerig coffee maker And the color. All though there wasnt a water purifier or filters.Luckily I kept the 1 from my previous maker.It had 2 coupons but were expired 6 months ago
Beware if you want to use reusable k-cups.  The website description should caution that reusable k-cups will not work with this Keurig Express. They will work with the Kuerig Slim so I returned the Express and bought the Slim.
works fine
not as good as older model. this one leaks water. how  i don't know.  i put  where only used occasionally if needed. put back older model in kitchen for everyday use
It did not last a year reached out to the company about the warranty and got the run around second one purchased within 2 years. Will not purchase another one
"This coffee maker is ok using retail pods. But doesn't work at all with reusable pods. The pod recess is too short, and the clamp pops up when brewing."
Seasoned Keurig user bought this for vacation place.  The brewer does not have the clear plastic cylinder that holds the replacement filter.  Brewers used to arrive with that and a one or two filters.  Now you must order separately or use bottled water.  Sign of the times!! On a positive note the size is great if you have limited kitchen space! You will need to refill reservoir more frequently.
I love the convenience and easy clean up but the coffee (even on the strong setting) is pretty weak unfortunately.
It’s like owning a throwaway device. You own it for a year and then it just stops working.  Disappointing
"Returned but works great.  Love the extra hot water over our previous model.  Big issue for us is the 8 oz minimum size.  With creamer and some flavoring, it can fill a regular up to the brim.  Also, the extra water over our usual 6 oz dilutes the flavor considerably.  If you only need a thermos-like container, this is a great choice."
"I bought this two weeks ago because my old Keurig decided to stop giving me more than 4oz cups at a time. I was hoping that this would work better, but it seems like there is a huge design flaw with it. It will work one day and give me the requested 10oz cup, then the next morning it will only give me 4oz of the requested 10oz. I have to push the button again to get my full cup of coffee.Another pain point is that the add water light comes on even if there is still a good 10 oz left in the tank.In my honest opinion, I would not waste my money on it. It is definitely not built like the old-school work horse Keurig that is for sure!"
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            After I followed directions Open and close the lid the lights came out but did not blink. I went online and found the solution. Open the top in the right hand back corner is a little knob which needs to be pushed down a couple of times to release it after I did that and then I closed the lid the lights started blinking and I was able to brew my coffee. It is a defect that seems to have affected quite a few machines because I've seen many many articles about that. So guys don't give up. There is a solution. Otherwise I find the machine quite average... I'm thinking about replacing it with the Nespresso coffee machine.
"I liked the simplicity of the Keurig Express design. Few bells or whistles. Makes good coffee from Keurig pods. Our old Keurig died after years of use, mostly with plastic reusable pods. The plastic reusable pods did not fit well into this machine - new needle seemed longer and bottom prong seemed designed to clash with bottom rim of reusable pod. Fortunately I found the reusable stainless steel Kcups worked.One other design disappointment was how much it leaks if you take out the drip tray to fit a travel mug. Not at all a problem with my old Keurig and it seems like they could’ve added a little more rim on the bottom to prevent leakage on the countertop with this model."
My new keurig leaks slowly out the back water holder .
Product is all plastic. Cheaply made but functional.
But there is black plastic inside. Boo-hoo.
Beautiful color. That’s about it. Can only make one cup at a time and not even. At times it sucks up the water but doesn’t brew the coffee. Had it for 10 months and already brews when it feels like it.
"I got this one because my old one was on it's last cup and the sale price was good. At first I loved it but that was using disposable k-cup - my old reusable ones didn't fit so I ordered some new ones. I made sure I got the right size and these new reusable K-Cups are AWFUL. The lid is too hard to close with one and you have to force it. I'm afraid of breaking it, and it makes an terrible cracking sound. Once it's closed though you get an awful cup of coffee - if you get one at all. The water doesn't go through, regardless of how little coffee is in the filter, and twice the lid popped open during the brew. One final negative is the water reservoir can be half full and the machines add water light comes on and you HAVE to add water. I'd deal with that if the reusable filter cups would work right. I think I'll return it and get another brand. I don't know why I keep buying these, I'm always disappointed."
"I bought this to replace my Keurig MiniPros:- Starts Brewing almost instantly, no waiting for the water to warm-up- Works most of the timeCons:- Slower drip than other Keurig's I have used, even though it starts quicker the overall time is longer than the mini- Messy, splashes much more during brewing than other Keurig brewers I have owned. You need to clean up after each brew.- You can only use 2/3 of the water, if you have 1/3 or less left it won't let you brew even though that should be enough.- Sometimes for no reason, it stops brewing after only 4 oz or so, even with a full reservoir, I will then need to press the 8 oz button to finish the cup.- I have had three of ten K-cup have their filters burst using this brewer and got a cup full or grounds. It was never an issue with my Keurig Mini.Skip this one and get a better model like the MiniArt"
I really wanted to give this a good review but it quit working at the 3 month mark. Waiting to hear back from Keurig for a replacement.
"Received this Keurig machine. Plugged it in. It worked great. Performed regular maintenance as directed.Six months and one week after receiving, IT STOPPED POWERING UP. Even repair shop couldn’t get it working. “It is not the thermal fuse.” Wish I’d gotten protection plan.Expensive six months of coffee.UPDATE: KEURIG CUSTOMER SERVICE REPLACED INOPERABLE UNIT WITH NEW ONE FREE OF CHARGE."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Returning this Keurig for a couple reasons.#1 It splashes all over the place. You have to find something to put under your regular-sized coffee cup so it doesn’t splash everywhere. I understand this is so it can accommodate taller cups and in understand the physics of falling liquids, but I don’t understand there not being a solution for raising the cups higher instead of the user having to find something to shim under the cup.#2 there is a strange lip around the back area where the reservoir sits. It feels like the reservoir is in place but it is not. The best part? Even though the reservoir isn’t really in place, the valve at the base of the reservoir thinks it is and dumps water everywhere. I placed the reservoir in carefully, walked away for a moment and came back with water running off the counter. Half of the reservoir emptied in no more than a minute.Returning this ☹️"
Instructions not very clear how to use. You have to fill out the whole water tank if you want to get any size still Brew?
I bought the Keurig express in February 2024. I have descaled it already. This morning I woke up and it is not releasing any water for a cup of coffee . I have trued  every thing I could think of per videos and the website to fix it and I’m still not getting a cup of coffee very disappointed. The descaled button remains on and water does not flow from the water tank to my cup of coffee will not purchase again
The first one was cracked when I received it. Got the next one in a couple of days. Not impressed with the machine.
"Less than three months after we bought this coffee maker, I inserted a pod, and the pod exploded, with coffee grains all over the kitchen cabinet.  Then, I smelled burning plastic. After that, the coffee maker would not work when I plugged it in. I contacted customer service and the lady on the phone was great.  Then, got an email from Keurig and they wanted a bunch of information and photos. Their online customer service is not good at all.  Twice they denied my claim saying that Keurig needed more information even though I sent them everything they requested. They still haven’t approved my new coffee maker even with multiple emails and pictures. Several times I sent emails with information they asked for and it was like starting my request all over again. They have an automated email system, and it’s crazy! I’m disappointed in Keurig.  I hope the new coffee maker they said they would send me works longer than three months. Thankfully, this coffee maker is still under warranty."
"Like the size & convenience.However, even after following the descale instructions, the descale light never goes off."
The Keurig works well. Color is just ok. The biggest issue is the materials are very poor quality. It is sunlight weight the whole unit slides all over the counter. This could become a safety issue if it tips or falls. I'm debating wether to return. I don't think the plastic will hold up more than a couple of months anyway.NOT what I expected from a KEURIG.
"I bought this machine about 5 months ago, and it has made our coffee faithfully,  up until today. My wife went to make her coffee and the machine started sputtering, making strange noises, and all of the lights in the kitchen started flickering. She called me at work, freaking out, and I walked her through several tests to isolate the problem to the coffee maker itself. Now, unless I can fix it when I get home (USAF trained me in electronics), it is a $90 paperweight. The most fun part is that it's Christmas Eve and I won't be able to get another coffee maker until at least the 26th. Christmas Day without a cup of coffee is going to be rough on those people around me.I will definitely give Keurig brand another shot, but not this model and not from Amazon. Going to buy it at a brick and mortar store where I can get help in the future.In short, I can't definitively say that all of this model are bad. Nor can I say that it for sure wasn't caused by myself or my wife. This was just my experience with this one machine."
Made out of flimsy plastic.  I really don’t expect it to last long
It appears to be cheaply made and the coffee isn't all that great.
"As above, just DOA. Something is going on with Keurig. Two machines now DOA."
Does a decent job but clogs up weekly requiring a good bit of maintenance.
"I don’t normally leave reviews, but I felt this was needed. The Keurig itself worked great at first, and I actually thoroughly enjoyed the ease of use. However, I did notice some things that made it very inconvenient to use. For example, I do not see many of the reviews mention this, but the Keurig only starts at 8 oz as the minimum, meaning no matter what, there will always be water in the back of the tank that you will have to add to just to make another cup of coffee. While this can be seen as a minor inconvenience, it is definitely still an inconvenience.Secondly, and the reason I was prompted to write a review today, I turned my Keurig on to brew a cup this morning and it randomly broke. The machine began smelling burnt, and it will not turn on at all. It is safe to assume I will not be getting any refunds now as the return window has long passed, but I URGE you to purchase a different model of Keurig altogether so you can avoid this issue a few months down the road as well. Especially if you are like me and rely on this Keurig, it's absolutely the worst timing for this to happen."
"It was fine to start but slowly began to give smaller cups of coffee and now doesn't work at all.  To be fair, we didn't do the descale but why does that need to be so complicated that you need to find a YouTube app?  And then it takes quite a while to run all the vinegar through.  Also, I actually didn't like the back access to the water.  It is in a tight space and we struggled to get it in every day.We have moved to bialletti coffee for now but can't beat the convenience of a keurig cup.  Just hoping the next one is a bit better."
"I've had a Keurig coffee maker before.  It lasted 10 years.  It was the basic model.  You just added the water each time and every 3 months I did a cleaning cycle with vinegar.  This newer one has more features, but 3 time now, it was totally dead for my 2nd cup.  I called Keurig each time and they gave me some pointers to get it going again, but this last time, none of them worked.  However, the next day, I was going to call and  tried it before calling and it worked again.  When it works, it's OK.  However, I consider it very unreliable."
Coffee is hot and dispenses quickly which is perfect.  The buttons are not the easiest to push and the alignment of the coffee maker  housing seems to be slightly out of alignment.  The quality of the buttons and plastic housing could be improved.
It only lasted 2 years
"Works well and hasn't broken down, but I can't figure out any way to remove the top needle to clean it out. It has old coffee grounds stuck in it probably growing mold and who knows what else."
Water container is small. Minimum functionality.  I have had several of the bigger Keurigs but they fail quickly even with regular descaling. So I bought this cheap one so I can throw it away later.
"This coffee maker arrived on time and in good shape.  The problem is that it doesn't accept the reusable filters I have.  I don't recall seeing anything on the page about which ones don't work, but I could have missed it.  Fortunately, a review was quite helpful and specific about which reusable filter (only one!) would work.  Thank you, Mr. Reviewer, whoever you are!  I ordered the only filter that will work, but it takes nearly a month to get here, so the coffee maker is camping out on my counter, waiting for the missing part."
"This is a very cute and compact coffee maker.  But the regular reusable k-cups don't work with it. You have to buy the newer reusable k-cups that aren't available at all the stores. So we ordered all new cups for this one. (The premade k-cups worked fine, that just isn't my preferred cup of yummy.)Unfortunately, after jumping that hurdle, the machine stopped working within the first week of use.We contacted Amazon for an exchange.  That wasn't available on this item, which meant we would return this one and have to repurchase another. Unfortunately for us that meant paying a much higher price because we bought the original one on Prime Day.I did not repurchase. Instead I went back to using my bulky, and much fancier, coffee machine."
"While this particular model does have three different cup sizes 8,10, and 12 ounces), which might seem like good enough choices, all three push too much water through most Keurig pods, and none of the three can be adjusted in any way. So, for example, there's no way to make a stronger six-ounce cup, which would make a much better tasting cup of cup from the vast majority of available K-pods. This forces the buyer to buy only the most expensive K-cups, which either have more or better coffee inside. There is a button for stronger coffee output, but it's not very effective.For the record, most other Keurig models allow the user to customize the default settings so the user can optimize the amount of water the machine uses, so the flow can be made perfect for the user's choice of coffee pods.So, this model simply is not as useful as most of Keurig's models, and the user is forced to optimize the taste they prefer by methods that aren't really as easy or as user friendly as they should be."
"This is a great little coffee make. Fast and small footprint.  However I bought it for my small RV which has a 1000 watt inverter.  The data on the web page list the wattage as 1000 watts.  In fact by meter, and what is molded on the base plate is actually 1500 watts, well above listed and enough to shut my inverter down. So I will go back to my smaller single serve, hotel room model, of a Kcup maker."
"The compact size, quick to brew nature of this Keurig earned it the 3 stars. The splashing, taste of the coffee and ""cheap"" look of the device lost it two stars. I wasn't expecting a high end machine but having to wipe the counter and machine after each cup feels annoying. The cup of coffee is a little watery. Definitely use the strong brew at minimum.I'm a Keurig user and continue to be...just expected a bit more with this one."
"I loved everything about this for my daughter.  Unfortunately, it failed us after the third use."
"I have had keurigs for a long time with very good luck. Before buying this one, I noticed that some reviews said it left grounds in the coffee. I thought perhaps it had to do with the pods used, so I went ahead and bought one. It fits my space well and was more highly rated for good tasting coffee in one of the coffee snob sites. 🤣I used pods from a known brand that I use frequently with no issues. The flavor of my coffee is excellent, but I was disappointed to see that yes, there are grounds in my coffee. So far not enough to cause a huge issue, but it’s a bit unpleasant. Rather than replace the coffee maker, I might try using my cold brew filter between the nozzle and my cup."
"Product is nice but they sent the wrong color. Also, does not come with water filter"
"I like the compact nature of this Keurig, however, there were a few things that didn't work for me and I ended up returning it.  1) the drip of the coffee from the machine was too close to the edge of my cup and would sometimes splash. I don't use typical store bought cups, so my cup rim does not sit up against the unit. I use hand-built pottery mugs.  2)  The unit did not like the reusable k-cup pods. I had a hard time closing the lid when I used them and the lid would pop-up near the end of the brewing cycle.  I typically am a big fan of Keurig and have owned many different models. This one did not work out for me this time.  Sorry Keurig :\\"
"As it says in the title, I had a great time, making pod coffee quickly. The cups were a little small, for example its biggest cup, 12 ounces, fits pretty good in a coffee mug, but 2 of them is too much for my to go coffee mug. Anyway, its now dead, in just under 2 years. It developed some problem with the water going into the pod. Appears to have a calcium build-up that cannot be fixed. I cleaned it, but its completely shut down on me. I only used filtered water bottles. The machine itself is unfixable. You cannot open it up without breaking it. The Keurig itself is unreturnable after 1 month. So, onto the next. $60, lasted 23 months, so approx $2.60/month."
"The coffee maker lasted only 10 months before it broke.I didn’t read the description carefully and I didn’t realize this model coffee maker will not keep the coffee warm so you have to be ready to drink it right away.It does make the coffee very quickly and I like that feature, but unfortunately 10 months is just too short of time.."
"I like this model, I am on the fence as I had to replace it via Kureig about 6 months after getting it.  They were very quick to replace & extend the warranty an extra year. Would have rated it higher but durability is questionable.Easy to use, works well, nice looking unit and not bad if you purchase on sale."
"I have mixed feelings on this little Keurig:. Love the slim size. Love the color (mint green). Love the speed at making my coffee. Hate that water must be added to back of machine which causes me to pull out from wall and turn the coffee maker around to the back.. Hate that it makes you add more water when only half empty. Hate that it continues to drip coffee long after you remove your coffee cup.. Hate that any time you lift handle, the coffee maker turns on. This means if you just want to remove the coffee pod later, it will turn the machine on.  Then you have to remember to turn it off."
"This coffee maker works well enough.  I wish I had considered where the water container was positioned.This item is slim and takes up little space, but it must be slid out from the wall to pour water in.  This may sound trite but my old keurig  water container was on the top and easy to get toAnother thing is you must pour more water then you actually need to make a cup.  It's annoying.  You think you have poured enough but the light indicates to add more.I would have sent it back but destroyed the packaging too quickly.  Would not buy  again, would shop more."
"This makes a good cup of coffee an does not take up too much space on the counter.  It has one annoying flaw.  It will not use a reusable k-cup, not even the Keurig reusable cups.  So I can't use all the coffees that I have that do not come in k-cups."
"Mostly my concern is with the coffee maker design.  The on/off button is in the left side of the machine, as are the ounce buttons (8, 10, 12 ounces).  I have found it to be a pain having to search around the side of the machine for those buttons,instead of them being on the front.  Also, you have to place the water column into its mount with some force in order to make sure that water doesn’t leak out of the column.  I had that happen twice before I realized you have to give the water column some oof before it seals properly.As I said design issues.  Otherwise it makes good coffee."
After having this less than one month it doesn’t fill the coffee  cup. If you press 12 oz you’re lucky if you get 8oz.Always at least 4 ounces short. Ordered the descaled and cleaner even  though it shouldn’t have needed it this soon as we only use it on the weekends and it didn’t help. We’ll go back to buying a no name brand.Better off buying another brand.
I bought mine to have a second cup of coffee at the office I typically bring a large cup with me in the morning so I don’t always use this. I’ve used it a grand total of 6 times and went to use it this morning and it no longer brews and dispensers my coffee. It does not pull water from the reservoir but still makes the noises as if it is brewing. I’ve checked everything I can think of for it to be clogged. It is still very new so there is no issue I can see. I am  Frustrated and disappointed. It worked perfectly before today
I was excited to receive this nicely designed product and it worked great for 3 months. Followed advice of the “fix” and it worked for a few cups of coffee and then gave it up and is dead.  The quality is just not there
"This is my first purchase of a Keurig coffee maker and it's complete BS. With the overinflated cost for pods, you'd think they would come up with a decent coffee maker that remained working after six months. They can't even include a water filter required to operate the coffee maker. Everything you need to run this is NOT included. I thought I was buying something worthwhile not a money pit just for the pleasure of a cup of coffee whenever the machine feels like working. I'm going back to a drip coffee maker that will last longer than a cup of coffee does."
"The coffeemaker worked well until the second time the descale light came on. The first time that I descaled, it went as expected. I descaled with a Keurig brand pod and solution and the light would not go off.  I called Keurig support and again descaled per the operator's directions (while on the line with him) and again the descale light would not go off. The operator then asked if I could hear him - the call had not dropped - and never came back in the line.  It is beyond the return window at this point. Would not purchase another."
"I didn’t even have this machine a year and it started to stop brewing at half a cup, just stop for no reason. Luckily I was able to contact Kerurig and they sent me a new model after having me retrieve plenty of paperwork."
"Brews quickly and coffee tastes good, but its not hot enough, have to microwave for 10-12 seconds.  Also splashes a bit, prob due to small stream into empty mug, have to wipe around.  Small and sleek and quiet."
"I got my mini Keurig on July 1st, it is now August 28th  of the same year and went through my daily of making a cup of coffee . It turned on,started brewing, fed my animals, it sounded like it was done brewing walk over and it only made a small amount, so I cleaned the tube and needle area,ran 1/2 water and half vinegar. Then when I was done cleaning the coffee maker I waited about 30 mins and was going to make a cup of coffee and the machine wouldnt turn on, so I unplugged it plugged it in again and nothing tried another appliance and that worked in that socket, but flipped the power to plug. And still nothing. The coffee maker has died. The other big keurig I had died as well.I will never purchase another Keurig ever. Horrible product."
I purchased this as a replacement for a decade old single serve. The unit is nice an feels well built. Unfortunately every fourth or fifth cup the machine fails to produce a full cup. The following cup will then overfill. I’m not sure why this is happening but I have not experienced this with any other single serving machines.
"...which I've discovered that I do not, hence I wound up being VERY DISAPPOINTED with the Keurig K-Express coffee maker. I think it was about $80 when I bought it, after my sister did (literally) days of online comparison shopping and review reading. She bought the same machine, and still uses hers, so perhaps I'm too demanding (re: flavor perhaps?). I wound up returning mine, and went back to my ancient, manual DeLonghi espresso machine for now.To be fair, I tried using the Keurig per the included instructions, and to give it the best chance possible (to making decent coffee) I used it with the 'strong' setting ON, and with the output set to the smallest (8 oz.) size cup. I also tried it with a BUNCH of different K-cups, including some well-reviewed ones like Peet's Major Dickason's blend (and a few others too). To be totally honest, I never got what I'd call a decent cup of coffee out of the machine. AT BEST, it seemed like weak drip coffee no better than you'd get from an almost-free, thrift-store Mr. Coffee machine dating back to the Reagan administration and expired, off-brand pre-ground coffee.I tried... I REALLY tried... but I couldn't get a good cup of coffee out of the Keurig and believe me, I WANTED TO. I WANTED the early-morning, still-mostly-asleep push-button convenience that Keurig offers, instead of the somewhat more involved, time-consuming process of a manual DeLonghi. I mean, you have to be SORT of awake to not spill grounds as you load them, and to tamp them decently, etc... whereas the Keurig is so simple my dog could probably work it (not to disparage dogs of course... mine's very smart, but she is missing a couple toes on her right front paw, which is the one I assume she'd use to make coffee).SO: unhappy as I was with hot brown water, I returned the Keurig K-Express coffee maker and I have (I kid you not) about 150 different K-Cups left over that I'll give to my sister I suppose.Tangentially, let me add that my experience of Nespresso machines is MUCH BETTER, whether they're small/old ones like my aunt in San Diego still uses, or the fancy probably sentient/AI-equipped one at my credit union. They MAKE GOOD COFFEE. However, as I'm neither the Pope nor a sultan, I haven't yet been able to convince myself to spend so much $ on a Nespresso machine, let alone like a buck-and-a-half per cup on coffee 'capsules' for it. Yet.-Scott :-)"
I really liked this coffee maker and used it every day. A few days ago it smelled like it was burning and now it is dead. I’m very disappointed since I’ve only had it for four months.
"This lasted from Aug 2023 to Dec 2024. Descaled for the first time and it worked properly. Did the rinse cycle after descaling and it powered off and would not power back on.  Called Keurig. They “troubleshooted”, plug, unplug, press power, etc. Warranty only good for a year so out of luck for a replacement. Ugh.  Going back to Nespresso."
"I have this coffee pot, and so do my parents.  I use mine rarely.  They use theirs multiple times daily.  It’s easy to use, and the water tank lifts out so you can fill it at the sink with fresh water.  There are buttons to change the brew from rich to classic, as well as a button for small batch (4 cups or less).  There is also a button to keep coffee warm.  It is easy to change the time on this machine.  Downside, there is no way to program the coffee pot to brew at a certain time.My family loves it, except my parents’ coffeemaker died after 6 months.  We’re trying another one before moving on from Ninja, hopefully the dead one was a fluke."
"Drips on the hotplate when carafe is removed near end of brewing.  Seems you can't adjust the hotplate temp (coffee gets quite hot).  Puts out a good amount of steam when brewing.  Also loud gurgling when brewing.  Also, lid on the carafe can not be raised using just your thumb like with most all coffee makers (it has to be twisted off and thus you have to use both hands).  Our Hamilton Beech coffee maker is much better (doesn't drip, less steam, quieter, etc) but that model is no longer made and newer HB model is not as good."
"I've purchased two of these machines and my review is not biased in any way. The machine looks fine and has easy to learn controls, that's a plus. If your like me you like your coffee hot. The Ninja produces consistent hot coffee and the brew cycle is not long, around four to six minutes for a half pot. After owning two of these  machines in the past and I have one issue with it. The water passes by a heating element which heats the water to it's desired temp. I always have coffee in the morning and mine was really hot so I liked the machine at first. I then tasted the coffee my friend was brewing and I was really impressed  by the complexity of the brew. He purchased another brand that all others are compared to ( made in the Netherlands). He said the water never touches the heating element. When water touches the heating element it loses most of the minerals in the process. This machine leaves the coffee tasting flat compared to my buddies. I love the taste from a French Press but the convenience of a drip machine. I found mine, but the machine cost an arm and a leg. I found one on sale which helps tremendously so I'm  going to splurge and get it. If your on the fence about purchasing such a high priced  machine, just do it. It's the last coffee maker you will ever buy. The Ninja is more than adequate for most people. The coffee is hot but the taste for this coffee snob  let me down after a few months."
"The panel malfunctioned . I could not BREW as the brew button would not work. The clock numbers were also askew . I suggest registering your product with the warranty. I had to call the company and they replaced JUST THE BASE. Which was great. I thought it was wild that they sent just a base. No carafe or water reservoir. I didn’t need them, but found it odd. Happy it was replaced . It came relatively quickly. In the meantime I was able to brew by PROGRAMMING the unit to brew at a certain time."
"Purchased this coffee maker January 2021.  It died today, November 18, 2024.  It makes great coffee and is easy to use.  The LEDs on the clock display started to fail after six months, but since I don’t use a timer, it wasn’t a big deal.  Today it wouldn’t do anything when I pressed the start button.  I don’t know if four years is a satisfactory life for a coffee maker, but my simple Mr. Coffee never quit for ten years.  Maybe simple is better."
"We have purchased two Ninja coffee makers (same model). One in August 2021 and June 2024. We loved this coffee maker.  When the water reservoir started leaking very badly, we replaced it with another Ninja, same model. We figured it was just old (3 yrs).  Last week our second Ninja started leaking from the same place. The first one lasted under 3 years, this one lasted under 5 months.  I would be hesitant to purchase this.  There is obviously some type of problem with leaking from the water reservoir to happen twice from the same model.  We will not be replacing it with another Ninja coffee maker."
"We’ve had this for about 18 mos., we liked it very much and it worked well until a month or so ago when it started leaking. We’ve cleaned and descaled and maintained the machine, but it leaks from the bottom during every brew now and along with the leaking some control panel button lights are no longer working.Seems this product has a limited lifespan, something to know if you’re considering buying."
"We have had a Ninja coffee maker for as long as I can remember and loved it. Unfortunately the decanter broke and decided to purchase a new one.The one thing people should know about this model, is it takes forever to brew a pot of coffee, 15-20 minutes or more.Many mornings I have to leave work without enjoying a cup of coffee."
"I only just received this a couple of days ago, so I may be updating my review down the line, but so far I’m not as impressed as other reviewers seem to be. Perhaps it’s unfair to compare this with my former Cuisinart 12-cup coffee maker, a real workhorse that was a good bit more expensive than this one, but I could hardly keep from doing so.While this coffee maker does make a good cup of coffee, I really expected more. I love that there is a removable reservoir, but my initial feeling was that, as with my espresso machine, the reservoir could be filled, and it would dispense only amount of water needed for the 4 cups of coffee that I make on a daily basis; this is not the case. The reservoir needs to be dealt with every day, and the amount of water that you put into it is the amount of water that’s going to come out.I’ve also found that this coffee maker does not turn itself off after a certain amount of time, so I have to be mindful of the fact that it’s still on after a prolonged amount of time. It also does not stop when you remove the carafe in the middle of the brewing process, as I found out to my cost this morning when it continued to dispense coffee all over the warming tray. Its VERY slow brewing process is what prompted me to pour a cup of coffee before it was finished because it takes probably double the amount of time to brew coffee than that of previous coffee makers that I have owned.Additionally, I found that the warming tray didn’t keep my coffee all that warm. I like a hot cup of coffee, and this just didn’t provide it. I do like that there is a place on the side of the coffee maker for a coffee scoop, but I found the amount of coffee that would fit into that scoop laughable. I ended up using double the amount required in order to get coffee as strong as I would like it.It does program, is user-friendly, and brews a fine cup of coffee. At this point, I need to decide whether that’s enough."
"The Ninja is well designed, had every one of the features that I most wanted, has a thorough instruction booklet, and I see that the sweeping majority here thinks that it makes great coffee. But...I haven't found this to be the case. I've tried it all. Four different kinds of coffee, all ground and fresh, medium roast, dark roast, with the permanent filter  - which left a ton of sediment at the bottom of the cup, rendering the thing useless -and then with unbleached brown paper disposable filter. I've always used only filtered cold water, NEVER poured right from the tap. I tried the small batch option, carefully measured out the grounds (by the way, for this coffee maker, 6 ounce equals 1 cup), tried the rich brew, the classic brew, used a little less coffee, a bit more coffee, deselected the small batch feature..when I tell you that I've tried everything, I am not kidding.  I always get a cup of bitter tasting swill. I tried to adjust the amounts of creamer and stevia (I always use that w/out issue). Nothing.  The latest coffee I tried was PEET's. Smells great in the pouch; horrible once it is brewed. Like all the other coffees, it's as if the flavor was somehow stunted and never fully develops. It takes exactly seven minutes for it to brew four cups. So brewing time seems reasonable. Yet the results are always unacceptable."
"We have had this coffee maker for just about 13 months now, and we use it daily. We have the auto shut off usually set to 4 hours because I will often go back for another cup after I get the kids out the door.This week, my husband smelled something burning and then heard the coffee machine start to incessantly beep.  Thank goodness for that, bc by the time he got over to the machine to unplug it, it was smoking out the back where the cord comes out of the machine. He put it on our back stone patio where it continued to smoke for about half an hour.THANKFULLY we were home.I won’t say not to buy this bc it has served us well for a year. The detachable water reservoir was a game changer and it was very easy to clean.Coffee machines, I think, should last longer than a year though. Not sure what went wrong with ours… I’d be open to replacing it if Ninja sent me a new one. The warning beep was a nice feature.This has me shook though. Using the French press for now. Those don’t catch fire."
"It's a coffee maker and it looks cool and it's a ninja, which is cool. It brews coffee. But it's definitely not special. Speaking of ninja... it's not a quiet coffee maker so it's not deserving of the name... hahaOne thing about it that I dislike is how much steam comes out of it when it's brewing I had to rearrange my kitchen to make sure it's not under one of my wooden cabinets because it was getting a lot of moisture on the wood when it was brewing.Also, I do not understand the button for ""small batch"" For me, I thought it would make sense to be able to fill the tank up to 12 hit small batch and it would brew a small batch using only 4 cups of water, leaving water in the tank to brew a ""small batch"" later. No. Hitting ""small batch"" will drain the tank just as a regular batch. If you put only 4 cups of water and you hit the small batch, it's the same thing as just hitting ""brew"" it's gonna do the exact same thing so that is definitely a pointless feature.I actually probably would return it if I had held onto the box, but instead, I rearranged my kitchen hahaThe scoops size that it comes with is pretty accurate. The rich batch is absolutely rich no lie.Anyway... my input"
"This coffee brewer was purchased to replace an aging Cuisinart in my winter home. This brewer has all the features to make it a great coffee brewer but somehow it falls short. I must mention that in my summer home I have an SCA certified brewer (Melitta Vision) that will brew a perfect carafe of coffee day after day.The Ninja CE251 has a lot going for it, separate heating elements, an adjustable one for the carafe warming plate and a separate boiler to heat the water for brewing. This separate boiler will bring the water temp to 195-200 degrees Fahrenheit within a minute of turning the brew cycle on. It has semi custom brew cycles in classic and rich and it also has a small batch option. This brewer has an automatic bloom feature. The carafe warming plate can be turned off or programed to shut off automatically in 30 minute intervals up to 4 hours with 2 hours being the default. This brewer features a removable water reservoir for easy water filling with a 12 cup (60 oz.) capacity. It features a #4 cone filter basket that can use paper filters (my preference) or a reusable gold tone metal filter (supplied). The unit is made of BPA free plastic which feels good and sturdy. The carafe pours fast and is drip free.So what is my problem with this brewer and why I only give it 3 stars.First is the carafe, while it does pour fast and drip free, the lid is quirky and difficult to take in and off. I am left handed and the lid was definitely made for right handed use. it just feels awkward to me. Second, the carafe does not sit flat. It rocks like the bottom was not made correctly. This allows it to not seat on the warming plate correctly and can cause the pot to not contact the brew basket shut off button correctly causing it to drip coffee everywhere. The third problem is the end of brew cycle alarm, sometimes it can take as long as 4 minutes after the brew cycle has completed to actually go off and shut the brewing boiler off. The fourth and probably the biggest annoyance is that with all this brewer has going for it, it can not consistently brew a good carafe of coffee, it is hit or miss. I have tried everything I know to do but to no avail. I have adjusted coffee grind size, and amount, but this brewer just has a mind of its own. If you paid $59.99 as I did, it is a 3 star coffee machine, if the price is anything higher I would recommend looking elsewhere. If you are in the market for a good coffee brewer, one that will make your coffee a spiritual life changing moment....spend the extra money and purchase an SCA certified brewer otherwise just purchase your standard $29.00 Mr. Coffee, your resulting coffee will not be much worse with a lot less money invested.Update 03/04/2024If you have made it this far you would have read my initial review. Well on this update I have changed my 3 star rating to a 1 star. the reason for this is because i have come to the conclusion that this coffee maker can not brew a decent pot of coffee. I have tried everything I know how to improve the quality of brewed coffee but to no avail, it is always bitter and left a funky after taste in my mouth. I have changed grind size, amount of and even the brand and type of coffee until I felt that I exhausted every avenue. I finally pull out the old Cuisinart coffee maker that this Ninja replaced and did a side by side comparison. Same coffee, same grind size, same amount of coffee, same amount of water from the same source. and the old Cuisinart, brewed a smooth pot of coffee, flavorful and not bitter. The Ninja again brewed a horrid pot so  it is now retired. My original recommendation was it was just OK for the price I paid $59.95, now I can not recommend this coffee maker at any price, it is just garbage."
I have had this Ninja Coffee Maker for almost 4 years.  Recently it started leaking so I decided to do a failure analysis.  Ninja designed in an overflow reservoir to direct any leaking water away from electrical components.  In the bottom of the overflow reservoir is a drain hole.  Normally the overlow reservoir would only contain water if the grounds basked overflowed.  The problem is the flip up water sprinkler has an O-Ring. Eventually this O-Ring starts to leak when brewing and water leaks out every time.A better option is to purchase a coffee maker with a swing out basket that does not have a failure prone O-ring.
We bought this to replace our OXO brewer.  I was hoping that I could find a less expensive brewer that made good coffee.  The Ninja was not the answer.  We followed the directions in the manual and tried the different brew types  but the coffee taste didn’t measure up.  If you’re looking for flavor and extraction you got to pay the additional $$ for an Oxo or Mocha master.  Or be patient enough to make a pour over…
The coffee maker itself was very nice. But the buttons were hard to push to start it up. So I returned it.
"I don’t like the design. When the power blips the clock flashes and must be reset - this is the 21st century and this is an easy thing to avoid. And why have a separate water container? Because the lid seals tightly, the water reservoir fogs up with condensate after coffee has been made - just vent the lid so the reservoir can dry out. Coffee tastes fine, but I’ll get a more practical design next time."
"Over the years, I’ve used 2 Cuisinart  coffee makers similar to this but recently I decided to try the Ninja because of the great ratings. The glass  Cuisinart pot never got stained with the brewed coffee but  the Ninja glass pot gets stained and  the coffee stain is hard to remove from the glass.  I don’t understand why this happens!  It looks terrible."
"Coffee maker is nice, makes a nice cup of coffee, will keep warm for however you’d like & is relatively easy to clean.  Unfortunately, it will NOT automatically turn off on its own…even if you don’t keep coffee warm!  That is a big negative & wasn’t mentioned in product specs or anywhere about the product.  That is a safety hazard!"
"I like everything about it - except trying to clean it! I have never had a carafe that is this impossible to clean!Dawn dishsoap, or in the dishwasher, soaking in hot water and vinegar... It does not matter what I use, wiping with a clean paper towel after rinsing produces really dark stuff.EVEN the tube on the lid - image shows wiping after washing! So I took a brush to scub the inside of the tube.After washing the pot and using vinegar and water the image of the paper towel wiping inside the pot where the band touched the glass on the outside produces gunk...I am becoming concerned about the plastic used and the plastic parts on the machine that cannot be cleaned or inspected.I bought this after decades of Cuisinart Coffee makers. The first few lasted a very long time the last two not so much. I liked the idea of the removable water reservoir on this and it makes coffee just fine. I was originally washing the carafe every night with Dawn and a good sponge and noticed the dark stuff... it seems to me it is getting harder to clean over time. Then when I wiped the black tube and saw it too has stuff... I am questioning the health and safety of this."
"This coffee maker makes good coffee but if you keep your coffee maker under the counter as I do, you will need to pull it out from under the top cabinet everytime you load more grinds and same for adding water.  I am always moving it in and out from the wall.  For this reason, I really don't care for it."
"It's a decent little coffee pot but any $20 coffee maker from the big box store will make the same quality coffee. It has a lot of ""features"" that are actually pretty stupid and unnecessarily raises the price on the machine.The spoon is just pointless. I've been making coffee for 40 years without a dedicated spoon. Also when you want to make a full pot of coffee it's just plain annoying to have to do 12 spoons. I'll stick with the scoop that came in a folgers can.The removable water bin...again, a pointless feature. We all put water in the carafe and then pour it into the coffee pot. Why did that need to change? Just a marketing ploy and an excuse to charge more.The carafe. This part of the machine I actually hate. The lid doesn't flip up with your thumb, you have to twist it to get it off. No more one-handed emptying or rinsing or pouring, now you need two. This is very annoying to adjust to after 40 years of using a normal carafe. Again, why did this need to change from the norm?The coffee itself tastes no different than any other coffee I've ever had from a machine. Acid levels feel about the same, taste is the same, the amount of ""burnt"" coffee that you smell is the same.The filter allows a substantial amount of residue into the pot. Can be remedied with disposable filters but again, why even include a reusable filter when you actually need disposables? Another feature that only serves to raise the price.Overall, it's a $20 coffee maker that has a lot of pointless and annoying ""features"" that only serve to raise the price. Save your money and head on over to wally world. I regret this purchase and would not recommend. Don't let the coffee ""experts"" trick you into buying this like they did me. Minus 2 stars for the annoying carafe and the price."
"Works well, but coffee tastes bland like Restaurant coffee. I bought this Ninja thinking the coffee would come out bold and flavorful like my 10 year old Keurig.... I needed a coffee maker that could brew 4 cups or more at a time, which is one of the reasons I went with the Ninja."
"I broke the carafe of my 9 year old Bonavita. It was super simple and worked well. The drip portion was not well distributed and I use to manually rotate the coffee ground holder to let them get better drip coverage.  After 9 years, sleepy in the morning I accidentally knocked the carafe off the counter and it shattered. With that carafe discontinued, I was on the hunt for a new coffee maker. I had been hearing about Shark Ninja products. The reviews were pretty good, so I bought this one. All I can say is, although its my fault that I have a hard time getting used to its functions, parts and pieces. After 3-4 months I have ranted on many occasions, ""I hate this coffee maker!"". End of story."
"06/24/23 updateAfter more interchanges with Ninja last fall, I told them I was too busy to deal with them - and would get back to it in 2023. So... last week I did that. They gave me a case #, spoke with 3 agents (1 disconnect, 1 transfer). Bottom line: I wanted a refund. They wanted to, once again, have a video call and watch the unit work. No. Lots of words later, they said they could not refund since it was purchased on Amazon - but they would send me a new unit, if I paid shipping costs. To be fair, that sounds like a reasonable offer - unless you consider the fact that I will never use a Ninja coffeemaker again - so a replacement doesn't address my issue. I could take it and then try to sell it - but - haven't I already spent MORE time than is reasonable?09/10/22 update: it's DEAD after just 3 monthsAfter calling this a 'near perfect' coffeemaker (see original review below), it has become a useless one. One day the filter holder overflowed (using same coffee, same amt, same process, etc.): what a MESS that was to clean! Oh my. Thought/hoped it was an anomaly - but unfortunately no. I tried various remedies I found online and on the Ninja site - none worked. It still makes good coffee - albeit a lot smaller amt, since it overflows everywhere. Who has 30+ min to spend cleaning their coffeemaker every day - and even after that much effort, it's not really clean. Impossible! And to top it all off - on the 4th day of this, the coffee ran out from under the coffeemaker somehow - all over the counter.I called Ninja: they wanted to video me making coffee to ensure I wasn't lying. Long story short: the video link didn't work, and after some minutes trying to fool with it - they said it was probably just a faulty coffee filter holder (though nothing was broken on it) and would send me a new one. If that didn't fix it, then they would replace it.Have been waiting over 2 wks for that... nothing.So much for the perfect coffeemaker. ;=(And now back to another annoying one.Will really miss this Ninja... it truly made the best coffee I've ever tasted!original post in June '22:I've been buying automatic coffeemakers for 40 years (percolators prior to that!): mostly Cuisinart & Braun... and perhaps there were others way back at the beginning that I can't now recall. They've mostly made reasonably good coffee, but there were always 'design' annoyances: the grounds overflowed or came close to it, the built-in reservoirs were always impossible to keep clean, the programming was generally less than intuitive (dreaded reprogramming after a power outage), there was usually a 'clip' on the filter holder that would inevitably break. Overall? Generally nice looking, but VERY annoying. And they would eventually stop working in a shorter time frame than seemed reasonable.After my last Braun breakdown (only 1.5 yrs old) I decided to try something new, and found this Ninja. Literally every design element (except 1 extremely minor quirk) has been THOROUGHLY researched and implemented in the most logical manner. Programming is easy/intuitive. The 'alerts' are short and NOT annoying - just enough to let you know it's ready. I absolutely LOVE the removable water reservoir - what a concept! Why would anyone ever do anything different? It's easy to handle and would be easy to clean - except... it never needs cleaning because neither the grounds or coffee can get into it. I don't know if it's the 'flavor bar' (in the carafe lid) or something else, but the coffee tastes so much better/stronger - despite using the same brand I've used for 15 years. And a bonus: it doesn’t sound like fireworks are going off when finished brewing (my dog is much happier). The coffeemaker is very easy to clean - it doesn't make a mess when you remove the filter basket, as many models do. And last but not least, it's attractive!The 1 minor quirk: who thought it would be desirable or efficient or attractive to have an external hook to store your coffee scoop? VERY odd in my opinion.Forget about Cuisinart & Braun: buy this Ninja!!!"
"It works good. In my opinion the RICH brew option is useless, I don't taste the coffee much stronger when I used it. Overall, good quality.If you are looking for a strong coffee this is not the coffee maker that you need."
"bought this in April of 24, leaked slightly the first night, no problems since, then on 10/10/24 it poured out & won't stop, update10/12/24: took bottom of maker off, water tube that feeds unit from reservoir came off, had to reattach, not a hard fix, but shouldn't have to"
"This makes decent coffee and I'm actually buying a second one after the first died: got almost exactly one year's service before it failed.  Problem, noted by other purchasers, is the reservoir-machine connection which started unobtrusively leaking water into the interior of the machine, where the electrics are.  If you start noticing water on the surface where the Ninja sits that's a clue that your brewer is on the road to Sudden Appliance Death.  I will try not removing the reservoir on the replacement, and see if that gets any additional length of service before collapse."
"We like the removable water reservoir, the ability to program the start time, the integrated scoop, and the permanent filter.After four months the plunger on the bottom of the removable filter holder stop connecting with the 'button' on the top of the brew through lid. Coffee ran down the outside of the carafe onto the warming plate. Coffee also leaked from the bottom of the unit. We cleaned everything and ensured the filter holder was lined up with the brew through lid but it still didn't stop the leaking."
"I did not notice any difference in coffee taste comparing to the cheapest $20 machines.The downsides of Ninja are 1) it is very tall, so you need to find a space that will fit it and 2) to refill water, you have to take off a separate tank lid and put it somewhere - it is not attached to the tank - extremely inconvenient to do that every time.And yes, as many other reviewers mentioned - it takes quite a lot of time to brew..."
Digital dispaly started losing digits about 3 week into use. After several months it is showing 3 l8nes.
"Overall, the machine makes nice coffee. However, there are some caveat. First, you have to fill the reservoir each time. The machine also has rubber feet, which sounds like it would be ideal, however, you have to pull the machine to you each time to fill the reservoir. For some reason when I purchased this, I thought that you filled the reservoir once and then could brew coffee multiple times from it ."
"First off I'm a long time Ninja buyer!  I love Ninja products.... Until I had this coffee pot!  This coffee pot is worse than the cheapest model at Walmart.  Every brew it would put coffee grinds in our coffee which we tried everything to prevent by putting less coffee.  Even brewed a 2 scoop and still put grounds in our coffee.2nd complaint is the taste.  Not good at all.  Feels like this coffee pot was not extracting all of the flavor from the coffee.  Not strong in the least regardless of brewing on bold or adding proper amount of grounds.3rd complaint is it took FOREVER to brew on bold.  Yes, I understand they take longer for bold as I've owned plenty of pots.  However this pot you can brew 1/2 carafe, go take a shower get dressed and come back and the 1/2 pot is still not finished.  That's a bit long for me.4th and last complaint is the coffee was never hot enough after brewing.  Maybe if you drink your coffee black but I add a little creamer to mine and it was just not hot like other pots.My overall review is save your money and time on returning this pot like I did and look elsewhere!."
"Solid coffee maker, Slow brewing though, Decent price."
"Love the removable reservoir, love the fllter system, love how it cleans, LOVE THE COFFEE!!!!  HOWEVER it just burned out and will not brew after only thirteen months.  We love it so much that I have reordered the same pot again and are hoping for a longer life for this one."
I’ve notice a puddle of water by the coffee machine every time I make a pot. I make about 8-10 cups (fill up to the water line) but it doesn’t even brew half of the carafe. Will try cleaning once more and will update review it issue resolves.
I just looked at coffee pot from the bottom side and can see the glue are the rim gluing the handle on. This doesn’t seem right and potentially nasty exposure to this glue as liquid heats up. I’ll be returning.
"I hate to rain on this parade/Ninja lovefest, but I want to share a little feedback after owning this unit for two years now: it leaks, and I’m not so sure we would buy one again.  We were drawn to the Ninja as we prefer the cone style filter (it’s the only civilized way to auto-brew coffee lol), the reviews were glowing and the price point is good. We were willing to overlook the ridiculous, embossed “NINJA” emblazoned on the front, which is overkill. For the first eighteen months things were great and we loved everything about the machine that you read in the reviews.  But at month 18, and as reflected in many online comments (reddit, Google), the seal between the reservoir and the base fails and you lose about a half cup of water when you reattach the reservoir prior to brewing, and again during the brew cycle, spilled onto the counter.  We’ve followed all of the fixes recommended by online commenters to no avail. While the unit continues to make great coffee, we do have to clean up water every brew."
"I have had two of these coffee makers in less than two years. There's a lot to like about this model - most importantly, it makes consistently good coffee. However, it has a design flaw that results in it leaking water onto the counter through the base. This is unacceptable, as a number of other reviewers have pointed out.Both makers leaked a little from the beginning, but after a few months the amount of water escaping became unbearable. I did take the first one partially apart to try to learn what the problem was. It appears to me that the water is coming from the hole at the top of the filter funnel (probably intended for funnel overflows), down a tube inside the machine, and then out through a vent in the base. (And I'm never in an overflow situation; we're never brewing a whole pot!) I did manage to assure myself that this was not an electrical hazard (the water does not get close to any electrical connections), but bought a second machine on the assumption that it was an anomaly with the first. Unfortunately, the second one has the exact same problem.Other reviews indicating similar problems have indicated so much difficulty getting warranty service from Shark Ninja that I haven't attempted to do so, even though both units became major leakers within the warranty period. I don't have hours, or the patience, to waste on the phone with unhelpful support.I am living with the problem for now by keeping the maker in a tray to contain the water, but am looking for another brand with similar price and capabilities. No luck so far, since other brands that I've found which seem to have similar water sprinklers in the lid also have reviews indicating leakage.I did have a Bonavita for a number of years (significantly more expensive), and it worked well without leakage until it died. That Bonavita model is no longer available, and I had to return the newer model I initially ordered because of a number of other problems with it.I don't consider myself especially fussy about machines. All I expect is basic consistency in fulfilling their intended function. Why is that getting so hard to find?"
I got this because the one I had didn't make the coffee hot enough. This one makes coffee a little hotter but  stiil not hot enough! I guess you have to spend a couple hundred dollars to get hot coffee. Other than that it's a quality machine. I like the fact you can remove the water holder and fill it and slide it back in place rather than having to pour water into the machine which always pours out over the side etc. Time set feature is nice too.
"I love this unit.  Purchased Feb 25, 2021.  Nothing beats waking up to a cup of great tasting, hot coffee.  Programmed every evening for a 5:30am brew.  However, after a few months, I noticed one of the digital ""bars"" on the clock/timer face not lighting-up.  OK, I can live with that.  Then they started going out, one or two at a time.  Finally the clock became difficult to read.  Then the power went out and I needed to re-program the timer for the next morning's brew.  That became a bit of a chore.Finally I realized that this product has a 1 year Warranty.  I had registered with Ninja and figured, ""Hey may as well make use of the product warranty.""  Uhhhh... not so simple, Jack.I call the provided customer service warranty number.  The person who answers and I have a bit of a communication problem.  He has a Spanish accent and I have my Hawaiian/pidgin accent, but I'm trying;... WE'RE trying to communicate.  We go through the model/serial number information and I explain as best I can that the clock/timer is almost unreadable.He goes through his CS protocols and after a few minutes says they (Ninja) will send me a new/replacement base.  BUT... I'll need t pay for shipping, hmmm... $25 or $26 bucks (I can't remember for sure...).  Finally I decide, ""Heck... I really like this unit.  OK, send me a new base. I'll pay the shipping."" Not so fast Cisco...We start the banking process, I'm paying via debit.  Fail. The transaction doesn't go through.  He tries again.  Fail again.  Then I get a ""suspicious transaction"" notice from my bank on my mobile phone.  I call my bank on my mobile.  They tell me an entity in a foreign country is attempting to access my account.  So I ask the guy where he is, and he says Colombia.  So I just tell him to forget it... I'll live with a broken clock/timer.As much as I like this product, when it finally does give up the ghost, I'll not buy another Ninja coffee maker.  Lesson learned."
"If you watch many Japanese period dramas and animes, you'd come away with the realization that being ninjas is not a long-lived career.  Same thing plagues the Ninja programmable coffee brewer.  Mine lasted 3 years, using it around 25 times a month.Pro: It's easy to use.  The detachable water tank feature is a real plus.  It brewed a decent cup during its first year.Con: It died just past its 3rd birthday. The led control panel started flaking out after 1 year of use.  It looked like it was caused by moisture leaking into the backside of the touch control panel.  The design is such that there's no way to mitigate this flaw.  Eventually, the whole panel went due to moisture seepage.  The coffee maker had to go to an unmarked grave with the other ninjas before it.Additionally, the flavor of the coffee brewed changed near the end of its 2nd year.  The coffee started tasting acidic.  At first, I thought it was the beans.  I tested various beans using hand pour methods.  The coffee taste profile remain relatively same as  before.  From that I determined beans weren't the variable; it was the machine.Maybe 2 years of decent coffee and 1 additional year of limping along made a good service life for a Ninja.  But I was hoping for more."
"I like that the water reservoir is removable, making it easier to clean.I like that it has 2 selections to brew regular strength coffee, or stronger coffee.I like that it has a reusable coffee filter, as #4 size cone filters are a tad bit expensive, so this is a money saver.What I'm not particularly fond of is that it takes longer to brew a full pot of coffee = takes on average 12-15 minutes total.In addition I'm not fond of how noisy it is when it's brewing.We use reverse-osmosis filtered water, so the sputtering sounds it makes during the entire brew cycle is annoying.With the pros and cons stacked side by side, I'm straddling the fence between ""like"" vs ""dislike"".One would think for the price tag of $70 it would be more superior to the run-of-the-mill $30-40 Mr. Coffee maker at Wal-Mart. But apparently not."
Worked great while it worked but it didn’t even last 2 years.
"Broke the carafe twice, barely tapped it on edge of sink while washing, bought a generic cheap replacement the second time. Great coffee, loved the features. Sadly 2.5 years in it broke, somehow the heating element got a small tear in it (not sure how, never leaves my counter top) and almost started a fire- luckily I was home and smelled it burning from across the house."
"Worked great at first. Purchased in May 2024, good coffee made quickly. Now in August 2024 the delay brew function does not work as it should, and sometimes when you brew the coffee it is not hot.This is my 1st Ninja product purchased and I’m just not impressed . Better options out there for less miney"
"Unit worked fine for about 10 weeks - then Delay Brew feature failed.  Still worked manually but who wants to wait around for 5 mins on the morning Joe.  Just got off the phone with service - getting a warranty replacement of the programmable base after coughing up $22 for shipping.  Before the failure, we were quite happy with the strength of the brew, particularly when using the Rich setting.  It's easy to clean and program, independent of the failure. Giving three stars based primarily on reliability; the Delay Brew malfunction is not uncommon based on a brief internet search.  All electronic devices are subject to failure - for the price we still like the CE251 (the exact model number) and hope the replacement gives us years of service."
"I've had this coffee maker for about 2.5 years, and I really like the quality of the coffee for the price. We routinely fill the reservoir overnight so that we can brainlessly start the brew cycle first thing in the morning. Occasionally the reservoir might get bumped and unseat from the base, leading to water leaking all over the place. I chalked this up to user error, and just made sure the reservoir was well seated before each use. Recently it has begun to leak despite this, and it will no longer hold its water. I've subsequently read other reviews that say the same, and that even if the coffee maker is within warranty, the reservoir is not included.So buyer, beware. It may make great coffee for a while, but for how long, and will your kitchen suffer water damage before when it goes?"
"Hello fellow Amazoners, I've chosen to give this product 2 stars. We are really disappointed in the product we received vs the product we thought we were buying. Ninja is a reputable brand and this coffee maker looks pretty sweet, but let's look at the list of things I'm not happy with (please refer to photos for additional detail). First off, there are no lines/markers on the carafe for when you fill it with water, which is annoying, but after a couple of times, you can eyeball how much water is in the carafe or how much coffee is left. Next, the measuring spoon that comes with the maker attaches to the left side and the spoon is facing out, which means that dust, water/liquid, anything can get stuck to the exposed spoon and possibly taint your ground coffee in the container your are scooping from. Next, this is only a TEN cup pot. If you add more than 10 scoops, your filter will overflow and make a nasty mess. The photo you can see that the measuring spoon is not heaping with grounds and is a very conservative scoop. Then you can see the before and after photos of the grounds in the filter and this is only for 10 scoops. Also, this maker takes approximately 16 minutes to brew an entire pot.The things I do like about this maker are:* Aesthetically it looks nice and sleek.* The water containment area is removable, therefore easily washableOverall, I would not recommend this coffee maker. Unfortunately, it's past our return window. We may just throw it away, but who wants to throw away $100+ in the trash? Don't waste your money. You've been warned."
There’s a piece at the bottom of the reservoir that doesn’t come off for cleaning and mold gets trapped in it. What a waste of money.
This has a great design. The coffee is smooth and tastes great. The only drawback is it is very loud when brewing.
"The Ninja name is wasted here. It’s way too expensive for the lack of convenience most coffee makers give.  It looks sleek and inviting, but the auto-brew timer has to be set daily which can be a pain after a while. The warmer/burner only stays warm for two hours. There’s no setting to increase or decrease that time. On top of that, the coffee is not piping hot when it’s first brewed, so the warmer just keeps it warm and not hot. The carafe does not slide in and out of the position easily. You have to yank a little to pull it out and then risk spilling coffee or use two hands - one to stabilize the whole unit and the other to pull out the carafe."
"I love the coffee maker but shortly after using it the black part where the glass container sits, started peeling."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This review is coming from a customer who has owned the Ninja CE201 coffee maker for four years. While I initially loved how it brewed coffee, the recurring problems I've encountered over time have made me reconsider my opinion.For the first year of ownership, I was extremely satisfied with the Ninja CE201. The coffee quality was excellent, and the machine seemed to be built to last. However, the problems I've experienced in the years since have completely changed my perspective.Within 18 months of ownership, the machine began to leak cold water from the bottom. This issue occurs every time I run a cleaning cycle (approximately every 6 weeks), and the amount of leakage is significant. For example, a 4-cup brew can result in 4 ounces of water leaking out.In addition to the leaks, the machine's performance has deteriorated over time. After about 4 weeks of daily use, the brewing time slows down considerably, from 5 minutes to 10 minutes or more. This issue is resolved with a cleaning cycle, but the recurring nature of the problem is frustrating.Furthermore, the clock display malfunctioned shortly after purchase, becoming permanently stuck on a display of weird characters instead of numbers. This not only makes it difficult to set the clock for delayed brewing, but it also detracts from the overall user experience.The clock issue has prevented me from using the delayed brew feature, which was a major selling point for me. I had hoped to wake up to freshly brewed coffee every morning, but this is no longer possible due to the defective clock.While I have not personally experienced an electrical shock, the potential for one is a serious concern given the leaking water and the electrical components within the machine.Given the high price tag and the recurring problems I've encountered, I strongly advise potential buyers to avoid this coffee maker. The Ninja CE201 is not only unreliable but also a potential safety hazard. The quality and performance of this product are far below what I expected from a reputable brand like Ninja. This is a clear case of a company selling a defective and dangerous product at an exorbitant price. I feel scammed and deeply disappointed."
"The coffee pot works just fine. But the small batch button is a joke. I got this pot because I'm the only one who drinks coffee in my house (hence why I was drawn to the small batch button), but I have company over often who also enjoy coffee (why I wanted a 12-cup maker).The button literally makes NO SENSE when it tells you in the directions not to fill the reservoir with more coffee than you want to drink.I will likely return this product. I want to have a maker with a small batch feature that actually stops after 4 cups and not have to refill the reservoir every day. This coffee pot is too expensive for that feature to not work properly."
"I had bought one of these for my primary home under two years ago and really liked it. So I got another one to use in my summer home. This one was visibly defective with a crack in the warming plate. I had to return that one and it was replaced with the one I currently have in my summer home. The 4 hour warming feature on this one never worked, but I kept it anyway, even though I bought it because of this feature. It took much longer to brew and made a noise throughout the brew cycle that was not an issue with the one in my primary home. It also had a cheaper looking permanent filter than the one in my primary home. Now the one in my summer home will not empty all the water from the reservoir after using it maybe ten times at the most. This means the coffee is too strong.I am now having an issue with the one I have in my primary home, but I can work around it, for now. This problem is that there is a spring at the bottom of the part that holds the filter, which has stretched and now hangs down so that you can not get the carafe back onto the warming plate without manually pulling up the part that holds the filter. So this one is failing in under two years, too.This coffee maker is cheaply made and doesn't seem to have any quality control that you can depend on. I suppose you could say that the one in my primary home worked correctly in the beginning, but is failing now, less than two years after I started using it. When this coffee maker dies, I will by another brand. Three bad coffee makers in under two years is unacceptable."
"Disappointingly, This pot has developed a leak on the bottom of the pot. About  a 1/4 cup of water leaks out on to the counter when making 6-8 cups .  The coffee no  longer brews at the 195 temp.  I have to replacl this pot that has only 9 months of use.  Should have at least got a year out of it. 2 stars because it started out making really good coffee."
"This is a coffee pot I have a love/hate relationship with.  I bought my first one a few years ago and it has made nice hot coffee without a hiccup since new.  However, over time, two things WILL happen.1)  It will start to leak a great deal of water inside the base of the unit, which is an electrical HAZARD!  Some days it will not leak at all, and other days it will leak a great deal of water when it is brewing.  There are plenty of reviews of this problem, so thinking it will not happen to you is wishful thinking.2)  The LCD display started failing in less than a year.  First it was just one segment but over time, more and more light segments started to vanish.  It is now more than 95% gone and useless.Despite these issue's, I opted to buy a new one last month because I was worried about the water leaking and the electrical hazard.  Right out of the box, the new unit started making very loud sounds, the same one's you hear when the last amount of water is being sucked up.  However, the water reservoir was still full and fully seated.  I removed the reservoir several times and re-seated it but it would barely transfer the water through the brewer and continued to make loud sucking sounds.  It became obvious that this brand new coffee maker was another failed dud.Sadly, I returned this brand new coffee pot.I will never understand why a company (Ninja) would make such a poor coffee pot, especially one that presents a real ELECTRICAL HAZARD!  I really wish they would correct these problems, as I think most people really enjoy this coffee pot."
"I bought this coffee pot in July 2023, and I loved it from the start.  I loved how it poured, it kept the coffee hot for 2 or 4 hours (you can change the setting easily), and it produced delicious coffee every morning.  We frequently commented on how great the coffee tasted in this brewer.  However, this morning, I heard a soft beeping sound, and I tracked it down to the coffee maker.  I removed the carafe, and it felt super-hot, and there was a crackling, popping sound coming from the unit casing.  Then I smelled the burning plastic/electronics odor and saw smoke coming from the back of the unit, near where the measuring scoop attaches.  We unplugged it as more smoke came pouring from it, and the odor of burning fumes increased.  We carefully carried it outside and grabbed a fire extinguisher from under the sink just in case it was needed.  Thankfully, the unit eventually stopped smoking and cooled down out in the fresh air, and no flames were seen.  It scares me to think what could have happened if I didn't hear the soft beeping, or if I'd turned it on and then gone to take a shower.  Such a shame for such a good coffee maker, but it has scared me from ever having another one in my home."
Reservoir just started to leak. I live in a high calcium deposit city water area. The reservoir has a spring and gaskets which are stuck in open position. Tried descaling with no success. Ninja support hard to get a hold of.  Bought in February. So just over 6 months old.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Love the coffee this makes. The rest is terrible. Just after the warranty these things happened:- Digits went out on the clock.- Each brew left a puddle under the unit.- Carafe started leaking in the seam between the plastic and the glass at the top.I read online that Ninja would not stand behind their products after the warranty so for the first few months of a bad display I lived with it. Then the other leaks started recently (18 months old) I emailed complete details with photos to their support asking for a free or nearly free replacement.They responded to the email saying I had to call in. I called and spent an hour+ detailing the issues and waiting to talk to a supervisor. I never talked to the supervisor and was told to call back if I wanted to later, and my only option at that time was to pay $65 for a replacement unit.I called in again, explained the whole (simple to understand) situation again and was told I had to do a video troubleshooting session before I could talk to a supervisor. I did this and finally got to talk to a supervisor after some time on hold told me the best option they could offer was 30% off the $99 list price and no cost shipping... same price as on Amazon.I used all my best reasoning with them - about how a company should stand behind their products. How I the problems started just after the warranty. How the price they gave me was essentially giving nothing.... but they kept a hard line that once the warranty is over that is it.I promised them I would leave an honest review with photos. I told them they could respond to my review on Amazon.So. If you have money to burn on coffee makers get this one as it will make good coffee and you will get a new one every year or two based upon my experience.Oh and surprise... I bought the same model for a rental house and it has issues as well right after the warranty expired... so 2 out of 2. And I bought a third just to fix the other two, so we will see how the parts from this one hold up. But after this last one I am no longer a Ninja coffee maker customer. They do not stand behind their premium priced products."
The coffee maker works well. The only major issue is the buttons are ridiculous hard to push. I have to place my hand on top of maker just to turn on the coffee maker.  Just kind of disappointed in this maker.
"This coffee maker was fine for the first 2 months. After I cleaned it for the first time, It started leaking from the water tank every time I used it. I called Ninja customer support for help with the warranty and was told it was not within warranty and was made to pay for a replacement. the replacement tank leaks even worse. I have never had so many issues with the coffee maker within the first year. Beyond this it's a fine coffee maker, but I could do without water all over my counter and floor."
"I purchased this unit in April of 2023.  It is now October of 2023, so its been 6 months.  The water reservoir has a spring mechanism in place that is triggered when seated into the base.  My unit's spring would stick.  The whole thing is clear and you can pretty easily see that its just a spring and a plunger, but there's no way to disassemble it to try to clean it out.  I attempted to clean it by soaking it in a coffee cleaner solution as well as vinegar, but the plunger would still stick.  The manual and online support has no information on resolving this type of issue.  There is no web based support, so you have to call in.  I registered my product and called their support, explaining the situation.  The support agent was very friendly and helpful, but she informed me that Ninja considers this as ""normal wear and tear"" and it is not covered by the warranty.  She was nice enough to make an exception for me since I never called about issues before, so I'm still getting my replacement part.  But the part alone is 20 dollars, a BIG fraction of the cost of the whole thing.  I've had 15 dollar coffee makers last longer and would rather just get a different one at that point.Their phone support is fine and pleasant, but knowing how limited their warranty is for something that should be very easy to fix as is, its unacceptable to me.  Great support, subpar product, awful warranty.I would normally chalk the issue up to a one time thing, but I was gifted an ice cream maker from ninja that tore up the plastic container leaving plastic strands in the ice cream.  So that's two different Ninja products with terrible QC.Assuming your unit works fine with no issues, its probably great.  But I've had too many issues with Ninja products at this point to be a repeat customer.  If something else breaks, I'll just get my 15 dollar coffee maker."
"I've owned this coffee pot for about 6 months now, and the rubber seal on the bottom of the reservoir has failed on me twice already. The only way to fix this is to buy a replacement part from the manufacturer which will run you $20 + shipping. I always thought Ninja was a reputable brand, but maybe I was wrong. At least half of the water makes it's way into the pot, the other half on the counter. As far as the maker itself, it really isn't anything special. It just looks nice and works just about as well as the coffee pots you can get for $20 at Walmart."
Coffee tastes great but the coffee pot leaks water from the filter basket every time and the coffee pot itself retains water after washing and leaks also.
"Bought this Shark/Ninja Coffee maker based on how satisfied I've been with one of their vacuum cleaners. I works fine and everything but I cant say it's any better than a $40 Mr. Coffee. I am a bit miffed that when I called Ninja to exercise the warranty for a leaking reservoir tank, they said that the tank was a ""wear item"" and not covered under the 1-year warranty and that I would have to purchase the replacement tank. WTF??? That left me with little choice other than to buy the replacement tank. Not at all my experience with their vacuum cleaner warranty purchased from Costco. When it fails again, I'm going back to a Mr. Coffee product!  Amazon should make the details of all warranties easily accessible from the listing's page."
Works ok but coffee is not hot. I like cream in my coffee so to get hot coffee I have to preheat the water reservoir the cups and the cream. Cannot make coffee ahead of time because warming plate doesn't work well either. Anyone else have these problems?
"We've been using this machine daily for ~3.5 years, and I'll be replacing it with a different machine. While it makes good coffee (we've always used the additional filters as suggested in the comments), the point of failure is the seal underneath the water hopper. After a year, we stopped removing the water canister altogether, and just filled it with the pot, which works fine. But every so often, the seal fails enough to get your counter full of water, leaving you with a wet countertop and some horribly strong coffee (which I still drink because I'm a coffee junky). If you buy this, I'd suggest never removing the water hopper. Just take the lid off, and fill it using the carafe.Thanks for the memories, Ninja. Time for the ""Amazon recommended"" badge to be applied to something better."
"It makes good, hot coffee, but it takes forever to make a whole pot. I used to have the ninja bar and it took about half the time to make the same quality pot of coffee. Im talking like 15-20 minutes, when the average should be 6-8 minutes."
Just a heads up...I bought this in Jan and overall works fine.....HOWEVER! The coffee maker will make a pot without carafe on burner! Didn't notice carafe was not on burner this am and pushed the start button and jumped in shower. Hubby woke up to water all over counter and floor!! Burned 2 fingers when I tried to move machine over to sink. I thought this didn't work without pot - just in case.....be aware. Will probably get another maker because this is dangerous.
Works well for 2 years then starts to leak water out of the base heating plate … yikes!
Happy with the machine so far.  Operated as described. Temperature of coffee brewed should be hotter.
"I purchased this coffee maker 8 months ago. From day 1 it takes 30 minutes to brew 1 pot. After the keep warm feature times out, the only way to turn it back on is to brew more coffee. When I remove the pot, more than normal amounts of coffee drips onto the heating plate. I should have returned it right after I got it. I only gave it a 2 because it does make good coffee."
Coffee could be hotter.  Warming plate does not keep coffee hot either.
"Less than 2 years old, the reservoir no longer holds water and the coffee maker won't brew. For the price this is ridiculous. The replacement part is $30 after shipping cost which is almost half the price of the whole unit. Very disappointed."
"After waking up to another mess this morning I felt the need to write a review on this Ninja coffee maker. I purchased this brewer three months ago and since then I have had several brewing failures where water leaked out of the reservoir all over the counter tops and floor. Since I decided that I was done with this particular coffee maker I took a shot at trying to diagnose the issue. I started with removing the “plunger cap” on the coffee maker that the water reservoir connects to, BINGO! I found the issue which ultimately accounts to poor quality control. Under the plunger cap sits a rubber seal that looks like a top hat. The lip of this seal got folded when the plunger cap was put on during assembly. After properly realigning the rubber seal and replacing the plunger cap I have not experienced any more leaks. I have read other reviews of this Ninja coffee maker leaking so hopefully this helps someone resolve their leaking issue, especially if the return window has passed and the warranty has expired.Note: The plunger cap has three points that are lightly glued down.  I gently pried the cap off and re-glued it when it was replaced. The rubber seal sits under this cap (see photos). This may void any warranty so please do this at your own discretion."
"I'm not impressed.The pot leaks all over the counter when you pour from the carafe.It seems to take a long time to brew the pot of coffee.I'm sending this back.2 star, because it looks nice and I like that you fill the water canister instead of having to pour the water from the carafe into the machine.I wouldn't even try this brand or own again."
"Worked great for 9 months and then water tank started leaking where it attaches. At about 11 months it would stop the brew process within a couple of minutes of starting, ever so often. Replaced it with a Black and Decker."
"It makes good coffee, but the pressure required to push the buttons exceeds the pressure needed to move the coffee maker. When you push a button, the whole device slides a few inches back on the counter. If you place it directly against a wall, you'll be fine. But if you need it to be out a bit from the wall, as in our case so it's not directly under our upper cabinets, this design flaw will drive you crazy. I'm going to try placing it on a silicone non-slip mat to see if this solves the problem. But I feel that I shouldn't have to do that. Soft-press buttons should have been used instead of the stiff ones they chose."
"The machine died about a week ago after 3 years of service. There was a slow decline starting after about 2 years before it finally stopped working altogether. The display panel gradually lost the ability to display numbers, first the very rightmost digit lost some of it's bars and it moved across the display from there.But for 3 years the machine produced decent coffee every morning and the autostart feature worked, even if it was a little harder to set the start time for the last year or so. I won't buy another one, since I expect products to last longer than 3 years, but it is inexpensive and gets the job done."
"Here are the problems that make me not like this coffee maker.First, the design of the carafe is quite poor. Most carafes are all glass with a plastic handle and top that snaps into place. This carafe has an additional plastic ring that goes all the way around the top of the glass - then also has the standard plastic top that snaps into place. After owning this for two weeks, the seam where the glass meets the plastic started leaking. I cannot pour a cup of coffee without coffee dripping onto the countertop through this seam. And... There's no way to fix it. The only way to prevent additional clean-up is to only pour coffee over the sink.In many coffee makers, the water drips into the center of the coffee basket from a spout just above. Ninja came up with an idea where it uses something that is much wider and looks like a showerhead. The problem is this showerhead is much wider than the area taken up by the coffee. This allows water to run right past the coffee rather than drip though the coffee. Testing different settings led me to use the ""small Batch"" and ""Rich"" buttons on everything but a full pot. In the end, my favorite coffee just doesn't taste quite as good coming out of this coffee maker as it did from my old Mr Coffee (maker) that died after a number of years of faithful use.The removeable water tank is a novel idea. After reading reviews, I would not trust it to be removed (to fill with water) on a daily basis. I think this water tank would need to be filled with a pitcher.A minor design oversight... This has rubber feet rather than plastic feet. It's hard to slide it out and back from under the counter because the rubber feet stick to the countertop.I'm not happy I purchased this and will begin looking for something that is more intelligently designed."
"This machine produces good coffee, but the water reservoir mechanism broke after a year and a half of use. It ends up leaking water all over while brewing.. I assume it gets worn down when taking the reservoir on and off to fill with water. Unfortunate that the warranty is only for a year."
the ninja coffee pot has a keep warm button.  i have that on whenever the coffee pot is on.  Unfortunately the  plate on which the carafe sits does not keep the coffee warm  AT ALL.  If one doesn't immediately drink the made coffee it becomes luke warm quickly and goes cooler from there.
"If you want a great coffeemaker that doesn't last much longer than its one-year warranty, this is the product for you. I've had coffeemakers that were a fraction of the price last longer. This was my first experience with this brand. I'm so disappointed."
"This is the second ninja coffee maker in this model to go out on me in the past two years. The first one (which was a wedding gift) randomly stopped brewing one day shortly after the warranty expired. I purchased a second one because I was disappointed and really liked the coffee maker. I made a point to buy an extended warranty this time too.My new one has started leaking from the base every time we use it. There’s water all over the counter by the time it’s done brewing which is super dangerous considering this is an electrical device that’s plugged in and there’s no way to know where the water is leaking from. I’ve checked to make sure the water reserve is seated correctly and that it’s not an error on my end, but it leaks every time. This one is still in the manufacturer warranty, but ninja has refused to help me unless I video chat them from home to show them my coffee pot. I’ve tried multiple times to explain that I’m not able to leave work to go home to video chat them. I’ve offered to take videos/photos. I’ve offered to send in whatever info they need, and I’ve received no help whatsoever. And because it’s still in the manufacturer’s warranty, my extended warranty is currently no good either. I’m so disappointed in the quality of this product for how much it cost me, and I’m even more disappointed in the customer service.**Update**After sending in my information multiple times and being giving the runaround each time, I finally spoke to a rep named Stephanie today. I addressed my concerns and was flat out told by Stephanie that despite the fact that the unit is actively plugged in while it’s leaking that it’s not considered an electrical hazard. I’m shocked at how little concern ninja has for the quality of its products and the safety of their costumers. Stephanie finally offered to replace the base if I paid a nearly $21 shipping charge. This is completely unacceptable. Ninja is issuing faulty units and then charging their costumers to replace them. There are many complaints regarding the leaking issue, and ninja doesn’t seem to have any plans to address this. When I told Stephanie that I wouldn’t pay shipping, she finally agreed to send me a replacement base. We’ll see if this one also leaks. I’m truly appalled by the entire situation. This is a huge safety issue, and ninja needs to address it before something horrible happens to one of their customers."
Started to leak water after 6 months. Gradually leaking more and more during brewing. Coffee is good but not hot enough.On the plus side we haven't used paper filters for a year.
"This coffee maker started out great!!  It was easy to use, except for the lid having to be twisted on and off several times to fit correctly. The flavor was good and the delay brew timer worked well. But after less than a year, the base began to leak water all over my counter top. I tried to trouble shoot by cleaning the unit with a water and vinegar solution, making sure the water reservoir was placed correctly on the base etc. I also read several reviews which complained about the same problem I was having.  Well, it still continued to leak. So, I contacted SharkNinja about my problem with the unit. After verifying some information and linking up with the customer service agent via text and video so they could first hand see the coffee base was leaking in real time, they said my unit was under warranty and a new replacement base could be sent out. The catch was I had to pay a $21 shipping fee for overnight delivery. After a back and forth ( me refusing to pay for shipping for their defective product which was still under warranty) they said a one time shipping waiver would occur. The product arrived and I started enjoying coffee again. Then, about 10 months later,  the base started leaking water again. I troubleshooted again to no avail. I called the customer service line again, went through the steps mentioned with first base, agent confirmed base leakage in real time, then told me the warranty covered the ORIGINAL base ONLY, which was out of warranty!  So, the option given to me was to purchase a new base for $150, but they could discount that for me to pay ONLY $75 and waive the shipping. Really??!! Let me get this straight, they offer a discount for a 2nd defective product they know about having leaking issues!! I did not want to take a chance a third time with a leaky base, so I respectfully declined the offer. Unbelievable! I now have to find a new coffeemaker. I do not recommend this product."
"I purchased this coffee maker in Nov 2023. This morning, Nov 2024, after it completed its brew cycle, the machine started beeping. I removed the carafe to see if that would stop the beeping. It didn’t. I turned the machine off at the front on/off button, which stopped the beeping, but then I noticed smoke (thought it was steam) pouring out near the base of the unit along with a strong burnt electrical smell. I unplugged and took the machine outside immediately. I’m not sure what would have happened had I left the room during the brew cycle and not heard the beeping. I believe the unit was on fire internally at the time and it didn’t shut itself off! I loved this coffee maker during the year I used it and rarely brewed more than 6 cups at a time. I have never had an electrical appliance catch fire while in use. Shark Ninja may need to review the electrical circuitry on these units to avoid catastrophe."
"I like Ninja products and was excited to find a coffee pot with a clear water reservoir and 14"" tall (note: measurements in description are NOT CORRECT).  We have 14 1/2 clearance and the coffee maker squeezes under the cabinet without any extra room.  The depth is 8 1/2 (this does not include the handle).  The power button is hard to push but that maybe the size and location of the button.  On the plus side, I like the other options that come with the coffee pot.  We have only used it three times but so far, the carafe doesn't leak.  I would return it but we had to have a coffee pot and have used it a handful of time --the scraping of the lid and the lip of my cabinet will get old."
The item arrived on time and looked nice. We ran a batch of water through as the instructions told us to. The pot cracked as soon as the water filtered through.  And then water leaked from it. I'm disappointed. I bought this brand to avoid the problems of lesser quality items.
"This is my third Ninja device, and based off the reviews - I was feeling very confident about my purchase. Then it arrived at the beginning January - so I gave it a month and a half before reviewing. It’s has a lot of issues folks. So all these 5 star reviews - I’m missing something (?). I’ll start with the ‘Pro’s’: it looks really nice.Let me move to the Cons:- I bought this as a replacement for my other Ninja coffee maker which I had for at least 4 years. Great product and really a good design. The water reservoir was ROUND making it easy to fill and handle. On this new coffee maker - it’s not ergonomic or easy to carry (dome trapezoidal design). The second awful part of the design: the coffee filter lid lifts UP - meaning that if you place this under a cabinet - you won’t be able to fill it with coffee unless you move tho whole darn thing out under the cabinet/counter.- it takes about 20-30 minutes to brew a pot. So if you are looking for a reasonable cup of. Joe in the morning - this coffee maker won’t do the job. This is really frustrating, but it does ,are a decent cup of Joe.  But I’ve had other coffee makers do it in less than half the time. It’s painfully slow. But it’s good- so that’s the extra star - but I’ve had BETTER in LESS TIME.- It has a ‘half-pot’ feature where it’s just a lighted button. When you push it - it still makes a full pot. Wonderful..I gave the coffee maker to the local church for their AA meetings.It made it a weekend before landing in the trash.What a waste of money and a major disappointment. My last Ninja was just as expensive, but the QUALITY and DESIGN was far better. At least the air-fryer is still cranking. I can definitely recommend THAT product, but advise you to stay away from this coffee maker."
"We bought 2 of these, one for our home and one for a cottage. They make fine coffee, but the digital readout on both broke in less than 6 months. Now it’s almost impossible to set auto brew, which is a key feature for me. I won’t buy again."
"I purchased this unit after reading reviews on dozens of other coffee makers. It was a late wedding gift to ourselves with a gift card from our HoneyFund, and I was so excited to upgrade from my trusty French press!We only just opened the box and got the machine up and running a few days ago (had to make room on the kitchen counter) The machine is easy to use and comes with great instructions. We love the Delay Brew option as it will be making our mornings easier. It brews a strong cup and is easy to clean... I thought I was in love until I went to pour that first cup and coffee leaked all over my kitchen counter!The carafe leaks like crazy from the side where the glass meets the black plastic rim. It's extremely disappointing considering everything else about this product is pretty darn great. I have to pour coffee over my kitchen sink which is annoying. I have a Ninja blender that I've had for years and absolutely LOVE so I am pretty bummed that this piece is faulty on the coffee maker.I am hoping that Ninja does the right thing and send me a replacement carafe. I have the warranty info and the customer service number so I will update my review if they make things right. Currently I am unhappy with the product because what's the point in upgrading if you're gonna have busted parts?"
"Bought this for my grandparents and it doesn’t heat the coffee enough, they haven’t had it for a year. Contacted support but it would be $20 to ship a new base and i’m unable to return it for a refund even though it hasn’t lasted a year."
"Very easy to use and clean, but warm coffee not hot from the start and even the keep warm button is not keeping the coffee warm"
Coffee no longer hot after owning for 5 weeks.  I am frustrated trying to get answers/options to fit this problem.
Have had this a couple months and the heating element is already going out . Does not get that hot
This was great but it didn't last long enough for the price.  2.5 years and the seal wore out.  We only used filtered water for the reservoir so it wasn't due to the usual suspects of hard water minerals and such.
"I somehow backed up to a page for a used / reconditioned one, and while it was packed as though it were new, it would not brew a full pot. Returned and bought a replacement from another vendor, as the Amazon rep was rude to me."
If you have a Keurig then you'll hate how long this coffee maker takes. I'm still trying to understand how much coffee to put in the travel side because I've used it as directed and it leaks. I always use Cafe bustelo coffee grinds. The coffee tastes delicious still with this coffee maker. I wanted a large travel size cup. It does make a perfect size cup of coffee for my travel mug. I would say it's average and I find myself missing my Keurig because of the time it takes to brew. 8 minutes
"I have had this a few months now. It is pretty basic, dump the water in the back and it makes that much coffee. You can set it to start at a certain time in the morning. My only real complaint is that the single serve part is essentially useless. It is ridiculously slow (15-20 minutes to make a single cup). You are much better off only using the multi serve side that brews at a relatively normal speed. Disappointing as the single serve option was the primary reason I went with this machine."
"It is necessarily a bad machine, just inconvenient. In the morning, that isn't desirable much less any other time of the day.This doesn't have an independent reservoir so whether you want a pot of single cup you have to add the set amount of water. The pot side and cup side have independent water reservoirs you fill with the desired amount of the water for the coffee you are brewing.Had this machine had a dedicated reservoir of any kind, such as 40-50oz, that both sides pulled from this would be an easy 5 star review. As such, I didn't use it and just put the coffee machine back in the box and returned it. Disappointed."
"The only complaint I have about this coffee maker is that the black coating on the heating element is peeling off. I have only been using this since June and hate the fact that it is peeling off. I am 50 years old and have never had a coffee pot heating element to do this. Now, I am trying to buy one to replace this one and am afraid to buy a Hamilton Beach again."
"Taking 2 stars off for the misdirection on the filters and damaged box . Purchased this for the filter and found out only the single serve has a filter 👎. They almost made a good product but got greedy .also they’re is no sound that tells you it’s done brewing.Pro is the water comes out hot into the cup and the fill line in the mini filter  is accurate and the blue light looks good and green brewing light is bright. It’s a nice machine, but a filter and sound when ready is what I’m looking for ."
"I got this coffeemaker as a gift in 2013, and it worked well. I almost exclusively used the single-carafe side. From time to time, you had to purchase a new plastic filter for the single side, as the one in there got clogged, but no biggy, ordering was easy.I then got a problem with a bug infestation, and they colonized the machine. Yikes! So I ordered a new one. Naturally, the same brand again. That was 2022.The new one worked like the old one, however, it now almost always spilled water over when filling the single side. Some leak further down the tubings, or in the reservoir? Annoying. Then it stopped working altogeher. After a bit over two years, I got a new one.This one doesn't spill readily, but still does if I fill the single side with water too quickly.I feel the machine does what it does and is reliable for the price. But. The quality seems to have been going down. The old machine never had a spill, and also lasted for more than two years. If the one I now have gives me further trouble down the line, the next one will be from a different brand.Now, since the one with all the leakage was from 2022, it is possible the company had to change its sourcing after the destruction of worldwide supply chains in 2020/2021, and the new materials don't fit that well. But I would still like a coffeemaker that doesn't spill..."
"The coffeemaker is fine and works well. But it shuts off after two hours! That may work for some of you, but there is a couple hours difference in the time my husband and I get up for work, so I have to rush down and turn it off and back on before it shuts off. Other coffeemakers we have had stay on for four hours."
"I like that I can either make a whole pot or a cup. But the single serve splashes everywhere!!!! And it takes about 3-5 mins just to brew it. The pot is fine, takes about 10-15 mins for it to be completely done. It is a little bulky, but overall works fine."
"Good in theory, not great when you actually use it. I was willing to ignore the slight bulkiness and the lack of aesthetic design - having the single serve option (without keurig pods!!!) plus having a large 12 cup pot all in one machine was incredible! I have had the machine since the beginning of September and have used it pretty much daily. Most mornings I use the single serve option. First, the opening to pour water into the single serve side is so awkward and poorly designed that you will absolutely spill half your water plus have a bunch hit a ledge in the water hole and bounce out. I have to either transfer the water to a measuring cup with a pour spout or use a silicone cup I can bend. Still being careful not to hit this weird high ledge in there that will shoot some of the water back out. The design where the water goes is so bad I don’t think they ran a single test before putting the machine out for sale. Secondly, the splatter that occurs is ridiculous. Most mornings I am using a tall yeti mug and the white machine still manages to get splashed and splattered - an issue I’ve never experienced with keurigs or other single serve machines. In fact, I’ve never had a coffee machine look so dirty and splattered after one use, no matter the size.While the large pot is easier to use, the water area is also poorly designed and awkward to fill. Also, please tell me why the single serve came with a reusable filter but the large pot size came with 4 wrinkled paper filters and you have to buy your own reusable filter!?Very disappointing purchase, just a strange and oddly designed product that is more trouble than it’s worth."
"My machine worked well for six months, but it now has electrical errors that make the unit unusable. I purchased this coffee maker in January for a discount because of cosmetic damage. However, when I received the unit, the paperwork indicated it was refurbished. I was disappointed and should have returned it right away because it was not as advertised. I decided to keep it and hope for the best. It worked well for six months, but last week, it started to make odd noises when using the single serve. The single serve side now never shuts off. The light isn't on, but the element is always heating. To be safe, the coffee maker must be unplugged whenever it is not in use, so there is no way to use the program feature or keep coffee warm in the pot. It is a huge disappointment.Before these problems, I loved the versatility of using the single serve or the pot. The single serve has a lot of options to accommodate different sized cups. The pot kept coffee piping hot. Great machine if it worked longer. I will consider buying a new one some time to replace it and hope it lasts much longer than six months."
"Hamilton Beach is not particularly prestigious brand, but I've got a bunch of small appliances from them. Most are good value for the money. This coffee maker, however, tilts the scale away from being a good value.This is mostly a plastic coffee maker, which is to be expected. There is a metal insert for the single-cup side for some style, but it's essentially decorative. This feels like a toy. The plastic casing has a creepy-crawly feel that I'm surprised to get out of a retail box intended for sales in the US instead of something off Wish. Only the single-side coffee grounds basket has a nice positive detent when inserting. Every other flap and panel is loose and shoots the breeze. A little plastic bump in the molding would have been free and contributed greatly to confidence so I'm baffled why it wasn't done other than the industrial design was done by someone very inexperienced.This is two coffee makers slapped together and it shows. There is no central water reservoir, you have to fill the single-cup side for single and fill the carafe side for carafe. The water isn't metered like a Keurig, it just squirts through all the water it finds.Because you will probably fill it before use, and the lightweight plastic construction, the first refinement problem is that the front switch between single & carafe cannot be flipped with one hand: you have to hold the machine down with the other. Sounds like a silly thing but it's something you have to think about every single time you use the machine. Why does it need a big heavy switch instead of two separate ""GO"" buttons? Don't know!The glass carafe is pushing the limits on how thin the glass can be and I feel like I have to be extremely delicate while washing it unlike any other washable glass thing in my kitchen. The large basket doesn't sit still in the cavity while the carafe is in the machine because of the spring-loaded bottom (for the stop and serve function). I would have been much better to have this spring on the machine instead of the basket, so the thing wouldn't tilt when filling it, but, again, it's about being cheap. And, yes, that spring-loaded bottom prevents you from putting it flat on a countertop for filling so you have to scoop while it's in the machine which has the risk for a spill of grounds. It will sit still if the carafe isn't in the machine, but, much like the switch, it's another thing to juggle while you haven't had your shot of caffeine in the morning yet.The pictures show the single serve side can fill a conventional mug or a travel mug, but the stand isn't really adjustable. It's two positions, based on whether it's flipped upside down or not, so expect splatters if your mug is different from the one they had in mind while designing.It comes with a few big size paper filters. Um... thanks? Not sure it makes up for the rest of the deficiencies.Ultimately I don't think it's worth the asking price at all. I think I might have been happier with buying two separate devices and a splitter for the wall outlet."
Wouldn’t fit my coffee travel cup. I assumed you could remove the bottom tray like on others but you can’t.
"I bought this product 10 months ago. Worked as promised, until a week ago.  Stopped making hot coffee at all. The ""fill"" container was nearly full of clear water. Nothing was being brewed, although the lights were on and the heating element was hot. Still under warranty, I tried calling; went to their website, and finally emailed them the story.  Service centers were only listed in Mexico. Looks like I'm on the trail again for a decent brewer."
"I am a person who grinds her own coffee, I have always used a Bun or a French Pot, so when I first used this coffee maker the coffee was Awful.  Tastes like restaurant coffee.  My husband had read all the directions, and I had to set and hear them, and Still awful.  So, I went to Costco and bought Starbucks Dark Roast and Espresso Blend Coffee, and threw in a little Pete's Dark Roast.  It is kind of stupid having to flip a switch back and fourth and push buttons and wait.  But at least I have a blend that I can now drink.  So like I said, it depends on what kind of a coffee drinker you are.  Maybe if you like a certain kind of Pot, stick with it.Cat-Mom"
"I returned this because it's more work than it's worth. Hamilton Beach is a great brand but I am not sure why they made this one. They have the one that we have and wanted that makes up to 12 cups but you just push the cup up against the button and it comes out like foundation drinks do. It's making one pot of coffee but you get to get individual cups when you want. This one has to have coffee put where the carafe is as well as the single cup. It would be better if you could just do one but were able to get both. It's just not as convenient as many of their other options. It is nice looking and it's pretty lightweight for it's size. It's just not ideal for what we wanted, especially when they have much more convenient options that look just as nice and take up less space."
"Great concept, poor quality. Bought in 2022 ad a Christmas gift for my Mom and it quit working before Thanksgiving 2023."
Liked the coffee maker but carafe cracked after just a couple of uses under normal conditions no abuse.
No k cups u can open the k cups and use other then that nice pot
"Bought this after my Breville Grind Control bit the dust after 5 1/2 years. I really wasn't keen on spending $350 for a coffee maker again, so I gave this a try due to so many good reviews.tl;dr - I HATE IT!!!1. The coffee tastes like cheap gas station coffee. I use high quality grounds, but you'd never know it with this coffee maker. In fact, I can't believe that using the same grounds in different coffee makers can taste so different. I now appreciate my Breville so much more.2. The design is most inconvenient. The water reservoir for the full pot side is in the back, so if this is under a cabinet, you have to pull the whole machine out just to fill it. If you want to use the individual cup side, you have to make sure that side is well clear of a wall or other obstruction or else you can't slide the filter basket in and out.3. Having a separate cup and pot side on the same machine is kind of stupid. I knew this going in, but the price caused me to overlook that. It's a bigger issue for me than I had expected. My Breville could brew a single up or full pot from the same place. One water reservoir, one filter...all accessible front the front. So much more convenient.4. The Hamilton Beach feels cheap. I suppose you get what you pay for, but $120 isn't exactly ""cheap."" I guess you have to pay hundreds of dollars these days to get something that feels like it's built well. My Breville was built like a tank. It made it very heavy, but I never had to move it, so no biggie.5. The individual cup side includes a permanent filter, but the full pot side doesn't. Minor in the grand scheme of things, but it's annoying to have to buy a permanent filter as a separate accessory, which costs more money.I am returning this coffee maker and will fork out the $350 to buy another Breville. It's not perfect either, but it is far superior and simply makes a much better tasting cup of coffee."
While we typically like this brand we purchased our less than 6months ago and make one pot per day. We’ve had to replace the craft portion twice due to a leak. All other coffee pots we’ve purchased have lasted at least 5yrs without issues or anything needing to be replaced. Not sure what they’ve done differently but wouldn’t recommended buying.
This product was Great... until it wasn't.  No longer working properly to brew coffee.  Is it too much to wish for products that last any more.  going with another brand in the future.
"It’s all my fault for not getting all the details before ordering or using.  There’s no water filter, no gold filter (had to order separately) and the lid on the carafe does not come off.  All iInconveniences."
"I bought this specifically for the single serve option so that I could have an occasional cup without brewing a full pot. While the machine itself looks nice and the primary carafe is fine, the single serve is incredible disappointing - very watery (even on 'bold' setting) and bitter. I've tried all variation of grounds-to-water ratio but it seems to be the brewing process - similar to a Keurig, I suppose. Returned it to go back to my old reliable and will be searching for another single-serve option elsewhere... sigh."
I bought this after looking extensively for a dual type coffee maker that would make k-cups or brew a pot of coffee and was trying to find something with the frother that could do espresso cappuccino type things also and that can be very difficult and extremely expensive I found and there is no shortage of different coffee makers on Amazon it gets to be crazy looking through all of them I finally settled on this one under the impression that it would brew k-cups and much to my disappointment when it came it does not so I do have about 96 k cups I don't know what I'm going to do is now unfortunately that sucks but otherwise it's coffee maker is the nice looking it really does look nice on the counter and it seems to be decent quality so far although it is kind of slow is what I'm finding to brew it does have a heater on the pot side of it so your coffee will stay warm and that is great because a lot of coffee makers don't do that these days it seems like overall I would recommend it yes just beware that if you're trying to get a dual purpose meaning a k-cup brewing option This is not what this one does it does pods or those little pouches and it does do single serve grounds as well which I find to be helpful for how we use it at our home Yes I would recommend it The price was unbeatable for what we got compared to others that are available This is by far the best price I could find and I'm happy with that also
"I just made the biggest mess in my kit. I did not receive the one cup filter with my order. I am having all my kids, grandkids etc. coming in today. I purchased this item so as not to waste coffee. I cut a filter and placed inside the one cup and it literally went everywhere burning my hand. With the paper filter in the cup, when I put it in to brew it was loose. It did not fit properly. It is very cheaply made for the price I paid. Very unsatisfied! I love Amozon, but not a happy customer right now. My husband and I cannot get out to return it. How can you help! Thank you"
The carafe side works perfectly. The single serve side is only moderately warm/ hot
"I ordered it because it has both the regular coffee brewer but also the single cup option with a washable mesh filter. I use the single cup more often and previously had a k-cup brewer. I liked the idea to reduce waist of those k-cups with this machine. But, this machine takes much longer to brew for the single cup and if you have a standard size mug it splashes coffee outside of the mug and all over the counter and machine. I am going to keep it and just try to locate the sweet spot in regard to the amount of coffee and water to fill my cup perfectly. I don't love it though."
"I was so excited when we bought this coffeemaker, a big step up from the Mr Coffee I had for 12 years that I scavenged from a roommate who didn't have room to schlep it back home when we graduated from school. This one is supposed to do everything Mr Coffee does PLUS make single-serve cups of coffee, great for those mornings when you can't wait for the pot to brew a larger batch or if you have a party and just one guest wants a cup of coffee after dinner. The system is pretty easy, though my mother in law's attempts to make coffee at 3am (jet lag) all led to messy failures. She's had a nespresso for years so I mostly blame that on being out of practice.Unfortunately, after just 3 months of ownership, I ran the carafe filter basket in the dishwasher and an apparently crucial bit of plastic snapped, slid out or dissolved or something (while cheap plastic lids came through just fine, so it's not like it was too hot or anything) and the spring function to stop coffee flow if you need to pour a cup before the brewing is done has completely failed. I'm using a bit of twisty-tie to try to cut back the flow a bit, but it is generally ineffective. This is a pretty common problem based on the youtube tip videos on how to fix it and apparently HB doesn't sell the filter baskets online anywhere. I've checked all my local thrift shops too and unlike my frankensteined old Mr Coffee system (with almost none of the original accessories by the end of it), none of them carry the right shape of basket to replace it- it seems like they make multiple different baskets and none are the one I want- so frustrating!On top of that, three weeks ago the single-serve side stopped heating the water as it brews the coffee, which basically renders that side pointless. I can pour filtered water through a coffee pod on my own, thanks. I have to microwave the mug after ""brewing"" to even make the coffee warm, let alone hot. I've tried descaling that side with vinegar and a few other attempts to clear the system but so far nothing has worked.I contacted the company and have not heard back yet, so it's possible I will be retiring this coffeemaker and have to buy a new machine just 6 months later. Maybe skip this one."
"As far as actually brewing the coffee this machine works. And when it comes down to it, thats all you really need in a coffee maker. However, there are a few features that are very annoying and frustrating about this model that prohibit me from giving it more than 3 stars.  I am not sure if the designer of this model actually makes their own coffee at home.  If they did, they would have probably not created the problems I now have...To begin, the machine does not indicate when the coffee has finished brewing.  There is no triple beep alerting me in the other room that it has been finished and ready for consumption. What the hell? There is also no noise indicating that it is shutting off after 2 hours of keeping the coffee hot. Again, What the hell? Why would you make a coffee maker like that?There are two different top doors for the carafe style coffee. One for the coffee itself, and the other for water. Why would you have two doors? It's cumbersome, especially first thing in the morning. Why add an extra step? I haven't even had my coffee yet!. What the hell?The carafe itself is also problematic.  The lip on it is built in such a way that you can never actually get all of the liquid out of it. I am never going to be able to properly clean it. What the hell?As far as the single serve side, why was it built to stack for a regular mug? That is super annoying. Especially first thing in the morning before I have my coffee. What the hell? The designer could have easily made some kind of pull out ""shelf"" instead of me fumbling around trying to stack these cups for me to then put my mug on, and sometimes fall off of. What the hell?I seriously do not believe the designer put much thought into this. Again, coffee making is good.  The features ruin it though. I am glad I found it on sale, I would never pay full price for this."
"I purchased this coffee maker to replace an older Amazon basic...I like the single cup option and thought I would get a better cup of coffee - not. I liked the option of doing a single cup coffee and for the most part that works well, though coffee could be hotter. Unfortunately, using the option to make multiple cups is where this Hamilton beach fails in some surprising ways... first negative, you need to provide a filter or use paper filters (you get a handful of those in the package)... I purchased a universal filter for the Hamilton Beach line, but wonder if this product included one that I wouldn't be complaining about the poor cups of coffee. If I don't make more than 7 cups of coffee - I often end up with coffee like water instead of a pot of coffee - so I rerun the coffee through to get something that looks & tastes like coffee - I always have the setting on strong  so it should brew longer but the water just seems to run right through and does not seep and brew as you expect... also the coffee is rarely very hot, since I usually drink it black you may find it less then stellar after adding a creamer or milk.  I will see if there is a better filter available but so far have managed to work around its flaws but will not recommend. The product out of the box should make a good cup of coffee and it just doesn't do it."
"I like the coffee maker, but the carafe has a bad design. The black plastic trim piece at the top holds soap after I was and rinse it. I spend 5-10 mins trying to get the soap out of this trim piece so it doesn’t end up in my coffee. I bought a universal carafe to replace it, but I would find a different coffee maker."
"I love this coffee pot. I received the very same one at least 10 years ago, probably longer.  The only issue I have is that this one didn’t come with the stainless steel cup."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Coffee maker makes good coffee, but my standards are kinda low (I like pretty much any coffee). We brew a large pot once a week and use the single cup size every day. The two-size brewing option is a great feature.However, this thing leaks constantly. It drips water out the side of the housing while brewing a single cup and we are constantly having to wipe up water and coffee underneath the unit. The carafe also is the worst - I’ve never been able to pour the first cup without leaving a large puddle on the counter."
"I may be doing something wrong but I can not get the single serve side to take enough water to brew a full travel mug of coffee.  And it comes out in spits and spurts then finally an extremely small stream. The coffee on that side is always super strong, so much so there is a residue in the bottom of the cup. Not grounds just a very thick coffee residue. Have scaled back and back the amount of grounds placed in the filter but still have never had a good cup of coffee.  If you put too much in the reservoir on that side it both leaks out and then goes over to the carafe side. Which if your not using that side often would sit and get gross.  Just very disappointed in the single serve side of this machine. Nothing but good things to say about the 12 cup carafe side. Simple to use, works as expected."
so far got the machine in great condition no glass was broken was packed good in its pkg ran water and vinegar threw it before use am going to try it tomorrow morning and then ill review right now works good for cleaning (Up date makes good coffee and fast not slow like others and sturdy I luv this pot ) it's easy working it as well I also like the one cup side so you could just make a cup on the way out to work 😊
The main coffee pot section died after 1 year of use. It does make a good cup of coffee but I won't be buying another one due to its poor reliability. My previous coffee maker was a Cuisinart that lasted roughly 7 years. The single cup side still works but it does not brew a very strong cup and takes much longer to brew. I did like having this function to make a cup of decaf every now and then without having to mess around with the pot.
"I was so excited for this coffee maker. It had been working great! I don't make coffee often so I'd say u only used it about 2 times a week. I used it for a month and then one day I went to plug it in and the display was spazaming and none of the buttons worked. Unfortunately, the return window JUST passed so now I have to go through the manufacturer and it will take 2-3 days for them to even review my request. In the meantime I cant make my coffee. I know I probably got a defective product, so hopefully the new one will last more than a month. Other than that, it worked great while it was still working."
Takes a long time about 5 mins to brew a single cup. It also splatters a lot. The actual coffee comes out as a very slow drip. Very different from other brands that I have. Not sure I will keep this product.One a positive note.  the pot of coffee works well. Which was the main reason I bought the coffee maker.  But overall I want to like both options and be able to use both sides.
"I am returning this coffee maker. After reading all the reviews about how great this coffee maker is I wasn’t disappointed with the flavor, I was disappointed with the quality. After I ran my 1st cup of coffee through it, the lid at the top, warped and won’t stay shut. Which means the mechanism that sends  the coffee into the carafe doesn’t sit right either. I decided to not continue to use it as the warping was getting worse. I’m going to try out another manufacturer instead. These days most coffee makers don’t last 3 years before they stop working or start leaking.  I just didn’t think since it started to have an issue with the 1st run , it was worth continuing to try. Temperature of the coffee is good, and the flavor was good too. Just not made well."
It took a while to figure out how to make good coffee in this machine.  For a pot of coffee it is hard to pour the water in the reservoir because it is small and is located in the back of the machine.  We kept the machine because we used it and didn’t want to clean it to return it.  Will definitely go back to a keurig machine.
"Overall, the coffeemaker is nice, but I wouldn’t buy it again. Coffee always spills over when I make a single serving so I have to clean the drops every time. I wish the single serve had a timer option but that’s on me for not reading more reviews to figure that out. I would buy a Nespresso next time before I buy another one of these."
"I had researched coffee makers to replace our leaky Ninja brand. This Hamilton Beach one seemed esthetically pleasing and providing the features of separate single cup and programming for next morning brewing. When I received the unit, it had what appeared to be a food stain on the upper housing, and a fingerprint type stain on the lower housing. I surmised that it had been used and returned. I immediately requested a replacement. Upon using the unit I discovered the following. The water reservoir is at the rear which contributes to the unit’s overall lovely esthetic from the front, isn’t terribly functional for me as I must pull the unit forward and turn to the side to adequately pour water into the reservoir. Not a deal breaker but my previous coffeemaker has a side fill and that proves to be more convenient. When I filled water into the single serve area I was somewhat hasty and water poured quickly and leaked out of the housing. Apparently the reservoir must be filled in a specific area of the opening for it to not leak out. I found that the unit drips more slowly than other makers that I have had. Again, not a deal breaker but noteworthy.I ordered the unit in white and it is quite lovely in design, and overall functions perfectly well."
"Not a bad little coffee pot but for almost $50 I expected it to last longer than a year, so needless to say we were disappointed and did not buy another one of these to replace it."
"The coffee maker was initially fine for the first 4 months, I loved the single cup option that didn’t require a prepackaged pod.  Last week it started making some funny noises before it stopped working all together.  There is an error message on the screen that, I think, indicates an electronic issue.  Either way, it doesn’t work after 5 months.  Super disappointing"
"It works well.  The coffee tastes fine.  I never opened the manual, but everything's working and the timer's set.The volume of water is fine, for me. But I'm miffed that it lies about it. I get that a lot of times a 'coffee' cup is 6 oz instead of 8 oz. But this one gives you 5 oz per cup marking. (About 60 oz/12 cups.)So if you're going by the metric of pots you've used before, this makes the same amount that most 10-cup machines would make."
"Bought my coffeemaker in June 2024. I loved it and the coffee was great. Five months later, however, it simply stopped working. I'd start it and a minute later it would turn off on its own. I even moved it to a different outlet but still didn't work.  I was bummed but had to return it. Hopefully, I can find a reliable one."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I was very disappointed after I tested the single serve. While the machine is making the single serve in a regular cup size, it is spilling the coffee out creating a mess and getting the coffee maker's wall  dirty. In order to prevent this, you might need to use a large/travel size coffee mug so that it can cover the wall of the machine that goes behind the cup. If you do not have this cup/mug ready at home (which is my case) do not even think about this option. Sadly, the feature that makes single serve was my main motivation to buy this coffee maker. In addition to this, the coffee is not hot enough as it is supposed to be."
"4/1/17--I assure you, this is no April Fool's. My beloved coffee pot only lasted 5 months. Heed the warnings from reviewers that say it leaks. Mine began leaking as well, in exactly the same spot on the single serve side (near the brew basket area) as other reviewers have mentioned. I have used this coffee pot a lot, but I maintain it well and expected that it would at least last a year! The poor thing didn't even survive half that. The only way I can use it now is if I place towels all around the base. It was fantastic while it lasted, but it appears that my situation is not unique and that this particular coffee pot is quite likely to leak, either from the get-go, or after only a few months use. I can no longer recommend it.ETA: I use the single serve side so much that I went in search of an extra brew basket, because I didn't want to be without one in case my original should get worn out. The original still works fine, but I would be in a bind if anything happened to it because I use it so many times each day, so I wanted a spare. The only replacement brew basket for this model that I could find was direct from the manufacturer and it was expensive. I found that the 49983 brew basket can be modified to fit this model and it can be purchased affordably at online auction. Though I didn't purchase the 49983 brew basket on Amazon, I did review it, so if you want to see photos of how to adapt that brew basket for this model, please check out that review.I purchased this coffee pot to replace a BUNN. My last two coffee pots were BUNNs, and each of them lasted several years before succumbing to the effects of our very hard water. I like the BUNN, but decided to try this Hamilton Beach coffee pot this time because it offers the ability to brew a single cup. I also like that this one has the ability to program it to have coffee ready when you wake up, which is a feature common to many coffee pots, but one that the BUNN coffee pots do not have. I was ready for a change, and this pot is half the price of the BUNN, so I went for it and I'm so glad I did. The Hamilton Beach coffee pot brews up a great pot of coffee, and I use the single-serve side multiple times throughout the day for both tea and coffee. I have found that I prefer my loose leaf tea brewed in the single serve basket with the ""BOLD"" option selected. Most teas (I like DAVIDsTEA products) brew up very well this way, and I like how brewing tea this way leaves a cleaner cup of tea with less loose bits and sediment that I tend to get when I use a tea ball infuser. I'm sure I'm breaking all kinds of tea-brewing rules by doing it this way, but it's what I like and it works well for me. When I brew tea from a teabag, I will often just place the tea bag in the cup and then fill the cup with hot water using the single serve side and then let it steep. The only time I don't brew from a tea bag this way is if I'm brewing a medicinal tea, for which I would want hotter water for a stronger infusion. These are just my preferences and are examples of how I use this coffee pot, but I honestly love this coffee pot and if hard water (we clean it, but still...) eventually takes the life of this pot, I wouldn't hesitate to replace it with another just like it. I don't miss my BUNN at all."
Too large for my space.
"If it had lasted it would have been great, but after 6 months (including regular cleanings and only using 1 time a day) it no longer sucks up water from the holding container, rendering it useless."
"I'm very disappointed that the travel mug is no longer included with this coffee maker. This is the third time I have purchase this item because I have been very pleased with this product. In the past, the travel mug was included. For the amount I paid for this item, the travel mug should be included."
"First off, it's a good coffee maker, both the single serve and carafe make good coffee, plenty of reviews testify to this. The carafe side doesn't have a permanent filter, but they are inexpensive here on Amazon.What gets me, and this is not listed on the description page, is that the single serve side, despite accommodating travel size mugs, is a tiny 14oz, which is a very odd size. You can push it to about 16oz, but anything beyond that and it will leak from several places. Considering the sizes of coffee at coffee shops and restaurants, to me 20-24oz would be considered a ""single serving"" for a machine which can accommodate travel size mugs. Yes, this may be 2-3 cups, but again, it's a travel size mug, and this is not a K-Cup machine which has small coffee pods, you can put a bit over two tablespoons in the filter.Also, the fill slot for the carafe brew is a small slot in the back aligned to the right of the machine which makes filling from the left a much more challenging task.Once you're aware of these negatives, then decide on this machine. If I had known the small size of the single serve, I wouldn't have bought it."
"Secretly glad our Cuisinart Brew Central bit the dust, this maker advertised the bells and whistles and then some. First, this purchase was for a brand new item. Unpacked and fingerprints were evident on the ""stainless steel"" as well as a tiny etched rust spot. This must be something that manufacturers are not quality controlling (another brand also arrived with fingerprints).The Good: (1) It looks really nice. (2) Can be used with some pods (not a crucial option, but hey, why not?  (3) Came with a gold permanent filter for the single serve basket. (4) No annoying repetitive beeps at the end of the brew cycle. (5) Easy access to water tank without the water running down the back, which the Cuisinart did.None of the ""Good"" could make up for the ""Bad"" - (1) The aforementioned handling of a new item apparent upon opening.  (2)The blue display panel and related buttons are not represented well in the pictures from the manufacturer. Let me say that these were the ugliest, brightest blue lights that literally will blind you in the morning if you like to wake up and keep the kitchen lights low. If you do not turn on kitchen lights, these lights will blind you to the point you cannot see past the maker - like your cup better be in front of the machine and not to the side.  (3) The blue lights are tacky and remind me of the old Lite-Brite toy from childhood - but much, much brighter.  (4) No permanent filter for the full carafe side - every other maker provides it for free. Only the single serve side gets the gold filter.  (5) Though easy access to the water tanks, the covers are flimsy - enough so that steam lifts the lid. You will lose a full cup to steam, so plan on adding one extra cup of water if you want an exact measure.  (6) An attached carafe lid that is not removable. Yuck - I can see gunky stuff accumulating over time.  (7) No variable hot plate setting. It's one temp, no option to adjust. (8) If you don't own a microwave, buy one. This maker brews a tepid pot immediately upon brewing. It is impossible to cause any harm from drinking or spilling it accidentally. I'm talking under 120 degrees.Number 8 was the deal breaker, though listed last on my review. The Cuisinart that died (2650 model) brewed hot (burn potential) and the heat plate also kept it that hot. I am one who cannot eat piping hot pizza or drink piping hot coffee except in small doses or it will burn my tongue. This maker brews at the bottom notch of ""hot"", it was near room temp half way through the cup.  Why let a microwave ruin the flavor of your coffee if the maker claims to make the perfect tasting hot brew?We returned the maker and chose another. Temperature is kind of important if you want a hot cup of joe. Never used the single side, though reviewers have made statements that it fails to deliver also. But for the price, one would reasonably expect hot coffee with a full carafe. I pulled out our back-up Proctor-Silex basic model maker and the temperature of that $19 model beats the heck out of Hamilton Beach's temperature delivery. Silly me for wanting a maker with programmable features! (PS: the replacement maker purchased was another Cuisinart - Perfect Temp which was not impressive either. The 3rd time's the charm - the Zojurishi Thermal maker - it advertises and delivers the temperature that it promises. Brews at 195 and in the pot at 170, which held for another 1.5 hours. 4 hours later, 160 degrees. Now that's impressive!!)"
"Seems like the coffee is half as strong as it was from the cheap Mr Coffee that I replaced.  That happens even on the 'Bold' setting with extra coffee in the filter.  Also, what's up with the lack of a metal basket?  Paper filters are like rotary telephones ... you can do better Hamilton-Beach."
"Value for money isn’t bad. Not the best coffee pot but not the worst. Big enough carafe to hold all you’ll need, fairly quick at brewing as well. Does sometimes not perform the best, doesn’t always brew the full amount. End of the day it makes coffee and that’s all that matters."
"I wanted to love this machine, but it's more like tolerance or moderate-like.  It's a drip-coffee maker so you get what you expect to get-  average tasting coffee in average time for average cost.  I have been using it for three months as a mostly-weekends machine since I decided I just don't have time to keep pressing coffee.  I had a Cuisanart machine prior that was a piece of junk so based on reviews, I was looking forward to going with a less-label-conscious decision.The good--- Brews fairly quickly- Looks nice- Simple controls and all features work- timer, timed shut-off, and brewing strength (somewhat-  works best with partial pots)- Price-  despite the frustrations and limitations, it still seems like a good value- Decent coffee-  like all drip machines (did not notice the odd, plastic taste from the carafe or single-serve that some reviewers commented on)- Pot stays hot-  coffee stays fairly hot while plate is hot and maintains typical temp for a glass pot.The not so good--- Difficult to fill the main reservior due to the small water inlet.  NOTE-  It has a nice compact design for a ""side-by-side"" so I understand that there has to be some compromise, but it's pretty darn small!  The filling problem is exacerbated by the pot.  If you don't take your time, this pot, like so many others, lets the water ""lace"" over the pouring ""notch"" and spills everywhere.  From my experience, it seems like Black and Decker is the only one who has engineered a better pouring shape; shame that their electronics don't follow suit.- Lid does not come off of pot making it exceedingly difficult to clean AND making for what I predict is premature breakage due to having to shove a hand/cleaning item into the pot with the flip lid swinging around.********UPDATE, June 29, 2016--  Still kicking!  Two years of use and everything functions like new.  Frustrations/concerns cataloged in the ""not-so-good"" persist, but I have gotten used to them.  All-in-all, I am satisfied with performance and durability and am glad I purchased."
"I've used single serve makers for years. I decided to order this since I could do single serve or a pot.  At 1st it worked OK. After about 2 weeks, the single serve side started draining water when you poured it in. Then another week or so the pot side does the same thing. On the post side about a 1/4 cup comes out, then it holds the rest until you make the post. The single serve side all water flows out before turning the machine on."
This  coffee maker is a good value for the money but is totally fails when it comes to :Cons:1. No light to notify the coffee is done.2.No light on the warming plate to let you know its on or off. Since the warming plate stays hot for 2 hours I feel this is a safety hazard for anyone that has children or even a adult.3. Difficult to pour water in reservoir.Pros:1. Good value for the money2. Makes a decent cup of coffee3.  Includes a single serve for one cup of coffee but not a k-cup
Leaks out of single serve water reservoir.
"After not being able to find a replacement part for my older Ninja, I began looking for the next perfect coffee maker, this time with the option to also do a pot, with heater. I settled on this one. I tried both features and they worked great. Since I only use the single cup everyday, I struggle with the fact that it is very difficult to pour a cup of water into the top- most goes everywhere but inside! I tried setting it up for next morning programmed, and I woke up to water all over the counter, None in the cup!So, as much as I wanted to Live this, I really miss my Ninja."
"I like the coffee machine as it is stored under an upper cabinet and doesn’t have the steam coming out of it like my last machine did which ruined the underside of the cabinet. However, it doesn’t have a storage of water.  You have to add water every single time you make coffee.  Kind of a hassle to have to stand there and wait for the water to fill the pit and then dump it into the machine every single time."
"I replaced our original coffee maker because it was taking about 30 minutes to brew a full pot of coffee. This coffee maker is not much faster... 15-20 min for a full 12 cup carafe. I use my refrigerator to fill the carafe and there seems to be a disagreement on what 12 cups is, my fridge states 10 1/4 cups to get 12 cups of water in the carafe. There is A LOT of heat that is emitted from the top of this maker. I would caution anyone using this not to keep anything easily flammable directly above this thing, like a paper towel rack. It is VERY loud when it's down to brewing the last 1 cup or so of water...I can hear it throughout our 1500 sq ft house from everywhere. I thought that we would use the single serve cup more than we actually do, but it's really more of a novelty than a feature that we actually use.. My biggest complaint is the carafe itself. I have YET to pour a cup of coffee without spilling all over the counter. The lip of the carafe is much too wide to make a controlled pour and the lid of the carafe does not make a good enough seal to contain the water while it's being poured; and consequently the water/coffee will spill out from underneath the lid while it's closed during mid-pour.  I really don't foresee us keeping this coffee maker long-term. The display on the front showing the clock is really bright, this would be subjective to preference on brightness, I don't mind it...and it matches the color of lights on my fridge, so I'm neutral on if this is a good thing or not. I like the stainless steal look. To Me, this is more of a polished turd. It looks nice and has some cool looking features, but when it comes to the basic functionality of just being a good product and doing something simple and doing it well, it fails pretty hard.*update* 10-17-2020*  After owning this coffee maker for a  while and re-reviewing my review my opinion hasn't changed much.  The Carafe is the single most annoying thing about this coffee maker. I chased up with Hamilton to get a different carafe (a replacement of the same model) they suggested that my coffee spilling during pouring might be a defect, so they sent me a replacement carafe...nope, not a defect. Just a crap design. I've tried gentle pours and quick pours of coffee....no difference... coffee spills out on to the counter almost every time just the same. It's my single biggest complaint about this coffee maker. Perhaps I'll try buying a different aftermarket carafe, but it's a real shame. I'm not a coffee enthusiast or anything. I just want to be able to brew some coffee and not have a mess to cleanup every day."
"Single cup brews WAAAYYYY too slow, coffee tastes weak even on ""bold"" setting, and temperature is more lukewarm than hot."
"I switched to mostly pour over for myself but wanted a larger portion option for company. The timer is great, easy to program. Auto shutoff after 2 hours is great if you’re absent minded. The add-water warning was helpful in making me realize I forgot to switch from individual brew to the pot option.  The individual brew is nice option but messy. If the cup isn’t right up there under the drip coffee splatters everywhere, I’ve tried a variety of cup sizes/widths, even the tall travels. Water tank for the pot is a little awkward since it has such a slim mouth. I use a reusable filter in the pot side, the paper filters (some included which was nice) kept folding over. With the reusable have had no grounds make their way into the pot.About once a week I have to set something heavy on top of the brew basket cover because one corner will randomly pop up.With all of the little things, Was debating sending back but return window closed. For a programmable pot under $100 it’s acceptable. Could have gotten for less with a used one, but this is one appliance I’ll always buy brand new."
"Warmer plate rusted out with in weeks of purchase. Pause n serve feature not very good, leaks."
"I’ve been looking for a way to reduce appliances that sit out on my counter in my small kitchen and this almost fit the bill! The single serve side brews a tasty cup of coffee. I like that it doesn’t use pods so I can choose my favorite coffee flavors. I haven’t tried the 12 cup side yet but the buttons are all straightforward and easy to manage and program.The reason I gave it 3 stars and am returning it (hopefully exchanging!) is because the single cup brew takes 5+ minutes! I timed it. The first one took over 9 minutes!! That’s untenable for a coffee maker. I’m hoping I just got a defective machine and the company will replace it. If so, I’ll update my review but in the meantime I can’t keep it because I don’t have that kind of time to wait for coffee maker to get going. A single serve cup, unless French press or pour over, just shouldn’t take more than a minute. Maybe 2."
Not the best coffee maker
I ordered this lot after seeing the built in option for one cup brewing. At first I loved the pot! But for about 2 weeks on the carafe side when I make my coffee it comes out watery.  I’m very consistent with my cups of water and coffee grinds ratio lol. One day I looked at the breed grinds and 1/3 of them were not even wet! So while the coffee of brewing it’s only wetting the front grinds this leaving the end result watery.  I have gone through an excessive amount of my coffee (which isn’t cheap these days!) trying to get the coffee to come out correctly!  It’s really frustrating and honestly I’d love to return the pot. It’s more of a thorn in my side than it is good! Especially when it’s the first cup of coffee we all wait to hit our lips when we get up in the morning.. total bummer
"This only lasted a little over a year, the manufacturers warranty is only 1 year. With regular vinegar rinse cleanings, this machine stopped working properly after 1 year and 3 months. We noticed a very long brew time like 20-30 mins, half the water would evaporate leaving us with nasty extremely strong coffee like a concentrate. It was not a filter issue as we first thought, but it seemed that the water hose in the water reservoir was very slow at sucking the water out. But there is no way to take the hose out and clean it. Ran straight vinegar through it several times and was still extremely slow. The coffee maker was great for the first year, but disappointed that it did not last longer. I’ve had $20 coffee makers that lasted longer."
I really wanted to love this coffee maker and hoped it would last longer than it did. I did a lot of research and got this one because it was pretty well rated. But it only worked for 8 months then started running very slowly. I've had coffee makers last 3-4 years before breaking... sooo if that tells you anything. I thoroughly cleaned it several times to see if that would resolve the issues and it didn't. Don't buy this if you want something to last you longer. I contacted Hamilton Beach for customer support and haven't heard anything yet.
"While we like the dual function of this coffee maker, we have been noticing an off-taste and have even had stomach upset after our coffee. We have switched beans and tried multiple things. Today I looked inside the water tank and found this - mold and grime. Mind you, the photos are after I ran vinegar and a rinse through. There is no good way to get in there and clean it. It’s absolutely disgusting. I’m throwing this away and absolutely will not buy another electric coffee maker that has areas you can’t clean. I am tired of buying new coffee makers every year because they get so disgusting. I’m going to try the pour over so that I’m not poisoning myself and guests with mold and whatever other grime is in here."
"Its a good coffee maker. However the single side if you out in more then 2tbsp fine ground coffee you get grounds ALL IN YOUR CUP. Even regular brewing on single side is SO SLOW, and thats not eveb on bold setting!!!Doesn't brew very hot and once you add chilled coffee creamer your getting luke warm coffee"
After only 2 month and about 12 single cups of coffee it started to spit out the coffee instead of making the fine stream it used to in the beginning. Very disappointing.
"Easy to use, great features with the program option, nice display, and the dual brewer. I can fit my 30oz Yeti clone on the single side, although even with 8oz of milk added to the 14oz of coffee that only fills my cup 2/3 of the way up. Exceeding the 2 scoop recommendation on single serve can, but not always result in grounds spilling into the cup, but it does help get a stronger cup brewed. It's pointless to try an exceed the 14oz water limit unless you like weak coffee. The single serve basket is as easy to clean as any other reusable basket, but I so wish extras were available for sale (-1 star). I like to let the grounds dry out in the basket before I put them in a container for sprinkling around my acid loving flowers (wet grounds get moldy fast), so I can really only do that with multiple baskets or limiting myself to one use per day. I drink a lot more coffee, so my alternative has been using the full size carafe, but I lose the fresh taste advantage after the first cup full. The chief design flaw in this is the full size carafe. It has a lip around the top edge to keep the handle attached which interferes with the pouring spout (-1 star). This lip makes it impossible to get all the water out or all the brewed coffee out which is annoying. Through comparison use with my old drip coffee maker I've also found I prefer cone coffee filters to the basket style (easier to pick up and remove paper filters for drying and easier to clean reusable filters (no ribs to get in the way of scraping off grounds with a spoon), but this otherwise does the job and I really liked the single serve feature so I kept it."
The one cup mesh reusable filter and holder is missing from this pot. I can’t use this feature without it. How can I get the missing parts. Coffee isn’t the best I’ve ever had but will try a different brand of coffee.
"this coffee maker is 10 miles or more behind Keurig. Difficult to measure water every time, and the concept of single serve from coffee grounds is good but still a hassle to measure the exact amount of water and grounds for each cup !"
This is a nice product. I apparently  did not read thoroughly to know this does not use pods like my previous  Hamilton  Duel Coffee Maker.  I had to return.
Returned due to it doesn't support pods or keurig cups
"It's a good working coffee pot  and looks really clean and sleek and modern, however with the single cup side you need to have a thermos or large mug under it otherwise it splashes everywhere and makes a mess."
"My partner and I were confused as to how, when we made 6 cups, it filled up our 2 16oz to go mugs with no coffee to spare. So we tested it out and filled up the coffee pot up to the 6 cup line, then poured it into a measuring cup and it was actually 4 cups. Just seems like an incredibly weird thing to misrepresent. We were using too much coffee grounds for the amount of coffee we were making which felt really wasteful.Other than that, this coffee maker works fine, hence the 3 stars. Get a reusable filter."
My husband and I bought this coffee maker for the convenience of having a dual sided unit. One for just a single cup and one for an entire pot. However on the single cup side it takes absolutely forever to brew one cup of coffee. It truly reminds me of my grandmothers percolator coffee maker where it would just do a drop of coffee every 5 mins. When you’re rushing out the door the convenience of having a single cup of coffee in a travel cup is ideal however if you have to wait forever then Starbucks is sometimes a better option. On Saturdays we brew an entire pot of coffee however after the first cup of coffee the rest of it tastes scalded and we have to throw it away. I’m truly disappointed with this machine and really only rated it a 3 because of the 2 options. But I think we’re going to throw it away and buy something different.
The coffee maker works great but the single cup brewer always leaves grounds in my coffee and this was the main reason I bought this one
"Yes, when I first got this for Christmas I loved it, but the day after the return date it stopped working as well. My coffee is cold as it comes out. I was trying to save money by using this and not my keurig, but as of now, I'm back to my old Kerrigan. Disappointing because I loved the look too. Who wants cold coffee in the morning? Not me."
Decent for the price. Definitely prefer k cups but for a cheap alternative this will work.
I have had this for 6 months and would have sent it back if I had used it much in the beginning. I got tired of drinking coffee grounds every morning and was ready to trash it but I decided to try a reusable mesh filter for the regular pot first. Since then I have had no problems.I think the manufacturer should include a reusable filter. It does not work with regular paper filters.
"I would've given the coffee pot 5 stars but  started leaking in a couple wks. The big pot was great and even the single cup, but the I made a single cup and  the water started drizzling down from water storage. No I didn't overfill, I have no idea. What's bad I was going to return but the box and everything went to trash."
"I thought I would love having the single-serve AND carafe option, turns out I'd rather have kept my last coffee maker. I might be doing something wrong, but... it is messy to use the single-serve side. No matter what I can't seem to use it without getting grounds everywhere. I wish I were able to return it, but I waited too long."
This is a messy and cheap coffee maker. Doesn’t hold a lot of grounds and if you fill it the grounds leak through. It’s plastic and just seems super cheap :(
"This coffee maker is loud. I have been purchasing this brand for years now.  This model,  I’m not to happy about."
"After using a machine for pods for a few years, I’m having difficulty using this one.  Can’t get the amount right for the one-cup portion and it takes forever to make.  Not to mention the coffee is lumpy in the cup.  So far have been disappointed; I would send it back but I threw away the box."
I was optimistic but in the end this was a over glorified pot maker not suitable for k cups unless you make your own and not even reasonable steps to convert or switch from pot of coffee to kcups. It required a lot of work I ended up buying the ninja with frother and easy set up for 60 dollars more. I strongly suggest the ninja or keurig over this particular model any day of the week. If you are on a budget it's OK but you will be struggling for a while to get anything done. If you just need a pot maker go with the cheaper Hamilton it does fine
"I bought this coffee maker because we wanted to be able to make both a pot and a single cup easily. It works as expected and the look is ok, but the coffee is not good. I suspect the water temperature does not get hot enough. It always tastes weak even when using extra grounds. One other note: the single cup area is really made for a to-go cup. It has some interior parts that are designed to stack to make the seat tall enough for a mug. It's a clever design but doesn't look as nice to keep it out like that all the time."
"I owned this unit for 2 years and loved it for the rich, robust brews I got with the “bold” setting. But then it stopped working out of nowhere. Tried descaling it to no avail. Can’t bring myself to buy another. Wish products were made to last like they used to be."
It's a good coffee pot but the lid broke less than a year after purchase. The customer service folks required twenty questions to get a replacement and so I gave up. I'm sure the pot is made in China but replacement parts for customers should be easier.
"We have had this coffee pot for less than a year. It's a great looking machine and I don't mind it being on my counter. In theory, it's also great for those times when you need a single cup vs. a pot. We found right away that the cup side was not for us. Perhaps it is the coffee we use (Costco brand) or the fact that it's a mesh filter, our coffee had a very dark later at the bottom of our cup and it really did taste dirty. Maybe there are paper filters for single cup, but we stopped using it altogether.The pot portion was just fine, as well, however, we had to clean this with vinegar more frequently than any pot I've ever had simply to get it to make a full pot within the two hours that the warmer stayed on. In fact, currently, we program it to start brewing at 4:30am so that when I get up at 5:30 am, I can have a cup of coffee. (It's at between 4-6 cups at that point.) NOBODY has time for that. It is also leaving two cups in the holding tank which won't come out.It's terrible and our new Bunn is coming tomorrow.  Goodbye Hamilton Beach pot, we will not miss you."
Worked great till it stopped working 4 months later.. Turns on but won't push water through to brew coffee.. Didn't pay this much for it to only work a few months.. My last coffee maker was far less money and worked almost 3 years.. This Didn't even last 6 months..
"As a coffee aficionado and a loyal Hamilton Beach enthusiast, I was ready to let the 49933 dazzle my caffeine-loving heart. Alas, my hopes were dashed when it decided to moonlight as a coffee waterfall rather than a maker, leaking on three separate occasions. Mr. Hamilton, we had a good run, but this time, the 49933 needed a timeout. On the bright side, the color white was as crisp and clean as my failed attempts at a leak-free morning brew"
"I just ordered this coffee maker in October of last year. Early this morning, I ordered a Ninja Coffee Bar to replace this coffee maker. Prior to owning this model, I owned one of the older model Keurigs, which I got rid of, because after three years of daily use it would occasionally have an issue spraying water or coffee out, which was a nuisance, but still fixable.I decided to go with a different brand because I kind of missed having the option to brew a pot and not wanting to waste a lot of money and further damage the environment by buying k-cups, I wanted to go with a podless system as those refillable k-cups are a real mess and pain. After doing some research, I thought this would be a more affordable alternative. Even though I like piping hot coffee, for some reason, I did not pay too much attention to the negative reviews that stated that the coffee is not hot enough. Big mistake on my part. Technically, my coffee maker still works, but the coffee is basically lukewarm, especially considering that I like to put Coffee Mate from the fridge in mine. Also, 9 times out of 10 I use the single serve side, which often makes a big mess, spraying coffee everything and dripping coffee onto the plate after I move my cup and the brewer shuts off. The few times I have made a pot of coffee, it seems like that coffee is even less warm. I temped my coffee right after brewing recently, and it was only 173 degrees Fahrenheit. If you have done your research, like I have, then you would know that the SCAA recommends that coffee reach anywhere from 195 to 205 degrees Fahrenheit. I'm not the type of coffee drinker who normally notices the way the coffee tastes when brewed in one coffee maker as opposed to another. However, with this machine, the coffee does seem to taste more bitter. Also, it seems like that self-serve side on this machine takes much longer than the Keurig. I would not recommend this coffee maker to anyone. However, I gave it two stars because it still technically works, I just don't think it's a very good coffee maker."
"So I ended up returning this machine. The thing I hated the most is that it drips for so long after it's ""done"". Also there's a pause brew button, but that literally causes the water reservoir to basically empty out creating a super weak cup, or a big mess lol. I also didn't like the fact that there was no way to change out the water in the reservoir. I feel like that will cause mold in the future if I kept it. The coffee didn't taste good either. The coffee comes out hot, but not hot enough. I feel like the carafe side was even worse for the temperature. I ended up finding a much better coffee maker all around for less! Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. Not worth it."
"I was super excited about this coffee maker when I read the reviews.I have tried it now for weeks and if I could, I would return it.The single-cup side is very slow and the coffee does not taste as usual.The pot side is very slow as well and the coffee is way hotter to the point that you have to wait until you drink it, because you burn your mouth. When the heating plate is still on, the coffee maker makes a clicking sound every few seconds. I don't know if this is just a defect or is supposed to be ""normal"". My old coffee maker never did that, even though it also had a heating plate.I am very disappointed and will need to look for a different coffee maker. I just wish I could return this and get my money back. This was wasted money for me!"
"I gave it three stars because it does make a decent cup of coffee only when using k-cups. For the price, I expected better. I like the design of the buttons and that there are several cup sizes to choose from. What I don't like, I use reusable coffee filters so I can use my own ground coffee. Every time, coffee leaks from the top and drips out of the front and sides and makes a slight mess. I've used three different kinds of reusable filters, and they all do the same. I've owned several Keurig machines over the years, and this one is the first that doesn't work with the reusable filters. The machine is cheaply made, and the water reservoir moves and doesn't sit well. And you have to look at the side to see the water level because the plastic on the front of it isn't clear, only the side. For me, I'm going to store this to replace my older travel coffee maker and just use k-cups with it. I'll be trying a different brand next for using the reusable filters."
"I’ve had Keurig coffee makers for years and will probably continue.  However, this newest one although quite hand some has a reservoir on the left side, as you face it, that runs from front to back.  This narrow, rather flimsy container is so awkward to carry to the coffee maker without spilling along the way, I have resorted to using a half gallon container to carry water from the faucet to the coffee maker.  Formerly, the reservoirs were sturdy enough to fill at the faucet.  Otherwise, it’s fine and better looking that the last one, which only lasted about 3 years."
"On the surface, this brewer is pretty much like every other brewer out there. You put a K-Cup in, it brews the coffee, you get your cup of societally-acceptable morning productivity chemicals. However, having been using Keurig brewers for a while, I have to advise that the quality of these brewers is not what it used to be. Less than 1 year after buying this one, it lost the ability to sense when the water reservoir was low or empty. After that became a daily annoyance, I decided to call Keurig to see if they would do a warranty replacement. Obviously, the call went to an overseas call center where you're put on hold a lot of times; but in the end it took over 2 months to get the replacement. It took this much time because they put a lot of requirements in front of you. To start, I had to provide them with a photo of the brewer's serial number, then a photo of the brewer with a handwritten note next to it with my name and the service request number, and a copy of my invoice from Amazon. Having sent that, and followed up with a phone call to make sure they received my documentation/images, I thought my brewer would be at my doorstep. But, no, it was not, so I waited a bit to make sure I wasn't just being impatient. After 3 weeks, I started to worry so I decided to search through my emails to see if I missed an email (very possible with how many emails we all get these days). Searching through my emails, I found that they added an additional request for the Amazon delivery confirmation with the photo showing the brewer had been delivered to my doorstep. I went into my old emails and found the delivery confirmation, but the photo was missing (Amazon probably deletes these from their servers after a few months to save space, which is understandable but makes this request from Keurig impossible to complete). This meant another phone call to Keurig just to confirm that the only delivery confirmation I could provide was good enough. They said they're shipping the warranty replacement brewer out today, so let's see if that works. I would give this brewer 4 stars, but the lengths I had to go through for a warranty replacement on a brewer that started to not function correctly after less than a year makes 3 the best rating that I can give. As always, buyer beware. Perhaps if I had set my expectations lower I wouldn't have cared as much as I initially did; but the bureaucratic headache of warranty replacement Keurig created was a surprise to me since it was not this difficult to get a warranty replacement when my previous Keurig brewer stopped working (thank goodness they gave up on that K-cup QR code scan requirement). Maybe Keurig was just embarrassed and wanted the problem to go away as quickly as possible. Who knows? In any case, that's all folks.Update:Keurig messed up my return. Even though I gave them my shipping address no less than 3 times, they still managed ignore that information and sent it to my old address instead. Yes, my new address was on my sales receipt. They said they could fix this error, but it would take additional time. Again, the warranty process has been nothing but a long, drawn-out headache."
"Not happy about the water well light being removed, I assume to save money. I’ve had my new Keurig for close to a year and I’m tired of my coffee not being full because it ran out of water because the low water light is not working properly. It’s happening 50% of the time now. I now have to put a light on the well to check the water level. Yes, I’ve cleaned out both valve areas. Removing the water well light improvement failed in my opinion."
"I purchased this Keurig as ""Used Like New"" for a discounted price to replace the same model I had (the display on ours went bad).  There are a couple of things I noticed right away.  First, the handle isn't nearly as nice as my old one.  This one is plastic while my old one is metal.  Also, the buttons aren't easy to press.  They seem like they are already halfway down and so I'm wondering how long they will even work.  Another thing is that the cup brew sizes are much larger than my old one and it continues to drip for a while after you make a cup of coffee. Also, my old one had a light that would shine up through the water tank when it was on.  This one doesn't have that.  It seems flimsy to me compared to the old one.  It's too late for me to return it and now I'd have to contact Keurig which is honestly going to be such a painful process.  Lesson learned that ""Used like New"" isn't really ""like new,"" despite it being packaged up perfect as if it was never used.  And I'll be honest, I don't really think it had been used; it didn't come filled with water or anything.  It appeared to be brand new.  So while it may be ""like new"" it certainly isn't functioning that way.  Seems to be ""new with defects.""  And perhaps ""New"" is also more cheaply made than mine from a few years ago.  Buyer beware."
"This coffee maker has some great features, but I find it priced highly compared to competitors. About ten months into using the machine, it began leaking large amounts of water from the base. Prior to this, it would sometimes fail to start brewing and I’d have to turn it off then back on and try again. Keurig did honor my warranty claim and replaced the machine and I hope to not experience the same problems."
"My other Keurig finally died after several years. With prime day I was able to get this one. However the same day delivery not only left it at the wrong apartment and building but the box wasn't even close to a door instead it was at the top of the steps and the photo does not show the apt number. I think intentionally the driver knowing it was wrong.Fortunately I work at the apartments and the sign looked familiar, I asked a couple other staff members and the leasing agent recognized it.I didn't want to go just grab the box which might confuse the resident who has a doorbell camera so we called both people on that landing, spoke to one voice mail to the other.I'm in O building the package was at D.Not only the wrong address but the placement of the package and the photo only showing the bottom of the door (all the doors are the same) was a complete failur in delivery.If I didn't work here and was any other resident I doubt the package would have been found.Our regular drivers (we have 3) all do great and know how to follow their phone map but these other drivers that are sub contracted have made many mistakes, I cought one driving on the grass once .I would expect Amazon to look at the delivery photos and have an acceptable system in place on these photos showing the door number as well as the placement of packages.Big fail on delivery.I give 3 stars because the maker is nice, well packaged, nice features and easy to use. So as far as the machine it's great, as to Amazon your delivery is week"
I had to replace my old kuerig unfortunately and I picked this one for the similar resemblance yet upgraded cup choices. I used my original k cups but coffee grounds were coming through in my coffee so I purchased new ones and I still have coffee grounds in my coffee. I don’t understand how this is happening but it’s negatively effected my morning routine.
"I fear German manufacturers are learning the American trick:  create a really great product then once you've got people hooked, significantly increase the price and lower the quality to maximize profits.  The maker is fine.  It makes as good of coffee as you put into it and it's still fast and convenient.  It just doesn't have the solid feel of the original and the control buttons feel flimsy and awkward to deal with.  I've only made one cup so this is a limited review, but I will be really surprised if this one lasts four years like my last one did."
"I bought this unit to replace my previous keurig which had lasted 10 YEARS!!! That's incredible that it made it that long so I really wanted to replace with the same brand and also upgrade some features.Specifically, I really wanted the ability to make Ice coffee and this is what sold me on getting this model. Unfortunately, it's the one feature the unit doesn't have and I don't feel like they should be able to claim it. I watched many reviews of influencers using the ICE feature, all of which filled cups up to the brim with ice and dispense the coffee. A lot mentioned there was a little melt but that was ok. I was skeptical but still chose to purchase this version. Upon multiple tries, and multiple cups filled up with ice, all of them were melted about 75%. SO, it's no different that making a cup of coffee and pouring an additional cup of water into it. I was disappointed to say the least.As for additional features, it is able to be programmed, which I LOVE! Instead of waking up, turning on the Keurig and waiting 2 minutes in the morning for it to heat up, it's already on ready to make my cup. This earns the unit 1 star in and of it self.There are a good number of choices for your coffee size and that's great too.I wish i could give this unit more than 2 stars, but to advertise it an iced coffee maker is a little dishonest."
"I don't think that whoever designed how this thing works ever actually used it. The design decisions make no sense for usability.To start, the water container is a strange shape. They made it that way for aesthetic reasons. However, when you go to fill it up, you'll be forced to hold it the whole time because it's long and skinny and will tend to try to fall over.Next, there's no handle on that container. You're forced to try to grip it like a long heavy awkward book that wants to flip open.Then, to put the water container back on the brewer -  you have to try to insert the bottom of the water container into a slot, while simultaneously lining up a slot in the middle of the top of the container - all without a handle. That means you have no real choice but to try to balance it on the base, slip your fingers out from behind it, shove it forward, and hope it catches before you end up spilling water everywhere. Good luck.Now, you want to brew some coffee. Don't bother with the ""universal reusable pods"" from Keurig. They leak everywhere in this machine. You're going to need an aftermarket reusable pod or use the throwaway kind. Put it in there, and close the lid. Then realize that you didn't first turn it on, so push the power button. Only now, the buttons don't seem to do anything, because you didn't have it on when you inserted the pod, so you have to first turn it on, then open the coffee door and close it again. Now you can brew coffee.There's a ""strong"" button, but it won't stay on between brews. If you forgot to hit it before you hit the size button, you can't press it now either.Finally, the coffee.It's OK. It's not great. I used to have a Breville YouBrew, and that made a far superior cup of coffee. I also previously had a K-Supreme that also made better coffee.Overall, for the price, I guess it's fine for the price, but when this one blows up I'll be looking for something else."
"I purchased this Keurig K-Elite to replace an old K60/65 Special Edition model which served us well for many years. I was looking for as close a replacement as possible and landed on the K-Elite. Most important for us was to have a brewer that would turn on and off automatically, and while the K-Elite does that, you can only set the ""on time"" via the built-in clock. You cannot set a specific ""time off"" as we could with the K60. The Elite shuts off two hours after the final brewing. So, if my wife brews a cup of coffee at 5:30 am when she gets up for work, if I sleep past 7:30 am, the Keurig will have gone off and I must wait for it to warm up again. With the K60 our Keurig was ready to go from 5:30 am until 10:00 pm, our programed on/off times. Another thing that I cannot understand is why Keurig did away with the ""ready to brew"" readout on the LCD screen once the water reached temperature. Now, with the K-Elite you get no such prompt. You must listen to hear the water stop gurgling to know that it has reached brewing temperature. Sometimes it's difficult to tell, especially when you have hearing problems like my wife, and I do. Is it ready? Is it not? This is very inconvenient and a real step backwards in my opinion. Why Keurig omitted this feature on the K-Elite is a real mystery and a big mistake in my opinion. The other omission is the lack of a water window on the front of the water reservoir to determine the level. Is it full? Is it running low? Can't tell. Only by awkwardly craning your neck around to the side of the machine can you make that determination. This is ridiculous. If the reservoir could not be made totally transparent (as with the K60), at least provide a window in front to easily determine the water level. There is a low-water indicator, but most time you don't want to wait until that point to refill. Usually updated models offer improvements. Not this time, I'm afraid. This is a definite step backwards."
"Ever since I first plugged this in, I’ve never gotten an actual cup of coffee out of this. When I turn it on, the heating element heats up then trips my breaker. Not ideal, but not the worst thing. It’s definitely an inconvenience to have to run outside, unlocked my panel and flip a breaker just for a cup of coffee. But I can deal with that. But when I come back in, I’d turn it on again and try to brew a cup of coffee, only for the coffee maker to shut off. Once again, minor inconvenience to have to turn the coffee maker back on. But when I turn it on, and open and close the lid so the machine knows it’s ready, it would try to brew but only a few drops of coffee would come out, then it would shut down again. So I’d open the lid, re situate the k-cup, and try again. And once again, just a couple of drops of coffee. Then I’d try to run a small cup of hot water and that’s work great. So I’d replace the k-cup with a new one and try again. But no luck. The machine would try to push water through the k-cup, then it would shut down. After each attempt, I would check the needle to make sure it was clean. And still nothing.I’ve had this coffee maker for 5 weeks, after my last keurig took a dump after 10 years. It looks really nice, but it works like garbage. I was thinking of returning it, but the daily frustration of flipping breakers, wasting k-cups, delaying taking my kids to school because I’m pretty sure it’ll work the next time, led me to not worry about the $120 and I went full office space on this pos coffee maker. It’s in several pieces at the bottom of my trash can where it belongs. I won’t buy this garbage coffee maker if it’s the last coffee maker on earth. Save yourself the hassle, frustration, and headache. Buy something else."
Love it
"I've purchase many refurbished items with very good success. These items are usually checked better than the brand new ones. But someone forgot to connect the main water line so the water poured out as fast as it went in...Took a while to get it apart, but I fixed it."
It turns on at different times after I have turned it off. I have been unplugging it everytime I turn it off to make sure it doesn’t turn back on. I am going to look at it to see if it can be reset. There could be settings in it.
"This coffee maker brews pretty good coffee, but it leaks water during the warmup process. If a mug isnt in place during the warmup, the drip tray constantly needs to be emptied and cleaned, otherwise it gets moldy. I do like how many size options there are."
"After just one year, the arm mechanism that you lift to put in a coffee pod just suddenly jammed open half way. Won’t fully open nor will it close. Zero response from Keurig Customer Service. Time to try another brand."
Everything is programmed as directed but shut off doesn't work.  We have tried everything and it doesn't work.  Big disappointment as we have had Keurigs for years and never experienced this problem.
Tank may hold 75oz but the add water light comes on when tank is only 2/3s empty.  75 oz tank but only 55 or 60oz is usable.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I see good reviews on this keurig but am wondering if this loud rumble is normal when brewing. I figure turned it on and it made this noise then went silent so I restarted and the hum stopped then it made the same noise while brewing… not sure if this is defective but it’s very loud.
I have used Keurig coffee makers for years. Even with the strong setting it does not make coffee as strong.
"Usual good Keurig quality but this coffee maker did not work for me.  The machine is well made, looks great and has all the features I wanted, but just did not perform as I expectedCoffee  is brewed too weak for my tastes, even with turning on the ""Strong"" setting... did not appear to make any difference, ""Regular"" or ""Strong"" setting tasted the same...too weak!  and 12 oz cups were much weaker than the 10 oz cups.The 10 oz cup setting randomly only made 8 oz cup instead of 10 oz as selected...and even that was too weak?With this new Elite model, Keurig again redesigned the cup holder and now requires you to completely  remove the the standard K-cup holder to use their new 4 piece refillable ""My K-cup"".  There concept appears to be to make the new ""My K-cup"" reconfigurable to fit all Keurig machine models. The problem is if you want to use a prepackaged, prefilled pods, you must reinsert the original K-cup holder back into the mackine....grrrr  If you have people in your house that have a preference for their own brand of coffee used in a refillable K-cup and others who prefer prefilled pods you will need to keep swapping the K-Cup holder  in and out of the machine.My 8+ year old K550 makes perfect coffee, and takes prefilled pods or refillable K-cups interchangeably without having to disassemble the machine to use a different K-cup or pod.  I purchased this new Keurig Elite to replace my old K550, primarily because it was getting old and the new Elite model has all the features of my K550 but in a little smaller package.  Oh well. in the end I returned it to Amazon."
"I purchased this Keurig to replace my existing Keurig, which finally died after five years. While the old coffee pot and my new coffee pot look identical the new coffee pot is mostly plastic lacking in multiple features Such as the light in the water reservoir, And does not sit level on the countertop.  My guess is that this one will last maybe a year very disappointed and will stop buying Keurig after this one.The new Keurig are cheaply made and of poor quality."
"Has features like 3 sizes of cup and 2 tea cup sizes as well. It says it makes cold brew, but is hot  I Liked the setting for STRONG brew, but it doesn't seem to work in this machine. It’s the same weak tepid coffee as my other keurig machine produced.  Like the various cup size settings, but they should indicate the oz volume of each.Basically, it’s no better than the one I put aside to get this one with expanded features. My advice, If your keurig works, no reason to buy this. If yours is broken, this one makes pretty much the same coffee as any other Keurig as far as i can tell. Ive had 4 and i dont see the difference in the quality of the brew from one to the next. I would never buy a keurig. These were gifts over the years from people who don’t appreciate a good cup of rested or French drip coffee. . If you like keurig, this machine will do. If you like GOOD coffee, give this a miss."
Starting to have problems with power switch
"I wish Keurig could show some consistency with their products. This is the 3rd unit that I have owned and all are so different with their design and functionality. This last one has the clock on the top of the unit so small and far back that you have to be over the top of the pot to read it. The front of the water tank is hidden behind a gray piece of plastic, so you have to go around to the side to see how much water is left.  I know that probably sounds like an entitled American, but after 2 other units that didn't have this feature, I will probably examine other brands once this unit fizzles out. You can do better, Keurig.Edit: After trying so many different types of coffee, I am returning this, and if there was a No Star feature that is what I would give this coffee maker."
"First I will start with the reservoir, it is awkward and cumbersome. It's easier to just leave it on the side of the unit and fill it with a cup. Second, and most important, the brew size is off on all the selections. 12oz gives 10oz, 10oz gives 8oz, 8oz gives 6.5oz, 6oz gives 4.5oz and 4oz gives 2oz. If you want a 12oz cup of strong dark coffee, you have to brew one12oz selection size and when finished, open and close the k-cup holder so you can then select the 4oz size. This process also makes the unit heat up more water before it dispenses the last 2oz. Also, while the unit is on, before and after each dispense, it heats up another reservoir of water using 1500 watts of power. Granted, the 1500 watts is less than one minute each time. That said, you should be aware that is 12.5 amps each time it heats up. If you have this on a 15 amp circuit, you'll want it to be the only thing on that circuit. Don't have it on the same circuit as your microwave or window AC unit. But they're all 1500 watts so it doesn't matter the model you choose.Still deciding if I want to return this unit and maybe try the Cuisinart version. Or, maybe try the K-Supreme Plus version.In the end, not happy. Not worth the price of admission."
"This is a good looking machine and fits better under my cabinet.  But.  It’s not built nearly as well as my last Keurig.  My old one was heavy (which I thought was a problem but now I know better), had a display (which I miss) and lasted more than 10 years and multiple moves including cross country.  This one has flimsy build, and leaks at times when the pod holder is open and it is warming up, so I don’t set my cup down until it’s done warming up.  I’m not talking a few drops either.  It pours a small stream of water.  Ick.  Other than that, I love how it looks, I love the strong button and I like the ice coffee button.  I’m afraid it won’t last half as long as my last machine.  May make a change away from keurig.  🙁"
"We had a Keurig K-155 commercial model for our home use for almost 5 years, then it went bad.  I could not easily find another one, so after a lot of due diligence I settled on K-Elite.When it arrived, the first thing I noticed was that, compared to my K-155, this model was lightweight and didn't seem to be made for much use.  I don't like using this phrase, but it seemed ""cheap.""  Again, we were so used to our heavy-duty work horse, our K-155, that this seemed like a let down;  a disappointment.Nevertheless, I kept positive thoughts and put it into action.  It was really noisy, but no big deal for me.  Others here may not like the noise.  The flavor was not so bad, and it was nice that it had a 5 size selection.  (The old K-155 only had 4) But after a week of using it, I found the bottom overflow drain filled with water.  My keen intellect told me something is not right here.  So, I ran 12 oz of hot water through it into a cup, then removed the cup, and noticed that it kept dripping.  And dripping.  And dripping.  In fact, it dripped about 4 ounces of water into the overflow tray.  I cleaned it all up, tried it again with the same result.Thats all I needed to see. I was preparing to return it when I came across the K-155 model.  I bought it as fast as I could and its coming today!  So, be aware that if you are an avid coffee drinker as my wife and I are, and if you don't like moving the coffee maker around because its so lightweight it slides all the time, then this model may not be for you.I realize this is a review for the K-Elite.  I also realize anyone can get a faulty product from time to time.  But, for an extra $100 or so you can move up to the K-155 model.  If you do a lot of coffee drinking The K-155, with its larger reservoir and other heavy duty features,  may  serve you better."
"I have had one of these machines for probably seven years now and love them.Now I buy a lot from Amazon warehouse on the save with used, like new and have gotten some really awesome deals and have never had a problem through Amazon warehouse until now. I bought this as a LIKE NEW, still in original box, however when I got it it was not in the original box it was just stuffed in a box with some bubble stuff around it in a plastic bag soaking wet inside….yes I had to sterilize it and it did not have the long thing that goes in the water reserve with the charcoal filtered on the bottom so I had to take the one out of the one I was throwing out to use in this one and when it’s done brewing, from day 1 it still continues to leak hot water or coffee until it’s done heating up for the next cup or when you lift the lid but if you put the lid back down it will continue to leak. And not just that but usually when you take your K cup out to throw it out it’s pretty much dry….not these, you take it out you have to have a cup or something under it because it is still full of liquid. I don’t have the money to buy a new one or even try to find another used like new so I’m having to deal with it… I guess I got what I paid for.and I did buy another exactly the same like new for our camper because my husband works on the road and that’s his house when he’s gone and it did come in the original box but when he got it, the water reservoir was broken so he had to use the old one and right off the bat he had to unplug the needle because it was plugged???? AND it just now quit working. Again I guess I got what I paid for. Disgusted with Amazon because it came from Amazon warehouse during PRIME DAYS so we didn’t get like new we got used maybe OK ones and the first one I was talking about that leaks had a seal of approval works perfect nope never has from day one so I don’t know who’s doing the testing but they need to go. just disgusted right now."
I like it but the buttons are hard to push.
"I have been using Keurig coffee makers for a long time. One of the issues with my previous maker was the ability to select a variety of different onces to brew. This maker by far exceeds in that feature with the 6 different quantities. I love that feature!But this feature seems to have come at a cost. It no longer recognizes if it HAS ENOUGH WATER to perform the needed brew. I store the maker on a counter in a corner. The location prevents me from seeing the left side only window for water level and more than on a handful of occassions I have selected a 12oz brew to have the maker run out of water mid-brew. My previous brewer would not allow me to brew unless I had enough water for the whole brew. I wish I could see the water level from the front, and I wish the brewer was not dumbed down in this iteration to allow brewing when there is not enough water present."
"When my old Keurig started leaking I decided it was worth buying this version to try to get as many features as I could.What I got was a Keurig that looks and feels cheaper than my old version, that is not as intuitive and that is harder to use overall.My old version had a lighted water tank that made it easy to determine when water was needed.  It also had a hinged top on the water tank that made it easy to add water when needed.  With the new version, Keurig has opted to make the water tank only visible from the side and to remove the hinged top entirely.  Both of these changes make it more difficult to determine when water needs to be added [the new version only has a tiny LED on top of the machine showing when water needs to be added] and makes adding water much more cumbersome as well as the top of the water tank easily falls into the reservoir when trying to remove it to add more.Add to this the fact that the machine noticeably makes a pinging sound when turning on and off, I cannot understand how such an obviously downgraded version of the machine could be considered Elite.It is a very disappointing version."
"Update: 2/23/22:The following issue has determined my decision to return this poorly designed, defective, and expensive brewer. For the last week I have noticed 1/4 to 1/3 cup of water has leaked into my coffee cup after shut-off or auto/on. I did not notice this when first purchased because I didn't think to look. That's because after my last cup of coffee, I wash the cup and place it on the brewer to be ready for the next morning's coffee and then I shut off the brewer. The next morning, it is set to turn on at 6am. I load a k-cup and hit the 10oz cup button. I noticed that sometimes the brewer fills the cup more than other times. I didn't think much of it, but one day I happened to look in the cup before brewing started and noticed a lot of water in the bottom of the cup. It has been this way for a week and probably longer, had I thought to look before hitting the button. IMO, this is not a reliable coffee maker.Original review:I bought this K-Elite brewer based on the great performance of my Keurig B60 Special Edition that I have had for 10 years! I needed certain features that I thought this brewer would have but sadly, there are just too many things that are substandard compared to the B60. I am leaning toward returning it and going back to the B60 (yes, it still works!) until I can find another brand that does what I need.1. The old B60 had auto/on and a “true” auto/off. I could set it to go on at 6am and off at 10:30am. It worked perfectly. The K-Elite only has auto/on. It does have a function that will shut the unit off after 2 hours of non-use but what good is that if you set it to be ready when you start your work day at 6:00am and then take a coffee break at 10:00? You’ll have to start from scratch to heat it up again., And, if you disable the 2 hour auto/off, be sure not to forget to manually turn it off!2. The quality of the K-Elite is cheap thin plastic. Yes, it is light weight but it is so feeble compared to the B60!3. It has a button for “strong” coffee but all that does is make a ‘regular’ cup of coffee. If you don’t hit the “strong” button, your coffee will be watery and taste terrible! The strong button only slows the drip cycle down to a trickle, supposedly making the coffee stronger. IMO, it is the same strength as a regular cup.4. I agree with another reviewer’s comment regarding the water reservoir. When the reservoir is only half empty, the low water light goes on and it won’t brew until you fill it. There are at least 4 more cups of water left in the tank! And be careful filling it because the fill line is impossible to see.5. The water filter does not have a 1-12 number dial on it like the B60 had which made it very convenient to see when it was time to change the filter.I guess I should say at least one good thing about this brewer. Even though I do not like iced-coffee, there is a function that is supposed to do that. I don’t plan on using it unless a quest wants to try it. I will keep looking for a brewer that is similar to my trusty old B60 but it won’t be a Keurig. The company has gone so far downhill, it’s sad.As the saying goes, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” 😊"
First of all the only good thing is that it holds a lot of water so you don’t have to fill as often. It’s bulky and doesn’t heat very fast so waiting on coffee is a little longer unless you leave it on all the time. The other functions are really just kind of useless. The filter is kinda silly…almost like they just want you to spend more money. This brand doesn’t seem to last long. I’ve found that the cheaper ones are better.
I've had my machine 1 yr 6 mo. It stopped working. When placing kcups it shuts off. Multiple trouble shooted. Descaled etc.. I am the only user! And not every day. Imagine if I purchased for a business. I called the manufacturer who said they will give me a 60% discount IF I agree to purchase coffee from them for a period of 1 yr. Rediculous!! And of course this is out of warranty for Amazon so buyer beware!! Reviews stated this is an issue. A very costly one I might add. Love this machine. Sure wished it lasted longer I definitely would have purchased another one if so. 200.00 a year? NO THANKS!
"I bought this machine on 04APR22 today os 23APR23 and I needed to call customer service because the low water light / function stopped working after a descale. Customer service decided that the water tank is the problem despite the low water function not operating even with the tank removed. They offered to send me a replacement water tank by mail but I seriously doubt that will fix the issue. This coffee maker has consistently underperformed with water volume output the entire time I owned it anyway.  I will be purchasing a new coffee maker because I really don’t have time for stupid first world problems. Essentially wasted a Sunday morning on this and only regret buying this contraption. One star until they fix it or send me another machine.***UPDATE***Firstly, I still haven’t recovered the new machine from my porch but I must say: a warranty replacement arrived today.Secondly, The Customer service at both Keurig and Amazon are phenomenal. It took a few phone calls but after some time Keurig shipped me a replacement brewer.Finally, Keurig did not have to do that because the warranty was expired by a couple weeks but they truly stand behind their product.To Sum it up, my Keurig lasted exactly 12 months and 16 days. The warranty is for 1 year.  A replacement was sent out the same day but only after multiple calls and emails. I give Amazon CS 5* and Keurig CS 5*. The brewer itself gets a 3* from me because the one I had broke almost immediately after the warranty expired. And as promised I am updating the review now."
"Second system in 2 years.  Unfortunately dysfunction occurs just after a year so warranty is null.  First began dispensing various amounts of water depending on brand of pod.  Pods are not off brands tho.  Then stopped.  Called Keurig and of course they were ready to give me a discount with product still higher than on Amazon.  Big deal. Bought the one on Amazon for less. This time I am having to determine which  dispense size works.  12 oz never worked more than 10 oz anyway.  Now I am noticing ""strong"" switch is causing pressure melt down with system and turns off.  Not much guarantee for a quick morning cup of coffee.  Planning to try different brand.  Cuisinart provides 3 year warranty and I can attest to the fact they respond at 2.9 years as I just replaced a regular coffee maker of theirs.  Products are just not the same quality anymore.  This is my 4th Keuring since they began.  First 2 lasted years. This  will be my last."
Side mount water tank is very difficult to remove and fill and replace.
"I was all excited with my delivery getting here quickly, however when I was assembling the pot I could not attach the filter assembly, which I've done hundreds of time with my previous pot, I couldn't because the filter base was broken. I would like the filter assembly sent ASAP, so I may use my coffee pot. Thank youRichard P Calabrese"
"Bought this to replace my old one that finally died after 8 years. Works as expected but the control buttons are all in the movable center console, making it near impossible to operate easily. Lift the center brewing module and the display and buttons disappear tilted back. Also, why block the water level view all the time? You actually have to turn the whole thing sideways to see the water remaining in the tank...pay attention before you buy!!!"
"Disappointed in the color not being as pictured. This is more of a cheap yellow good color compared to the more taupe gold color in the Amazon picture. First pic is under the light , second pic is with the light off. But it functions well. Possibly will return due to the reason I bought it being the color."
I had a Keurig that lasted through 2 families and 10 YEARS. Ironically the coffee pot died days after the previous owner did. So naturally I replaced it. I don't mind spending $150.00 on a coffee maker if I am going to get THAT kind of mileage on it. I also had absolutely no problem buying the 3 years extended warranty.And here we are..... 3 and a HALF years later. A big pile of worthless plastic. The motor is completely FRIED. I'm not particularly thrilled as I have had $20.00 coffee makers last a lot longer. And because there is an appliance epidemic in this house right now. Microwave is on its way out as well. Of Coarse!! It's January! After spending money on Christmas! 😂 It's just sooo typical of what's going on in my world these days. EVERYTHING happens at once!
"I bought this unit as it was the ""top of the line"" coffee maker for home use and as a replacement for my older ""top of the line"" unit that was several years old.  I am really disappointed in several aspects of this unit.  First of all, the water capacity is less than my old unit (why?).  Second, Keurig has eliminated the clear window in the front of the water container so the unit must be viewed from the side to see the water level.  This is really inconvenient and makes the unit more difficult to use if it is set up in a tight space.  Third, the top of the water container is not hinged like the old one so you must completely remove the top in order to fill the container with water (a pain the butt as the top must be lined up just perfect to go back on).  Finally, the instructions on setting the electronics are very poor and written as if they were an after thought (oops, we forgot to include these!).  In my opinion Keurig really blew it on this unit.  I can't imagine why they eliminated the features I've described and it is certainly not a first class unit nor is it an improvement over my old unit.  If these features are important to you I suggest you look elsewhere.  I will follow up in the future to comment on performance.Update after my first week of use:  This model is simply a pain in the butt to use.  Because my unit sits in a tight space on my cabinet, and I cannot see the water level from the front of the unit, I have to turn the unit sideways to fill the water tank in order to avoid overfilling the tank.  And when I remove the lid from the top of the tank, which is not hinged like my old one, water formed from condensation drips from the inside of the lid onto the cabinet.  After one week I am even less impressed with the ""Elite"" that I was originally.  C'mon Keurig, you can do better than this.  This is a cheap model.  Why don't you build a solid, reliable coffeemaker with top-of-the-line features and just charge more!  I would gladly pay more for a unit that performs better than this.  Next update will be in a month or two."
"I’m a little disappointed, I have a  universal reusable filter and it does not work, I’ve taken the pod holder out and everything, also I ‘ve tried to set the temp and it won’t go up in temp so my coffee isn’t really hot."
The water reservoir isn’t quite as easy to attach after filling as other models. The auto shut-off feature doesn’t work as it shuts the coffee maker down when attempting to make a cup of coffee. We have disabled auto shut-off and the system works okay.
It seems like it's not as well built as my other Keurig that died after 3 years. I did get it on sale so that's good. I like the iced feature and lots of different sizes. We'll see how long it lasts.
"After returning two Keurigs previously, I am on the fence. So far, it has worked as expected. It heats relatively fast, and I use the strong function. I only find hitting the on button a bit annoying if you have fingernails, you have to hit it the right way. The water container altho not as large as my older Keuring, is more for esthetics than practicality. If you're tight on space it will take a bit of maneuvering to get it in. I have not used the iced version yet and will do so in the summer. I don't know how long this machine will last and if this one dies or fails to work after the 30 days I will not buy another Keurig again."
"Yes, and a resounding no. This machine is quieter than the k575 (the model it replaced) and seems to run smoother all around, this is a big plus.. It has the actual water temp option, you can set it up to the actual degree, which the 575 did not have (up to 192 degrees) which is a nice touch. However...a LOT of corners were cut to make this new model, and a LOT of user-friendly ""extras"" were either removed, or ""cut short"" (literally) like the power cord. It no longer reaches my plug. I need to clear about 1.5 ft maybe 2 ft. This plug has been cut down to 1ft? This may not be an issue for people with the plug right behind their machine. The touch screen has been replaced with buttons, which is ok w/ me but.. serving size is just buttons with pictures of various size cups (the actual amount of water in each size is not listed (ex: 8oz, 10oz, etc etc) its just a picture of a cup, so you will have to do trial and error to find out which is which, or read the manual and just memorize it. The shape of the digital timer is facing straight up, in my opinion this is a mistake, i like the old way where it was facing more toward where you would be standing.. this way you'd have to be literally leaning over the machine to be looking straight at the time screen. Lastly, pouring more water into the tank: The k575 had a very handy ""lid"" w/ a hinge, in the front portion of the water tank cover making it easier to pour water in without removing the entire cover, this hinged ""lid"" was removed. Now you have to remove the entire water tank cover in order to pour water in.This is a great coffee machine, however I give this 3 out of 5 considering this was supposed to be an upgrade, and also with consideration to the price point.. in my opinion, there should never be ANY components/features considered to be ""lesser"" than the previous model in an ""upgrade"" situation. ALL components and features should be improved."
I’ve had it for  10 months and it started turning off before coffee was complete. Only filled the cup up 1/4 way  I’m hoping it was just a defect in this one.  But it seems like companies make items to last one year.
I received my keurig elite today and upon opening the box the plastic filter was laying on top of the cardboard packaging inside. It was not sealed in plastic. The coffee maker was the same. None of the items were sealed. The cord was u wrapped. I believe this was a returned product and when I went to the return or replace item the only option I had was to return the item. I would really like it replaced with a new one
"The unit arrived and I hooked it up, following the instructions to soak the filter, etc.  I turned it on to run a hot water cycle as instructed and it started running immediately.  I figured I had accidentally hit the button and so let it run.  The large mug I was using came close to overflowing so I turned the unit off and emptied the mug.  As soon as I turned it on again it started running water again and again I turned it off.  I set the time and realized there are other settings to make but no instructions were included to explain how to set them.  After looking online for instructions I noticed the buttons were supposed to be backlit blue and they weren’t.  I then looked at the box and noticed it had been retapped.  I was sent a used and defective unit.Incredibly disappointed in both Keurig and Amazon.  I am giving them both a chance to replace it with a new one.  If they do I may up my review to 2 stars, maybe.Update 2/17 - The unit was replaced within 24 hours and the new one works as it should.  As a result I have upped the rating to 3 stars.  Looking at other reviews this seems to be an ongoing issue.  Keurig really needs to look at its QC procedures and Amazon needs to look at why the item was sent back out as new when it so obviously wasn’t."
It no longer stays powered up after about a year of service. Enough said.
When I purchased this it said that it would be delivered the next day.  It was not. Called Amazon and they told me it was the sellers fault.  It finally got here and the box had been opened before we got it.  It also must have been sitting on someone's shelf for a long time or it might have been a return because it came with some coupons but the problem is the manufacturers coupons have been expired for 5 months.  We have nice large coffee cups and to fill one of them up you need to run the 10 oz brew and then the 4 oz brew which is not all that bad but I did think that this would be able to fill my cup since it does have a travel mug size button.  The cup size is on me for not researching my cup size before purchasing but the fact that it had been opened and the coupons expired does piss me off a bit.
"I had a Keurig with an auto on (set manually) and auto off (set manually for what time I wanted to have it turn off).  I had this machine for almost 15 years. It started not to work correctly and didn’t brew coffee.  I was sad to have to replace it.  I especially loved the timer.  I got up early so the timer was set at 7 am and my husband got up later so I set it to go off at 11 am.  I never had to worry about the timer; never.  So I checked this one and it had an auto on and an auto off, so I bought this one during an Amazon Prime Day sale.  So I thought I got a deal.  When I got the machine, there were no instructions on how to do the timer, which I thought was odd.  I had to go to You Tube and found a video that explained the machine to include the timer.  I really didn’t like this time since the max timer would go off after 120 minutes.  So I set it and it worked the next day; then it didn’t work anymore.  I unplugged the machine and reset the timer again.  It worked then next day and then it would not work anymore.  If I reset it; it worked one day and not the next.  So it was intermittent.  I wanted the timer for basically convenience and also for safety.  This machine doesn’t live up to my expectations especially in comparison with my older Keurig, which was fantastic."
"I purchased this Keurig model excited for the extra hot water temperature choices, the stronger brew cycle option and the many cup serving size choices. It's functional, however, it drips too much, and it doesn't seem to get the water any hotter than any of my previous four Keurigs! The ""strong"" brew button sends out a mess of black thick ash around the coffee pod holder that has to be wiped off daily. Its a mess! This black ash seems to get everywhere. It is a constant cleaning with this model. The most annoying thing is a standard size ""to-go thermos - grab and go morning holder is too tall with the drip screen in place. Well, that's okay...just remove the drip screen. That was an issue with previous models; no big deal. (You would think!) Except once you've removed the drip screen and put it away in the cabinet (because the reach is too short with it) you will find that the little plastic 2 to 2 1/2"" mug holder piece is too small for any mug other than the standard size run-of-the mill coffee mug to sit in place. You have to hold any larger mug or it will tip and spill! Soooo annoying! This piece that goes under the drip screen is not functional - and when you use the drip screen you cannot fit your thermos if it's more than 12 oz. With my previous models I could use the attached piece below the drip screen with any size mug, cup or thermos. AND ONE OF THE COOL FEATURES IS THE OPTION FOR LARGER CUPS OF COFFEE! This  Keurig really had some problems. It is functional -  but I still have to put my coffee in the microwave and clean up thick, black gunk and lots of coffee drips. Thank goodness for Bounty paper towels! I wouldn't buy this again on a deep sale or recommend this model. Am still using it waiting for a newer improved model. My husband said we should try another brand. I think we probably will."
"The first unit wobbled like crazy. The second unit, just as much. I did notice that one of the little round pads that it sits on is longer that the other one. This is obviously a manufacturers issue.  I should not have to put a shim under a new Keurig for it to not wobble."
The pump went out 6 months later. I've owned others by the same brand that were awesome. This one missed the mark. Maybe they are just making them cheaper now.
We had a Keurig that lasted for over 10 years. It finally started to show its age so I decided to order another one. Right away I could tell the quality has gone downhill considerably. It is made of cheap plastic. I purchased and returned 3 of these until finally giving up and keeping the 4th. Why? Because every single time it brews coffee sputters everywhere. It is turning our white subway tile grout brown. We have to keep paper towels around it to wipe up the coffee sputter. The fact that this is the 4th one that we have purchased in the last few months is proof that it is a design flaw. The only reason that we kept it is because we had so many boxes of Scup's that we needed to use so we thought we’d suffer through maybe another year of this coffee pot before we switch to another better brand. I can’t imagine it’s gonna last past a year anyways.
I bought as replacement for one I had for quite a few years which was still working but started leaking.  This machine is very cheaply made and is not the same quality as the one I replaced.  It rattles and shakes when you touch it or open the lid to put in the K-Cup.  It does not sit flush and shakes when brewing.  I thought I had a defective machine and they sent me a replacement which did the same thing.  The only positive on this is the coffee does taste good.  I am not sure if their other products are like this but I would not purchase this one again and should have returned it for a refund as it is not worth the money I spent on it.  I guess I should have tried the newer version instead of getting the same machine - maybe I would have had better luck.
No trouble until you have trouble. Great machine until it’s out f warranty.This Keurig lasted two years only. Daily use for 1-2 cups per day!!!!Already did the trouble shooting.  Now we have to get a new one.  So frustrating.One year warranty only.  Why does everything fall  apart so quickly ???’
"I have the worst luck with Keurig. They go bust somewhere around the 1 - 2 year mark, despite my best attempts at maintaining and using them strictly as instructed. I've gone through three of this model, the third of which didn't work right out of the box.That's what prompted me to write this review. It might be gradually declining QC standards that cause this. Or maybe I don't want to admit I am cursed. When they work, they are great. It's a good, old fashion cup of coffee on the fly, which is all I want. I wish they were longer lasting (by the accounts of many reviews, this isn't normal, so I'm flummoxed). Nothing lasts forever, but I'd expect a $100+ coffee maker to last longer than this.So, take this however you will. For what it's worth, except for the one that never worked, it goes from working great to not working overnight. There's no slow demise where I can get it to work but find grinds in my cup, scald my hands, and so on. I guess that's good because if you can find one that works, they make a darn good little cup of joe."
"We have had our Elite for 1 1/2  to 2 years, and noticed it must be leaking water from underneath the machine, or the water tank.  Have noticed it for a few months.  Our old Keurig lasted over 10 years.Not sure we want to try a another one."
"I've owned a few other Keurig before upgrading to this one. Functionality wise it works fine and makes a quick good cup of coffee. However, I've gotten these marks all along the bottom of the coffee maker that won't come often no matter what I do and I never had this problem with any other ones we've purchased."
"My last Keurig lasted about 2 years of daily use. This one leaked immediately upon use. The reservoir seal looks to be completely tightened, but there is a constant drip coming from this machine. I would return it, but I have already used it once and threw out the packaging. I will have to try to figure something else out."
"Initially, it work fast and produced really good coffee, even better tasting than the last brand I had. After a few weeks of usage it began to have intermittent issues. Sometimes it starts when the button are pressed and sometime it just acts like it want to but doesn't. Great coffee maker if it was reliable."
"Our older Keurig was dying a slow death, and so this version recently came into our lives. It's ok, but there are a few annoyances. For instance, why can't they make a lid that latches? We don't have cats (some reviewers complain their cats get into their coffee pot!), but still a closing feature would be nice. I've nearly knocked the lid off several times. I also don't like the auto-shut off feature and the shape of the water carafe is somewhat difficult to maneuver. Worst of all, this machine leaves a little pile of grounds on the top of each K-cup after it's punctured, so the mess is ever-increasing. Don't know if that's supposed to happen, we've only had it for about 2 weeks and I keep meaning to contact Keurig to find out... So, it's ok, but I probably wouldn't choose it again."
"This machine is so loud. It’s loud when you turn it on, loud while hearing and loud while brewing. Would not have purchased had I known!!"
I just want to warn people making their decisions on which coffee maker to purchase.  While this coffee maker is very nice there is one annoyance that I want to bring up.  The amount of coffee from pushing the buttons is very inconsistent.  I use the same size mug every time.  I select the second largest size option.  Sometimes I get the correct amount.  Sometimes I have to hit the second largest size again to get the mug filled.  Other times I have to select the smallest to get the mug filled.This was not the coffee maker I was originally going to go with but the one I wanted wasn't available for a while so I settled.  Now I wish I had waited.
"First off I have this thing set at 192°, it barely goes over 170° so if you like really hot coffee, hard Pass. can't see the reservoir from the front of the unit. Limited counter space forces me to place this unit so that the reservoir side is against the wall so you can't see the water level.  On my old one you could see it from the front. and yes, I am aware that a light comes on, but that does not give me a visual cue about how much water is actually left. This one I guess they were attempting to clean it up a little and make it look nicer but in doing that you can no longer see how much water is left. it's annoying to have to pull the whole thing out every time to check water levels. The ice function to me seems pointless. Internet is ambiguous at best on how to use it. I've seen everything from don't use a kcup and it'll make 24 ounces of iced coffee, which I don't see how that's possible. And I saw YouTube video where it only makes 6 ounces, but it melts all the ice. if I wanted my ice to melt, I would just brew a normal cup of coffee and throw ice in it. Why bother with a special function? If you watch their video they pretty much just glaze over it. Because it Doesn't make iced coffee.You put ice in a cup just like any other barista would do. Beyond me why they even bothered to put that on there.Edit: now the weight sensor for the water reservoir isn't working correctly. The light is coming on when it's more than half full. I press down, and it goes away. yet another reason it would be nice to visually see the water level. more sensors equals more stuff that breaks.Edit 2: sigh... I thought it may have just been me but it wasn't. I had four other people try this nobody can tell the difference if I use the strong button. used Cinnabon, and Starbucks breakfast blend. And honestly it all taste the same doesn't matter what size of the five buttons I choose. I can't make anything strong. Or at least not what I consider strong. I'm going to go ahead and say if they make a single cup version of these with a 16 or 20 ounce option, buy that instead. Because besides from this holding more water you can't see that's all this is.Edit the 3rd (the final edit)Either I got a lemon or this thing is made by drunk monkeys."
"I had to replace my Keurig elite after it decided to give out after 4 solid years of use. I purchased a returned/refurbished unit from Amazon and it was defective from the onset. It took nearly 3 minutes to brew a single cup of coffee and the motor made a straining sound every time it tried forcing water through the Kcup. Overall, it’s a good machine with a large water chamber. Be wary or returned units. Thankfully I was able to get it replaced through Keurigs warranty."
"It was good, but just had to throw mine away after last than a year. It suddenly stop working, and that was it"
Product was great while working. It lasted for 3.5 years with occasional use. My old Keurig lasted 9 years!I guess quality has dropped and products are not built to last. Shame for a brand as big as Keurig to cut corners on quality.
"Great coffee. Great functioning machine. Very cheap, possibly fragile materials used for main parts that require handling, filling, replacing. If you are careful, it's a great coffee machine:)"
"After more than two years, this maker is still going strong.  Like most Keurigs, it doesn't have a ""hot enough"" setting, but it's workable.  Pours water over pods quickly, heats quickly, easy to clean but doesn't need it often, pod insertion and removal is easy, and it looks nice enough.  Seems well built.Five stars except for one thing: the water reservoir.  Whoever designed it should be brought to justice.(-1 star) the reservoir top's front and back are different heights, meaning that you can only fill to the lowest edge, leaving unused res volume.  This is presumably to mate better with the rest of the unit's swoopy-doopy Volvo lines.(-1 star) the reservoir's point of attachment to the maker is a fiddly hook arrangement that you have to get right before settling the reservoir into its receiving base.  Sometimes harder to do than it should be on a counter with other things right next to it and not much direct visibility.(-1 star) the reservoir is almost impossible to hold with your hands once full (i.e. on the trip back from filling at the sink).  There's nowhere to put your hands that won't impede reinstallation on the maker.  The reservoir is extremely oddly shaped and you can't imagine that this was ever designed to be held by human hands; it wasn't.  You will eventually learn a Kung-Fu pinch-grip with one finger in the water (ew) and another on the little Billy Idol lip up at the top that seems like an engineering afterthought.(-1 star) I was going to leave this at two stars, but moving the reservoir again for refill this morning has left  me irrational and emotionally damaged."
"Disappointed!  We probably have had 10 or more Keurigs in the past years. This model is very cheaply made; materials used are thin;  no lit-up water tank, and the lid for tank is very thin and light. This is probably why they tell you to remove tank to fill it, But it is then a Bear to replace it without lighting and you probably will spill water all over where you have chosen to use.it as I have. I choose to fill the tank while in place on the counter. I use the kitchen sink hose to pull out and fill the tank, without spilling a drop. Buyer Beware!! If you buy, also buy the 4 yr. Insurance, my guess is that I will get to use mine."
"Bought this one to replace the exact model that I had for two years that stopped working after less than two years and we contacted Keurig but they will not help you if your coffee pot is over a year. Which we found very disappointing to spend $200 and it only last less than two years and Keurig  wouldn’t care or do anything about it. So I was looking for a different coffee pot, but then was gifted this one for my birthday, so chose to use it. It’s the same coffee pot which we did like for two years, but the new version and  this one is so much slower plus it has an on off switch that the other one didn’t have. So it turns off automatically, and so every time you use it you have to put it on and it takes a few minutes to warm up. Then it takes longer for the coffee to drip out  and then to reuse it for a 2nd cup for someone else. You have to wait a few minutes in between!!So it’s slow moving and takes much longer than the original same model older brand.  Not very happy with this Keurig and then it only goes up to 12 ounces. It should be able to brew more if you want it to.  plus Keurig does not back up its expensive coffee machines after a year.Overall not very happy with the Keurig brand at all, and would not buy another Keurig."
"I purchased this Keurig originally last year, and it was great - until it quit on me.  It lasted about 7 months before I just stopped working. We thought maybe we just got a bad unit, so we ordered another one.  This one lasted 4 months.The only reason it isn't 1 star is because it worked GREAT until it died on me.  I'm going to switch to another brand."
"This product was great while it lasted, but it ended up leaking out the bottom onto my counter.  I disassembled it and it appears the seal between the reservoir and unit wears out. Keurig does not sell replacement parts, and I am out of warrantee. I tried a few YouTube fixes, including adding an o-ring to the reservoir seal, but the slow leak continued. I have purchased a new machine, and went with the K1500 commercial one, which I hope will be more durable, has a larger reservoir, and is about the same price."
"Very disappointed that I have to go buy another coffee maker.  This one will warm up and the light will go on to put the pod in.  Once the pod is put it, there are sounds like it is starting to brew, and then all lights go out, and it has no power.  This is not a local electrical issue - the Keurig starts but then stops."
"1. The water container is not visible from the front -- therefore, it's hard to tell when it needs refilling.2. There's no way to keep it on. It automatically turns off and expects one to tell it when to turn it on again.I've been a Keurig user for years, and this is the first time I'm not happy. Shame on Keurig to put out such a shoddy package!"
I don't know what it is about this  product. It has a terrible taste and the pods did also. It do get hot fast to get hot water but no good taste to even the water alone.
"I just bought this and while putting it together I noticed the canister has exposed metal screws on the bottom, which means these metal screws will always be sitting in water. That makes no sense that it would be designed that way. I can’t speak to the functionality overall of this maker yet but like others have said, I also think the machine feels very cheap and flimsy."
"Received original unit in a plain cardboard box labeled Keurig.  Unit did not work!  Called Amazon...they sent out a replacement unit within 24 hours and arranged to have UPS pick up original unit at no charge to us (yay Amazon).  Replacement unit arrived in what appeared to be original packaging (unlike first unit).  In retrospect, first unit appears to have been a recycled used or replacement unit (bad Amazon).  Second unit appears to be functioning well.  We'll see.Update 1/4/24:  Replacement unit failed on 2nd day of use.  DO NOT BUY!!"
"The K-Elite can malfunction with SOME brands of K-pods.  It cannot pump water through the pod to make coffee.  It splatters the grounds and water and then shuts off.  Take a new K-pod and put it in the holder and close the lid.  This will make a hole in both the TOP and the BOTTOM of the K-pod.  Do not make any selections at this time.  Remove the K-pod and turn it a quarter-turn and put it back.  Close the lid once again.  Now, you will still have ONE hole in the top and TWO holes in the bottom.  Now the K-Elite is able to pump the water and work as normal."
"It’s fine. Does the job. But started out silent, the  got louder and louder over 2 months. Drips a bit long after the cup of coffee is made. Bigger reservoir is nice, but it’s harder to get on than the older model. The “hot water” option seems pointless because the water is still routed through the k-cup chamber so you still get that coffee taste when you just want hot water. Overall - it’s just fine. Not great, not terrible, just fine."
"Purchased as a gift for my husband. A few months in water started leaking from the bottom. That eventually stopped. 11 months in, as soon as you'd hit the brew size, the unit would shut off. Did all the troubleshooting I possibly could and there was no remedy. Thankfully, it was still within the 1 year Keurig warranty and was replaced for no cost.Aside from that, it's disappointing that you can't fit a large yeti cup (24 oz) underneath the brewer."
"I don’t like the access to the water reservoir. It’s a bit cumbersome to remove, & replace full of water. The only way to know you are low on water is to turn the the machine to the side or wait for the low water light to go on. We have our machine in the corner of the countertop so maybe it’s easier if it were in the middle of the counter. That being said it makes great coffee like their previous models"
"This is my second Keurig. The last one still kinda ran, but was on its last leg after about 10 years of reliable service.  I got this particular one because it had a larger reservoir and also could make 12oz cups of coffee.  Like I said in the title, it runs, although it stopped working about 3 month in and I had to tear the whole top apart to clean it, but could be a lot better with a couple of tweaks that other Keurig pots already have.Most of the issues I have with it are regarding the water tank.  First, I have mine positioned so my frig is next to it on the left. The problem is that there is no way to see how full the tank is without sliding it out and turning it.  The second problem is that it will run dry without making a full cup of coffee without any warning.  My older machine would let me know if there wasn't enough water in the tank before starting a cup.  This one doesn't have that feature, and this is a newer model that is advertised to be better.  I should have stuck with the model I had, even if the tank held less water so I was filling it more often."
"Using it for one month so far, will update later. Most keurig coffee makers have been lasting from 3 months to a year, my guess is due to poor, cheap, plastic parts, and poor quality control. We are on our 4th keurig in 4 yrs, not a good track record. If this one does no last at least 2 yrs we are changing brands."
I did not like the straight of the coffee when using pods.
"I like the fact that I can make coffee so quickly, but after you take the cupholder out, and lock down and back into the machine, you can see a buildup of garbage where it kind of leaks into there. painstakingly you can get to it with a small brush, then take the handle of a spoon with a small damp rag on it and wipe out the Gook. there needs to be a better way to take it apart and clean it.  This can’t be healthy!  The picture is where you can’t reach.  After I get it as clean as I can, I spray inside with colloidal silver to sterilize it.  Believe me it is nasty!  Yes I do pop the cup part out to clean.  Take a flashlight and look back inside at the goop."
"I do not like that this machine turns itself off after about 30 minutes, as this necessitates a long heating-up process before brewing that a previous version of this model did not require (you were able to keep that one on and ready to brew at all times)."
"I had the slimline with all the options: heat, quantity, strength, settings for each person and I loved it but I always had problems then it just went out. Disappointing this one.  It has few options and even when you hit strong, it is weak. 😢"
"I had a Keurig for a couple of years that finally stopped working. I watched videos on how to clean it, take it apart and clean out for the water flow. Spent many hours, but Still water would not come through. So I bought a brand new one, figuring a year or two of use was acceptable. This new one was purchased September 21 and never really worked. After maybe ten cups it stopped working. It shuts itself off and water does not flow.  I was out of town for a couples of month and the 30 day return date expired on me or I would definitely return this malfunctioning, never really worked piece of junk."
This new Keurig still makes a good cup of coffee.  Over 10 years I’ve owned many of these machines. I found with this model that removal of the water tank to fill and change filters is cumbersome. Not an improvement.
Stopped working - worked for about 6 months - Keiuigs quality went WAY down - we had a keiuig for about 5 years (our old one) then it started to act funny - I tried cleaning it several times - but after 5 years it was dead - ordered this one - in Dec it is now May it stopped working - our old one you could replace the needle part but this one there is no way to do that. Plus i don't think that is the problem - it is the electric wiring in it - you put the pod in and it drips for a few seconds and shuts all the lights on it off - I tried the old unplug and replug again - so in a nut shell - our last one worked for 5 years - this one worked for about 5 months and that sucks- they are just making theses things cheaper and cheaper - with less quality control
"Stated it was very good condition and it was not. It was missing parts, it had water in the box. It was missing the filter in the water tank. Not happy with this purchase."
"This is my third K-cup brewer. The newest one, Keurig Elite K90 has a leak in the bottom of the water tank. I need a new water tank or information on how to fix it."
"According to Keurig, their customer service informed me that they are aware of problems with this machine. The carafe leaks repeatedly every single time you pour a cup of coffee. It runs all over the counter then onto the floor. They have replaced the carafe for me several times but the result is the same.Now just a few months into purchasing this machine, it has quit working entirely. Tried to make a pot of coffee, and the machine cuts itself off with less than 1/2 cup brewed. The element shuts off too.  They have replaced the machine but now into 2 days of this replacement, the carafe is leaking all over the place and the machine is cutting itself off again.  I would not recommend this product. The only up-side is that they keep replacing it because they are aware of the problem.  I see other reviews saying the same thing. Don't buy this unless you really like the UPS Store because you'll be there often returning this product as well as returning all the replacement parts.........Save your money.05/24/24 UPDATE. I am now on my 3rd Keurig replacement coffeemaker.  They have replaced the carafe now 6 times.  The Keurig rep told me ""...it's not uncommon to replace the carafe 6-7-8 times..."" They are fully aware of the defective products.  Customer Service has been great to replace the broken parts, but you shouldn't have to replace a coffeemaker every 45 days.  The machine is a great concept but they really need to review it's function. Each time, I have requested to return the defective parts but they don't want it back.  I want them to see/use the product to fully understand what they are selling.08/01/2024 UPDATE  I am now on my 4th replacement Keurig coffeemaker.  This has been a complete nightmare!!!  They are FULLY aware this product has numerous issues.  The last representative told me that 'THIS PRODUCT HAS BEEN LABELED DEFECTIVE'. They still sell them.  The carafe leaks like crazy, you pour a cup and it will literally spill all over the counter and down to the floor so you must make certain that you carry the pot to the sink and pour your cup there.  The machine itself works about 60 days then it just simply shuts itself off.  You'll get about a 1/2 cup of coffee made and then the machine stops and will not make any more.  I like the concept of the machine in that it has one water reservoir that connects to the one-serve or the carafe and that is a really nice feature that I have enjoyed.  However, that is about the only thing that you will like about this machine.  They are aware, COMPLETELY aware that this product does not function properly.  I have asked repeatedly to send these machines back so they can see for themselves how defective it is but they do not want the machines returned.  Again, they are FULLY aware that these machines malfunction.  The customer service insisted that this new machine ""has been tested"" and should work. I am not holding my breath.  With all the problems that I have had, I wish I went to Walmart and bought a $20 machine off the shelf instead of dealing with this mess."
"I like have both the pot and cup brew options in one machine. This is the reason I bought it. However, I don't like how difficult it is to slide the filter basket into the correct position. This was slightly off the other day and left me a huge mess of coffee grounds and leaked coffee to clean up! I also wish you could preset the brew time in advance!"
"Liked this coffee maker when making a lot of coffee. Pod coffee tasted watered down, regardless of the brand of pods used, BUT it only lasted 14 months. It clogged all the time and we had to take apart and clean.  Started leaking and smoking without warning. Had to throw away."
"Loved it while it lasted, was nice to have a pot/pods combo unit. Bought unit Mar2023, stopped working Oct2024.The pods lid was always a bit hard to close, but now it will never kick on the heating part, where the light blinks slowly for brewing/heating up.  Neither side works as it’s the same problem.Not sure if it’s worth it, usually on sale for 120-150, so you’ll prob get 1-2 years out of it . You can decide if that’s worth it.Tried a few fixes (which didn’t entail taking anything apart really) from online, but no luck.Planning to reach out to vendor but it’s 6 months past the warranty so I’m not holding my breathe, will update if anything comes from that."
"This is a good coffee maker I love it,  but the carafe leaks alot when pouring coffee. So I eventually got a new one from keurig.  Guess what same problem. Hopefully they make an improvement to it."
"While this does make your standard cup, the coffee pot is worthless. No amount of coffee grinds will make the brewed coffee taste like coffee. It tastes like water, no matter how much I put in it. Idk how a coffee pot could be disappointing, but this one is. Keurigs are ok but also lack flavor which is expected. The pot is no bueno"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            When you only use the K-cup side, this brewer works great. I have to wonder if they didn't design it with the idea that, given the option, who wouldn't prefer a k-cup over a full carafe? However, since my hubby drinks 3 cups of coffee at breakfast, and is lazy, he doesn't want them brewed individually. He puts on the pot and drinks the coffee over a two-hour period (the length of time the hot plate keeps it warm).The problem is there is some sort of design flaw with the carafe. When purchasing our coffeemaker, I made a capital mistake of not scrutinizing reviews--not my norm. But this product has so many reviews (almost 27,000 at last look) and most of them positive, I figured I couldn't go wrong.About three days into using this product, the carafe began to leak. I thought I was pouring too fast, and slowed down. Nope. Still leaked. Okay, I thought, this carafe had a problem. I called Keurig and they replaced it promptly (they do have very attentive and helpful customer service people). The new carafe arrived within a week. I didn't use it the first two weeks; my husband did. Then when I made his breakfast one day, I poured his coffee and it leaked. I told my husband, who said he had also noticed the leak but thought he was pouring too fast. We experimented with water, holding the carafe over the sink (see photo and video). Any time the carafe is over fill level 6, there's a distinct leak coming from under the black band that holds the lid onto the glass. Since this is our second carafe, I thought maybe they both came from a bad lot. So I came to Amazon and did a search on ""leak"" in reviews and questions, and discovered most of the bad reviews and questions involved leaking carafes. As other customers have noted, this is a design flaw and it's an established problem that Keurig has not bothered to fix. So essentially, we have paid about three times the price of an ordinary dual brewer for a product we can only use for the K-cup side--or to make two cups of coffee in the carafe without leaking. And unfortunately, the return window expired a week ago, so we're stuck with it.Needless to say, I can't recommend this brewer to anyone who actually wants to make three or more cups of coffee at a time.Also, the water reservoir is very difficult to use. This is a problem more with me than my husband. He is strong enough and has a good enough grip that he can hold the entire reservoir under the fridge's water filter and pour. I am not. We live in an area with extremely hard water, so the filter is necessary, and I can't fill it with tap water. And further, the filter (both filters and plastic housings for said filter must be purchased separately) fits loosely and trembles when water is added. Youtube videos show it snapping into place with a click and instantly becoming the rock of Gibraltar, but after the click, ours still shakes.Finally, in yet another attempt to get our hard-earned cash, Keurig's descaling solution (also sold separately, in small bottles) is, as nearly as I can tell, equivalent to the vinegar-water mixture our old coffeemaker used. Next time I'll go back to the old coffeemaker. I think it was a Kitchen-Aid. At least the carafe didn't leak, you didn't need a filter, and the descaling cleaning solution was one you could make at home with your own vinegar and water."
"I've had Keurig makers forever and, for the most part, have always been happy with them.  I purchased this combo Keurig after using the same model at my brother's house.  It was truly the best of both worlds - full pot if there were multiple people drinking and individual K-Cups for...well, single cups.  It worked perfectly for the first 9 months or so until:There is a design issue with the carafe that causes it to leak when pouring from a full pot.  I initially thought it was a flaw in my carafe so I called customer service and they sent me a replacement pretty quickly.  However, the new one had the same issue and, after reading other reviews, I discovered it's a common problem.  I pour over the sink now, so it's not a big deal.  Inconvenient but nothing to complain about.However, over the past couple of months, there are other issues that have popped up.  The cup size selector on the K-Cup side is accurate maybe 1 out of 3 times.  If I select 8oz sometimes I get 6oz.  Sometimes I get 12oz.  This isn't an issue unless I select 12oz for a 12oz coffee mug and end up getting 20oz of coffee.  I cleaned the unit based on Keurig's instructions and we're still seeing the same problem.In addition, maybe once/week I'll set the machine to brew a pot and end up getting half a pot and then a huge mess on the counter as the remaining coffee ends up going through the K-Cup side.  It's been hit or miss (with increasing numbers of hits) and I make sure that there is a giant coffee mug always under the K-Cup dispenser.I've talked with Keurig several times and the usual response is to clean and descale the unit.  I'm an expert on this now.I'll be replacing this one and I'm hesitant to try another Keurig combo."
"I absolutely love This Keurig Duo. This review isn't necessarily about how the machine works.The coffee maker does work great. This machine has a 3 step process to brew coffee. It does not indicate if the strong brew is on or off for making stronger coffee. There is no indicator light letting you know if strong brew is on or off. It still make a great pot of coffee and a great single cup of coffee.I wish the water tank was bigger. It only holds enough water to make one 12 oz. Cup and one 12 cup pot of coffee. If you are only using it to make single cups of coffee, it's perfect. If you are making pots of coffee, you will constantly have to refill after making a pot if you also want to make single cups of coffee after brewing a pot. All and all it is a good Keurig machine/maker for those that want both single cup or a pot of coffee.But for those if us that like to brew our own desired coffee or save money, versus expensive plastic pre filled K-cups, I'm very disappointed in Keurigs new designs of machines and refillable K-cups. They are inconsistent from one machine to another and the designs are different from the newer models verses older models. The designs of the New universal K-cups suck and do not fit all machines as advertised. They will not fit this machine.Let me explain. I had refillable k-cups that I used with all of my other Keurig machines over the years and they all fit perfectly. Keurigs design had never changed. Whether it was an off brand refillable K-cup or Keurig brand refillable K-Cup, they all fit and worked in any Keurig brand coffee machine/maker. Of course the off brand refillable K-Cups always make weaker coffee. If you wanted stronger coffee you would needed the name brand Keurig K-cup. My generic brand refillable K-Cups do not fit in the new keurig Duo machine. So off I went to buy a name brand refillable K-Cup made specifically by Keurig to fit Keurig machines. For $10.00 or $22.00 you can buy a ""universal refillable K-cup"" made specifically for ""Keurig"" machines. There are 2 different ones that ""Keurig"" makes. These are not off brand K-cups. They are Keurig brand. These refillable K-Cup snap into pieces to fit specific machines in a specific way. It is a 4-5 step process that I had to watch a video to learn how to put it in. It is required to remove the original k-cup insert that comes with the Keurig machine from the factory. (I JUST WANT A CUP OF COFFEE) This process should not be so complicated nor difficult. And then, The refillable K-cups made by Keurig DO NOT FIT. The Keurig or the generic brand DO NOT FIT ALL KEURIG DUO MACHINES.Please be aware... if you are are looking to save money by using refillable or reusable K-cups, Do Not purchase the Keurig Duo machine. ANY refillable/reusable K-cups WILL NOT FIT. I have tried many different brands and types including the Keurig brand and they do not fit this machine."
"This was great for the 7 months of working.  Just went blank, turned off in middle of brewing and wouldn't turn back on.  I'm working with the Keurig team to get replacement.  We will see how it goes."
"As the title reads, stopped working in the middle of brewing a pot of coffee after only 45 days.  Good news customer support at Kurig had me a new one sent out the same day."
"We have owned other kureg coffee pots, and were never disappointed. This one requires multiple steps to switch from pot to single cup brewing. The reservoir is difficult to refill, sometimes the coffee grounds flood into the pot, and the coffee temperature is not always hot enough  which requires microwaving."
"Each time i buy a keurig, it seems to last shorter and shorter amount of time. My carafe has leaked since day 1 when you pour coffee. When i select 12 on my single serve i get about 1 inch of coffee!! I’ve descaled it and thoroughly cleaned it, and it still does this not sure I’m going to get another keurig 😞"
"This coffee maker is really is classy looking, versatile, and is relatively compact considering all it's capabilities. It should have a five-star rating. But I'm being generous by giving it three stars.A huge problem with the Duo, that I wish I had known before I made the purchase, is the carafe leaks when you pour coffee. It is obvious that this has been a problem for a number of years since the coffee maker first came out.Since the issue is not only very annoying, it's also messy, and completely unnecessary, I went in search of suggestions to remedy the problem. My internet search revealed workarounds (none of them from Keurig) and most were the same thing, which is sanding right inside the spout, or removing a tab at the back of the lid at the handle (or both). Apparently this solution works for some, but it has not worked for me, and when you pay $140+ for something you want it to function properly.The interesting thing about this problem is that Keurig obviously has known about the issue, and has never corrected it. When I looked for solutions to the problem, it seems that other owners of the coffee maker have complained of the same problem ever since the product came to market. In other words, this was not an issue of simply ""working the bugs out"", instead it is a case of Keurig not dealing with the issue at all.The sad thing is, apparently the one workaround that actually works, is buying a particular model of the Mr. Coffee carafe that fits. Maybe Keurig needs to have Mr. Coffee make their carafe for them."
Decent coffee maker except for the fact the pot leaks alot when pouring coffee.
"Yep this thing is about 30 percent bigger than it needs to be. That presents a problem for most of us taking about two square feet of counter space. But wait! If you have upper cabinets like most people this coffee maker will need to be on the front edge of the counter in order to refill the tiny water hopper.  Yes the water hopper is only big enough for one pot of coffee when really it should be holding 2 to 3 pots worth of water. The filter bay only opens if slid out away from the upper cabinet. The coffee pot remains moist and must be left open to air dry. The carafe lid and basket are made with a plastic that eerily resists water, reminds me of some sort of PFAS. Who knows how much threat to human development it could potentially cause? Guess it's cheaper than stainless steel.That said it brews nicely a pot or k cup. Good temperature and water metering. Even make hot chocolate or tea by leaving the k cup empty and running hot water into a mug. The carafe is dimensioned to refill from a refrigerator perfectly. But you need to run a supply line from the fridge connector to this coffee maker to make life easy.Take the good with the bad and live with this massive small capacity coffee maker."
"The dual coffee machine is good. Although it works, the carafe is not good. It leaks all over the counter when poured. Purchased another carafe in 2024 caused the same issue. Before pouring our coffee, we must either pour it over the sink or put a dish towel on the counter. The carafe was made with poor craftsmanship. I hope that they can resolve this issue. Buying a new machine is something I will do once I have the money."
"Ordered this Keurig in February 2024. I started having issues in July. Both the carafe and the k-pod was not producing the amount chosen. Thought it needed a good cleaning - descaled it. No good. Descaled again. No good. Descaled it again a few weeks later. Descaling didn't help. In fact, the machine continued to produce less and less coffee. Now the carafe won't even make 1 cup when you select 12! I thought it must be the pump - and its under warranty - so, I called the support number for Keurig. after a few minutes describing the problems the agent began saying they couldn't hear me, and they hung up. I called back got another agent...spent a few minutes explaining the issues and answering their questions then they also said they couldn't hear me and hung up. I next communicated by email. Someone called, went through all the same steps - but did not hang up!. They asked me to send proof of purchase for a replacement. Done. Quick response said it would ship in a couple days. A couple of days later email said it was out of stock and would be a month before it could ship. I sent another email to the same place asking for a refund or a ""similar"" unit replacement. Its been several days - no answer. One would think that a company as big and popular as Keurig would have a better system of warranty replacement - or just let good old fashioned customer service take over and do the right thing - offer refund or similar unit. Nothing yet. Crickets. By the way, this is our third Keurig. The first lasted almost 2 years. The second about a year. And now this one 6 months. Not good!"
Having trouble getting it started. I go by instructions but nothing happens
"We bought the Duo a couple weeks ago to free up some space on the countertop by getting rid of my wife's stand-alone coffee pot and my K Supreme. My personal history with Keurig machines starts years ago with the ""classic"" original looking machine, and then another one or two after they each died, to a Supreme a couple years ago. The Supreme has been awesome, it starts brewing within 5-8 seconds, and outside of the noise of the coffee exiting the brewer into the cup, the machine itself is almost silent.I assumed that this must be Keurig improving their machines and just modernization in general.So I was pretty disappointed with the Duo, it is slow, and noisy. It basically works the same as the old ""classic"" style machines, where when you power it on, it takes minutes to warm the water up before brewing, and while warming you can hear the water kind of roaring inside with greater and greater intensity. Then when it does start brewing, there's lots of gear noises, clicks, whirring and grinding. The pump is noisy while it draws the water from the reservoir. This was kind of a deal breaker for me because I'm usually the first one up in the mornings and I don't want a bunch of mechanical noises coming from the kitchen when the rest of the house is still quiet and sleeping.The Duo has a big water reservoir in the back that is not too hard to fill. It does not come with a charcoal filter holder, which is a little odd considering that the Duo reservoir's water outlet will definitely fit one.The coffee it made from both the brewer, and the K-cup side, was predictably good and unremarkable. The controls are easy enough to use, although I did have to consult the manual for a couple things.I ended up packing this up and sending it back, and putting the Supreme back in service. I've been spoiled by its quick, quiet coffee production and the Duo was just too much the opposite."

Love the versatility but when the urn is full and you go to pour it leaks all over no matter how slow you pour. Frustrating
"I bought this item in October, 2019. Was truly excited about what it could do - produce single cups of coffee or produce a carafe of coffee. Wow! The problems began when I first tried to set up the machine. Because the product is basically all black, the buttons for hour/Minute, strength, and auto are not highlighted in white so you can see what the buttons do. Then, the instructions are somewhat haphazard as they really don’t tell you specifically what happens after you push them. I realize that you turn on the machine first, select either POD or carafe next, press the blinking light or the button that’s above the blinking light next to confirm (Why not make the confirm button blink like the on/off, pod or carafe buttons, ounces or cups selection?), press ounces or cups BUT WHAT IS NEXT? It doesn’t tell you to push the confirm button again, upon which the light will Begin to blink slower and that’s all you have to do. I did that and nothing began happening! There was no sound to indicate the machine was working. I turned it off and then on again, following the steps, but became frustrated. I packed it up to send it back. But then I gave it another try. I finally figured it out!It worked for a few months and then the “descale” light appeared. WHAT A PAIN IN THE NECK! Too many steps- turning off, turning on, pull the plug, reset, replug, remove reservoir, dump water, refill this/that, disconnect for 5 minutes or 30 minutes, or 4 hours. Do this four (4) times for the pod side and (4) times for the carafe side ..WHAT???????????. The written steps lack clarity and precision. Since I don’t have the packaging anymore, sending it in for repair is out of the question. What a waste of my money! Previous machines that I’ve owned are Mr. Coffee and Cuisinart- de scaling is super easy and quick! Back to my 6 year old Cuisinart! Out with the new and back in with the old! Avoid the Keurig k-duo...UPDATE- Well, “shiver me timbers” I decided to RE-read the customers’ reviews and found a review from Donna S. that not only worked but gave this machine a second chance. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU, DONNA! Your comment about holding down the 8 and 10 ounce/8 and 10 cup buttons for 10 seconds removed the “de-scale” indicator. BUT, first, the machine must be off, then turn it on but DO NOT select pods or carafe setting. Just locate the hard to see 8 and 10 buttons and hold them down simultaneously for 10 seconds- VIOLA` —- NO MORE DESCALE LIGHT. Do removing that light kept the machine from functioning properly!I will give the machine 3 stars as the instructions for set-up and de-scaling are difficult to understand and poorly written."
"I brew six cups of regular coffee each day.  My wife only drinks decaf, and only on two or three days a week.  She makes her decaf using a press pot, taking her twenty minutes or so.  She has her one cup and saves the rest in a small thermos to reheat later or, more likely, toss out several days in the future. My bright idea for a Christmas gift was to give her a small, single shot Keurig K-Cup machine so she could have a fresh cup every time.  I ordered one from Amazon and was shocked at the size of the thing.  I couldn’t find a way to make it fit along with the existing coffee maker on our limited counter space.  I sent it back, and then saw the K-Duo.  Some quick measuring suggested that even though big, it could replace the existing drip pot and add the K-cup feature, saving some space. I checked Consumer Reports for ratings on duo-coffee makers.  There were preliminary ratings on two units: the K-Duo and the Cuisinart Coffee Center.  The K-Duo was rated slightly higher then the Cuisinart.  I thought, making drip coffee is not rocket science, all you need is really hot water (195 degrees), where as K-cup technology seemed a bit more involved.  That tipped the scales toward Keurig.  It had a large footprint but I thought it would fit without the existing drip coffee maker.  So I ordered it and wrapped it for Christmas. We opened the box and set the Keurig on the counter.  It was indeed big.  It had a plethora of features, mostly needed because the unit used a single large reservoir to feed both the drip brewer and the K-cup side.  After cleaning the unit as per directions, I made a K-cup of D/D Columbian.  It was okay, but didn’t seem as hot as it should be.  I set up the brewer for the next morning.  When I activated the controls, everything worked as expected (the controls are rather slick.  I liked them).  Again, with the addition of cream, the coffee seamed on the edge of warm, not hot. Over the next two mornings I measured the temperature of the coffee just after the machine said it had finished brewing.  According to Consumer Reports the temperature should have been 195 degrees or more for up to six minutes after the brew cycle ended.  I measured the coffee’s temperature with both an instant read thermometer and a candy maker’s thermometer and never got a reading above 165 degrees.  Because Consumer Reports said the K-Duo had met their testing requirements in the lab, I could only conclude that the unit I had was somehow defective and I returned it.  This may (probably will) not be your experience, but after so much hassle, I ordered the Cuisinart.  (See that review also.)"
"We bought this back in November 20th. We loved this coffee maker; it worked great and brewed fast.However, it recently stopped working during the middle of a brewer and will NOT turn back on. We have reached out to Keurgi directly and really have been little to no help. I was live chatting with them, explaining the situation and the issue provided the serial number for them to turn around and say I need to talk to someone on the phone. I'm not sure how that is really going to change my answer. They asked me over and over again the following items:1) Unplug your brewer, wait 30 seconds, then plug it back in and turn the power on.2) Try a different appliance in the same outlet to see if the outlet is still working.3) Ensure your GFI outlet hasn't been tripped.4) Cleaning the product. (I tried cleaning it but, I can only clean so much when it won't turn on.5) This small appliance is the only one in this particular outlet in our house.I kept repeating myself, saying that all the items had been tried and the coffee maker was showing no signs of life. It will not turn back on.Like I said, we really like it and would just like an exchange."
"I have never wrote a review but always read MANY before new purchases. On this particular purchase I didn't read the reviews because I had alread had the previous versions of this pot, and loved it.  Kicking myself now!!Ugh, this coffee pot isn't worth the time or money. The pod side is fine but they have single makers for that purpose. The coffee pot side is the problem. I feel it never really makes a FULL pot of coffee it always is a few ounces short. But the biggest problem is a defect in the design of the spout. We are unable to pour without pouring a ton on the counter. It spills all over while your trying to fill your cup. I'm not talking about a few lil drops, It all over counter and even down the counters sometimes! I know you're thinking,  I'M doing something wrong...I'm not!!  My husband and I had a whole conversation yesterday morning about if he could pour it without making a mess..he agreed NO!!  Insane how that got through product testing. Between it not actually making 12 cups and how much we spill, I'd say each pot only gives us 1/2 pot at best!Most frustrating! I would try a different pot!!!"
"K-cup side works as expected but when you try to make 12 cups in coffee pot it only makes 10 cups, even when you’re press 12 cups, was very disappointing"
"Works well, however it only gives you 3 cup (8-10-12) sizes."
"The coffee maker works great except for the carafe. It leaks everytime you pour it, dumping coffee all over the counter. Very annoying for the price of the machine."
"Between work and home, I've owned 4 Keurig machines and have yet to have one last two years.  The last  machine I bought was a K60 Duo, which worked okay until the upper needle bent.  It's made of plactic when it should be made of metal and is not easy to replace even if you can find the part.  Talking to Keurig customer service means your call is transferred to South America where my call was usually dropped after two to three minutes.  It was difficult to understand the customer service rep, even though I speak Spanish, and he offered no real help.  If you buy this model, get the service contract and expect to replace the machine in about two years.  My next machine is probably going to be a Cuisinart, they have to be better made than Keurig.  Either that, or I'm going to give up on K pods."
"Loved it, for the few days it actually powered on."
I was hoping for better based on the great reviews. I set the thing up to brew at 4:30 am. After 45 minutes it shut itself off and that wasn't the only time it did it. The book says the burner will stay on for 2 hours and for the most part it does. I guess it's in a bad moodsometimes. The carafe is not designed well. No matter how quickly or slowly I pour it dribbles quite a lot. I have to keep a couple paper towels on the coffee bar to catch all the coffee that runs down on surface tension. If something happens to this machine I really can't say that I would buy it again.
"The unit was purchase in April 2024. We received unit in excellent condition and it worked great to start out with. then a problem started. It would tell us to add water when it was 3/4 to full. We would unplug the unit and reset it and finally get it to work. This happen aprox 6 to 10 times between April and today, 7/20/2024. I could not get the thing to work because of the add water message. I contacted the manufacture as the instructions indicated. NO SOLUTION, However the chat person turned me over to a technician that would help me for a charge. For something only 4 months old and $140.00 I am not happy!"
"This is our third Keurig in about 7 years, but we do/did use them a lot. With that said, we preferred previous models over this one. We went with the Duo this time after our Elite finally passed on because of the dual functionality. Makes a good cup of coffee, but this unit does not get the coffee very hot. One of the reasons we replaced the Elite was because it no longer got our coffee as hot as it once did. Coffee from the Duo is hotter, but it is nowhere near as hot as what came out of the Elite in its first two years of service. Does not matter if it is a single cup from a pod or a pot from the basket, the heat leaves a lot to be desired.Finally, though there is a place for a filter holder in the water reservoir, it does not come with one. Each Keurig we have gotten in the past came with both a holder and filter. At first I thought it was a mistake, but this seems to be a thing now. Keurig expects you to buy one separately. While it may not be a requirement for use, it can make a difference in the taste of coffee and most certainly helps with the health of the unit. I could not use the filter holders from our previous Keurigs since they were of different sizes. Where as those holders were around eight inches or so, the Duo requires the shorter, four inch model. I had no choice but to buy a new one. So, if you prefer the use of filters, be sure to keep in mind you will have to purchase the holder and a filter or two separately when placing an order for the Duo.Overall, the Duo is okay, but after a week of having it, we miss our retired Keurigs."
"I couldn't wait to get my new coffee pot!The first week it was fine but in the second week I'm not sure what happened but I had water and grinds all over the place.I thought maybe that was just a fluke and maybe I did something wrong but then couple days later I made another cup and when I opened the top I noticed there was water inside the hole of the K-Cup.Also, now every time I go to make a cup I hear a sizzling sound. Not good, I know.Of course it's past its window to return it but it's my fault I should have returned it with the first red flag. So I will wait to see what happens... hopefully it won't get any worse because right now it's usable but I'm still disappointed, I thought it would be made much better.Maybe it's just mine... who knows..."
"I thought going with Keurig was a safe bet.Not so much.The basket for the brew side is small and when you do a large pot, it fills up higher than the filter and then you get grounds.We have tried several brands of pods and too many times we wind up with grounds in the cup."
"We really enjoyed this coffee maker. We didn’t use it a lot and we took very good care of it. This morning a light flickered a couple of times when we plugged it in, then nothing. We purchased this coffee maker in 2023, it was costly and now it is out of warranty. Sadly, we are not able to talk to anyone at Keurig other than people who are at a call center and, although very polite and persistent, are scripted. They were very nice but they could offer no suggestions on how to fix it. They said the device is defective and would offer us half price to purchase another one. My question is why would we want to purchase another one at any price if there is no way to repair a new one if it quit working? Very disappointed."
"I have had this coffee maker for a little over a month now. My wife is a K-cup person, while I prefer old-fashioned drip coffee. This fit the bill nicely to meet both our needs. I had read about the issue some people experienced when pouring coffee from the carafe, and coffee running down from under the lip of the pour spout, but didn't think much of it.For the first month everything was perfect. She made hers, I made mine. But then over the past few days my carafe started making a mess on the counter every time I poured a cup. I thought maybe it was a fluke, but much to my disappointment I discovered it was happening every time. Keep in mind, I have NOT placed the carafe in my dishwasher and only washed it by hand this entire time. I also only make one small pot per day, so it's not like I'm wearing it out prematurely.This is a legitimate issue that Keurig needs to address and resolve. I plan to look for a replacement carafe to use in the meantime. If I can't find one, it's going back and I'll revert to two coffeemakers on the counter again.UPDATE: I found a great replacement here on Amazon from CUPALL: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NM1PPVM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsThis universal carafe came with different lid attachments and fits the Duo perfectly. Best of all, no more drips!"
"Pros: It brews coffee.Cons:1. The carafe dribbles coffee everywhere no matter how fast or slowly you pour it. Got a replacement carafe and it dribbles, too. Have to pour coffee over the sink.2. You have to press 4 buttons to start a cup or pot of coffee (other brands, you press 1 button).3. If you remove and fill up the reservoir on the back, but you forget there is leftover coffee in the coffee pot, it overflows (as opposed to regular coffee makers where you pour the water from the carafe itself, so you know it’s empty).4. If it goes off and you want to turn the heating element back on, you have to turn the machine back on and then hold the carafe button for 5 seconds. (Others, you just press brew and walk away.)5. It takes 3 whole minutes to brew one cup. Soooo slow when you’re trying to make a quick cup and get back to whatever you were doing.6. The k-cup side is a little taller than the carafe side, so if you’re right handed, you have to make sure to lift your scoop of coffee waaaay up and over the right side to get it in the filter on the other side when you’re loading it up. We keep accidentally hitting it and spilling coffee everywhere.Some of these things don’t seem like a big deal, but they are annoying AF and they make my husband and me hate this coffee maker. Just terribly designed and not efficient nor convenient."
"We knew our old coffee maker was getting old and were ready to replace it before it died. We were pleasantly surprised at how much better this maker is!PROS1 - HOT COFFEE! My coffee is never hot enough.  This coffee I had to let sit a minute before I could drink it.2 - great flavor! So much better than my old pot, despite regular cleaning.3 - fast coffee! I thought you had to pick great flavor or fast coffee. Turns out you don't.4 - the pod option.  We make coffee by the pot but it's so nice to brew a quick cup! We use the reusable pods which have come a long way in the last couple of years.CONS1 - it drips when you pour it.  I know, pour slowly.  Or pour super fast.  I can keep any pot from dripping except this one, you have to pour over the sink, not even over the counter with a quick wipe up.  It is annoying at 5am.2 - you have to push 4 buttons to make coffee:  POWER - SELECT POT - SELECT NUMBER OF CUPS - START.  You get used to it, but would be nice if it remembered, seems like less of a problem now than at 5am lolOverall, yes, go for it.  The inconveniences are quickly forgotten with that first sip.Addendum:. The dripping coffee is a big deal.  More than a tablespoon or two goes into the sink every morning. Hope they fix this problem. Would not buy again, but will probably stick with what we have for now. Dropping to 3 stars for the mess. Buyer beware."
"The day we received our coffeemaker, we immediately set it up and tried to brew some coffee.  The pod side worked fine, no issues.  The carafe side, however, never would even begin to brew a pot,  it worked to put water through to initially clean it, but would not start brewing again.  I called Keurig and got a rep that I could simply not understand.  I explained what we had purchased and what our issue was and she kept going on about the K-pod side, she never seemed to understand that the machine was also supposed to make a full pot.  After several tries and explanations, she said she needed the serial number and told me to turn the machine upside down to get the number from the bottom. I explained it was full of water and coffee grounds and that I still had the box so could get it from the box, but that was not good enough, I had to turn the machine upside down to get the number from the machine.  I gave her the number from the box and that was fine after all.  She then started to give me return instructions which included taking pictures and getting them verified and then getting permission to return it.  We would have to ship it back and then after they received the product and inspected it, they would, theoretically, send a different one back.  I received the e-mail with the instructions and started to try to comply with them all and decided it wasn't worth the time effort and money to return it to maybe get a different one in return.  We kept messing with it and it finally started brewing, at least, partial pots, some times it will brew 10-12 cups and sometimes it will brew 6-8 cups, all at the same 12 cup setting.  Lastly, the pods taste like you expect pods to taste, the carafe side has almost NO taste.  I use the same amount of ground coffee as I put in my old Cuisinart coffeemaker and it is almost tasteless, even increasing the amount of grounds and grinding it finer makes no difference in the flavor.  I am truly sorry I ever even considered buying this and would NEVER buy another one, our old Cuisinart was a much better coffeemaker and I am not impressed with the price of K-pods, 12 cups, of the lesser expensive pods, costs as much as a bag of Starbucks Sumatra beans."
"This is not worth the plastic it is made from. I purchased this thing for work. you fill the reservoir to the 12 cup mark to make a pot of coffee and it stops before completing it's brew due to ""add water"" warning. The coffee will not stay warm. once brewed it is as hot as it will get. the hot plate shuts of randomly. Even if the hotplate is on, the coffee does not stay warm and we have to microwave a cup to rewarm it. The design of the coffee pot is horrible! the handle is flimsy and should you try to pour a cup with any speed coffee overflows due to a bad design.The Kcup works as it should. That is the only reason it gets 2 stars!"
"We liked this machine at first and had no issues with it, would have preferred to have a setting for the carafe where you could brew a strong cup but we managed. 2 years later the machine would over dispense water and created a mess. Followed tutorials on how to reset the machine and after 2 days it started dispensing cold water. We can no longer brew a cup, get ready for the day and come back down due to it being unreliable. In our view it isn't built to last."
We have bought 2 of these since 2022.  Both units only last 10 months with being used 4-5 times a week.  Disappointing for the price.
"I got this for our office, the dual feature is nice but if you have low cabinets it’s a pain to pull out. My biggest concern is the coffee pot itself is a messy pour, I am cleaning up coffee up multiple times a day."
"I had Kerurig’s first attempt at a brewer with carafe. It wasn’t great for the carafe, but the individual brew was awesome & had great setting features. I replaced it with this because my previous one pin that punctured the pod broke. I’m familiar with & enjoy Keurigs is what I’m saying. Anyways, I digress…1) I don’t like that the tank is located on the back of the device. It’s kinda bulky to pull it out away from the wall every time it needs filled. It just takes up a significantly larger space on my counter than my previous model.2) I also dislike the fact there are missing features my previous model had. Namely I miss the temperature control setting. I like my coffee pretty hot. You can’t adjust for that on this model.The carafe side is better than the previous model. It brews an okay pot of coffee I guess. But truthfully, I think I’d almost rather just have a smaller single brewer & use my french press or something. It’s not really worth having this huge thing on the counter. I doubt I keep it very long. There’s so many other brewers with more features for the same price point."
"I was excited to get this but this model, but it lacks filters and is difficult to clean the water reservoir.  You must use a Philip's head screwdriver to remove the container for cleaning.  I have to use much more coffee than my other side by side that finally died, and unless I double the amount of coffee and hit the strong button it tastes very weak.  I use Folgers coffee or grind my own beans if I buy another brand.  I do not know if the fact that I use Folgers half coffee/half decaffeinated brand has anything to do with the weak taste.  Other than that it looks good, fits under the counter space and is fast in brewing time.  Sounds a little noisy when it heats up too.  I think next coffee purchase will be regular coffee and see if that improves the weak taste."
"I love the coffee system and use it for coffee, tea, pods, hot water, etc.  I am VERY unhappy with the karafe.  Almost immediately after purchasing this system last year, the pot began to leak.  Keurig replaced it.  This system is in our winter home.  We left for the winter. Arriving back in the fall, the new pot began to leak.  After much communication and first refusing, they replaced it again.Guess what.Yes, a few months later...It's leaking again.You'd think they would come up with a new design for the karafe. OBVIOUSLY, the glue that holds the glass and plastic together is faulty.  We hand wash the pot. It's never put in the dish washer.  Next system will definitely NOT be a Keurig.  They don't know how to solve problems IMHO.If you buy this system, don't trust it.  Pour your coffee over the kitchen sink."
"Well, in short, don't waste your money.As a few have stated before, Keurig won't really do much for you except give you another soon to break unit.The long story is thus:Wife buys unit #1. Carafe spills down the side when pouring. Contacted Keurig and they sent another pot that does the same thing. Also when using single cup, the pump motor runs and pours water all over the place when K-Cup lid is up and when its down pumps the tepid water into your cup. Nothing like a half cup of luke warm coffee before the heating cycle even begins. Again, Keurig did nothing but send another unit out.Carafe is same same and just as messy. After 3 months the brewing cycle only produces partial pots and the K-Cup side was leaking again. This time they said they wouldn't send out another unit.So the wife has me buy another one, this time from Amazon. All the same problems all within 2-3 months. I went back to my $8 Mr.Coffee pot because its soup simple and works and I have never had 1 problem with it.With as many Keurig models as they have you would think the pots are interchangeable and that they might actually try to address the known issues. They don't and they won't.Consider yourself warned if you buy this turd."
"It’s fine, just a couple of annoying things… it doesn’t seem real intuitive. When I start a pot in the a.m., it’s not self explanatory, and I wonder sometimes if I got it right….i don’t know until I can hear the water heating up. But my main gripe is that you have to be REAL careful when pouring from the carafe…go slower than you want to, or you’ll have a trail of liquid dripping down the front of the carafe onto the floor!"
The convenience of the coffee maker with the single cup/carafe is great but the coffee isn't very strong.  We had the silver carafe version which seemed to make stronger coffee but upgraded to this because it has a burner to keep the carafe warmer.  I thought the strong button would be for both sides but I understand from other reviews that it's only the single cup side.  Bummed that I can't get stronger coffee (and I don't like it super strong) but this is pretty weak.
"I ordered the Keurig in 2020 and bought the insurance plan. Literally 4 days before the plan expired, the coffee maker just stopped working. I sent it in and was refunded. I bought the same machine, used it not quite 2 months and now this new one has stopped working."
"This was my 5th Keurig unit. The first one I bought lasted 5 years and is still in use. This one died after two. Three others are still operational. Perhaps quality control has dropped. I may look at other units, but still believe Keurig is the best out there."
If you want to brew a full pot it will not. 12 cups of water in the reservoir will only get you a 10 - 11 cup pot. There is always water left in the reservoir. My Aunt has one also. It does the same thing
We love the dual function being able to brew a pot or just a cup. The k cup side works great so far. The carafe dribbles all over the counter. If you pour too slow it dribbles. If you pour too fast it dribbles. Very seldom do you find the sweet spot.A lot of reviews stated this fact. I figured surely they had corrected this flaw. WRONG!!!This problem definitely needs to be corrected. It’s a waste of coffee. It’s a mess that has to be cleaned up. Plus it’s extremely aggravating. I will NOT buy another one till this problem is fixed!
"The coffee maker works as it should. You have to pour the coffee extremely slow, or you'll dribble large amounts of coffee on the countertop. The pouring spout on top of the pot needs to be redesigned.  Have a couple of paper towels available."
"I really like this coffee maker and it hasn't given us any problems. Then why only 3 stars? I have 3 complaints/suggestions about this coffee maker.1. The water reservoir isn't big enough. If I fill it up and make a full pot of coffee, there is water left, but if I try and use a pod, it says I need to add water. So it's not big enough to contain enough water for 1 pot and 1 12oz cup. The same is true in reverse. If I fill it, make 1 cup using a K-cup and then want to make a pot of coffee, it tells me I need to add water.2. Once your pot is made, it stays on for 2 hours and then goes off. I like my coffee HOT, and I may want coffee more than 2 hours after it was initially made, especially if it's set to go off at 6 and maybe I decide to sleep in and get up at 7:30. 30 minutes later it goes off and there isn't an easy way to get the burner back on.3. The auto timer is a pain in the you-know-what to set and turn on.  Half the time I set it for a different time, it doesn't work. When I do get it set, to turn it on you have to press Power, then Auto, then Brew, then power.  That's just kind of stupid."
The Keurig Duo brewer itself is awesome but the carafe is terrible. You literally cannot pour a cup of coffee without it draining all over the counter. Did they test this thing?
"Well, I wanted this machine to be amazing and it was far from it. It is the worst ever at making an actual pot of coffee. No matter now few grounds are used it overflows the basket every single time. This results in coffee filled with grounds and a huge mess in and around the basket, lid, etc that’s near impossible to clean up. I should have immediately returned it, but the first few pots I thought it must be me doing something wrong. Nope. It works fine for single K cups, but if that’s all I wanted I wouldn’t have purchased this and could have saved myself some grief and $. I would give it less than 2 stars but it can make a K-cup so I guess that’s something?"
"Makes good coffee - and love the single serve option.  I have purchased 4 Keurig duo's over the past two years - and so far - they all have this same issue to one degree or another.  On the carafe I have now, I've learned how to pour with fewer drips onto the counter.  Not easy -but doable.  A Christmas gift I purchased for my daughter - the carafe is horrendous.  I tried everything - and coffee just poured out all over the counter.  Great gift!!!  Ordered a replacement carafe- so we'll see how that one works.  Who is engineering this carafe?  Keurig - you'd better do better with this one - or you're going to lose a lot of customers!!!!  Provide a carafe that doesn't drip coffee all over the counter.  Ingenious!!!"
"I purchased this on 8/11/2020.  Although I am not a fan of Keurig cup coffee in general I wanted the K-cup feature for guests who do.  I gave it 4* for coffee flavor and 5* for temperature as the carafe coffee is very good and the K-cup coffee leaves something to be desired almost no matter what cups you use.  A marketing gimmick and not an honest attempt at making quality coffee.  The water reservoir is narrow and situated at the back therefore a bit clumsy.  It can be pulled up and out from the front by grasping the ends of the reservoir and filled on the counter and then dropped back in which is my normal approach.  Trying to fill it in place from your Britta pitcher runs a fair risk of pouring water down the wall behind.  It has a timer but once set it does not show the brew time, it reverts back to the clock.  A small clock icon appears to indicate that it is in timed mode but you can not conveniently verify the actual brew time without upsetting the entire cycle.  The controls consist of a sequence of blinking lights requesting a decision from you regarding carafe or K-cup, number of ounces, etc.  The machine came with almost no instructions as to how to set it for delayed brewing so the first time you try to set up for timed brew most likely you will end up with a pot of coffee when you don't want it, like immediately.  Not a fan of the controls - too many blinking lights.  The machine is smart enough to dispense specifically requested volumes of water and alerts when water is needed.  Also it uses one reservoir for both carafe and K-cup functions which is a good setup from my perspective.  Unfortunately, for a near $200 price tag you apparently can't buy a carafe that doesn't drip on the counter when you pour your coffee.  The more full the carafe the more likely that it will drip.  Ridiculous.  No excuse for this fundamental error."
"Bought a Keurig Duo to get updated after using Mr Coffee for a lot or years(multiple units for over 40 years). What a waste of money! Now it’s no real bad when making a single cup but when it comes to making a 12 cup pot of coffee, that’s where the problem begins. This carafe is useless, every time you try and pour a cup of coffee it dribbles onto counter top!!! I went online to see if anyone had the same problem, 100’s if not 1000,s complaining of this with some stating how to fix(which I tried but failed) some returned for new carafe multiple times. What the hell, no Keurig rocket scientist can’t figure out hot to make a carafe that don’t leak??? Amazing!!!Anyway I came upon this article that someone posted that gave a part # for a Mr Coffee Carafe,  low and behold it works like a charm 👍  So I paid good money for I thought was a great coffee maker and got tooken to the cleaners! So I do like the single cup at times if I had to do over again, I would buy a Keurig single cup machine and buy a New Mr Coffee 12 machine and call it good! 12 cup is grate for company. So cost was at least $30.00 more but the problem is solvedKeurig rocket scientist just go get a Mr Coffee Carafe PLD12-RB Series with Black Handle and see if you can figure out how to copy it. Amazing we have to put up with this crazy stuff. Fix it correctly since there are so many complaints about this and BTW YOU CAN REFUND $30.00 since that is what it took to fix it.As for any one else buying this Keurig Duo stay away and jus maybe get the single cup and 12 cup Mr coffee Carafe 👎"
"Did not last even 2 years.  Once on, pushed on “cup”  and “8” ounce and it is just frozen. Pot option will not work either.  I called Keurig hotline, difficult to understand, after troubleshooting for 20 minutes, they tried to sell me a new one, no thanks.  Disappointing."
"If I was merely rating features and capabilities this would definitely warrant five stars. I love the versatility of using pods on those morning when running out the door or brewing a large pot when I'm not. However, the totality of the rating must include the carafe. It is virtually impossible to pour a cup of coffee from the carafe without dribbling anywhere from a few drops to several ounces on the counter. The design of the plastic spout and opening are flawed.  I am amazed this made it through quality control at Keurig. This is not just a one off issue either judging from the other reviews and the fact other companies have developed replacement carafes without the design flaw. Unless they update the design, be prepared to spend another $25 for a carafe that pours flawlessly so you can truly enjoy all the features."
"This was “ok” but I will not purchase again. The coffee is not hot enough and it automatically cuts off at 2 hours. Also since it does not have water filters, I end up having to put more scoops of coffee than what I do for other coffee makers."
"I will start with the 2 things I like: this fits under the cabinet and you can raise the lid to fill the brew basket without pulling out the coffee maker. I also like being able to fill the water tank - mine is right next to the sink and I have a faucet with a pull out hose so that is easy. Here's what I don't like: the coffee from the carafe is too weak. Unlike your above chart the ""strong"" button only works for coffee pods. In order to make decent coffee I have to use extra scoops of ground or it is like the proverbial dishwater. In addition it ""overfills"" when using the carafe. If I am making 6 cups it fills almost to the 8 cup mark on the carafe, Also the glass carafe is stained brown in spite of hand washing - because it apparently is not dishwasher safe! Very disappointed and sorry I did not buy another Cusinart..."
"Bought 23 Jan. 2023.From day 1, the coffee pot leaked  coffee from spout being poured.Called Keurig company and had pot replaced, same thing, coffee leaked from spout. Pouring coffee was a clean up job every cup.15 Nov. 2024 coffee maker quit working altogether. Trash"
"I've had this machine twice now. The first one I purchased lasted me a little over a year. I turned it on like normal and received a message to Add Water. I removed the water reservoir (full) dumped the water put it back and refilled the water. Same error message ""Add Water"". I contacted Kuerig and unfortunately my machine was no longer under warranty so they had me replace the water reservoir to see if that would fix the issue (it did not). I bought a new machine through Amazon, and it had been working great until yesterday when ""Add Water"" came on AGAIN. I was so sad. I checked my purchase date and called Keurig right away went through some trouble shooting steps and it did not fix the issue was advised my machine is under warranty, so a replacement is on the way. After 2 machines I'm not sure I will be buying this model again."
"The is absolutely no way to brew a good, strong cup of coffee with either the carafe or the pods.  If I put my usual amount of hrounds in the basket, I get grounds in my coffee and some of the grounds in the filter basket are still dry. I am returning and already bought another coffeemaker."
"Purchased this Duo Keurig Dec 28, 2023. This coffee maker is practically new. Anyways i have made hundreds of  k-cups. I attempted to make a pot of coffee, it started to work then stopped. I scanned the barcode in the back and attempted to reset the Keurig. It did not work. I called the manufacturer told them about the problem, and they agreed to send me a new one. Folks be sure to register your Keurig!"
"I got this to replace another brand duo coffee maker that stopped keeping the coffee warm on the warming plate. This makes good coffee and works as it should on the single cup and on the full pot sides. The first thing that I noticed when unpacking it was the extremely cheap feeling plastic that it is made of. Other Keurigs and all other brands that I have used are made from thick, substantial feeling plastic. This seems very thin and very brittle. Why would Keurig not make it from the same material? The biggest problem is, like others have said, you cannot pour from a full pot without it leaking and wasting coffee."
"The pot always leaks went pouring, however much worse is that the machine leaks intermittently really badly. I had to put the machine into a tray.  I cleaned it and sometimes it helps, but not always. I am not sure how or where it’s leaking from. I believe that it’s related to the drip tube.Also many times the selected different brew quantities  are not predictable. I might get a half pot, or nothing.  Programming the thing sometimes doesn’t result in starting for breakfast.I end up unplugging it and starting over. This helps."
"The carafe leaked around the seal when I first got this. I dealt with it for a month or so thinking I had done something wrong. Keurig sent me a new one. The second, lasted about a month and started leaking too. It’s super frustrating."
"I'm not real happy with this Keurig Coffee Maker. I spent a lot of money for it and I thought it would be nice, but it's not really made that well.  The programmable timer went out right away, so you couldn't have coffee the next morning automatically. Went thru a hellish time getting a replacement  I really would never buy another Keurig.  I'll stick with another brand"
The only thing I dislike is the decanter does NOT keep the coffee hot!
"Was a great coffee machine however it only lasted 19 month of normal use. Heating element and pump stopped working, customer service had not options but to try and sell me a new unit as warranty is for only 12 months."
The actual machine is really good. It has worked perfectly for over a year. When I first got the coffee maker I was beginning to think at 57 I was losing my morning motor skills. I couldn’t pour a cup of coffee without it dribbling all over the counter for the life of me. I had to buy a plastic mat for under the coffee maker as my inability to pour a cup of coffee without it spilling all over the counter was staining our light granite counter top. If you pour your first cup or two at about 20% of the speed most people would pour a cup of coffee you might be able to get a cup without making a mess. I’m talking about 15-20 seconds for an 8 ounce cup. As it empties it gets better.  Finally at one point my wife sent me a Tik Tok of somebody else lamenting about how miserable this thing is to pour. I don't understand how they could get this so wrong. As it is I live with the thing but I won’t be sad if it breaks.
"Overall I like this machine, or the idea of it at least.The carafe leaks horribly when pouring regardless of all the different ways we try to adjust. It’s frustrating, especially when you buy a brand you expect better quality from."
Performance of the coffee make is great the temperature is nice and hot. The only problem is the carafe leaks coffee while pouring coffee in the cup. I have to put down a paper towel to catch the coffee.
"Overall this is pretty good as far as making coffee.  However, everytime I pour into my cup the carafe dribbles coffee onto the counter.  It makes no difference how fast or how slow  you pour it still dribble.  In addition it very difficult to clean the inside of the karafe.  Maybe I'm missing something in the simple task of making coffee in this thing.  If so, educate me."
I like that you can do either size but it’s a guessing game of what you need to push and when you need to push the on button again. The water reservoir is not very big either so you have to refill often. It would probably be fine for just a couple people. I am always having to try to walk those using it through the steps to make it work and it seems to only end up working well half the time without trying a few times. We use it in a group setting and it hasn’t been good for us - I thought we just needed time to learn it better but I wish I had returned it when the return window was still open.
"UPDATE 11/17/24:We’ve officially given up and bought a $30 Mr. Coffee maker. What a waste of $160 on the other one! Fingers crossed we can get $5 for it at a garage sale next month—though we’ll be sure to warn the buyer (if there is one) about the quality issues.UPDATED REVIEW:I regretfully have to downgrade my review from 3 stars to 1 star. DO NOT BUY. Although Keurig did send us a replacement carafe, it started leaking again after just one week of use. The brewing issue has also worsened: when selecting to brew 10 cups, we’re lucky to get 6, even after thoroughly cleaning the machine. Unfortunately, we are past the return window for Amazon and are now stuck with this poorly functioning product (and the money we sunk into it). I’m disappointed that a company like Keurig would release something with such design flaws. Again, DO NOT BUY.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Keurig K-Duo Single Serve K-Cup Pod & Carafe Coffee Maker (Gen 1) Review:Overall, the K-Duo is ok, with its best features being its sleek look, style, and ease of use. However, there are two main issues:Water Loss in Carafe Mode: When brewing with the carafe, around 20% of the water is lost. For instance, selecting 10 cups consistently yields only 8 cups, and adjusting settings didn’t improve the output.Poor Carafe Design: The carafe tends to leak when pouring, causing spills. The only way to avoid this is to pour slowly, which can be frustrating."
"Purchased 11/30/22, died 7/15/24 of electronics failureNow trash due to lack of availability of internal parts.Not what I expected of Keurig - and this was #3; #2 is back in service."
This is my second Keurig Duo.  They work well for about a year and a half then they don’t.  Good machine - I just wish it lasted longer.
"Buyer beware.  I suppose I should have commented about this coffee maker sooner.  I bought this unit July 2022 for my husbands birthday.  I should have returned it immediately, as the coffee maker didn't brew 12 cups as advertised on the first run. All we got out of this is 10 cups.  I have had coffee somehow ooze out of the bottom of the unit at times. Sometimes the water comes out during brewing so hard that the coffee grinds go everywhere around the dispenser and into the coffee pot itself.  This unit says it is programmable, however, it has to be programmed on a daily basis as it has no memory feature to program.  Had this unit for approx. 1 yr and a week when it finally died with water leaking all over the counter.  Called Keurig and they gave us a new one with the condition that this cannot be returned if the replacement is faulty.  Had the second one for about 1 year 2 weeks when this one died on October 16th 2024!!  This time it was the control area that made crunchy noises, single cup malfunctioned pouring out 16 oz. of water for an 8 oz. cup and the regular carafe would not fill with any water to brew.  This is the last time I will purchase a Keurig as I think there is no Quality Control on these units.  For the price point you would think they would manufacture a coffee maker that will last years which in our experience both units lasted a wee bit over a year."
"The coffee looks like you get the best of both worlds right. We have owned previous brands for years and loved them. We opted for this option because it gave you the best of both worlds. Well this model is disappointing to say the least Ann’s not worth the money. The reservoir when low on water stops the cycle and does not pick back up brewing when water is added like other models we previously owned, leaving you with a half filled pot or cup. When pouring coffee out of the pot into your favorite cup you have to be careful not to spill your coffee due to the poorly designed spout. Do yourself a favor and purchase a regular coffee maker and don’t waste your money onthis machine."
Carafe leaks when you pour.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This coffee maker is almost perfect, except it leaks when you pour your coffee and the sound it makes when brewing can definitely startle you. If you can live with that, it’s a great coffee maker. I complained  to the company. Telling them that it leaks when I pour my coffee after taking photos and sending the information required instead of just sending me a new pot, they send me an entirely new system which surprisingly leaks. So it’s great but not. I am adding to this review because by accident I broke the coffee carafe and had to purchase another check out the video. I just added here and you will see absolutely no leaks and the price was great."
"Have had A Keurig for years and wanted to have the dual option. Loved this one at 1st compared to a different dual coffee pot I tried. Saw a video when researching this product, it doesn’t take 5 minutes to heat up. It did take a few, but when you hit the power, by the time you get your k-cup and put whatever additional you put in your coffee mug before you start brewing it’s usually ready. Or you can hit start and walk away and when it’s ready it will start brewing.Works fine but a couple issues I would note. You can’t change the temp of the water so if you want a cup be ready to drink it fairly soon after it’s brewed. And I don’t even like my coffee scolding hot. 2nd with the fill tank on the back (which I do like), if the fill tank is low and you don’t notice it, the Keurig will let you hit 12 oz cup and not notify you to add water if there isn’t enough to make 12 ounces and just brew whatever is there. Pics: regular 12oz brew vs what happened to me when I didn’t notice the tank was too low to make 12 ounces. Last issue, no matter what reusable k-cup I find, it still doesn’t close smoothly."
I am giving it two stars because I am now on my third unit. First one lasted two days and second one lasted a couple months. Manufacturer was very responsive and sent replacements out. First replacement took and week the second took a month. Hopefully the third replacement will be the last.
"The coffee pot works great.  However, after only 4 months, the programming part that sets a delayed start stopped working, making the pot a lot less useful.  Can this be returned?"
"Best I like about this machine overall is the water depository for both pod and carafe in the back.  You do not have to fill up the water by pouring from the carafe in the depository every time.  I like pouring it in from a filter container.  And it won't work unless there is water in it. Pod side of this machine is great.  I enjoy hitting the 12oz and getting a full cup of whatever I am wanting.  Now to the carafe.  When it works it can be good.  Issues:  1-Sometimes does not make the coffee.  I push the 8 cup and get maybe a 1/2 cup and have to turn it off and on again, hit 8 cup again and then it's there.  2-The carafe dribbles when you pour.  I do not know why, it just does and then you have clean your counter.  Minor thing - it would be nice if it beeped when the coffee is done, but not a biggie.  I don't normally not recommend items, but this one I must - at least until they get their carafe side working better."
"I opened my K-Duo  I was so excited and realized no filter or filter case was included :>( , since one was included with a previous one that I purchased, I was ok where is it, nope none.  Also, I think that the coffee pot little flimsy, (ok I'm used to the Mr. Coffee pots how the glass is a little thicker, but hey the whole thing looks good anyway.  Yes, I would buy it again, except I would order the filter with it.  I hope you enjoy yours if buy one."
Used the brand in single pod for years and coffee taste was good.  The new dule machine makes terrible tasting coffee. Same pods some filter water but coffee is nasty like colored water with no flavor. The stong button doesn't make it any better. Can never make a pot of coffee that tastes good at all. Hopefully I can return for refund. The machine works but just makes lousy coffee.
Heating element on carafe side stopped working after 11 months. Even after descaling it didn't help. Tried to exchange it and Amazon would only let me contact Keurig customer support. Keurig told me to call a number. When I called there was no human just a bad AI system that kept malfunctioning and basically screaming in my ear. Bought a different brand and it was delivered today. Not impressed with either and I basically just rented a coffee maker for $18/month.
"Okay so I love this coffee maker, and really I can't live without it. But I did buy the cheaper option of getting it secondhand, and it was noted to be 'slightly' scratched, which I didn't mind.BUT when it arrived and I opened the box, all the packaging was wet, and from the smell it had clearly been wet for awhile. I wasn't impressed that I had to boil and bleach it all to be on the safe side as soon as I got it. Whilst washing it, I found that the machine wasn't scratched at all but instead there was a large chunk of plastic cracked and missing from the water holder in the back, so I can't actually fill it to the line at all.You get what you pay for I guess"
"I purchased this machine just over a year ago and, being Keurig, I expected it to last a lot longer than this. While it technically will still make coffee, it doesn't make a consistent amount. I use the 10 oz or 12 oz setting, depending on the size of my mug, but now I never know if I'm going to get a half cup of coffee or if it will overflow - even on the larger size. I've had lots of coffee spilled because of this and, of course, too much water affects the flavor of the coffee. Pretty sure it's too late for a replacement. Disappointed - I've been a loyal Keurig customer for 10+ years."
"This Keurig duo is fantastic except for the carafe. We’ve had it for over 3 months now and cannot get it to pour without spilling. Have tried every angle, every level of fullness, every tip on the internet and nothing works. Keurig support is not helpful at all, directed me back to the FAQ on the website. It’s infuriating enough to want to replace the entire unit. Do not recommend buying if you plan to use the carafe option frequently."
"My 4th replacement worked fine for a couple of months. I was ready to update my review, now this one has also quit. Consistamtly makes 4 cups when I program for 12. Done all the suggested Keurig solutions, nothing wurks. Still makes single cups.  have come to the conclusion this is just a bad implementation of a really good Idea. I know others who have different Keurig dual brewing coffee makers and they work fine. I know of nobody else with a K-duo so I cannot say any of them work consistently. I really wanted this to be a great coffee maker but it is definitely not. I am going back to my old trusty Black and Decker 12 pot coffee maker. The last one lasted over 10 years. I guess I'll give away all the pods I bought or but a different kind of single cup solution. The single cup brewer has worked every time but I don't have room on my counter to keep this for the single cup feature. Very disappointed.Replacement quit brewing 12 cups after 2 months. Received it on March 20 and it quit brewing 12 cups in the first week in May. For us older folks, this may be the Edsel of coffee makers.Old Review 2: So far so good. Coffee brews 12 cups every morning.Old Review: I set it to brew 12 cups at 05:30. The coffee pot (Keurig K-Duo) turns on a 05:00 but does not brew 12 cups. It varies but normally it brews 8 cups, this morning 6 cups, a couple of times 10 cups, and rarely 12 cups. My Keurig envy is fading fast. I'm almost ready to go back to Black & Decker which lasted over 10 years and always brewed 12 cups. Hate to give up the single cup option, but this is not working out. I have contacted Keurig and I may change this review to 4 or 5 stars depending on their response."
"The coffee it makes from the regular pot is fine. The pot itself is not. It will NOT pour without spilling liquid absolutely everywhere. Unusable pot. The k-cup side is probably fine if you actually use k-cups, but if you get the refillable filter to use your own coffee. Just don't. It's awful. I'm going to get me a different maker personally."
"I have always used a 12 cup traditional coffee brewer, so I felt like I upgraded when I bought a single cup style. Turns out, I’m not a single cup gal. So, I gave this one a try and I’m glad I did. I LOVE the cold brew and over ice functions for an afternoon treat, and the classic or rich styles for the mornings. It has a delay brew function, which I was missing with the single cup brewer I had chosen. This one looks nice in our kitchen. It’s definitely an upgrade to the old traditional coffee pot I had. I love the drip stop function so I can pour while it’s still brewing. It’s a 12 cup capacity, but I can brew various sizes easily. I feel it’s a good value for the multi functions it has, and good quality but only time will tell on that. You can choose to use #4 cone filters, or just the built in filter, but I always use a paper filter so it is an easier cleanup. Also, fine grounds will end up in your cup without the paper filter. Due to reading some reviews about a weird taste, I washed the parts extra well before using and I don’t taste anything other than my coffee. My single cup version had a built in milk frother, so I’m missing that on this guy. But it is an option on a different model when you click to order. At this time, i recommend this Ninja productEdit to original review:  if you put the recommended scoops of coffee grounds in for a full carafe, the water going through the grounds causes them to overflow and there will be coffee grounds coming out around the edge and into your coffee. So, you have to go with less coffee grounds. I’m still trying to work this out since I rarely need a full carafe of coffee. I usually just brew enough for myself, but we had company for breakfast and it made a mess to add the recommended coffee grounds for the full carafe. I’m disappointed!Another edit: i absolutely do not recommend this anymore. After it overflowed coffee grounds again, I started a return and replaced it with a Keurig Duo. I’m so disappointed that Ninja’s product has this flaw. Also, it splatters coffee on the tile backsplash each time I brew. I do not like that! They need to work on this design! You should be able to brew without splatter, and you should be able to brew as recommended without coffee grounds overflowing!"
"The warming plate on the hot delay brew function only activates when you make at least a half carafe. I hate it. I think it’s so that it doesn’t burn a smaller amount of coffee or so if people put their cups or travel mugs directly on the plate it doesn’t melt the cup/mug but even if you can fit your mug under the pot it’s still not warm coffee in a mug so what’s the point…I just want it to brew 18oz of hot coffee directly into the carafe and stay warm until I leave the house so I can pour it in my mug when I’m ready. This doesn’t do that and while you can adjust some warming plate settings like temp and time, I still can’t change it so that it will turn on for an 18oz pot. If I delay brew for just myself it’s either cold or I waste coffee. Not the best for single people, if you live alone, or if you only drink one or two cups of coffee. This is basically designed to only program hot brews for at least two people or a bigger household. Probably better for people who prefer cold brew. I wish I would have known that before I purchased.I DO like the functionality otherwise including the removable water reservoir, the sliding filter, and the measuring spoon on the side of the machine. But doesn’t make up for what I was primarily hoping to use the pot for."
I was expecting a coffee system where I could use my k cup pods as well as ground coffee.Lines on water reservoir does not really help indicate how much coffee you are brewing. Coffee reservoir is clunky and so is top of coffee pot to open and close.
"I would possibly give this coffee maker 5* if it wasn’t for the carafe.  If you would like a really clean carafe you will need to purchase a bottle brush. I have one but it doesn’t fit in the mouth of the carafe. I just ordered one.  This carafe also doesn’t dry in dishwasher or if I hand wash, leave it in strainer for a full day it is still very damp inside.I’m debating if all of this is worth the bother.  I’ll receive my bottle brush this week, I will have just over a week to decide if this maker is worth it. I know I have no solution for drying it out fully."
Makes great coffee but am very disappointed that the black coating on the warmer plate is peeling off after less than 2 months of use. It was too expensive for this to happen already.
"Easy to read instructions.  Have made a pot of coffee and came out very good and nice and hot.  Unfortunately there was no frother attached, or in the box.  I do enjoy using a frother and will see if I can get that attachment.  In regards to the filter, I chose to purchase the paper filters and the manual did shows that it uses a #2 filter which I ordered and used.  The #2 filter fits nicely and easy to clean.  Reason for the 3 stars is because frother missing and cannot comment on the use or functionality of the frother."
I was delighted when my ninja coffee machine arrived but v disappointed to find crack on it and as a result would not work
"The water reservoir smells like plastic and if you let your water sit overnight, then make coffee, it ends up smelling like plastic. I tried white vinegar but didn’t help. Maybe this is why it was on sale. I leave it open on the counter overnight then add water right before I make the coffee. That seems to help, I’m considering sending it back."
Well it’s my first drip coffeeAnd I grinded the grounds using shared Amazon machine in size 16 out of 32The results looks coolI am just not sure it is the way it should be
"Bought this a couple of weeks ago. I liked everything about the CM401 coffee maker except for one issue. A very strong plastic smell. I ran a carafe of water through the brew process 6 times to try and get rid of the smell but no luck. I brewed a cup of coffee and plastic affected the taste. Since I was going to be out of town for a couple of weeks I left the coffee maker out hoping that the smell would diminish. When I got back the smell had greatly dissipated. However, it reappeared when I ran a carafe of water through the machine. I ran another 6 carafes through the machine but the water from the last run still tasted of plastic. I really wanted this coffee maker but the plastic taste and smell is a deal breaker. I called sharkninja to inform them of my experience. I only see a few reviews complaining about the plastic smell and taste so it may be only a few models or a production run that suffer from this defect. Also, I have to wonder why the plastic has such a strong odor."
"Coffee doesn't taste as good as it used to with my older model that did a preheat before it brewed the smaller cups. The heat plate doesn't keep the coffee hot enough. We used to put ice cubes in our cups to cool them down, and now we can drink straight from the pot. My other one had the insulated stainless carraffe so I wasn't worried about a heat plate but I couldn't find an affordable one to replace it. I also miss the flip-up lid in the water reservoir. Not sure why they did away with too. I also do not like that the auto-shut off is a complicated process just to change the length of time it stays on. 2 hours is never long enough when I am up for at least 3 hours before my other half so until I change the settings on it, I have to remember to reset it before I leave for work. And last but not least, what is up with the amount of water that stays in the reservoir? Did they mark the lines on them in the wrong places? Or was this purposely done?"
"will send back if I can't get it to work!I loved my old ninja coffee pot, had it over 4 yrs and then it just stopped working no matter what!Did a search on one close to mine and there was to many bad reviews so seen this one had better reviews and I needed one fast so ordered this one!Like the 12 cup I had better then this 10 cup, the heating plate just shut off when I set it for 4 hours as I was busy doing things and hate having to reheat every cup in the microwaveI came out for second cup and it had shut off and the whole pot was now cold!turned the heating plate back on and put a cup in the microwave, made my cup when I noticed the time was not on it only the amount I brewed so went to reset it, it would just flash the time and then when it shut off the time was gone again and only the 50 oz was listed!!I will be sending this back if I can't get it to work, I want to see the time not how big of pot I made and if it doesn't stay warm there in no reason to even use it!!Very disappointed as I loved everything about my other ninja coffee maker and also order another ninja master prep after having my old one break after many many many yrs of use, love love my new one and make smoothies every day with it!"
"I wanted to replace an older small Cuisinart coffee maker with one that would brew at a higher temperature. After reading and viewing so many reviews that they began to blur in my mind I decided to try the Ninja. I followed the instructions, begin with plain water and that first pot had a definite smell. I made a travel mug sized batch (I really liked being able use a cup or mug rather than the pot). I could taste and smell an off note in the coffee. After a cleaning cycle with a half vinegar mix and some more clean water runs the off taste and odor persisted. If I filled the tank and let it stand over night the water picked up the chemical odar  aroma and taste. I did another round of cleaning cycles but the taint remained.Now I am not as sensitive to some smells as the boss, so I asked to come over and give it sniff. She said from the other end of the kitchen, ""No need, I can smell it from here. Send it back."" So back it goes.Some online searching turned up posts complining about the non-coffee odor or taste, so this is not a unique problem. If it were from some substance left behind in the manufacturing process the repeated cleaning cycles should have eliminated it. It as some suggest, it is sweating or outgassing from the plastic, it is unknowable what it is or how long it will last. It is a defect either way.If you buy one of these and you smell or taste an unpleasant or off note in the coffee, don't waste your time with repeating the cleaning cycle. Return it.I am going to try a different brand."
"I really enjoyed this coffee maker while it lasted. The programmable feature that allowed it to auto-brew in the morning was great, and I loved the frother attachment. Unfortunately, I used it nearly every day and after about 19 months, it stopped brewing. I tried using affresh tablets to clean it, but no luck. Would have given it 5 stars without the functional problems."
"Doesn't dispense all the water regardless of setting. Also glass carafe has been down graded and stains. Washing daily does not help, the glass quality is very poor.  Probably will need to return. This is the 2nd one and both have the same issues."
"This works great and makes good coffee, and has some nice features like being able to select the warming plate temperature and duration, as well as an easy-to-use wake-up time programming mode. Despite my critiques below, this is still the highest quality coffee maker that I've purchased on this site. Others are, without exception, cheap and flimsy compared to the Ninja.However, there are some things to note with regards to hard-programmed portion sizes. At all times, regardless of the coffee being made on the fly or queued by a programmed timer, the machine must be set to a certain size (1 small cup, 1 travel mug, 1 large travel mug, 1 half carafe, 1 full carafe). The first three options presume that you are providing a cup and not using the carafe. Thus, the warming plate will not be turned on. The result is that if you live alone and only want to make, say, 20oz of coffee in the carafe for your morning, the coffee will quickly cool without the warming plate on. In this situation, you are forced to provide an insulated mug in place of the carafe order to retain the warmth, which is a silly way to drink coffee anywhere but in your car. If two people are drinking coffee, the half carafe option is practical, and will activate the warming plate to keep the coffee hot.The workaround to the above mentioned coffee problem is to manually activate the warming plate, but this is only useful if you are awake when the coffee is being prepared, and not expecting to wake up to hot coffee. Personally, I just program a half-carafe of coffee for myself in the morning, of which I drink 16oz and end up throwing away the other 16oz simply because I want the warming plate to activate.As a closing note for the live-alone coffee maker, you cannot outsmart this machine by selecting half-carafe and only filling the reservoir with the example 20oz instead of the greater half-carafe quantity of water. The coffee maker will alarm out before the coffee is finished brewing and sound a very annoying series of beeps and an alarm message to ""add water"".A final critique is in the controls, which are a bit intimidating for first time users. In particular, none of the buttons will work until the power button is pressed. This seems to make sense, but actually is frustrating because of the fact that the only difference between the machine being OFF or ON is that the clock display is at full brightness or half brightness"
"The coffee maker makes good coffee, but the coffee pot glass is thin and breaks easily. We’ve now broken two pots, the second time from using a scrub brush to clean the inside."
"We have had this coffee maker for almost 2 years, using it to brew coffee at least twice daily (morning, afternoon and occasionally evening), and unfortunately I'm on the lookout for a replacement. There are some great features and a few drawbacks that make me hesitant to recommend this machine.First off, it looks beautiful on the countertop. I also like that you can brew so many different sizes and even directly into a travel mug. We also enjoyed the milk frother, which is simple but does the job.Now for a few drawbacks: the first issue I have is that the inside top of the machine where the grounds drawer closes into is constantly getting coated in grounds, adding an extra maintenance step to clean this off regularly. Initially I thought it was because we use fine ground coffee, but even when we used the regular grounds I have noticed the issue. You wouldn't necessarily even know this build up is occurring until you look for it and realize how gross it is wondering how long old grounds have been mixing into your coffee. I have never had this issue with any of the other coffee makers we have owned.The other issue I have I have seen in a few other reviews as well-- the water reservoir backs up and leaks all over the counter from time to time. We initially assumed it was user error and tried to very carefully put the reservoir on each time, but we have still had issues. It has happened more and more frequently now so in addition to cleaning old grounds out, I find I have to mop up water from around and under the coffee maker at least a couple times a week.All of that is too much additional effort for the convenient features this coffee maker offers. I think we will go back to a more basic machine that functions as expected consistently and doesn't require the extra maintenance steps."
"I bought my ninja coffee pot and October 2021. I loved the features, the different brewing options, the built-in frother.  I loved the timer option. It brewed a delicious cup of coffee on any setting. I didn’t love that the keep warm option is only available on  one half a pot or more option. I didn’t love that one year into purchase, the brewing cycle began switching to “Clean “towards the end of brewing. From this point on every time I would brew a multi travel mug, half pot or whole pot, it would switch to the “Clean “option and stop brewing. No matter how many times I cleaned the machine this would occur. It would stop doing this for  one or two months at a time but now I am approaching the 2 1/2 year ownership mark and it is pretty much doing it each brewing cycle. After researching this multiple times for one year, it seems the life expectancy of a ninja coffee pot is only about a year. This brewing malfunction is commonly reported.  I have not been able to find that this has changed with most recent models. I love Ninja products, however I will not be purchasing another ninja coffee pot. I emailed the company multiple times, and was never offered a replacement or any suggestion to fix this problem. For the money that was spent on this machine I was hoping to at least get 3 to 5 years as this is a normal life expectancy of any other coffee pot. I hope this review is helpful. I am not trying to deter from purchasing Ninja products. However, there are many improvements that need to be made on the ninja coffee pot functionality, and life expectancy before I will consider purchasing this again."
Great coffee machine but the whisk was missing from this order.
"I purchased this coffee station in 2021. I really love it and all the things is does. I love the milk frother, the gold mesh filter and the ability to make all sizes of coffee including a single cup. However, this year the water reservoir has started leaking. The leakage is so bad, I have to put a dish towel under the machine. I’m very disappointed in this problem. Additionally, the finish on the heat plate is coming off. I don’t want to purchase another coffee maker, but the water leakage has become serious."
"Really wanted to love this coffee machine, but can't. Carafe opening is impossibly small making it difficult to clean. The water reservoir seldom empties completely, leaving a small amount of water to stagnant and become a magnet for bacteria to develop. I would not buy it again."
It’s a great design but the coffee grounds went through the filter. Not sure I like my coffee with grounds.Great quality other than the filter. The temperature was easy to change and the buttons were as well. Didn’t make much noise except when it first started out but no big deal.The craft could be a little bigger. At just 10 cups I had to make 2 pots for the family.
"Lasted about two years before it finally konked out. Frother only made it about one year. Can’t decide if I think that’s impressive or not, considering our current throw-away culture."
We enjoyed our last ninja coffee maker. This one is not so good. Mainly due to the bizarre water levels versus fluid ounces .
I bought this 18 months ago. Worked good except the drip stop isn’t automatic and if you forget to switch it back over you’re going to have a mess. Didn’t even think to see if it had that feature considering the cost of it. Now the basket fills up and not draining into pot. Like I put the stop drip on but it is not. Very disappointed this only lasted 18 months. I’m a big Ninja brand fan and never had any issues with my other products.
"After reading the reviews I was excited to get this coffee maker, but????? One of the biggest reasons I bought this was to minimize plastic with k cups, . I do not feel the coffee is any better tasting, it is WAY more complicated to brew one cup at a time. It comes in handy if I’m making more than one cup but I find a good bit of slug at the bottom of cup or pot, I’m Very sorry I bought this!!! Considering returning."
"Before purchasing, I read the reviews like everyone else.  With the exception of some reviewers expressing a plastic-type taste, the reviews were very favorable.  I discounted the taste issue thinking is was more of a quirk relative to the taste of certain individuals, besides, what does plastic taste like anyway?To my surprise, the reviewers that wrote about the plastic taste hit it on the mark.  From the first brew to the most current one, the plastic taste is present and strong.  It fact, if I was to characterize it, I would think it tastes like burnt plastic which is present from the first to the last sip.  It's so bothersome to me, that I will be returning this unit."
"Bought in 2022, broke in 2023, Amazon wouldn’t replace… after many coversations got Ninja to replace it. But they said they wouldn’t replace it if it broke again. Here we are in 2024, it broke again. Save your money and just buy a $25 Mr. Coffee pot. I went back to mine that I had before this one, that is 15+ years old still works like new. Ninja is a rip off."
"I bought this coffee maker because Ninja is a good brand and the reviews were outstanding. Well it was too good to be true... I wanted a multifunctional coffee maker and have never had a fancy one like this so I took a leap spent a bunch of money on what I thought would be the perfect coffee maker and was hugely disappointed. I have no idea why this coffee maker has so many great reviews.- First thing I noticed was it smelled and TASTED like plastic. Even after cleaning it, running pot after pot of water and/or vinegar through it. Even after brewing 4 cups of coffee through it, it still tasted and smelled like plastic. I wasted cup after cup of coffee and creamer on this machine. Some plastic smell and taste I figured would be expected straight out of the box brand new, but it's just not going away. And if I can taste it right now, even if it did go away I'm sure the plastic would still be in my cup of coffee, every single part of this machine is plastic!- Second thing I noticed was the coffee grounds in every cup of coffee. The more I used it the more coffee grounds were at the bottom of my cup. If I actually wanted to keep this thing I would have to buy paper filters because it's a ridiculous amount and I hate having my last drink of coffee by grounds...- Third thing which isn't a huge deal, but kinda annoying is how small the opening to the carafe is. I have a bottle brush so it's not a big deal, but if the coffee were to sit and get stuck in the bottom then you would have a harder time cleaning it because there's now way anyone older than a 3 year can get there hand in there.- The frothing attachment is okay.- Not great for making single cups as if you put a small amount of coffee in it doesn't brew very strong, but if you put more coffee in then you get more grounds in your cup.- The water thing on the side is a weird shape and also hard to clean. Even a bottle brush doesn't go down into one side that is awkwardly shaped.- Did I mention evey part of this thing is plastic or has plastic fused with the non-plastic pieces?!- Make sure you measure it before buying because it is big. I measured and it barely fits under my cabinet, but I still have to pull it out to get the coffee into the top. Annoying!"
"I was so excited for this product and it did make a great cup of iced coffee. Unfortunately the negatives outweighed the positives. This product uses so much electricity that it couldn’t be used the same time as our microwave which we have not had the issue with any of our other appliances in the kitchen. It also would frequently make way more coffee than the size we chose. The other annoying part is that if you want to make anything less than a half carafe it won’t let you use the stay warm feature even if you brew right in the carafe which is annoying because my husband works nights and I usually turn the coffee on before going to bed and by the time he pours it into his mug its already cold. For the price I don’t think it’s worth it with all these flaws. Also, the frother doesn’t steam which is not clear until you open the box."
"Bought this on sale for Black Friday.  Really nice design / style because it feels a bit different from normal coffee makers.I will say I wish it was slightly taller as I can’t fit my 42oz Yeti mug in it.BUT it’s been a little over 10 days of use. Literally making two brew cycles a day for two cups of coffee.Real Problem - it has some poorly designed water sensor that failed….after 20 brew cycles.Details:Today it tells me I need to add water and stops making the coffee. Reservoir is filled. Tried refilled, power cycle, holding it down for added pressure, and running a cleaning cycle (the only recommendation from Ninja product page), tried different brew modes, tried different fill levels, tried adding weights in the reservoir, tried cleaning the water intake with pipe cleaners and toothbrushes, tried compressed air, and I can’t get past it.So now I have no coffee (since I have my old one away as the first 9 ninja days were great), a broken coffee machine, and have to call Ninja to see if they can fix this POS, but they aren’t even open yet so I have to take time off work to make the call."
Box arrived and had obviously been at least opened. Nothing missing or broken. Did I get a renewed item or an open box item when I ordered new?
"I've been using this coffee maker for about 4 months, so long enough for the initial ""love it"" to wear off.Pros:- looks nice on the counter- makes good coffee (as long as I use good coffee)- heated pad keeps coffee at a nice temp- timed brewing featureCons- if I don't flip the top of the water reservoir open after brewing, it develops a funky, musty odor- opening of the carafe is too small to clean by hand; needed to buy a special brush to clean it with- the reusable filter isn't fine enough to stop grounds from getting through, so I've ended up using paper filters anyway which I had hoped to get away fromThis isn't so much a con as a suggestion: think about your coffee drinking routines.  For me, all the extra features for brewing like cup size, travel mug, half a pot, classic brew vs rich brew were fun to experiment with originally but in the end I just need a big pot of coffee waiting for me when I get up every morning.  If that's you, too, then don't bother with this model."
Purchased July 2024.  Carafe opening is impossibly small making it difficult to clean or put into dishwasher.  To get the last ounce or so of coffee out you must remove the cover to pour it out.  The stop drip does not work at all.  The heating pad is wearing away from all the coffee dripping onto it.  The water reservoir get slimy/oily constantly - directions say to clean the reservoir weekly which is a pain. Wish I could return
"This coffeemaker, like so many other drip styles, has either plastic and silicone tubing that comes into contact with the hot water/ brewed coffee.  The style is noteworthy from the single cup holder/ use your own grounds, to the whisk style milk frother which did a pretty good job and tucks away when not using.  No matter how many times I cleaned, ran water through this machine, the coffee smelled and tasted like plastic, with a slight burnt taste.  When you think about it, the hot water is in contact with these elements from the time it is carried from the cold and hot water tank, through the plastic filter holder, and into the glass pot through a long black plastic tube that sits in the coffee. And I tasted the plastic. I wouldn’t serve my guests or myself coffee from this machine."
The machine came without a frothing arm or instruction book.
"I like that it has so many different size brewing options and that it can be time programmed. It has stopped working after 9 months. It shuts down after it's start up, no matter if it's programmed or not. I will have to throw this away. So after searching fixes for it this is what worked. Unplug coffee maker first. Take off water resivoir, remove pot and basket and other items that can fall off. Turn the whole coffee maker upside down and shake lightly. Turn right-side up and attach parts and make a new brew as usual. Worked for my Ninja, hopefully it will help yours."
"Needed a new coffe maker and every feature on this one was exactly what i wanted.  I probably wouldn’t have used the “frother” feature but I though it was cool.  I liked the feature where i could flip down a pad for a single cup or carafe.  I also liked the slim style and how it took up so much less space then my previous maker.  Unfortunately, the problem I had was the coffee maker would not use up all of the water in the tank.  After noticing this for a couple of days, i decided to test a theory, sure enough, each day there was approximately an additional ounce or more of water remaining in the tank.  By the end of the test week and using the same amount of water each time, the tank had over a cup of water remaing in the tank.  In other words, each day the carafe has less brewed voffee in it.  We tried adjusting the settings, changing the levels in the  tank, even switching to single cups (after several single cups more than 1 cup of water remained in the tank.  Very strange problem to troubshoot and online problem searches were no help.  Ninja was absolutely no help.  They never responded to my complaint.  So we sent it back.  We considered exchanging it with another one as I thought maybe our issue might have been an isolated incident.  Then I found a couple of similar-sounding reviews and comments from other users.  Its a shame.  We have other Ninja products that are great.  Just wish this one had of been great also."
"Quick View Pro/Con list at the bottom (if you want to skip all the wordy storytelling)I bought this coffee pot after my previous one of 9 years died. I researched, Googled, and scrutinized for weeks before locking in. It checked all the MUST boxes and more! It took me 1-2 days of making coffee with this to be absolutely 100% locked in. This was it, THE coffee pot.  It makes great coffee. The included scoop is clear to use and accurate to brew delicious coffee every time. You can customize with Classic or Rich (for me it depends on the roast). The Specialty setting isn’t EXACTLY espresso; but man does it come close without being brewed under pressure.It’s got all the bells and whistles. Everything you need and want to clean detaches for quick easy access and clean up! It has a built in frother/blender. The hot plate doesn’t burn the coffee, the drop down single cup tray is strong and durable. The settings allow for every desirable cup of coffee you want. It has a clear instruction book to walk you through this and be happily home brewing in minutes. The programming auto-start is simple and works.It’s perfect! At least it was until it broke after 3-4 months of mostly regular use. Now it’s terrible and it’s the worst version of broke a coffee maker can be. It sucks you into loving it, then makes you HATE it!  AND IT WORKS JUST LONG ENOUGH TO SURPASS THE AMAZON RETURN POLICY!The problem: there is a manufacturers defect in how it draws water from the reservoir into the brewing system. It starts to draw water, then it stops and tells you “ADD WATER” (See the first 2 pics. Water level is circled and so is error message). Most times I want to brew a pot of coffee I need to stand there and repress the Classic/Rich button after it errors out. For 1 FULL POT I need to repeat this process 20-30 times!!!! It errors out after about 1-2 oz of water drawn in. GO CHECK THE ONLINE REVIEWS ON NINJAS WEBSITE. TONS OF STORIES CONFIRMING THIS. It won’t auto brew anymore without erroring out immediately. It’s all sizzle and no steak at this point!PROS:-Built in frothing tool (folds away for convenience)-Single serve settings-Single serve cup holder-Included coffee scoop with ACCURATE measurement guide-Fully detachable for easy clean up-Variety of settings for multiple brew styles-Auto brew settings-Specialty (espresso style) brew-Included mesh filter-Great flavor coffee, and it’s always the sameCON:-Manufacturers defect in water system that causes it to stop pulling water for brewing after 1-2 oz. forces you to restart the brew every few seconds. (View Photos)-This break happened to ours in less than 4 months or less than 100 brews!"
"As stated by others, our machine's discharge spout at the bottom of the water reservoir had algae growth over time and I resorted to popping off the two screw caps on the spout, unscrewing the spout and cleaning it by hand. Once dry, I recrewed the cap back into the bottom of the reservoir.This is a rather poor design and will prevent me from buying a machine like this in the future."
"I purchased this coffee maker based off the excellent reviews and the fact that it can make hot or iced coffee. I own multiple Ninja products and love every single one of them, except this one.I have owned this for a couple of months now and have yet to figure out how to make a good cup of coffee. There was always a weird taste. I read the directions, watched videos, everything. Tried more coffee grounds, too strong. Tried less coffee grounds, way too weak. And always this weird, nasty taste.Then I came back here and starting looking through the negative reviews to see if someone had the same issue and found a solution. Once I did this, I noticed that a lot of people that seem to have purchased the machine around the same time as me are also complaining of a plastic taste whenever they make coffee. This is exactly the taste. I couldn’t describe it until I read these. I’ve made countless cups of coffee, ran vinegar through it multiple times, countless runs of just water - I have tried absolutely everything to get rid of this taste and it’s still there.Seems to be an issue with the products that were made around this time. I’d stay away from this one for awhile."
Not what I thought it would be.Water flow horrible not worth the money durability okSpeed not that great
"Have had it for several weeks, have yet to figure out how to make decent coffee."
"Pros: I love the water reservoir and how it fits so well on my counter. I don't have to pull out the entire machine to add water. I like all the settings as well. I don't use the frother, so I have no opinion about that. I love the measuring spoon that fits nicely on the side.Cons: this thing splashes everywhere. As you can see from my backslash, it creates quite a mess in the kitchen. Even when it beeps that my coffee is done, it continues to drip. I can push the lever to stop the drip, it keeps dripping. I have resulted to keeping a paper towel under it because it makes such a mess. I have had this coffee maker for nearly 2 years now and I'm ready for it to die so I can get something different. If it wasn't for thr co stant dripping and splashing I would love it."
"It pains me to leave this review because I really think Ninja nailed it with this coffee maker in so many regards.  But the plastic reservoir (the water holder) is a deal breaker because it imparts a plastic taste in the coffee. It is especially bad if the water you use to make the coffee is left in the reservoir for a few hours or, God forbid, overnight.  Sniffing the inside of the reservoir you can smell the strong plastic so I'm not surprised it seeps into the drink.  I checked the reviews on Amazon and sure enough, there are some others who have had the same problem.  I contacted Ninja and they suggested a vinegar/water soak and run-through, which I had tried a few times to no avail.  I tried airing it out, scrubbing it, putting water in the reservoir only when I was ready to use it, but nothing worked.  I contacted Ninja again and they were kind enough to send me a new reservoir.  I hoped that maybe I just got one from a bad lot.  Unfortunately, I had the same problem with the replacement.  I just called Ninja again and they apologized and said there was nothing more that they can do.  So now I have to throw this coffee maker out, which kills me.  Many reviews do not mention this issue so I'm assuming most units and water reservoirs are fine as I can't imagine anyone would want to drink a cup of coffee with a very noticeable underlying plastic taste."
It's beautiful what I think They should rethink that.
This coffee maker was purchased in March. It worked great for about 2 months and then all of a sudden started making cold to barely warm coffee. Sad that the heating element went out after 2 months.
I only drink one cup daily.  Each time I have to reheat my coffee in the microwave because it’s lukewarm.  This is immediately after it’s been brewed.  Too much trouble to return.
"First of all, i want to say I'm a ninja fan.  I really thought this coffee maker would be amazing but it isn't.  I ran a couple water cycles through it and the ""brew"" time was pretty long.  I then brewed a half carafe and it tasted pretty darn good.  This morning I brewed a full carafe and there was approx 2-3 c of water that didn't go through the brew cycle and the coffee had a metallic to it.  Dumped everything out and brewed another full carafe.  Still did not brew 2-3 c but at least the metallic taste was gone."
"After having this machine for a little over three months I can confidently say I would not advise anyone buy this coffee maker. As others have stated, the water reservoir randomly leaks into the well where it sits. I have not identified any rhyme or reason as to why this is happening. It’s a pain to clean up as well.The shape of the carafe and the small opening makes it’s very challenging to clean. Not sure why anyone would design a carafe that a typical hand can’t fit inside of. It’s an Olympic event to clean the thing.And finally, this morning it appeared that the machine kept shorting out when we tried to brew coffee. Pressed start, machine blinked and turned off. We repeated this process 3-4x until it finally brewed, but I have very little confidence that it’s going to work reliably moving forward. I’m outside of the Amazon return window so I’ll have to contact Ninja support and see if I can get something taken care of under their 1-year warranty. Truthfully, I’d rather throw it away and start over with something else, but for the price I paid I feel like I have go through a repair process.Heed the warnings from other reviewers and buy something else. Do not purchase this unless you want annoyance to become part of your morning routine."
"Updated review 4/2022:  I’ve had to knock down one more star. The fact that the machine does not have a warmer to keep the pot warm is becoming an issue. We’ve stopped using the pot features because of this. Make one single cup and move on.I have ordered and returns almost every coffee machine on the market.  I have a small appliance cabinet so the machine needs to fit in correctly and properly.  This machine fit and it makes a great cup of coffee.  But, it's ugly.  It's aesthetically not very attractive and looks like an old retro style coffee machine.  I did find it cheaper at another store.  I try to keep the cabinet door closed so it won't show.  Another issue we are having is that when making a larger size coffee (pot, carafe, half, travel mug), the coffee does taste watered down.  I've tried adjusting the amount of coffee I put but still running into the same issue.  If you're going to use it for a single cup of coffee, this does a great job.  It's also easy to clean and has easy access to the water reservoir.  Just to note, I have the version with the stainless steel pot, not the glass."
"In general, a very versatile coffeemaker. I particularly appreciate the ""rich"" setting. The cons are the glass carafe and the warming plate. It is near impossible to clean the carafe, even using a bottle brush.  I have the plate warmer set hot for 4 hours. As the morning progresses the coffee becomes lukewarm. Note that I live at 7300', so keeping coffee hot is important to me. The pros include the ability to make a full pot, 1/2 pot, various cup levels (although I haven't figured out how) and a 4 oz cup for specialties-this works well. There is a frother, but it doesn't warm the milk so of little use to me. I really like the ease of adding water; it's much easier for a left-hander to use than my previous makers."
"I want to love this coffee machine so much, because it has so many great features that I love, but I’ve owned two of them at this point and both have gone bad after about one to two years. The first one started leaking after two years, to the extent that the whole tank of water would empty out on our counter throughout the day. We took it apart and found that a rubber seal had gone bad, but the part couldn’t be replaced. I bought another one of the exact some product in 2022 hoping it was a fluke, but here we are again in 2023 and the machine has started to leak, this time into the machine itself. Some of the lights on the front of the machine have stopped working and it blew a fuse in our kitchen while in use. It seems that the leaking is causing electrical issues now. I am so bummed, but I suppose it’s time to try a different brand since Ninja hasn’t convinced me that they can design products with any sort of longevity."
Didn't realize till I had the unit how difficult access was to the shower head part where the water pours out over the grinds (the part is not movable in any way). I don't know how you see to clean it as you can't see what is going on without pretty much turning the device upside down. Other machines I have had you'll eventually need to clean that area (not that easy to begin with) and not being able to see seemed a problem as you'll never know if you cleaned it well - which will affect the your coffee taste wise. Just seemed like poor design and the making of an annoying task more annoying. I decided that for $130.00 I didn't need to be forever irritated over the design. Never fails to amaze me that virtually all products have such needlessly flawed designs. Tags still inside the backs of dress shirts? Really?
It beeps & coffee isn’t done dripping. And coffee isn’t that hot. Not as good as my old NinjaIf you press “rich” you get half a cupJust an inferior or lemon machine
"Lots of options for making coffee with this maker. One option-cup at a time- works but it's not the k-cup type.  That's ok,but the biggest disappointment is the half pot option.  One would think a half pot would use half the reservoir but that's not true.  It requires a bit more than half the reservoir capacity. So the reservoir must be at least partially refilled to make another half pot for the next time. It also uses #4 conical filters not the typical filter."
"I love the look of this coffee pot and the over ice feature, but the flavor is off. I have been using the same coffee brand for a couple of years, I grind my own beans immediately before brewing. But this machine makes it taste bad, almost chemical. I ran a vinegar/water mix through the machine three separate times and there is no change. I've found myself buying cups of coffee outside of the house more often because of the off flavor. Another con of this machine is that there is no auto shutoff. I've also found that the carafe isn't easy to clean because of the smaller width of the opening. As someone who cleans the carafe by hand after every use, the opening is too small for my small hand to fit inside. If you run it through the dishwasher, this con isn't a problem. The attached frother is a fun and useful addition, but is forgotten (and out of sight) after the novelty of it wears off. Overall, I feel this brew station is overpriced and I miss my old coffee pot that made the perfect cup every time. I would not purchase again.Pro's: aesthetics, over ice option, frotherCon's: no auto shut off, chemical flavor after brewing, carafe isn't easy to clean"
It’s a nice coffee maker but I bought it for the frother and it came without the frothing tool. It’s pretty much a $120 worthless buy for me.
"I got this coffee maker in May and began using it in June. Already I am having issues with the brewing. I do not know what's going on but it brews basically water. I make my coffee strong so it had the normal about if coffee and was still translucent. Just this recent time, I tried making iced coffee and it was literally water like it never passed the coffee grounds . Too expensive for this I could get a better brew from a $20 coffee machine"
"When I put this item in my cart it was on sale for $99 & it came with a frother shown in the product video and described by customers. My old Ninja has a frother which I used every morning. My old machine quit working properly and cleaning it five times didn’t  fix, so I ordered this one while it was on sale. It arrived this afternoon & I had already set it up when I realized no frother! I went to Amazon and saw that they had also changed the price and charged me $119! And there doesn’t seem to be anywhere that I can actually contact anyone. Rufus only answers stupid questions, not product issues."
Loved this coffee maker while it lasted! Unfortunately for the price it’s really upsetting that it only lasted for 2 years and then it completely gave out. I regularly cleaned it and descaled it as needed. Although it runs a cleaning cycle just fine it no longer trips the brewing cycle in any form no matter what you choose. If you buy it I would recommend getting the extended warranty if you buy this product as you are only provided one year of warranty.
"I haven't be impressed by the coffee maker.  It isn't as easy to use as our old one. It's ok but I would nevre consider another one like this. No stainless steel pot, the heating will always burn coffee. Just isn't as it seems."
From day 1 the machine has not brewed a full pot and requires setting it to full pot then refilling tank and setting it to a travel mug to get a full pot. It also takes a very long time to brew. Not impressed.
"I actually love the coffee maker, however, it only lasted 2 years. I would expect it to last longer since it's a ninja. Also, I don't use it every day, so really, it lasted about a year based on the frequency of it's use."
"I took my time reading reviews before purchasing. This seemed(s) like a great buy, but I have had a bad go. Firstly I believe this is a great machine for novelty flavors and run of the mill.My Experience was that with every brew option it made low body, coffee. I noticed right away that the ""let down"" was too fast, but figured I'd be open minded and had several cups on different options. I really appreciate the full body flavor of coffee and I use sourced Full bean coffees, that being said this machine was making some pretty poor cups of coffee with little to NO body in flavor. Even with the specialty brew it couldn't produce any nutty flavors or other mid and high range notes. I was totally bummed. Now with average market beans it does make a decent cup of coffee with especially if you're a french roast kind of person.I thought it was an issue with the washer plug but upon repacking it for return I decided to go over the pieces and found that the springs don't hold any resistance to the basket (thus the quick let down and no body)... So I do believe my personal go on this item may not reflect the greater market as both springs were saggy and one is even more saggy than the other. However I have a suspicion that this machine is for people who enjoy their coffee with other flavors and are not seeking the fully body richness good quality beans can provide.So all things considered this might be the machine for you or it might not be what you're looking for.. or it might just be a shotty 1/1,000 that I happened to get.I'm glad Amazon does hassle free returns for the occasional bum deal, yayI hope this helps"
"I have 2 of these coffee bar makers. One I’ve had for 4 years, and because I loved mine so much I purchased another one for a second home about a year ago. The newer one has green algae in a part of the reservoir that is unreachable because of the design. In 4 years I have never had this problem with the first one I bought. I know others have complained of this design flaw and I have even tried some of the advice to clean this. The picture above is from after cleaning. Ninja customer service is not helpful. You can buy a replacement water reservoir for $25. I love this machine and the coffee it makes but this is a glaring problem. I’m disappointed in Ninja as a company and will find another coffee maker manufacturer for future purchases. If the added expense of having to rebuy water reservoirs is something you don’t want to commit to, I would look for a different machine."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I have been using this coffee maker for almost 4 years and it's been really great overall. But it quite suddenly started leaking, pouring water out of the bottom. The compartment housing the electronics seems to have water flowing through it. Moisture can be seen behind the lighted display and it flickered for a couple minutes and died. We had a good run, granted, but I'm giving this 2 stars because this seems a pretty catastrophic (not to mention dangerous) way for it to die. Watch your machine when it's running. Hopefully others won't have the same experience!"
"The cost of this, even refurbished,  makes me double unhappy. The heating plate has quit. The coffee will still brew hot on that setting but the hot plate - just will not turn on. The pot just beeps ay me."
"Apparently this model doesn’t have the warmer feature, which I didn’t notice when ordering."
Stopped working after 4 years. I know that is a decent amount of time but I'd prefer to not need to buy new appliances that often. Now it will just sit in a landfill.  The water chamber also leaked and collected water underneath it. Looking for a new one now but it will not be a Ninja.
"I purchased this maker Jan 2023. While I think Ninja did a fantastic job on designing this maker, the main problem I have (and it's a dealbreaker) is that EVERY cup of coffee made tastes like plastic. The issue is clearly the reservoir. A quick sniff of the inside reveals a potent plastic, oily odor.  I tried many remedies, white vinegar, dishwasher, soaking overnight with soap, then vinegar again. I contacted Ninja customer service about six months later, who sent a new reservoir. Unfortunately, it’s the same issue. I tried the white vinegar again. No change. I tried just  leaving it uncovered so that maybe the odor would escape – it never did. At this point, the maker is useless to me. It’s too late to return so it will be thrown away.Again, it’s a great maker to look at and I think it would make a great cup of coffee if they used a different material for the reservoir. For me, it as wasted money."
"When my Ninja coffee maker died after 4 years,I didn't hesitate about getting another Ninja. Unfortunately, this one has a design flaw in the carafe. It dribbles. It doesn't brew coffee as hot as I prefer.  Coffee strength is okay on rich setting.  If I had kept the packaging,I would return it."
"It was okay the first few times. By the 4th time I made a pot, it just didn't taste good. I don't know, maybe I'm bougie.I just decided to get a French Press and that is so much better. Lol"
"For the cost, this machine sucks. I pick a xl coffee and it only fills my cup halfway. Exactly a month old and this machine blows. Now I'm stuck with it"
"I had the exact same model a few years ago and loved it. So when I needed a new coffee maker for my place, I splurged on this product again. The new one is horrible. Takes 2-3 times longer to brew, brews a half pot even on the full pot setting. If you set the delay brew feature it often ends up beeping because something is wrong and nothing turns it off except unplugging the device. Not sure if I got a faulty one or what, but not worth the money anymore."
"Like many others here, I've experienced the awful plastic smelling and tasting coffee.  Any coffee brewed from this thing is not enjoyable in the slightest.  You are most likely drinking harmful amounts of plastic if you use this, it smells and tastes completely awful.When I initially bought it, I did a lot of research but still somehow missed this.  Seriously, this was $160.  A $20 coffee machine beats this one just for that reason alone.  Ninja's customer service was great at least, I'll definitely give them that.  They even offered to replace parts to help (I waited too long to return tbh), but I just can't get it out of my head and don't want to risk drinking plastic.I'm pretty sure it's the reservoir, but it could be other parts.  Any water in that reservoir instantly converts to plastic smelling water."
"I had high hopes for this coffee machine. After seeing many positive reviews lauding the delicious coffee it creates on all the different setting I had to get it. But from day 1, it has been nothing but a disappointment.  Despite following all the cleaning and operation instructions, every cup of coffee it made tasted like plastic, no matter what setting was used. It’s not even a cheap coffee machine, so I don’t understand why clearly some key components are made of plastic and leach into the coffee. Aside from the terrible taste, this is a safety issue as well.  After having a great experience with ninja blenders, I’m especially disappointed with the company for making such a subpar product."
"This coffee pot does brew a nice cup of coffee, but is not a 10 cup carafe. After brewing a full pot, it measures 8 cups. Otherwise, it’s a fine coffee maker. It does have quite a large footprint and is too tall to fit below my cabinets, so I’ll probably try to find something else."
"I don't write reviews normally.  I am outraged by the quality of the ninja cm401 that I purchased on January 23, 2024.  I use double filtered water to make our coffee.  2 weeks ago I started getting the add water error when reservoir was full and unobstructed (pushing in on the reservoir tab and water gushes out like its supposed to).  After unplugging and plugging back in multiple times and a lot of button pushing I got it to work again.  The machine and all the parts still look brand new (because they are).  A few days later the clean machine button came on.  I cleaned it per the instruction manual.  Worked fine for 2 weeks and the add water light and beep is back on.  I have followed all the youtube videos for trying to fix this but no help.  After half a day trouble shooting this coffee machine it is a no go.  Pulled out my trusty Hamilton Beach coffee maker and all is good with it.  I called tech support and they wanted me to go through all the trouble shooting tips with them while on video chat.  I do not have the time for this.  They need to back their product.  I will never purchase another sharkninja product again.  Do not buy the cm401"
"Pros: loved the detachable reservoir, pot, buttons, and display very much!Cons: we cleaned the machine, ran water through, made coffee, repeated, repeated with vinegar, air dried,  and still the coffee and water smelled of burned plastic.I wanted to keep it so bad because I loved the set up but the taste was awful. Even with filtered water, paper filters, and cutting the coffee mixture down. Disappointing"
"We liked this coffee maker a lot at first. It was our first Ninja coffee maker and the reviews were mixed. But we really liked the removable water reserve, milk frother, and drink options so we decided to pay the money and give it a chance. We were not happy that the maker didn’t seem to have any way to remember a scheduled “on” time so we had to manually set the clock each night, but it was a minor inconvenience.Note: We regularly clean our coffee makers as they get daily (sometimes multiple times a day) use.About a month ago, we noticed coffee grounds in our coffee and saw that the grounds in the filter area were running over. We again cleaned all the parts of the coffee maker.Then yesterday instead of making coffee as scheduled in the morning it showed “Cln” - I tried to override it to make our morning coffee but it wouldn’t. So, I went ahead and selected “clean” and it went through an hour cycle - it did nothing. It didn’t run any water through and it didn’t reset the “Cln” message. I tried the clean cycle again with the same result. We unplugged for the time recommended in the manual and that didn’t do anything. We cannot use it and cleaning it doesn’t reset it.So, we paid a lot of money and performed regular maintenance on this machine and in less than a year it is unusable. The manual says now we would have to pay to send off the machine to get fixed.Nope.To avoid the time and money that would entail, we are getting a much less expensive coffee maker and learning our lesson about this brand."
"Upon purchase I used a few times and the keepmwar, would not stay on! I’d come to get another cup and it wouldn’t be hot.  I contacted company and they sent me a new machine.  This one seems to do the same thing sometimes it stays on for awhile and sometimes it shuts off before we finished the pot. Also doesn’t seem to slow perk like my previous cuisinart. Water comes out quickly like a Kuerig and I’m not a big fan of that as you get weak flavored coffee even when you use the Rich option. Not lovin this at all."
"The product is well designed, easy to use, and has held up in the nearly two years I’ve owned it. I can’t speak highly enough about the product quality, with one major exception and that’s the reason I’m writing a review today.The coffee coming out of this thing is the weakest cup of coffee I’ve had in my entire life and I’ve had a lot of bad diner and gas station coffee over the years. I’ve tried every configuration/option possible, read the manual dozens of times because it’s almost illogical how weak the coffee is. My pot today was lighter than many cups of iced tea I’ve had.Even the concentrated 4oz option is weak compared to the $10 Walmart coffee pot this replaced. I want to love it and I’ll probably end up keeping it for a bit because I paid too much for it, but do yourself a favor and find a better option that can actually brew a basic pot of coffee."
"I purchased the Ninja C401 and, after using it only once a week for a year, I'm incredibly disappointed. It started malfunctioning. One morning I noticed it overheating significantly and than began to smell and smoke. I genuinely believe it could have started a fire if I hadn't been nearby to unplug it. When I reached out to Ninja for assistance, they refused to replace it, which left me feeling frustrated and unsupported. Given the potential safety hazard and the lack of customer service, I cannot recommend this product. It’s a shame because I expected much more from such a well-known brand."
"This coffee maker produces terrible watered down coffee with a burnt taste. I really wish I can fix it but it doesn’t seem to be fixed. Really a disappointment since I spent so much money on it. Other than that, I like the setup of it. Just can’t get over the taste"
"I got this coffee maker after reading the reviews everyone seem to enjoy it and give it nothing but compliments. For me This machine lasted about 10 brews. Before it gave out. The coffee was strong and the brew was pretty fast, but This morning I wake up to a hunk of broken plastic on my kitchen counter. What can I say? Is it a one off?"
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband last year and he was thrilled. It's a  great little machine in that it offers different brew sizes, has a frother, etc. Initially, it brewed very good coffee. But after about 8 months of regular use (3-5 times a week) and a cleaning cycle every month, I noticed that the coffee was tasting very bitter. We have tried using different amounts of grounds, different coffee brands, more cleaning cycles...nothing is working. I think only getting 8 months of decent, drinkable coffee out of a coffee maker is ridiculous."
"Every time we make coffee grinds end up in the pot, it doesn’t matter if the filter provided or a paper filter. We have even tried using less grinds than the pot calls for.Another annoying thing is thee coffee unit beeps stating it’s done but the coffee keeps dripping.Lastly, the frother is weak."
"We replaced our older Ninja coffee maker with this newer model.  Huge mistake!!!  This was supposed to be an upgrade to an already feature loaded older model and boy, were we mistaken.  First, and it’s not the makers fault, but the small 10 cup pot is pathetic compared to our previous 12 cup.  The pot is also extremely hard to clean by hand due to a narrow opening at the top.  The heat pad is probable the biggest disappointment.  At best, it keeps the coffee luke warm.  Even at the brew point, coffee is not hot enough to develop the true taste of coffee.  Our previous model was king at this function and why Ninja did away with this feature, I have no clue.  Ok, one good thing about this unit is, and not a key feature to us, it has a frother.  I’ll take heat over the frother.  Over all, HUGELY disappointed in this coffee maker."
"I’ve had this machine for less than a few months and it broke. Made an 8 ounce cup this morning and when I came to get it, my counter and floor was covered in watered down coffee.No matter what size you set it to , the machine dispenses the full amount in the reservoir."
"I was really excited to get this coffee maker since I love making both hot and iced coffee. However, I’ve used it a couple times and the “hot” coffee is not hot. It’s warm at best. Not sure if I’m doing something wrong or received a faulty item, but I’m thoroughly disappointed to say the least…"
"Functioned as it should but was a drip coffee maker, doesn’t make espresso as described, coffee not rich like the pressurized brew you get from a keurig whether you use pods or your own grindCoffee tasted awfulIncredibly expensive for a drip coffee maker. My Mr Coffee old coffee maker actually made better coffee whether big or small amount at a fraction of the price.Could hardly wait to return this!Rudest customer service rep I’ve ever encountered when I called ninja, her supervisor was very kind thoughAmazon reps are the best!"
The appearance is nice and the controls are very intuitive. Filling the reservoir is easy too. Voice is made quick enough. But I haven’t been able to get a good cup of coffee out of this unit no matter what I’ve tried. It also has a plastic smell and weird taste. If they could fix that issue it’d be an otherwise great unit.
"I loved this coffee maker when I first got it, but after ~2 months it became unusable. Hundreds of people have the same issue - this coffee maker basically has an xbox red ring of death: the clean light.My clean light started showing up a few seconds after starting to brew. I ran the clean cycle with vinegar per the manual, then did the flush cycle. The clean light went away for about a week, then started showing up again. After that, no amount of clean cycles would make it go away.A coffee machine should be dependable to use every morning. A $200 coffee machine much more so. It's unacceptable that so many people have this issue.To add to the problem, the coffee maker started leaking water from under the base every time it's used, making a mess of my counters and floor. I finally contacted Amazon support since my return period was over and they handed me over to Ninja support.Ninja support had me run the clean cycle again (which takes hours) then call again and show them the problem on video chat. I tried to brew a cup and this time didn't get the clean light (of course) but the coffee maker still leaked all over my kitchen. Ninja said they would send me a replacement water reservoir (despite explaining the water was coming from the base and the sides and reservoir were totally dry) and did nothing for the clean light since ""they weren't able to see the problem on video."" The next time I tried to brew a cup, the clean light showed up again.It's been now 3-4 weeks after i called ninja support, and the replacement part has still not arrived (they estimated a week to 10 days) so i don't even know if that will fix the problem.Don't take the risk - just look at all the people frustrated with this problem online before you buy. Do your research and pick a reliable, durable machine."
"One thing that I did not see mentioned about this coffeemaker in the product info or reviews is that it is limited to only making specific pre-determined amounts of coffee - full pot, half pot, mug, travel mug, etc. My husband liked the idea of being able to just make one mug if needed so this seemed like a good option. Unfortunately you can't make anything in between the presets - no option for 3/4 of a pot. We don't usually need a full pot but sometimes would like a little more than a half pot. I could probably get there by making a half pot, then remaking an extra mug, but that is not very user-friendly.  The presets are convenient but there should be a way to override them. That said, it makes good coffee, the delay feature works well and the removable water reservoir is convenient. But for the price I would like to be able to make however much coffee I want.8/25/22: UPDATE - I have tried to make some of the other preset amounts, including a full pot, but for some reason it leaves an inch of water in the reservoir and the the pot does not look full. Additionally, the coffee tastes weak which is weird. I would not buy this coffee maker again, it's too expensive for all the quirks it has."
"This coffee maker is decent at making drip coffee, which I would obviously expect given it's high price. Honestly, comparing it to a $30 coffee maker, I don't think it's really any better at making standard drip coffee. Unfortunately, it is also hard to clean which just boggles the mind given how expensive it is. When I make coffee the grounds spray on the bottom of the top piece of the unit (i.e. where the water comes out). You may not notice it at first until you find some old coffee grounds fall into your coffee filter (yuck). The only way to clean this is to essentially wipe it a bunch of times with paper towels, because it isn't something that can be disassembled. Taking it one step further, the carafe is not well designed for cleaning. It has a weird shape which means you need a special sponge that can reach into the carafe to clean it, while most carafes you can easily clean with a regular sponge. It also has a straw type of lid to it, which as you can imagine is not easy to truly clean without a pipe cleaner or something.Overall, I'm disappointed. I hoped that if I spent the money on this coffee maker that I would be happy with it, but if I could do it over again I think I would've bought a simpler coffee maker that is easier to clean and doesn't spray coffee grounds all over."
It did not make the coffee hot and the place to keep the coffee hot for an hour or so only kept it lukewarm.  The button to turn in the machine did not light up. Could not put  the carafe in the microwave.  I will keep my Kuerig.
"As far as making a good cup/pot of coffee this is a great product. However, after about a week of use the body started to leak water out of the bottom. So my maker is definitely defective unfortunately. Sadly I will need to return mine and hopefully get this issue resolved with a replacement."
After owning a kuerig for many years without issue I figured I would get one with a carafe to try to safe some money on coffee. The unit is great does k-cups and did make one pot of coffee. After about three weeks of owning this the carafe side stopped working. It will make the coffee but the water and the plate never got hot. Just cold. I called Keurig and they are sending me another one. Support is good I just hope it is a new and not refurbished one. Plus I’m hoping that this one will last at least half as long as the originals.  I will update this once I receive the new one.
This was my Christmas gift this year. I love the new design and that fact that you have a pod side and a pot side. Unfortunately the coffee is not strong. I’ve even gotten “strong” coffee and used the strong setting but it’s still bland. And the Strong setting is only for the pod side and tbh it doesn’t make a difference.
"I used the original with the craft. Now they don’t make that model. This one is good but the water tank in the back is harder to get to. You need to pull the coffee maker forward to get to it. Also, you need to order another item to use the single cup with your own coffee."
We've had single serve machines forever but since we both work from home we wanted the option of having a full pot as well. My only complaint is the single serve side does NOT get hot enough. Even when pressing the extra hot button my coffee is cold within 10 minutes. I like to enjoy my coffee and not have to gulp it down just to have it while it's still warm.
The flavor it produces just isn’t up to par. It brews so quickly that it doesn’t really produce a decent quality pot of coffee.
Can’t use filtered water stop working and called kuerig they said only use rap water and works fine since then
"What I don't like:  the carafe is unwieldy, the water is barely hot enough for brewing, flat bottom baskets are not as good as cones.What I like:  The wife likes the pod side. Saves space."
"So many things I didn’t like I had to write this review.  The lid on the coffee pot is flimsy and doesn’t control the pour well.  Also, I had to YouTube the instructions on how to place a reusable filter in the single serve coffee side because none of the filters I bought would work even though the instructions said they do. Crazy that the directions inside the box and on manufacturer website are 100% INCORRECT.  You literally have to make physical changes to the filter so it works in the newer models.  Also have to make sure you press and hold the red coffee pot button down to turn the burner off,  but if you happen to push and not hold the coffee maker will start to flash to prepare to brew again.  Then you have to HOLD the flashing K button - not tap so it won’t brew.  I’m a 62 year old coffee connoisseur and have had many coffee makers from various manufacturers.  I liked the design of this one so I bought it.  Plus the reviews weren’t bad.  There are many products I like from this manufacturer but whoever engineered the functionality of this one needs to go back to the drawing board in my opinion."
However coffee not as hot as we'd like it in the stainless container.  Not as happy with the brewed coffee as with my previous 2 Cuisinart coffee makers which each lasted long time.  The pot is difficult to clean.  Too small to get hand in so use brush that just can't get in all the crevices.  No complaints on single serve side.
"Doesn’t get hot enough. Only stays on for 2 hours. As an all day coffee drinker, that can be a problem."
Reusable K cups do not fit with this machine. Other than that it is nice and brews fast.
"I am a 4-cup-in-the-carafe person, but also like the flexibility of a K Cup. This unit has a minimum size of 6 cups. Contemplating returning it."
The coffee maker is great with one exception:  you cannot use reusable K cups with it.  The Kcup is pierced several times in different areas of the cup making it impossible to use a reusable cup.  This was not clear from the information provide on the website or in the package insert.  Otherwise this is a 5 star product.
"Loved everything about this machine, the sleek look, ease of use, coffee temperature, and versatility. But after about 2 weeks, it powered off and we couldn’t get it back on. Hoping it was a fluke. Going to return it and try again with the same model."
I was very excited to get this all in one coffee maker to save space on my counters.  I am happy with the carafe coffee maker side.  Controls are easy to use.  What I am very unhappy with is the K cup side.  The nozzles dispenses in like a spray and makes a mess.  I have to hold the cup directly underneath to avoid splatters everywhere.  Also once it's done with its cycle it will continue to drip making a mess.  I would have liked to give it a 2.5 because I am half way satisfied.
"Purchased it for $199, and loved it for the two weeks that it worked. Then after 2 weeks, when I tried to use the iced coffee, it gave me ER3, PR5 error code and would not dispense water to make an iced coffee. When I called customer support for Keurig, they did not tell me what the problem was but said they would send me a replacement. That was awesome customer service, but they would not send the new unit until UPS received my old unit to be shipped back to them. So because I did not have a box for shipping the old unit, it took me several days to get it to UPS and then once they had that tracking number for the old unit, they shipped the new unit to me which took about a week. I will update if the new unit breakes also."
"A gift, this K-Duo Gen-2 was unboxed and set up last night. The recommended cleaning occurred but now, as of just 12 hours later, the carafe side (the heating plate) does not work.The k-cup size works fine.I would not recommend this since I wasn’t able to use the carafe at all for making coffee."
Was excited about ordering this upgraded piece in October 2024. Now November 25 try to make a whole pot of coffee and it really didn't work. Made it light and it didn't wet the coffee grinds . Extremely disappointed 😞
"We purchased this product after our first Keurig died after 11 years :(  This one is described as the best of all worlds, you can brew, a pot of coffee, a cup of coffee and even ice coffee in 4 different sizes... Well, it does all of that with one exception...Ice coffee can only be brewed in 6 oz :(  That stinks, why?  Otherwise it's pretty nice"
"I had a Keurig K-Duo version 1 for two years before it fried. I purchased version 2 hoping for better features, but oh boy... There are virtually NO POSITIVE CHANGES AND SIGNIFICANT ANTI-CONSUMER CHANGES1. They placed 4 metal rods for the single serve, so you have to buy all new reusable kcups for no reason other than Keurig trying to force you to buy kcups. It has the added benefit of also causing some grinds to float out and get in your coffee.2. They removed the power button, so if you accidentally start the coffee, the best route to stop it is to unplug the machine and deal with resetting the clock.3. The 12-cup pot somehow has a worse design than the first such that you will inevitably be spilling coffee, so make sure you pour over the sink.Recommendation: DO  NOT BUY Version 2. Get a version 1 and be happy."
"I will never ever buy another damn  Kure coffee pot It does not brew hot. It’s ridiculous. How much money you pay for one you don’t even work, right"
The carafe side doesn’t work at all.  Feels like we’re jumping through hoops to get it exchanged.
"Bought this device this week. Ran both sides through a cycle or two to make sure and clean out any manufacturer gunk. Bought special re-usable pods since this one has 5 holes instead of the one needle the original version of this had. Made 1 carafe of coffee the other day. It was super quick and worked great! Went to make coffee today and I can't get warm water out of the Carafe side. Single Serve side is working fine.Lots of other reviews saying the same thing. I am going to try and do a replacement, but I'm scared based on so many reviews of this issue, that it will happen again.Will update"
