Product looks nice and had good reviews but it suddenly died after only a year of intermittent use.  The lid was also not easy to open--you had to depress the button and hook the edge with your fingernail to life it open.  Not easy to do when it's hot.Replacing with a different brand.
"Overall this a fine electric kettle. Here are my nits. First of all the power cord is thick and heavy and terminates at at large 3-prong grounded plug. I’m sure the argument for this heavy cord is that being grounded makes it safer, but it’s rather unwieldy on the countertop. My previous kettles did not have one and I never had any issues. Second, the screened opening on the pour spout doesn’t open all the way to the bottom of the spout, making it difficult to empty the last bit of water from the kettle. Also, the top of the glass is not flush inside to the the plastic top, forming a ledge, which also contributes to difficulty getting all of the water out. I like to leave the kettle lid open after boiling allowing the remaining moisture to evaporate, but these last 2 issues combined with a rather small lid opening (which also makes it more difficult to add water to it) cause the evaporation to take hours. I need to leave it open all day, possibly allowing airborne dust and pet hair to settle in the kettle. My last Hamilton Beach kettle was good on all of these points but after my trusty unit bit the dust, I had to return 2 units due to a manufacturing defect and didn’t trust trying a third time."
"I've bought three of these kettles over the last two years, but all three have since required replacements. All three purchased before the faults occurred.First, the cons:One developed an issue where it would turn off half-way through the boiling process, rendering it useless for the intended purpose.The other two got chipped glass in about the same spot near the bottom of the glass portion of the kettle necessitating replacements for safety reasons, whether this is the kettles fault or just bad luck is hard to say, but having it happen twice in the same part of the kettle does point to a structural weakness being possible.They are also difficult to fill due to the narrow opening at the top, which is also partially blocked by the hinged lid.The pros:I did like the thick solid cord on the base stand. More high wattage appliances should have these sort of thick cords on them.When they did work, they heated the water fairly fast, a full kettle in about eight or nine minutes or so at a guess, never really precisely timed it while I had this kettle.All in all, I can't really recommend this kettle if you want one that is going to last more than a few months to a year before requiring a replacement. It feels like a solid, well built appliance, but has failed to live up to the expectations of that three times in a row."
"I bought this a year ago and after a while once boiled it would turn off before coming to the boil completely. I mentioned this and it was replaced so good customer service.Now a year on it is starting to do the same again. I also noticed with this one it doesn't boil properly but shuts off as it comes to the boil as if the thermostat is set a little low.Now looking for a new kettle but won't be buying one of these again, they should last longer than 6 months."
"We used the kettle on an average every day at least twice a day, sometimes more for 4 years until it finally died. 6 months ago, the connection between the kettle pot and the plate started to work only when you adjusted it. Now it doesn't work at all."
"It works fine, but I didn't like that the heating element under the spout makes boiling water blow out of the should someone overfill it.  Other brands have the element back toward the handle, so the rolling boil pulls away from the spout instead, and they won't boil over.  That design can be filled to the top without any problems.  Bad design that could easily be remedied."
Bought in Oct 2021. Was a fast kettle that we used daily until one day the shut off mechanism stopped working a couple weeks ago and now it boils without shutting off and gets dangerously hot. Will be replacing with a different brand.
"If you leave the lid up, the auto shutoff will NOT work and it will boil itself dry. Found this out the hard way.  Bought in 2021 and used daily. Today, 11/12/24, I threw it away after the base partially melted."
"Bought 4 years ago, we used this in the last 3/2 years nearly every day. It mostly worked fine and was very quick to heat up water. But then the switch began sticking and wouldn't stay on, and eventually it stopped altogether. I opened it up and the metal contact points inside the switch the had corroded. We never ran it through  a dishwasher or anything, just kept it clean in accordance with manufacturer instructions. After cleaning the corrosion off it worked again for a while but then coughed out. I did expect it to last longer than it did. The metal needs to be made of something that doesn't corrode with water."
"Look, I get, these things only last a year or two at best!!!  However; We have had this Elec. Water Kettle for three months and it no longer works!  It comes on and before it can Boil, only warm water!Since the kettle was still under its 12 month warranty and we have only, they will replace it; Which I am glad for that."
"Unfortunately, I did not get to use the product until months after I purchased it so did not realize the issues until it was too late to do anything about it. I purchased for my mother who told me it was too fancy for her and she wanted a simple kettle. She didn't even take it out of the box. I started using it a couple weeks ago. When the water is heating, there does not seem to be a problem, but when you go to pour the water, some water pours out from the seal btw the bottom of the glass portion and the bottom black piece. The first couple times I thought maybe it was from water that had gotten on the outside of the glass when I was filling it that had settled in the area below the glass. So, each time I use it, I make sure all of the water goes inside the kettle, and I wipe down the outside entirely before heating. Doesn't matter. Each time, water comes out of the bottom of the pot. I have simply taken to pouring the tea over a towel or over the sink, but it's annoying and feels somehow not so safe :-)"
Bought this kettle twice.  First one lasted about three years.  Thought that was a fluke so bought another one which only worked for 16 months. Avoid this piece of JUNK.  Looks nice but that’s about all it’s got going for it.
"I thought about returning this and getting a different model and now wish I had. It works as stated, but I did a boiling race against a pot on my stove and it came out right around the same speed. Also, it would be helpful to have additional measurements and the glass. But my biggest complaint is that it’s hard to fill using the sink because the lid doesn’t open far enough and gets in the way. Additionally, due to the design of the top and spout, you can never truly get all the water out.Came back to say, part of the handle gets pretty hot sometimes"
"It does the job, very sleek and effective. It gets your water to a boil and shuts off automatically. However, I had it for a few months and within the first month, the kettle began to build mold at the bottom (this could be my mistake, maybe I leave water in it or maybe our water isn’t clean?). Another thing was the plastic strainer that comes in the spout completely disintegrated after a couple months. After 2-3 months of usage, we started noticing white specks floating in our water.Ordered a new one recently after we hit the “it was time” mark, and this one was leaking from the bottom after the first or second use. Replacing it with the same but if these issues persist, I’ll just have to go with another brand."
"Wanted to love this kettle, I do love the glass so you can see build up and get it cleaned HOWEVER after periodic use in one year it’s stopped working. We didn’t get it wet we didn’t drop it etc worked one minute then 10 minutes later tried again and won’t turn on anymore. What a waste, our last kettle (different company) lasted from about 2013 until last year guess I should’ve bought the same one instead"
"Pro1. Boiled water fast.2. Auto shutoff feature.Con1. Made in China (known for using hazardous materials on products)2. Lid stuck all the time and does not open properly, had to pry it open with a knife.3. Horrible taste of plastic even after months of use, switched back to my stainless steel kettle.4. Hard to clean with the small lid opening."
"Okay, I really do love this kettle, but was very alarmed when I went to use it the other morning and the kettle was so hot I nearly burned my hand on the glass - and it was turned off!  I quickly unplugged it, had  an electrician check the outlet (a neighbor), and found that something was wrong in the base of the kettle that was causing it to heat up despite being turned off and not in use.  The electrician said it was lucky I was home because the risk of it causing a fire.Despite being past Amazon's listed return date, I called Mueller to let them know what had happened so they could alert their team to potentially defective elements.  Their customer service was stellar, professional and sympathetic and despite it being past Amazon's return date, they said they were going to send me a new kettle.  Kudos!  I'm glad to have another, but will make sure it stays unplugged when not in use!Hands down, this is the best made electric kettle we have owned.  It is very well made and sturdy with all edges (rim of pitcher, base, top) protected by hard surfaces that are easy to clean.  The button atop the lid makes it easy to open with one hand and the on/off switch on the handle is genius.  Seriously.  It heats up quickly and continues to heat even if you cheat and pour off a little hot water before it shuts off.  Most immediately shut off if you remove them from the base, but this one will continue until the water is boiling before automatically shutting off.We have zero complaints and honestly wish we had found this brand and model sooner!"
this was great! until it wasn't.  It worked last night but this morning did not work. spontaneously quit working.  and I only bought it a year and a half ago it turns out.  disappointed.
"You can replace an ""ü"" with an ""ue"", but ""üe"" is not a thing, so it was clear from me from the start that this is a Chinese producer trying to give himself a German brand. Anyway I was willing to give this a try. After all when somebody invest into establishing a ""quality"" brand it surely should reflect on the product?Indeed the Kettle served me well for about 23 months. The clear view to see how much water is in there and the light when it's on is helpful. But just yesterday the lid won't open anymore, I had to use a tool to get it open and after screwing it off the reason was revealed: the opening spring is just supported by a thin piece of plastic which just broke off (see picture).This seems like such a simple design mistake that I'm wondering if it's intentional. But that doesn't make sense since it certainly doesn't help with branding and it probably also won't help sales since there are enough alternatives out there. So it seems somebody just didn't think this through. Still I wonder how they can make this claim in the description:""A premium long lasting lid that stays shut when it’s supposed to for years to come, unlike the majority of the others on the market.""Yes, it stays shut. Not only when it's supposed to, but also when it isn't.If you get this Kettle I recommend paying $3 extra for a 3-Year Protection."
"Like many, I came straight away for the tremendous reviews - BAMBOOZLED!!! In fact, this is why I can’t rely on customer reviews on here anymore. And instead, sort everything by most-sold, unfortunately (because the masses, if nothing else, are really good at being the masses). Thanks, ‘mueller’ ‘design award’ (my ass) yada yada. The complete review is in the title above 🤙"
"I recently purchased this electric kettle in search of a convenient and fast way to boil water, and while it does its main job well, there are a few noteworthy drawbacks that I'd like to share.Let's start with the positives: the speed at which this kettle boils water is impressive. It quickly brings water to a rolling boil, making it ideal for those hectic mornings when every second counts. This efficiency alone is the redeeming quality of this product.However, I must address the persistent issues that have hindered my overall satisfaction. Firstly, there is a notable problem with leakage when pouring the water after boiling. This is a major inconvenience as it creates a mess and poses a safety risk, especially if you're handling hot water. It's disappointing that such a basic functionality flaw was overlooked in the design.Additionally, the handle occasionally becomes uncomfortably hot to hold. While this doesn't occur consistently, it's still an issue that shouldn't be overlooked. It's essential for an electric kettle to prioritize user safety and comfort, and this aspect falls short in this particular product.In terms of build quality, the kettle appears average. The materials used seem decent, but it lacks the robustness I would expect from a long-lasting appliance. The overall design is unremarkable, blending into the crowd of similar products on the market.To summarize, this electric kettle is a mixed bag. Its greatest strength lies in its speedy boiling capabilities, making it suitable for those who value efficiency. However, the persistent leakage issue and occasional hot handle detract from the overall experience. It's an average product that falls short of providing a consistently positive user experience."
"First of all, the on/off switch is on the upper part of the handle below the lid release and can easily be activated by mistake. Second, the lid does not open fully so that the filter gets in the way of pouring water into the kettle. Also, the cord is not very flexible."
"ETA: I did reach out to Mueller directly through their website and they have offered to replace the item since it’s less than a year since purchase. One star for quality of item, five star customer service.I bought this kettle on September 28, 2023. It gets routine use in our household of two adults and one teenager. Today it just stopped working. Less than 5 months of use, and it’s now going into the landfill. I’m disappointed since I have several other Mueller products that I have been very happy with in the past."
"It heats water to a boil and shuts off.  That is all it really does.  There is a ring of LED's that glow blue while heating but they turn off as expected when boiling temp is reached.  I did briefly have another kettle from Cosori that I initially liked better. It had a range of selectable water temps and it was supposed to maintain the water temp for maybe 2 hours.  However, the keep warm feature failed after a few days.  That pot would then heat and shut down.  Figuring if that feature failed so soon I was not willing to take a chance that something else would crap out so I returned the Cosori and opted for a much simpler unit.  Hence the Mueller was the replacement I chose.  The Muller does the basic job of heat and immediately shut down.  I will say that between the two units,  the Cosori did feel a bit more of a higher quality constructed product, especially the kettle base. Maybe I just got a bad one and should have tried areplacement.  The base on the Mueller is much lighter in weight and feels and looks cheap by comparison.  The Cosori base is much heavier and seemed to be of better quality construction.  In the long run, ordering things sight unseen always has something of a risk element.  It might be better to seek out a brick and mortar store to see things in person.  I'll probably keep this kettle as it is OK but having it home and knowing what I know now, I'd look elsewhere.  There just is not an element of elegance with this unit."
"This kettle only lasted just over 2 years before the auto shut off stopped working. It is stylish and heats quickly, but this safety feature is essential and prompts a replacement."
"The 1.8L model was used 3-4 time per day and the power switch failed at 8 months. The manufacturer honored the warranty and promptly sent a replacement. No hassle, but still a hassle for us.We like the favorable features, but this appears to be a common issue, cannot recommend."
"I was happy with this tea kettle until the inside bottom started to rust after I had it for 6 months.  I contacted their customer support and since it was still under warranty, they sent me a new one.  That one only lasted 8 months.  I wasn't able to turn it on any more.  I would push the start button and it would immediately pop back up.I contacted them again only to let them know what I thought of their product.  Of course since this one was a replacement, they told me that they couldn't replace it for free.  I told them that I wasn't trying to get replacement because I didn't want another one of them.One other feature that I didn't like was that the lid wouldn't open all the way.  After the first one rusted in the inside bottom I thought perhaps I should make sure it was complete dry after each use.  It was difficult to fit my hand in there to get the bottom dry.I cannot recommend this product."
"Mueller kettle model  #M99S. Looked attractive, fun to watch the blue bubbles. But sadly you won't get to watch them for long. We used the kettle four to five mornings per week, handled with care, and in less than one year, kettle decided to die an unexpected death. Many, many attempts to contact the company have proved fruitless ... hearing only a recording over and over again. At the very least, buy a brand that has a functioning ""help center"". Very disappointing!"
"Works fine, but broke after a couple of years. It wouldn't shut off once the water started boiling and became a fire hazard."
"I love my kettle and have used it daily since I purchased it in October of 2020. Now it’s June of 2024 and suddenly it just died. I guess the switch went out because it just won’t turn on. But, I use it so much I just ordered a new one. Great item. Hope this one lasts as long or longer."
We bought this in June of this year. Lid stopped popping open consistently within 3 month and now will not open at all. Not impressed.
"2.5 years later: Verified death trap. Perhaps if designing a vessel to be regularly filled with boiling water, more attention should be given to 1) not letting steam escape from the handle around the on/off switch, burning your victims at 6am; and 2) creating an on/off switch which doesn’t get stuck after a few years, resulting in your machine contentedly boiling away until the second coming. Better to have the thing simply stop working in advance of these dangerous failures."
"Despite good reviews on several websites, the one I bought in 2022 stopped working less than a year after I bought it. I was stupid enough to buy a second one because I really liked this kettle. We'll, it stopped working too. I think this one was only a half year from purchase. Oh well, lesson learned."
"I purchased this kettle because I was relocating to a new city and wanted to leave the kettle behind for my housemates.  This kettle arrived and I packed it into my relo crate.  Upon arriving in my new city 4 months later, I enjoyed using my kettle daily.  Each morning, I heat water for a single cup of tea so the kettle hardly get excessive use. Today, after just ONE YEAR of daily use, THE KETTLE STOPS WORKING.  This is the SECOND Mueller kettle I have purchased and BOTH stopped working within 12 months of use.  Is this Mueller's designed functional obsolesce deliberate product design to stimulate re-purchase or is it simply crappy quality?  I'm not sure but what I know is that I will NOT--EVER buy another Mueller kettle or other product.  I need products to last well beyond a year or two.  If I wanted to have to re-purchase products regularly, I would buy the cheap crap from Chyna.  I though Mueller from Austria was better and longer lasting than the cheap crap from Chyna.  Apparently I was wrong."
All show and no substance. Like others who have reviewed it; it's nice to look at but fizzles out in a short time; not meant to be durable. We are elders who use it a few times a day. It's the third or 4th automatic shutoff kettle that lasted under a year. We opted for this pricier model but it quick working in under a year. I'm going back to the old whistling tea kettle
It heats up fastBut drips when I pour the hot water out!
"The reason of giving it a three star is because it is impossible to clean.  Nobody's hands, unless it's a two year old kid, and even than wouldn't work because the arm is too small, will fit in to clean this thing.How do you clean it?  You can't open the lid far enough to put your hand in it and clean it.  Yes, you can rinse it out of course as I do, but I have to then leave it out all night to dry on it's own because I can't dry it since my hand won't fit.  Don't know why the lid was made this way.The heating part of it is great, heat up fast, doesn't stay hot for very long however meaning your tea, you need to drink within a reasonable time and also one other thing I'm not too crazy about is the base.  The cord doesn't stay put and the kettle doesn't stay straight on it when you need to put it away, so you  need to be careful that it doesn't fall when you put it away, then, when you want to use it if you notice it, the cord is very stiff and doesn't simply stay flat either, the kettle itself is a bit bulky, and since I only need it for two, but mostly one person, it's a bit too big.I know it sounds like a lot of things I don't like, but I actually do think is a pretty good product, it's just this few things that should have been looked at, I think and it's my opinion.I like the color when you turn it on and it is easy to use and fast heating up the water."
This unit stopped working after 14 months of use.Not recommend.
"I ordered two in different sizes, based on the size of the airpot in the building we were putting the kettle in. They both work great. Electric kettles and pretty awesome appliances. The water heats quickly and if you only use it for water, you really don't need to wash it. Just wipe down the outside. Maybe rinse after use if you have a lot of sediment in your water. WE had limestone and it would leave particulate matter in the kettle that we would rinse out.Good pots! Not just for coffee and tea. Good for instant oatmeal, grits, boiling eggs, etc :D  We take ours camping and though we tent camp, we got a site with electricity and hook up with fan and kettle. It makes mornings so pleasant :Dupdate 15 months after original purchase: after 9 months, the kettle quit turning itself off. The heating element would stop heating because the thermostat detected that the water had reached temp, but because it didn’t turn the kettle off, as soon as the water co9led, it would re-heat until all water was gone, then continue this process with a dry kettle. We continued using it for an additional 6 months when we realized what was happening (because it happened intermittently). 15 months isn’t a very environmentally responsible life span for my household appliances. I did buy a second one, but will hope to have better luck. Of course, now that I know what I’m looking at, I’ll contact the company immediately if it occurs again."
"Bought on 3/4/23 and just stopped working today 9/23/24. Great while it lasted, but expected more from what seemed like a quality brand and was double the price of similar options. This is the second one that we've had and both times they lasted about 1.5 years of home use. The first one the lid broke, this one it just stopped turning on. Time for us to just go the cheaper route and get another brand for $20."
I got this kettle a few years ago and have enjoyed how fast and efficient I have been able to boil my water. However recently the kettle auto shut-off feature has stopped working entirely and the steam seeped through the button and gave me a burn. I am past the return/product support window and am disappointed that the quality declined so quickly that is unsafe to use now.
"It hasn’t even been six months, and it gave up the ghost and stopped working today!  Pricey to quit working so soon.  I loved this kettle because it was so pretty and easy to use, but I use it every day to make coffee and to get a quick start for boiling water for cooking.  I usually get a 2 to 3 years out of my electric kettles so I am very disappointed that this one didn’t even make it a year.  I wonder if it can be fixed?  I’m so sad.  I won’t be buying another of this brand.  Be warned!"
"*****UPDATE*******September 9. 2016I purchased this item in March 2015. It lasted for 18 months and then started leaking water through the switch right under the handle. Needless to say the warranty is up and I now own a useless piece of crap. I have downgraded the original 4 stars to 2.*********************The Breville BKE595XL is a pretty good electric water pot/tea kettle. I like the glass body not only for aesthetic reasons (and it really does look nice in the kitchen or on the table), but also because the Schott glass helps to keep the water in the pot hot longer.The construction of the pot is great. It feels well built and of high quality parts. I have had this pot for about 60 days now and have seen no rust developing as some pots seem prone to do after a few uses. I use this pot at least three times per day, every day, and it keeps working as it should. The two buttons on the pot (one for opening the lid and the other to turn it on/off) haven't given me any trouble. The automatic shut off is quite nice. When the pot reaches boiling you can hear the ""click"" of the on/off button as it returns to the off position and that's it. There are no beeping alarm sounds (which I appreciate!) to indicate the water is ready. The base of this unit looks pretty robust, it's better than several other brands I have owned. The cord wraps inside the base nicely and the cord itself is not so short as to be of no use to those with electrical outlets that are set a little high over counter tops. Looking inside the pot you can see the highly polished stainless steal that covers the heating element. The finish on the stainless parts are of a mirror quality.Water rapidly boils in this pot. I haven't timed it, but this pot brings 1700 ml of water to a full boil in what has to be around 7 minutes or so. It can't be more than ten minutes. Keep in mind that the time to boil is relative to sea level. So if you live at higher altitudes it may take longer.Over all this is a great purchase and I would be happy to by it again."
"I have purchased this item twice and both times it quit working in less than 12 months.  The second time, I tried to talk with Breville customer service and it was a horrible experience.  In multiple online sources, the published Breville customer service phone number is missing a digit so it is not a valid number.  After finding a real phone number,  I called more than a dozen times but they do not answer. I finally scheduled a time for them to call me, and when they called, they put me on hold for 25 minutes.  After I spoke with them, they agreed to replace the unit and sent me an email that  stated ""...your order has  been placed...allow 7 to 10 business days for your order to be shipped.""  I waited 3 weeks and contacted them because I did not receive the replacement.  After being placed on hold, I was told that their agent made a mistake and they would not replace the unit until I returned the old one.  Because they had not told me that weeks earlier, I had tossed the old unit.  As a result, they would not send me a replacement.  I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told I had to make an appointment for later in the week.  I made the appointment and they did not call.  This is the worst customer service ever!!!!  I have liked Breville products and have their microwave oven, toaster, and food processor but I will never buy a Breville product again."
"I absolutely love Breville products, but this kettle developed a leak from the bottom in just 2.5 years of use. Not the biggest lost in my life, but that's not what you'd expect from a premium product."
"After several months of searching of a good kettle, I've decided to go with this one.This kettle is build solid and is of great quality. It's not couple of months I own it and it's really amazing. It looks nice and feels nice.It's BPA Free by the way.--- UPDATE ---Update after going through 2 of these - each lasted around 3 years.No physical damage to the kettle. Bot simply stopped turning on at some point.I would expect a kettle at around $100 price tag would last much longer. As much as I like it, I'm not going to get another one of these.The other, maybe a bit minor, issue to point out is the bottom flat heating surface inside the kettle. It's nice and shiny at first. But you have to make sure you wait a little bit after the kettle boils before filling in a cup. The problem is that once you turn the kettle for the water to flow, the water level goes down on that bottom surface, and when it's still hot (which is approximately 30 seconds after the kettle turns off) the water from the surface which is not submerged anymore will evaporate quickly and the heat will result in discoloration / bubbly visual image to show up on the surface, which is permanent and you won't be able to fix it. The problem is that you can't remember to always avoid doing that and I ended up having both of my kettles with these marks in the bottom.Bottom line:1. A kettle at this price point should last at least 6-7 years, but it didn't.2. The discoloration is a real problem because it definitely changes the aesthetics of this beautiful kettle."
"This is my 4th Breville Crystal Clear Kettle (they usually last for one to two years).  What I have noticed with the most recent one I have bought is that there is a film on the inside of the glass that I cannot clean off.I am concerned as to what chemicals the manufacturer is using to clean the glass?  I have boiled vinegar in the kettle to try and get rid of it but with no success. It would be great if Breville could investigate and let us know that their kettles are safe to use.The kettle is sold by Amazon.com, so I assume that it has been verified to be a genuine Breville product and is not a counterfeit.After reaching out to Breville Customer support and trying to clean the glass as instructed.  The 'greasy' spot on the glass is not removable.  So much for the kettle being sold as  ""Crystal Clear""."
"The item stopped working in less than six months. Their customer service is very difficult to reach and their hours of operation that is listed online is inaccurate. I was told I would get my replacement, and then several days later, I received an email stating I needed to return the broken item. Luckily I still had the kettle because the trash pickup did not come. The agent also said this would be a one-time replacement, even though it broke due to no fault of my own.In the email, it said I would receive a separate email for a prepaid label to mail the old kettle back. I never got the email with the label so I had to call yet again and wait over 30 minutes.Overall, I would not purchase this again. Customer service sucks and the item broke way too quickly. Do not recommend."
"Repeat purchase of an excellent product.  Early failure required interacting with Breville customer service.  Very disappointing experience for a higher end brand.  Difficult to reach, slow to respond, confusing and laborious effort for a warranty replacement.  Never did receive the replacement.  Love the product but would choose another brand next time."
"It does it's job of boiling water. With that said, there are a couple things that I don't like.1. The power button lights up when it's on but it's very dim and you can't really see it especially given its location. I wish there was a better visual indication that the kettle is on.2. The max level indicator is really low so while the kettle is pretty large, you can only fill it about two thirds of the way.3. There is no sound made by the kettle when it auto shuts off after boiling is done. Some sort of a 'ding' would be helpful.4. The finish of the handle doesn't match the stainless steel parts."
"I wanted a water kettle made of glass that has minimal contact with plastic. I bought this electric kettle in Dec 2017. I loved the fact that the water tasted so clean, would reach a rolling boil within a couple minutes and cleaning was a breeze. I only boil water that has been filtered using a Zerowater filter. I have not had any deposits. By May, 2018, when the water boiled, the lid would open and I'd just have to close it manually. Once I had turned the kettle on, but walked away. The water just kept boiling until it all evaporated. The next time I tried using it, the kettle wouldn't turn back on until I disconnected it from the power source and turned it back on again. Then today morning, I noticed that the lid would not stay closed even if I closed it manually. It looks like there the top grey ring has cracked on both sides of the handle. I take good care of my kitchen gadgets and I like to keep them looking new, so I am a bit disappointed. I have other Breville products and I consider them to be of very good quality, which is why I purchased a Breville electric kettle. I contacted Breville and they will send me a replacement as this is within the warranty period. I hope the new one will last longer and will not have these issues."
"The fastest boiling kettle I was able to find in the US (so far!)Tested its 1800w against a previous kettle and the speed improvement over a 1500w was clear, though not massive because of the +300 watts.But, hey, faster is faster and that is what it's about for me in the hot water for PG-Tips process.Still missing the 2500w+ UK kettles but it'll do.Glass approach looks nice also.Perhaps the on switch is a touch small/fiddly but, otherwise, nice item.Update (June 2019):Regrettably, this went the same way that some other reviewers have reported.  Firstly (within the first year) the lid began to stick and needed help to lift. Then (at about the 18 month mark), the lid started coming open on its own during the boiling process - which I noticed when the kettle boiled dry so, thankfully, I am able to confirm the boil-dry function works!I still have, and am still using the kettle because it has highest rated wattage I have been able to find in the US...but have to keep the lid down with a flat, aestehtically-pleasing stone.  Hmm..did this kettle really cost me $90+!?Called customer service to see whether purchasing another one would make sense because Breville had taken notice of the apparent lid issues. Was informed that there were no noted product updates, but an unannounced fix 'may' have happened (?) because (paraphrasing) ""Breville are so innovative that I can't imagine they wouldn't have fixed something like that"".  Best advice was to look out for a recent batch number - the four digits on the underside engraved vertically to the right of the product label - tell you the year (1st two digits) and the week (second two digits) of manufacture. So, for example, 1733 would mean it was from the 33rd week of 2017."
"Honestly its a kettle there are really only two things it needs to do.1) It needs to get hot enough to boil water. Does it do this? Yes.2) It needs to let the user know that its boiled. Does it do this? No.As a previous owner of the Ikon kettle this is a serious downgrade. The fact that the kettle steam essentially mars the view makes the see through feature fairly meaningless. The opening of this kettle is more narrow than the previous model, this isn't a deal breaker but its somewhat less forgiving when you are filling it up from a pitcher as I tend to do.The additional wattage is welcome but not very noticeable, its not faster by a huge amount, it is faster but not minutes to seconds sort of improvement. The kettle itself feels less sturdy than the steel version, and its wider at the base by a large margin. What makes this kettle unusable and utterly useless is its inability to indicate that its boiled unless you are in the same room.No bell, no tone, no whistle, nothing. The switch switches off and that's it. Normally I wouldn't write a review but I specifically took it upon myself and wrote to Breville's customer service and asked this exact question. I was told it had a bell - which suggests that either my kettle is defective or that they don't even know their own product. I believe its the latter.I find the ring to be important, I am not hovering over the kettle waiting for it, if you do then this kettle will very likely meet your needs. If you want a reminder that the kettle has boiled while you read the paper or talk to your partner in another room this just won't do, and I urge you to consider avoiding any company where the customer service reps are incompetent, lying or unable to say they don't know the answer but would find out factually."
"For some reason this power cord is much shorter (and therefore more limiting) than on our first one despite being same model supposedly. Happy to modify rating if only we got same 36""-cord base."
"We have been quite happy with our Breville kettle. Unfortunately, the pop-up lid stopped functioning on December 9, 2023, five years after purchase. We had issue with shut off delay while water boiling, and occasionally lid sticking, but otherwise we have used this daily since purchase. The low review is it seems so wasteful for a higher-end product to go into landfill after only five years. I may wait until products last longer before purchasing another electric kettle."
"Purchased this to replace a 3 yr old Breville SK500XL Stainless-Steel Electric Kettle that was getting tired. Design is nice, longer electric cord is also handy. Not impressed with lid..when lid button is pressed to open it takes forever for it to open....its suppose to be ""slow"" but it's really really slow! And the opening is smaller so when it does need to be cleaned it will most likely be more difficult. Twice I have found it boiling with the lid open...I had thought the lid was closed and it wasn't.... never had this issue with the all stainless version. Also, the all stainless version has a bell that goes off when it has completed boiling and turned off ....on this new one, the water boiled, I made coffee, ran up stairs, came back down with laundry and then heard the bell go off....something does seem to be off in its timing! Have been using it for 5 days....maybe it will improve with time!"
"I dislike writing bad reviews.  I am giving it 1 Star only because the people I've spoken to at Breville were nice.  As you can see from my headline, I've returned 2 tea kettles.  The 3rd one broke yesterday in the SAME way the other TWO did.  I loved the look of the tea kettle so much.  I wanted to believe that maybe I got a couple of defected ones and as Breville replaced them with relative ease,  I gave them 3 chances.  Sad to report they all  broke in the same way:  the handle at the top comes away from the connection and when the water reaches a full boil, the lid pops openand won't close.  There is plastic strip that attaches the handle to the glass -- and the heat and weight of the water eventually pulls the plastic away from the glass.  The outcome is that the lid won't close.  I can use it now only by putting a heavy lid from a sauce pan over the top of it to keep the lid closed.  I am SO disappointed.  It is beautiful, however, there is a major design flaw that needs to be corrected.  I'm perplexed at all the 5 Star Reviews. Please let me know if anyone else had this experience.  I'm calling Breville today and asking for my money back."
"I really do like this kettle but it has one major flaw which I can't overlook given the price. After having it a little over a year the lid started opening by itself during operation which is annoying, defeats the auto-shut off feature potentially boiling away all your water, and is dangerous as it sometimes flies open while pouring and if it keeps going after the water is gone (I haven't tested this) could be a fire hazard. Aside from that it cleans up easily, descaling is simple with white vinegar, boils quickly, and never has any funny smells.Using this thing daily I decided to move it away from my cabinets as it lets out a lot of steam in a short period of time if you aren't right there to close it when it opens which is inevitable every time I use it, sometimes while heating, sometimes right when it boils, and if not then it will definitely open when I pour.Considering this product is more expensive than similar options I can't recommend it. If it were cheaper and I was having this issue I'd just get a new one but I feel like I'm stuck with it since it was so pricey so I'm just going to live with it."
"I purchased this kettle Oct in 2023, but after using about 4 month, my kettle does NOT auto-shut-off function. When water start boiling, the kettle’s lid opens and keep boiling. I should manually turn off. It looks very unsafe & manufacturing defect. I couldn’t return to Amazon since return window is closed, so I contacted Breville customer. I created a warranty claim. So far I do not receive a reply except first automatic response. My other old one was very inexpensive, but working very well for a long time without any issue. I just wanted kind of fancy brand kettle in my kitchen counter top, that’s why I purchased this Breville glass kettle. But it does not work properly after 4 months. It’s so funny. I am still waiting for a response from Breville. I’ll update if I have that."
"I really like this kettle. It heats up quickly and the water tastes great. However, be prepared to replace after a few years. We've had two of these. The first one broke in less than three years due to the lid issue that every is talking about. Lid just refused to close after awhile and it would just boil endlessly. The second one broke after on 1.5 years. That one just refused to turn on one day. We did use it heavily but I would expect such an expensive product to last much longer."
"This was a great item but only for a year. The button on the top that opens to fill with water stopped working. I've only had it for a year. The cheaper ones last much longer. I was disappointed by the quality. Usually, Breville is a great product.  Customer service with Breville took 2 weeks to get a hold of someone."
"I liked the idea that it is stainless steel and glass versus plastic. I spent far more for those features.  However, there is something very odd about the interior stainless steel plate on the bottom of the glass - it constantly gets hundreds of dull spots all over it that have to be laboriously scrubbed with baking soda.  I only use filtered water in it (not distilled) and have never heated water below the minimum level.  I don't know why the food grade stainless steel is reacting that way but it looks bad and is a pain. It makes you wonder whether or not it truly is a high-grade/food-grade stainless steel.  I wouldn't expect that to happen in the price range of this product"
"This is an edited review as of 8/31/2018. I have had the kettle for three years having bought it in 2015, April. I would say that it was lovely for the first 18months. Then the top stopped opening. I still use it but I can't open the top and it looks awful. I have to fill it by pouring though the little opening. I think that I will probably replace it soon with something simple and cheap. I think that an electric kettle for which I paid nearly $100 should be better. So I will pay much less and plan to replace every year. The other Breville product I bought was equally flimsy. I must say that the stick blender is amazingly good.I did a lot of research before buying this and I wondered whether I was being a dope for buying an electric appliance when I have a perfectly good stove. But I have a history of burning up teakettles. This one is fast and it is really beautiful to watch. I have had it for several months with no problems and no fires! I am pretty sure it is the best one out there."
"There were two things that after two weeks still annoyed me about this kettle.  First, the rocker power switch that reqires two hands to turn on - I really miss the paddle switch of our old kettle.  The Second I solved - the  first loop of the power cord is about an inch or two short for standard above counter wall outlets.  I was able to solve this by unwinding the cord and rewinding it in the reverse direction.  It’s really noisy too but this seems to be the norm. Would I buy it again? ....nope."
"Several small design flaws in the product usability:- The flat base platform design doesn't allow for a quick return of the kettle into position. I have to wiggle the heavy kettle around left-right to set the kettle in to the base.- Water is in contact with a plastic gasket on the bottom. This is the gasket that connects the stainless steel bottom to the glass.- The ""on"" button doesn't snap back into the ""off"" position. Another brand model I had previously, conveniently automatically turned off when I emptied up the kettle in the process of heating up (because most of the times I don't want the boiled water to reboil, just heat up). An empty kettle will eventually stop heating up, but the button will not return back into the ""off"" position.- The small ""bpa free"" text printed on the glass above the max line is so small and hard to read, that most people mistake it for the max line and fill to it, which results in boiling water spilling.- Under the lid there are small plastic screw toppers that fall out and prevent the lid from closing. Removed them.EDITThe lid stopped closing, pops open when boiling, hot water splashing."
"I returned it because plastic elements are in contact with the water even though it says it's glass and stainless. After exhaustive research and finding it almost impossible to find 100% plastic free electric kettles, I went with a solution that I am now so so so happy with. I bought a small stainless steal kettle (see below Coffee Gator) to keep my water clean. I also like the spout on the Coffee Gator kettle which is perfect for pour over coffee. With the breville, the water spout is not good for pour over coffee because it's harder to control and it comes out too fast.If Breville would make a non-toxic version I would buy it and keep it in a heart beat. I especially like the model that allows you to select the temperature.POUR OVER Coffee Kettle 1L - Stop Burning Your Beans - THERMOMETER Built-in by Coffee Gator - For Perfect Hand Drip Coffee"
"I like it and it basically works.  My only complaint is that if you set it for any temp other than boiling, it takes a very long time to heat the water -- it seems to heat up for a while then turn off and wait for the sensor to read the temperature.  I guess it waits because the heater element is on one side and the sensor is on the other, so it waits for the temperature to equalize before turning on again.  Anyway, if you combine that with the watched pot phenomenon it feels very slow."
"I really love this kettle but the lid hasn't opened for a while.  I researched the internet to see if there was a solution as I did not want to send the kettle back and found that this has happened before with other customers.  I contacted customer service and received back an automated response saying my concern was important to them and never heard back from the company.  That happened twice.  So there obviously something wrong with the lid closure design and you are not going to get any help from the company.  There than that, it is a great kettle."
"I had ordered this kettle twice before and I loved it. They would last approximately 3 years or more. However, this last one broke within a month of using it. I decided to chat with Amazon on 2/9/2022 re: the issue with the kettle which is that the open button (for the lid) stopped working making the kettle useless. The rep “helping” me was asking me to switch the kettle to a new outlet?! As if the issue was with my power! I could tell they didn’t believe me. I was at a doctor’s  appointment so after about 10 minutes of going back and forth with this person I was called in and had to end the chat. But I am very dissatisfied with the support service by Amazon. Unfortunately because of my busy schedule I haven’t had time to follow up and not sure it’s a good use of my time."
"The handle and lid which are attached to the kettle has broken apart after two years of use.  After reading the other reviews, this problem seems consistent with the product. it's not built to last.  However, the price is very expensive for a kettle that only lasts 2 years.  Furthermore, I didn't even use it every day.  Only once a week.  I decided to purchase a Breville, bc it represents quality and well-built appliance, but it was not the case for this kettle.  Very disappointed."
Just like many other reviews stated the lid release button stopped working on mine one day.  The support I received from Breville was about a 2 on a 10 scale.  I won't be buying any more of their products after this negative experience and their lack of support on a known flaw with one of their products.
Bottom of the pot is showing rust in less than a year?!
"So if you've ever had a Capresso, you might think you'll like this.  But you won't.  It's 2-3 times as heavy and quite bulky, too.It does NOT feel good pouring.  I'm not weak at all, the kettle is just a wrist torquer.  Even the heat activation button is not in a handy place, down at the base of the handle.  It's just a terrible ergonomic design overall.  Just not a pleasure to pour...It does the job, it boils fast.  It's pretty to look at.  It has Schott glass, BUT SO DOES THE CAPRESSO.  And it's $30 more than the Capresso (and only boils 1 cup of water more, so not even big enough to warrant the extra $).Overall, it's not worth paying the extra $ for the Breville label.Stick with the Capresso."
"After less than 6 months of daily use the lid mechanism on this kettle failed. If you push the button the lid stays shut and because of the design there is no way to pry the lid open. So the only way to get water inside is through the pour spout. Breville customer service is sending out a new one after I send this defective one back. However, if this had happened after the 1 year warranty period I would have had to buy a new kettle. Considering the premium price you are paying for this kettle, one would expect more durability. I am definitely filling out the warranty information on the new kettle they send me in case it fails again. My previous electric kettle had a lid failure, but that was after about 10 years of use."
"I've owned mine 16 months. Overall I'm pleased. I prefer my cuisinart kettle that had a keep warm feature but this one works well and is much prettier to look at.However recently the top has started popping open. If you don't catch this, which luckily I have each time, it will boil dry. I have ruined kettles in the past this way so I no longer turn it on and walk away."
"I had this same model kettle and loved it for five years, but last month I noticed that it was leaking. I should have paid attention to that! Because both the new kettle I ordered, and the replacement Amazon kindly sent me, have leaked straight out of the box. The leaks happen in two places: where the glass kettle meets the base, and through the On/Off switch. Surely this is some kind of safety hazard to have water leaking through an electrical connection. I contacted Breville support directly but have not heard back from the yet; will update this review when I do. In the meanwhile, something must have changed in the manufacturing process since I bought this kettle years ago. When two brand new kettles both leak in the same places, this cannot be a fluke. I'm not going to try for a third replacement; sadly I am now in search of new brand."
"Pretty, but some functions are missing. There is no sound when the water stops boiling. Also it is big, but you can only fill it halfway, until the full line before it starts spilling hot boiling water out."
"After 1 month from purchase, Breville kettle had developed RUST STAINS on inside.Breville support asked us to send the product back and finaly had sent us a new kettle.Sounds ok right?Guess what?2 weeks later, the NEW ONE became RUSTY exactly at the same spot, even worse than the first one.See the above photos.Now I'm on the phone for 30 minuets waiting to their customer service...Their service also worth mentioning cos communicating with them is extremly challenging.To conclude: product is dangerous to public health (Rust)Over priced $100 compares to alternative kettles at $25- $35.And comes with sluggish customers service.BEWARE.RUST."
"Was disappointed by this product as there is definitely plastic and rubber that come into contact with the water. That said, this one of the better electric kettles I tried in terms of exposed rubber and a plastic smell/taste. If you can accept this, then this is a pretty solid product (although expensive). If you're like me and can't stand any sort of plastic taste to your heated water, this might not be for you."
Heats quickly and is a great size for daily tea making.  Since I don't use the insert or boil I usually fill a bit past the 1lt mark when making a large pot of water for ice tea.  It does drip quite a bit when filled past this point.  I always heat my tea water to 194 degrees.  Unfortunately the default setting is boiling so I have to reset it each time.
"Our electric kettle gets a lot of use - two to three times a day, every day.It's fast, shuts off automatically without fail, and heats the water to a complete boil.Unfortunately the lid has broken and it no longer opens. We can still fill it up from the pour spout but the spring loaded open lid doesn't work (despite fiddling with it for 30 minutes)."
"I was prepared to really like this kettle, having deliberately spent more for better quality, glass carafe etc.  I had read one review mentioning the odor but was hopeful that it was an anomaly.  It wasn't.  The chemical smell when I opened the unit was overwhelming.  It apparently comes from some sort of plastic piece which fits into the bottom of the glass carafe.  In my view, this totally negates the reason for choosing the glass carafe in the first place--which was to avoid chemicals leaching into the boiling water!  I would be very nervous drinking water which had been boiling in direct contact with this surface.  I was sorry to return it but that's what I did; I never even used it.  I hope this company which has a good reputation (apparently) is able to remedy this situation.  I'd like to buy something like this in the future since most electric kettles are made in China and break after 2 years."
Its way to much water for me. And the metal on the bottom seems to corrode only after a month of daily use
I like that there is no metal-glass transition at the lip (the case of many products out there). such lines will accumulate sediments and dirt.. This one has all glass all over (except the boiling base). The on-off switch is non ergonomic because it is very miniature rocking switch. Other models are better with their fairly big levers.  The other issue is that the on switch latches on even when you take the kettle out before it switches off by itself. This means when you put back the kettle on the base it will continue boiling. I don't like this and I feel it is unsafe with the hot switching (the circuit will be live the moment you dock the kettle back on the base....  I feel that the prolonged handle is not balancing the kettle in your hand when I lift the kettle.
"I had this kettle for over a year now and I'm disappointed.My issues with it:1) there was a very bad toxic smell for months. I used the kettle multiple times a day -- the smell was very strong and the water tasted terrible. I had contacted the company of why this might be but of course did not get an explanation but just some advice of how to clean the kettle. (Which did not get rid of the smell)2) there is plastic exposed to boiling water3) glass might be German but it is manufactured in China4) will not shut off automatically if you don't wait until finished boiling like other kettles do5) started to rust a few months agoWhy is it so hard to find a quality, plastic free kettle in the US? There is plenty of people looking for one it seems. I know of several options in Europe but unfortunately they don't work here... It's too bad that there is still enough money to be made selling rubbish."
"I bought this because it was glass, not plastic, and I liked its clean looks.  All good.  The problem is that it draws a HUGE amount of power.  When I plug it into a 110v outlet with 15 amps (with no other appliances running), it trips my breaker every time, no matter which outlet/breaker I try.  So I have to plug it into a 20 amp outlet, which is a pain."
"Made in China! I was looking for something NOT made in Communist China and thought Breville had not surcumb, but I was wrong! No where on Amazon or the Breville website could I discover country or origin or manufacture, AND misleadingly “USA” is included in the title as a regionally available descriptor. Nope. Not made in USA; not made in Australia. Made in Communist China!  Oh, the glass says “German”, but the kettle is Not made in Germany either.  It boils water, and does not feel like the high quality materials of of Breville products Not made in China. I feel tricked!"
"I keep ordering this kettle, it's true. I'm a sucker for aesthetics. However, I have to keep ordering the kettle because it routinely breaks after 1-2 years. This morning, the latch on the lid stopped working but I find that it's normally the on/off switch that tends to go first."
"I'm on my third kettle in three years, but we do use it multiple times per day so I understand that these will wear out. My issue is that with the latest kettle there are two very small screw covers that kept dropping into the water in the kettle. I let Breville know this happened and the response was that I should fix it by gluing the screw covers in with “epoxy glue as it is a non toxic glue and is also feed grade safe”. Pay almost $100 for a kettle that has parts falling into the water and then get told that I need to track down specific glue to fix their mfg issue - unbelievable!"
The kettle's lid opens spontaneously. The auto switch not always turns the kettle off after water gets boiled. I have to watch it all the time for safety reason.  The two pins on the top that support the lid  fell off and got lost somewhere. This device is not reliable and not worth the money I paid for.The customer support is the worst I've ever dealt with. Chat on their website is always offline. The rep over the phone was clueless and would not understand any technical words. She said she would call me back  but it never happened. So I'm left with no choice here....
"I have always been a fan of Breville products and have always had good experience with them.  Having said that, I have to say that I am upset with this junk  product. This product cost 2-3 times more than other kettles, however it is cheaply made. Our Kettle has just cracked after a little over one year use. It has never fell or got damaged by any other object. I was willing to pay more in exchange for a quality product, however this is the shortest lived kettle we have ever owned.My advice - save your money and avoid purchasing this product. It might look pretty at the first few months, however it will not last long.Please take a look at the attached picture and judge if a $100 kettle with light use (1-2 times a day) should look like this only after one  year."
"I wrote a very positive review for this kettle when I first bought it.  However, after using it for a couple of months or so, my opinion has changed somewhat.  The main problem is that it doesn't turn off when the water boils.  It's not a show stopper but it is inconvenient."
The quality is ok. The lid started to rust after a month of heavy use. Too bad. We had to return the kettle.
"Loved this kettle and bought it for the glass plus we’ve had great experiences with other Breville products and support. Then, it stopped hitting a boil and has now gotten to the point where it takes 36 seconds to get to 90 degrees and then it switches off. Support response took a week to tell me “We no longer offer a service program for the Breville Kettles. This means we must no longer offer repair as an option for any kettle.”I will not be spending this much money on a new Breville kettle again."
"I love this Glass Kettle but the Lid keeps Breaking. I get insurance bc the lids break and the product warranty is a challenge. Even though you buy insurance Breville gives me a very hard time for replacement. That's the function of insurance and if the lids keep breaking, FIX the Lids!!"
It's a nice looking slightly overpriced electric kettle that does the job. After using it for one year I noticed that the lid occasionally opens at or right before reaching the boiling point preventing the kettle from automatically shutting off. Breville offered to repair it for half price of a new kettle...
"After spending hours researching electric kettles and sadly discovering that it's impossible to buy one not made in China (with the exception of the Zojirushi water boilers) I opted for this one based on positive reviews, Breville's reputation, and the glass being made in Germany.Guess what?  It's a total disappointment.  It only shuts it self off automatically about 1/3 of the time.  The top often opens at random and won't close.  It's very noisy.  What a regret!  Is it too much to ask for a kettle, at this price, that always works right?"
Looks good but awkward to pour
"I just received my kettle BKE595XL. I was replacing the identical model purchased 5 years ago. I was very happy with the product. My initial purchase was partly based on the type of glass used, Schott glass.The current listing on Amazon and on the Breville site indicated that the product is made with Schott glass.What I received was a product made with DURAGLASS.I am having trouble contacting Breville to discuss the discrepancy and of course I see no way to discuss it with Amazon.Just be aware that you may get a product made with DURAGLASS"
"Looks great. Bigger than necessary, in my humble opinion. Doesn't shut off by itself once waters boils as quickly as it should. And i don't like that the ON button stays engaged once the pot is lifted from the base. I think there are better values out there."
"Worked fine for about 6 months and then....when the water boils now the kettle won't shut off!! The whole purpose of buying this was that it will automatically turn off when water is ready. The always looks dirty, need to constantly boil water with vinegar.. And..as much as like the fact it's class, it is also fragile. We've chipped the spout. I don't blame the manufacturer for that, but it is good to keep in mind that it is a big class pot full of hit water..so eventually I will need to buy a new one.."
"lid's hinge always breaks after a year or two same weak spot,  had three of them... great as long it works"
"Although I like the speed of boiling, the lid just stopped operating after about 4 months. Also, you may want to turn off the kettle before it turns itself off. A furious boil and creates lots of steam if under a cabinet so place with this knowledge."
"The kettle cracked while boiling water. Glass just shattered. Pretty scary.Here's the backstory. I purchased the Breville USA BKE595XL electric kettle in March. I used it once a day for about a month and then stopped drinking tea during the summer. A week ago, I started drinking tea again and used the kettle about 10 times. This week, the button you push to open the lid stopped working. My wife played with it and got it to open and it seemed fine once again. Next time I used it, it shattered.I am posting in case others have experienced the same problem.It's a shame because  it was  great product and I was thrilled.Manufacturer should respond if this is a known issue because this is dangerous."
"I got this because I wanted to avoid ""boiling plastic"" with my water. Unfortunately, due to what can either be categorized as either deceptive or moronic design, the lid is entirely made of plastic. This means once the water heats up the hot steam heats the lid up releasing the strong aroma of plastic (no it has not gone away even after extensive use). Also if not used immediately the hot steam will condense on the lid and off course drip straight back into the water. This is not a good choice for those concerned with avoiding plastics."
"UPDATE 1.5 YRS LATER: Without warning, the lid latch stopped working this week. This is far too fragile for a $200 kettle.----------------As others have noted, this is probably the fastest 120v electric kettle you can buy. There is a clear difference between 1800w (which this unit has) and 1500w (which is where other units max out). Also, the construction seems to be high quality. There is a real heft to this unit. I agree with the reviews criticizing the difficulty in getting the kettle back on the base; I find myself pushing back and forth a bit to find the peg in the middle.. Also, I don't especially like the Breville plug: it's size makes it difficult to align with the receptacle."
"I did plenty of research and bought this for my sister as a holiday present.  She used it for 2 weeks before it broke.  Breville will not allow you to return a product without an authorization code that you need to get by waiting on the telephone for hours, which busy people do not have time to do.  Maybe this was just bad luck that it broke, but it shouldn't be so difficult to return, not for the price I paid for it. Seriously disappointed."
"Product was sloppily packaged inside packing box. It was dirty, and kettle handle is already peeling and damaged. Disappointed that it was purchased “new” and sent this way. Will be buying from Breville instead."
"Works well.  However if you only make a single mug/cup, it may be a problem as it requires you to make 2 cups minimum or the autoshut off may kick into effect for overheating rendering your item useless."
"I love all things Brevelle but this did not meet my expectations.  It's very fragile which makes me nervous just using it on a granite counter top.  It didn't heat any faster than my microwave or kettle, so it was a waste of counter top in my opinion."
"This is our favorite water heater. Works great and looks good on the counter.Recommended. BUT, used to last three years. The newest version's electric switch only lasts about a year.No fix, buy a new one."
"This is a beautiful kettle and it's a lot less plastic contact surface, however the design completely fails to live up to its looks... The lid does not close. I tried soft touch, strong and firm and none worked. The lid just keeps on opening. I accepted a replacement and then read the reviews (my bad) and decided to cancel the order altogether. I've sent the kettle back, cancelled the order for replacement and have received no refund. I hope someone reads this, because I have also attempted all the other channels to initiate a conversation over this misunderstanding but haven't been able to write to the seller."
"This is a great kettle, but there is an issue with the lid which won't stay closed. This usually happens after several months or a year of use. Based on reviews, I see that the issue is going for years. I bought the kettle 7 years ago and the lid stopped functioning in a year of use. I disassembled the lid, found the defect and fixed it. It is a design flaw which can be fixed by the manufacturer. But the manufacturer or designer does not correct the flaw, despite numerous negative reviews."
Love this tea kettle. It boils quickly and quietly. Only rating 3 stars because after using it for a few months there are water deposits starting to form on the bottom.
"Update: I purchased a new one in October 2017. Tried to return it and could not. Two major flaws: the auto-shut off does not work. The kettle will continue to boil well after boiling temperature is reached. Second, the lid would not stay closed after a few uses.The kettle broke after two years. The handle pulled away from the glass -- the lid no longer closes, and the auto-shutoff does not work. I'd say, on average, I used it once per day. No more than that, and typically for no more than 3 servings of water."
"I was excited for the kettle to arrive as I have been searching for a plastic free electric kettle for a while. The reviews I read stated that the only plastic piece on the kettle could be removed. I thought the high price tag was worth it. I was very disappointed when it arrived to find that nearly the entire lid is plastic and there would be no way to keep hot water from touching it when pouring and condensation on the plastic lid to drop back into the water I would eventually drink. Thankfully, Amazon has great return policy. I never used it so I cannot speak to its functionality."
You’d expect a $90 kettle to last more than 2.5 years. Apparently not! The soft close/open lid broke last week. When I was a kid you brought one electric kettle and they lasted so long they became family heirlooms.
"The switch that is supposed to turn it off when the water starts to boil doesn't work. So you have to be around to switch it off manually when it boils. Customer service said we need to clean it, which we did but that didn't solve anything. Then they said they would replace it but after many emails telling us that the item is not coming we still have no replacement. By now the warranty is ended. Its a very expensive piece, looks good but is impractical and dangerous. If we forget to turn it off the plug has to be reset on the wall. Very disappointed with the brand, the customer service and their products."
"I was happy with this but after 3 years, the lid opening mechanism stopped working.  I really don't like replacing things, especially things that cost $100, every 3 years."
This was exactly what I was looking for.  The first one arrived and the lid fell apart within a few days.  Despite my better judgement I ordered a 2nd.  Now after 14 months it burned out.  Very disappointing and I won't be ordering a 3rd.  While it was working it was great.
"had it half a year and loved it, now the rubber around the top coming out and automatic switch off stopped working probably because of that>"
"I bought this 2 years and 3 months ago.  It has worked great until recently which is really disappointing. The lid has become wobbly and unstable and sometimes at peak boil will pop open and boil endlessly until I turn it off.  Today, I found a small black circular piece floating in the water inside the kettle and my guess is it's from the inside workings of the lid.  It's on it's last legs and I have to buy a new kettle which will not be this brand again."
"Poorly cleaned, scratched, used item with water intrusion on edge sold as new. This is very disheartening."
"Less than a week I started to see brown spots at the bottom of the kettle. Kept using it, and there is rust at the bottom that keep getting worst. I have a good experience with Breville products in the past. But this electric Kettle started to get rust, less than a week ago. Im going to think is just bad luck, I purchased the warranty along with the kettle, and try to get a new one. We'll see how it goes with the exchange"
The interior always has a rust to it that I can not get out. It just looks dirty. product works great.
"After owning this kettle for 2 months the light for the kettle which both illuminates the interior and shows whether or not the kettle is turned on stopped working.  Despite being under warranty, Breville refused to replace or repair the carafe."
"After light use for two years, it no longer clicks on to heat water.  Breville used to make quality products, and the old electronic kettle we have after two decades still works. Their customer support isn't very good, and will make you pay for the fix, 60% the original cost!"
"Lid release button stopped functioning. The lid is now shut, and locked in place so tightly that we cannot even pull it open with manual force. Our kettle is out of warranty, and I am getting zero help from customer service. For a kettle so expensive, this is a big disappointment."
"Works fine, but the off switch is failing after one year of use. Tech support from Breville is pretty much like getting help from the IRS"
The first kettle I received was defective from the start.  When the water would boil the kettle would not shut off automatically as it was supposed to.  Amazon replaced that item with a new kettle which worked well for 1 month then every time the water would boil the lid would pop up on it's own and the water would boil away until it was manually shut off.  For such an expensive kettle I expected it to work properly for more than 30 days.  Very disappointed.
"Item looked great when it arrived.  Boiled the water fast and quiet. Used Three (3) times... Then the GFCI circuit blew.  Not a big deal, reset the GFCI and since then the water kettle will NOT shut off.  Tried filling it 3/4 full, 1/2 full, nothing would turn it off unless you tapped the button.  I assume some type of thermal sensor was damaged during the GFCI trip?  My only recourse was to return the item to Amazon."
This is was expensive and it heats well. However the filtered water that I use still leaves some minerals that are impossible to get off even with cream of tartar.
"Glass condensates while heating/boiling and stays foggy after that. Old same model kettle didn’t have this problem. Old kettle had a stamp of german Schoff glass, new one has no stamp or note in the brochure. May be thats the difference. Dont like it."
"Reading through the reviews here I realized that so many other costumers had exactly the same issue.The lid pops spontaneously upon boiling, the kettle would keep heating which could result in the complete evaporation of water and a safety hazard.It is disappointing to see such a basic mechanical defect coming out from Breville. This product is definitely not a good buy."
"The kettle is attractive and heats water quickly.  It has worked well for three months.  Last week-end I used a soft brush to clean the inside.  The glass suddenly broke and a big chunk fell into the carafe.  I was very surprised since I was careful to use little pressure when cleaning it, and the carafe was warm, not hot."
"We needed a new electric kettle, I did some research and read reviews on Amazon, and everyone raved about this item. Upon receiving this item, as I was unboxing the kettle, box had a big warning/disclousure along the lines of ""This item contains a part(s) which is made of chemicals that are known to cause CANCER, this disclosure/warning is only being displayed because the state of California requires it.""Now why in the world would I subject my health to such chemicals knowingly?Thanks"
I tried to clean the bottom inside of the kettle with a soft brush and it scratched the surface.
"I bought this because the title says ""Breville USA""  I was in a hurry and stupidly assumed it was made in the United States.  When it arrived, the box indicates it is just another China knockoff.I realize that I was not thorough enough, but the misleading title really bothers me.The thing works fine, although the fill line is halfway up the glass part, so you can only heat half a container of water at a time."
I only had this for a little over a month and the bottom part is deteriorating. I've found metal flakes floating around in my tea...This product is too expensive to fall apart already. I do not recommend.
After just one or two uses their started getting white spots on the bottom of the tea kettle. Also around the top the rubber where the lid goes in it looks like its rusted water between the glass and the rubber. I tried to take it out to clean it and almost couldn't get the same back together don't take it apart if you see that underneath the glass it'll even break the glass or won't go back together
"I have had this item for less then 6 months, and the whole bottom is rusting, the numbers on the glass have peeled, and the covers on the screws around the ""mouth"" popped out and I found them in my warm water. Really disappointed, as my last Breville lasted 10 years before it finally died."
"There are several issues with this item and had to return the it. First, the display doesn’t stay lit even with it being plugged in and had to lift it off the mount to locate the power on button (frustrating) Second, after boiling the water it left a metal plastic taste to it, and I thought it could be the water source but only filtered water was used every time. Plastic is leaching."
Is there a way to open the pitcher to the wide setting? It is hard to clean and fill!!!
"This has a strong off-gassing smell that is not going away, even though it's been a few days. Also the top does not seal well, so if you tip it too fast, water comes pouring out the side, not just out of the spout. Also not a fan that you have to lift and reconnect the kettle in order to see the settings. I probably won't be using this and will get another brand instead."
It smells so bad when bioled。
"I’m sure this would have been fine for a fully able person, but too heavy for an elderly person with limited strength."
"I like it a lot, it does the job at a very customizable level, but regardless of what setting I use, it drones while it is in the process of boiling? I don't need extra noises making my tinnitus worse, except to tell me that it's done!"
"Leeches out plastic into water. 12 boils later, multiple washes with soap/vinegar, and boiled water still smells like and tastes like plastic."
"I love kettles (they will change your life: do it!) and I'm not a princess. I was however sad that this one managed to come with an actual design flaw: the lid fits too loosely, which means that when you're pouring the hot water (it does heat promptly, yay) steam escaping from the chamber can make it icky to hold. You won't get 3rd or even 1st degree burns, but they shoulda made a better kettle. Duh. I'm too lazy to send it back-that's my first-world problem. Don't let it be yours. Pay 5-10$ more for a better one and don't encourage this sort of corporate sloppiness, esp in this historical moment. They are doing fine. We need our tea. We can't fix the world, but we can have a no-stress cuppa."
I like the size and weight. Fits a lot of water and is very light. The things I don't like is that it is plastic on the outside and the plastic does heat up which just makes me not want to keep it. The reason I got it because I thought it was mainly stainless steel but if the plastic is heating up then that means it's leaching chemicals even if it's BPA free. Also the lid does not open all the way which is going to make it a pain in the butt to fill up and clean out when using. Most likely requesting to return if it doesn't wow me in next 2 days.
"A satisfactory, if unexceptional, water boiling kettle. If you make hot teas or health drinks like us it works well, and could be used to make ramen, instant oatmeal, etc. quickly and potentially for several people (useful for parents). There is nothing special about this kettle, but there doesn't need to be: it works, it is easy to use, it's easy to clean, and if you take some very basic maintenance and safety issues into consideration (the same that would apply for any hot or electrical appliance) you can definitely get a fair amount of water boiled without oversight or too much waiting."
"I really wanted to like this kettle. It is cool to the touch, stylish, easy to clean, and lightweight. I wish the on/off switch wasn’t plastic. It took away from the kettle’s stylish looks, but for the price, I could let it slide.I had two primary issues with this kettle. First, the lid does not open very wide. This made it a little cumbersome to clean and to fill. Secondly, it produced a metallic smell that I just couldn’t get rid of, even after repeated cleanings. Due to the smell of the kettle, I eventually decided to return the product."
"I bought this electric kettle and it does its job but be careful when picking it up after it has just boiled as the steam escapes around the lid. If you pick it up by the top of the handle the hot steam will scald your hand. It also does not have a filter on the spout, so if you live in a hard water area, you may get more than just your beverage to drink over time"
"3 stars because I paid the price for a new kettle, but received a used one. I emailed the seller or customer support and didn't receive any response. I didn't want to go through the return process bcs I needed it right away. As far as the product is concerned its a great quality kettle. You get hot water in minutes and it looks durable. I also like the matte finish. I wish customer service was better."
"Beware of heat that seeps through rear hinde area when pouring boiled water. Some hit my thumb as pouring the heated water, and it burned! Thank God I didn't drp tje pot and scald myself.  Also of note, fluid remaing on walls and inner lid of pot does not dissipate well.  On a positve note, the kettle is substantial. I like the ease of operation."
"We like the way this looks, and it holds a lot, but I got it to use in my classroom and I had to swap it for my more expensive kettle because this one tends to drip and I got a burn from it.  I'm careful and as long as I watch out for that it works ok.  But beware!"
"Hi, hoping someone responds to this review.This kettle has been great, except now , a little less than a year from purchase the lid will no longer stay shut.This has caused the kettle to boil over and out while also evaporating everything that is in it (if the lid reopens). When I keep a cup on top of the lid to keep it shut I have to manually stop heating or the same will occur.I can not get the lid to shut anymore, regardless of if I’ve messed with it.Any help on this issue would be appreciated because it was awesome until this problem!"
We’ve been using electric kettles our whole lives. Yes it is fast boiling but this is how EVERY electric kettle works. This specific kettle is cheaply made. You can see a thin gap under the lid which makes the hot water spill when using and gives you a good burn. It shuts off automatically but takes so long that every time I was afraid it will explode. The only positive thing about this kettle is that it will boil your water and it looks stylish. Other than that it’s way overpriced for what you get. I returned it because it didn’t seem that the kettle will last long and I got tired of steam and hot water burns.
"This kettle is good for heating up water quickly. Unfortunately, it WILL burn you. It has a serious design flaw that causes steam to come out right under your thumb as you hold onto the handle and push the button. All of my family members have been injured by this."
"Very disappointing. There are many things I do not like about this product, but I'll just mention the most significant.First, the water tastes like plastic. Despite multiple washes and weeks of use the water becomes flavored with a plastic scent and taste.Second, the ""auto turn off"" feature that is so standard for electric kettles takes way to long to actually work. This may be adding to the plastic taste.Thirdly, once the water is boiling (and finally turns off) the way the lid is designed allows steam to escape to exactly where your thumb wants to rest when pouring, resulting in serious burn potential. This lid is so poorly designed that it opens about 45 degrees making filling the kettle awkward, and cleaning it annoying.Lastly, the over all feel of the kettle is light, flimsy, and cheap. This is disappointing because it's priced as much as some of the better, name brand kettles out there.In conclusion, I cannot speak lower about this product."
"Works fine, but is pretty loud (sounds like a rocket ship about to take off). Also came with a weird smell to it. Now that I’m re-reading the instructions, it says to clean with saltwater for 30 minutes to remove the odor. I did not do this, but I’m sure that would help."
"I unfortunately had to return this product, I didn’t realize how big 1.7 L was 🙄 . other than that,It is Easy to use and easy to clean. Just keep in mind - the lid doesn’t open ALL the way & it can be annoying ."
"I was super excited to use it today but as I was unboxing it, I noticed the very noticeable scratches... I will be reaching out but being a new product, this should've never left their factory! Just because of that I would rate it a 3"
"I got 2 and gave one to a friend. I didn't start using mine until 12 months after purchase. I have at cups of tea from this kettle at my friends house and noticed the flavor was metallic almost medicinal. I though it was her water. Then my old kettle finally stopped working and I pulled this out of the box washed it and boiled my first pot. SAme metallic flavor. And it's not my water. So rather than continuing to use this and possibly get cancer someday because of it, I am going to throw it out and find a better one.Also a burn hazard because the water will come out throught the lip of the lid not just the spout when pouring."
"Rust appear inside within 1st month, tries soda and vinegar, nothing, would not recommend though working fine so far and outside is easy to clean but rust eliminated all positive feedback"
The on/off lever seems to be faulty it doesn’t always stay down when turning on I'm likely returning it ‘cause it doesn’t feel safe
It was to many watts for my van I had to send it back. 1500 watts was to much pull on my inverter.  But it is a nice kettle.
"Came home to a housefire, this kettle was to blame. Faulty. Never turned off. It was empty and pour cap was open at the time to allow for it to 'airout.' was plugged into a surge protector which was ""reset"" after a shutdown. Arrived home 3 he's later to a slow smoked house 😔 could have been MUCH worse. Buyer beware! $23 isn't worth your home or your life. I will be contacting the company with regards to their poorly manufacture safety. This item should auto shut off when empty or low water, the same way is shuts off with fluids. So dangerous!!!"
"We use kettle many times a day, so when our old one gave up, had to go to amazon to quickly replace it. Saw this model and liked all steel built, the water does not touch any of the plastic parts. However, the way the lid is build, it does not hug the kettle 100% so when you over tilt the kettle when pouring the water gushed through the lid. Unfortunately very unsafe when children involved. I m going to give it a week and see if I d like to return it. Other than the lid issue, it works great.Edit: we burned ourselves couple times with hot water and decided it was enough. Returned and got a different brand kettle"
"The Kettle works great and the outside doesn't get hot, but it's a huge, huge pain to fill or clean. The lid doesn't open all the way, so you have to tilt it at an angle to fill and constantly stop filling and hold it up right to see what level the water is at. Very difficult to clean because the lid doesn't open all the way, hard to reach the bottom."
"Works good, but after 6 months closing mechanism has broken. After 3 month or so it's start working very noisy."
I don't know for how long it should work but I used this for about 1 year.
"I was looking forward to opening and using a sturdy, double wall stainless steel kettle for use at work. When I received the kettle, I was severely disappointed. The plastic covering is flimsy, the steel interior is so thin it might even be aluminum. I do not feel safe using this kettle, since the product papers do not list details about the materials used to construct the kettle ANYWHERE.  The only place it is listed is in the description, probably so that everyone will buy it. In addition, the company title even looks like it's typed in Times New Roman font, and slapped onto the side of the kettle."
Nice Electric Kettle but the lid doesn't always open. Had for about 3 months.
There is a small rust spot in the kettle.
"DOA. After filling it up and plugging it in it doesn't turn on. The on switch light turns on for a second while I hold it down, but then immediately goes off when I let it go. It's possible that I'm doing something wrong, but I'm not sure how. It's a pretty simple device, and the minimal instruction pamphlet doesn't suggest any other steps. Even if I were to get it working at this point I have no confidence that it would continue to work."
The lid assembly breaks easily. It creates a gap between the lid and the body of the unit. Steam rushes through the opening and the unit does not turn off anymore.Lifetime warranty is questionable and the customer service is hard to reach.
Bad Lid design! Will water damage switch and power because once I use it the next time I open the lid  water drips from condensation under lid and drips right down side onto switch !!  So Sad because I like it otherwise !
I love it just wish it were sturdy
"After using this kettle for a couple of months, I would not recommend this product to anyone. Every member of my family has burned their hand at least once from steam escaping from the back of the lid. I had to create a shield on the top the handle to keep our hands away from the escaping steam. I should have returned it. Avoid this product."
"Bought this one 3 months ago hoping since it was twice the price of my previous kettle it would be better, but in reality this kettle keeps turning off so we have to basically watch it to make sure it’s even boiling the water! I don’t have time in my life to watch a kettle boil! It clicks off even when it first starts!"
This kettle makes a high pitch squeal when it is heating up and it drives me crazy!  Will likely return as we have only used it a week and it made this noise from day 1.
"The Veken electric kettle we purchased didn't even last a year before the heating element went out.When we tried to reach out to the company and Amazon for a product exchange or refund, we didn't receive any help or reply. Now the product is not available for purchase."
Steam can escape from under the lid near the handle when you are pouring. I usually use a dish towel when pouring the water now!
Works as expected. Feels cheap.  6 days later still has a VERY STRONG vinyl smell. STILL Hoping it will dissipate.  The lid does not open very much.. will be p.i.a to clean.
"When pouring,  steam leaks from the handle burning thumb. Also tend to “over pour” resulting in spilling and potential scalding."
You can burn your fingers with the lid if you're not careful. It also doesn't stop boiling when the lid is open.
I hate that the lid doesn’t open all the way. And it gets build up way faster than other kettles I’ve had
"After cleaning this with baking soda, vinegar and everything we could think of this kettle continued to leave our boiled water tasting like metal. Seems like there is some sort of coating on the metal that's getting into the water.  Perhaps the metal taste will go away after 1000 usages, but I'm not going to wait that long."
got this a year ago and it suddenly just stopped boiling water.. also the button that opens the lid is defective. i need to press it multiple times and somewhat force it for the lid to open i would like a refund or return this product.. but this isn’t important since the kettle doesn’t even work any more..
"Updated review after use. See photos, kettle eventually rusted, clearly it’s not actually stainless steel.This is a great tea kettle. Wide top makes it easy to clean. Heats up fast. The whole inside is steel. Great product."
"Almost immediately developed  a ""film"" that is hard to remove"
"I thought the water tasting like plastic  was just because it was a new item but… I’m now 2 months in and, still a very bad taste. I find if I brew it with the lid open and pour it immediately the plastic taste is much lighter… Still pretty creepy, I should’ve returned it."
"Worked but was loud.  We live in the country so it's quiet in our house in the morning.  This thing woke everyone up so I didn't get my ""me time"" with my tea/coffee in the morning.  Sent it back.  Stick with my Russell and Hobbs"
stopped working after almost two years.
Steam escapes right to the handle and causes serious risk to burning
Don’t recommend. Died after 7 months. If you pour quickly it poor from between the lid and the top of the spout. If you open the lid to refill right after having boiled water and emptied it scalding steam comes out.
"So disappointed in this product.  After reading all the glowing reviews, we were surprised that the heated water has a noticeable smell and tastes like plastic.  Soaked it with vinegar but still an issue.  Wondering if it's really a stainless steel interior."
"After unboxing I went to rinse it out. When cleaning the spout, the towel came up with black residue. I looked inside and saw this patch of what seems like mold stuck inside the spout. For obvious reasons, I returned it. It’s also hard to clean since it’s so big."
"plastic state last for months and the build quality is poor (see from the picture), there is a big gap behind the lid, the steam pours out and might potentially burn your hand. the Lid only open 45 degree makes it hard to clean. do not buy."
This product is great until you decide to boil water back to back and the condensation buildup on the lid burns your entire wrist and hand. BEWARE. This is a faulty product that can really cause injury. It did for me. I'm about to return it.
The product has a simple switch to push down to turn on. On the pot I received the switch is defective and does not stay engaged. Not sure if it is just this pot or a design defect. I am returning this item.
Could not get through to product service for advice.  Pot did not turn off automatically and boiled over until dry.  Then it shut off.  Other concern was that level marks inside of pot very hard to read.  Noisy when on.
"I can't rate how this item works, due to it arrived damage and was not able to use it. It was sent back the day it arrived. Darn I was looking so forward to this item."
This kettle lasted 2 months before Shorting out and creating a small electrical fire. I have photos. Horrible experience but now I know what it feels like to get electrocuted.
This is not a good kettle. It is very noisy and started leaking from the bottom after only three months of using it. I don’t recommend it.
My finger was almost burnt. There is a gap on the backside between the top and the body. Hot steam was coming out from the back. Very disappointed....
The lever popped up constantly before the water was hot.
Very difficult to set I believe is defective but I just find out this  The switch looks defective
It leaves a terrible and awful Plastic/chemical like smell and flavor to The water. I can’t returned it becauseI threw away the box.
Has a strong plastic smell that can not remove after a half year.
Only buy this if you want it to last 10 months and then die.
Purchased this kettle in Oct. 2019 and its already rusted inside. Very disappointed considering all the great reviews.
Rim is rusted after just 8 months. Looked good while it lasted though...
Terrible Plastic/chemical like smell which has not gone away after boiling wayer in it 20 times. Unusable product
The heated water tastes strongly of plastic making it unusable.
Stopped working after 9 months.
Piece of crap broke 6 months.
The power switch wouldn’t stay down. Returned.
Takes forever to boil water
Rusted on the inside after first use.
This item is crap in my opinion.
Very flimsy. Returned item
"This kettle worked fine for a while but then the lid quit shutting.  Disassembled the handle and lid and found the plastic part that releases the top broke.  Considering the pressure it is under, should be more durable."
"I had this kettle for about a year now. The auto shutoff broke about 3 months in, so after it started boiling I had to manually shut it off. Every now and then the auto shutoff would work. But after a year in, I had a full kettle of water just evaporate completely leaving nasty limescale residue behind. For the safety of my house and your's, I don't recommend cheaping out on something that's so essential for daily consumption especially during the winter.If you do decide on a cheap kettle, remember to boil 1 part vinegar and 3 parts water to help descale/prevent mineral buildup before your first time use with the kettle.If you're coming from an a cultural background where hot water is essential, it may be worth investing in something that's higher brand and quality like zojirushi kettles which would probably last a lifetime. Treat yourself well."
"This product needs to be pulled from Amazon because it's a safety hazard!! Not only is difficult to clean because it does not fully open, the description is inaccurate. Also, you risk severe burns or worse when pouring from this kettle. I returned it ASAP!!!"
This kettle has a lie design issue.steam escapes through the cracks in the handle. I have burnt myself numerous times. I will be replacing this kettle.. BUYER BEWARE
"I'm not able to rate this product - as I never used it. The quality looks acceptable though and very sleek, trendy look. Sadly, I received it when it had clearly been previously used. Not cool!"
"The last kettle we had was a SECURA. It worked 4 years. We bought another one. Worked 1 year and stopped. Now this one is just below 2 years. It worked fine and I would have rate it a 4 star. We use it twice a day to boil 1-1.5 litter. But lately, the auto stop does not work and it over boils until we stop it. This does not happen all the time but enough to raise concern. Few days ago it over boiled and the outlet was burned. Now I am looking for the next hot water kettle. I think we should expect these kettles work between 12 month to 24 months. It is not high tech and no new innovations. It is just built not to last and get you keep on buying."
"Works great, but the boil button . . . the one we use the most has given up the ghost.  I feel like it has been engineered to fail.  I would rather pay more to have this thing for twice as long.  Will be have to do a bit of research to see which products last longer.Probably will not buy again."
"When it worked, it was very convenient. But it died in 5 year with almost daily use 1 time for 1 small pot of water for tea or coffee. The switch died like my other lamps made in China. I wish they use stronger parts. It's a waste because the kettle body is still very good."
"I just got this kettle and I wish that I wouldn't have because of its size. I guess that's my fault for not thinking about it before purchasing. However, it's well constructed, easy to use, insulated well and doesn't burn your hands, but is very large and doesn't fit fully under my sink faucet, so it's awkward to fill. It's also kind of heavy so having to hold it awkwardly under the kitchen faucet isn't great.I think one of the best things about it though is the insulation and the fact that you can touch it the outside of it without burning your hands. A lot of electric kettles aren't like that."
"Over the years I have used the basic kettles for my tea. I drink black tea so the boil only option was fine.  My most recent kettle started having issues with the power toggle not staying down I thought I would replace it with one that had more to offer. Temperature control and keep warm seemed like handy features to have. This kettle does that well, however some things I wish I had known before I bought this model.1) Even empty it is heavy - I have fibromyalgia and the weight of this kettle empty can be problematic on a morning before my muscles have decided to function. Add the water and it is a two handed lift affair. Since this it is insulated/cool touch it isn't that big of an issue but given the amount of hot beverages I drink during the day I can see this may be more of a workout than I'd like it to be.2) The handle - Most of the weight is in the bottom when full of water, the handle doesn't provide much in the way of balance when pouring. It is for sure a two handed process.3) THE BEEP - I am awake at random hours and my spouse is not. We live in a small space and the beep to start and the double beep at the end is very loud. I wish I could disable that.4) The height - I saw the measurements but didn't really think  it would be a problem. It is about 4"" taller than my last kettle. I kept it under my cabinet on my counter and it had plenty of space that the steam was not a problem. This one has to be pulled out away from my cabinets to use it. Given the size of the kettle and the small space that is my counter it tends to be in the way. It makes for a lot of moving back and forth throughout the day.5) The lid - To open the lid you have to push a button inset in the lid. It sticks and doesn't open every time. You either have to push it several times to get it to unlatch or just use two hands and pull up on the lip of it at the spout while you push the button down.These aren't really deal-breakers, but things I wish I had known. I had already disposed of box it came in so a return is out of the question. I will keep using this until I can find one that is more fibro-friendly, but then it is being given away."
"The product is OK, but it is frustrating for a left handed person because the ""fill line"" is only visible if you put the handle to the right.  Same with the LED display--only on one side and only for people who use their right hand to fill and/or pour from the kettle.  The beep saying it has reached it's desired temperature is not loud enough.  Also, if you want the kettle to hold the temp, you have to do it AFTER it reaches the temp and BEFORE 24 seconds lapse.  Sheesh."
"Pros:- Although it looks like the buttons on the handle are capacitive touch buttons, they are actually real buttons under a protective plastic cover.  This is a big plus since you get tactile feedback when you push the buttons, and your button pushes register even when your fingers are wet from working in the kitchen.- Presets cover a wide range of temperature down to 105 F (milk/baby formula).- The outside gets slightly warm to the touch, but the double wall/insulating construction means you (or your toddler) will not accidentally scald yourself.Cons:- Large plastic hinge means steam contact the plastic hinge, condenses, and drips back into the kettle.- Plastic smell from lid/hinge did not go away even after boiling vinegar in the kettle 6 times. This was a deal-breaker for me.- The plastic latch that holds the lid in place makes contact with water while pouring. Less of a deal-breaker, but might matter to some.- Can only set temperature to one of the presets -- can't set a custom temperature.- Beeps when setting temp and when done.  No way to mute the beeping.- Display on the side looks kind of obtrusively large/weird."
"I rarely write reviews, but I think this is a perfect situation for one: to note a major design flaw.  This product is perfectly fine, but it has a huge flaw that makes usage incredibly annoying and messy.The most important thing an electric kettle should do (after heating the water of course) is pour.  Somehow Krups produced a kettle that leaks / drips when the water level is relatively high and you're trying to pour at anything but a full tilt.  For the first 1/3 of my pour, water is streaming down the side of the kettle and onto my counter.  It kind of boggles my mind.  Like, did they test it?  And if so, why were they ok with the leakage?  If other customers aren't noticing this, then they are either pouring very fast, or they never fill it beyond a certain level.  When pouring coffee in a pourover setup, you can't pour fast otherwise the coffee grinds will bubble up and spill over the side (especially at first, when the coffee is still foaming).  Hopefully this review helps."
"We have had this kettle for years and have loved it.  It boils fast, it holds a lot, it's easy to keep clean, it is silent - well, compared to a tea kettle on the stove.  No worries about a whistle if others in the house are still asleep or have turned in for the night.  You can hear it bubble but then it shuts itself off.  Earlier this year, the lid snapped off at the hinge.  The doesn't seem to be a way to fix this so I tried to get around it by gluing a knob to the top of the lid.  And it still worked but eventually we decided we should splurge on a new one.The new one arrived and the lid mechanism felt so stiff to use and closed with such a sharp snap, it seemed bound to break in short order.  Assuming it was defective, we returned it for a replacement -  and found it to be the same.  I see lots of complaints about the lids snapping off similar to how ours did.  We had gotten at least 5 years out of our old one and can't remember the lid ever feeling as stiff as the new one-  I don't know if we got a good one by some fluke or if this has gotten worse over time.  Given the lid problem, I can't reccommend this kettle -  unless you are willing to deal with the lid breaking and gluing a knob on at some point.  I guess we'll just keep going with our wonky one until I figure out what I want to replace it with.  I don't need frills or lights or a window  - it's such a good kettle aside from the lid issue."
"I hate to write this review because on the whole I really like this kettle even though the lid is not great, but I just bought a second one and the lid literally does not open at all. I love that this is insulated, it keeps water warm and easy to reboil and keeps little ones safe. The temp display is wonderful I love watching it go up. The one touch boil on the handle is super clutch, it has the beep to let you know it’s on and the temp display lights up. On my original kettle that I bought a few years ago the lid was the only downside. The button gets steam and moisture around it, it doesn’t work super well an sometimes gets stuck. Usually the lid barely opens so if you need to refill it and it’s hot you’re sol. (I’m aware that many tea kettles have lids that don’t open all the way as a feature to protect from steam but you can’t even push it much further) I use my sink faucet to push it open and it does not open very far. Even with all the issues with the lid I liked everything else enough to keep it. I just ordered a second unit and the lid does not move at all when you push the button. It’s such a stupid design for such a beautifully designed product on every other dimension. They could literally just change it to something you pull instead of push and it would be perfect. I’m hoping this one is just a dud (I expect the failure rate of these is fairly high) and I can try ordering a replacement. Looking at what else is available, I’m not really impressed. The Hamilton beach and cuisinart models are functional but such a tired old design that’s seen no updating in years and they aren’t insulated. The closest thing I can find is the zwilling cool touch pro that’s twice as much money and only 1.5L, but at least it has the normal button on the handle to open. Please fix the lid I will give you all my money!!!!"
"I originally bought a Secura 1.7 liter to replace a very old Hamilton beach 1,7l.  I wanted a full stainless steel or glass kettle that does not have any plastic parts in contact with water.  The  Secura had good reviews, but when I got it, i noticed that it was not a  sealed interior.  There’s a large 1cm hole at the top,  very thin and  sharp-edged, that will allow water into the space between liner and outer shell.  Not a good idea.  One customer has a picture of the hole with rust drips.  It was also really tall.  Finally, the advertised double-wall is not actuall a double steel wall like a thermo cup.  It’s a steel liner with a plastic outer shell (which seems to be true of the others that advertise ‘double wall’.  That went back.So, I checked the Krups smart temp digital and a Miroco, both of which seemed to be fully sealed stainless double walled.This time, I got both together and compared.  The Krups is taller and heavier than the Miroco.  But the steel edges of the Krups is slightly smoother and the steel slightly thicker.  The miroco steel liner seems to be as thin as they could get it.  However, the miroco won out immediately because it is shorter than Krups by about 2 inches, and lighter, but most importantly, the diameter of the opening is large enough for me to easily put in my hand.  For the Krups, the lid didn’t unhinge enough, and the diameter was barely a large enough to put in my hand.secura: some design flaws (sharp hole in inner liner), giant sized.Krups: heaviest, taller, narrow opening, but slightly better build quality,Miroco: no holes inside, relative light (though still much taller than my old Hamilton beach 1.7, larger opening.  I’m keeping the miroco.Note that none of these three has a double wall of stainless steel.  However, the outer plastic shell does prevent scalding by insulating the hot inner steel with a layer of air and plastic.Finally, I boiled tap water in the miroco, and it did indeed boil at about 7 minutes from about 75 deg F.One final observation, a week after using it regularly, it still has a plastic smell after boiling,"
"2nd update:It still heats and stays cool outside as the first day I got it... but the bloody lid is still noisy has hell when you close it, and there is no way to avoid the loud ""clack"" noise when you close the damn thing.Ditched another star because of it and will keep doing all the way to zero.Update: After using it for few months it still heats the water as it is supposed to.It is a kettle after all.Yet the lid is so clunky and loud every time you close it it goes with a slam.I though after some time the hinge was going to break in a bit, but no. It did not improve a at all and it is still very loud.Took off one star because it is so annoying.It is cool to touch and it feels actually cooler than expected. By that I mean it is barely lukewarm.Obviously, you need to be careful with the spout which is the only part that will get hot.The kettle is plenty stable on the base. Some people complained that it is not stable, but it is as stable as any similar good products. The kettle will slightly wobble if you push it, like most the electrical kettles, but to displace it you really need to make knock it down deliberately. For those who have succeeded in doing that, I do not know what to say...Inside is all steel including the cap. There is a tiny rectangular piece of ""Teflon-like"" material near the hinge, which has spurred 1-star reviews from the purists, but that part will hardly ever be in touch directly with the water and release anything that is harmful just by being in touch with the steam.When you pour the how water it does it smoothly, feels well-balanced and steam does not come to your hands which is great.I knocked down 1 star because it looks a lot more glossy than in the photos, which makes it look a little cheap, despite the shape being well designed and it is a bit flimsy, also the switch despite it looks good and is well illuminated feels a bit cluncky. I paid 29.99 when the price was reduced, but for these 2 reasons, it is the right price. No way I would have paid 59.99. OK, maybe 39.99.If you do not mind the glossy black and are not as picky as I am it is a well-designed kettle and it works just fine and will not burn you to the tough. So it will be great.Had it been white or matte black dark gray, it would be worth 69.99.I will keep this one anyway since it works well and maybe buy a matte black when I find one that I like."
"... I wish the top would not have to be forced down to close it before usage. It makes this horrible snapping sound and I always expect it to one day just snap off. I love that the interior is stainless steel and not plastic. The black color makes it look modern but the pouring sprout is messy. I typically boil water for my tea every morning but as I'm pouring the hot water, the spout can't seem to be able to handle the water flow (it has holes in the spout) so it ends up spilling at the sides of the spout. Odd. It's ok for my needs but has room for improvement."
"This kettle is worse than useless. Initially, it was functional but I found it annoying because after it boils, you have to wait for it to cool completely before you can use it again. So you can’t just add more water and turn it back on. Now after just 8 months, it turns itself off before the water even boils and you can’t turn it back on to get it to boil all the way. Total waste of money."
"I purchased this kettle to replace Krups kettle I had been using for fifteen or more years.  I drink allot of tea.  That kettle was the simpler model.  This new kettle heats the water quickly.  Has multiple temperature settings to choose from, something I have not used.  The issues I have found are the lid, which is supposed to open with a touch of the button, fails to do so about 95% of the time.  I have taken to aiding the opening process by applying some upward pressure on the lid while pressing the button.  Also, the button to start the heating process must be pressed and held in briefly in order for the unit to turn on.  I now watch the display on the side of the kettle to be sure if has turned on.  If the set temperature does not light up then I was too quick to release the button.  These issues are annoying but don't affect the operation of the device once you get used to it."
Design is nice and the appliance is sharp and looks good.  Modern appearance.  It takes roughly 7 to 8 minutes to heat a full pot of water.  My old Krups did it under 5 minutes.  The pot is difficult to fill with no external markings to show level of water.  The internal markings are clearly designed for a right handed person as they are only on one side of the pot.  If you are left handed avoid this product.  Ideally the level markings should be on both sides so anyone can grab it with any hand easily fill it and see the level.  The lid when open does not fully give access to fill the pot.  You need to manually pull on it it to reach the full open position.  Again an inconvenience for filling.  For the price I paid which was 30% off I cannot complain too much.  It does the job but I have had cheaper pots that heat faster.  the features are ok which is preset temps for various brewing or uses.  It also has a stay warm option for 30 minutes.  Temps are accurate when measured with a probe thermometer.  Overall decent but better kettles available.
"The pot works great and boils water very quickly, shuts off when it’s done, I thought it was exactly what I wanted. I’m disappointed at the discoloration (rust??) between the glass and the heating plate. We have only rinsed out the inside of the pot, never immersed in water so don’t understand why this would happen. And it is getting progressively worse so this one will probably go in the trash and I will buy another brand"
"Looking for a 1.5L or 1.7L electric kettle with an all-stainless interior, I decided to give this Krups model a try, as I figured being a larger/older brand, quality would be decent. Unfortunately, I'm very disappointed.Here were my issues:1) It is NOT 100% stainless steel on the inside. Close, but not quite. I know I'm being picky, but the hole near where the handle is that creates a steam channel to activate the off switch is lined with white plastic. While this doesn't directly touch the water, steam does collect there and drip into the pot. So yes, some small amount of water will have touched plastic.2) On a similar note, when pouring water, if you pour VERY slowly you can get it to pour only through the spout. However, if you pour with any angle/degree which places the water level above the spout, it will leak out through the front of the lid above the spout, running over the exterior black plastic framing piece between the top of the kettle/lid and the spout before entering the cup. Sort of defeats the purpose if you're trying to avoid plastic touching hot water.3) On the first couple of boils, I definitely caught a slight smell of new plastic. Now, this may dissipate with time, but given the other two areas where plastic comes in contact with the water, I'm not going to put it through its paces to find out.4). As others have said, there's no minimum fill line.5) Not an issue, but the on/off switch is marked with Chinese characters. Why does it even need marking? Or why not I/O symbols? It just shows poor quality control oversight on the part of Krups.So, back it goes. Sigh."
The unit functions just fine and heats water as expected. I kept thinking after many washes and use that the odd plastic smell would go away…no such luck. I only use this now to heat water for cleaning purposes. Don’t buy it if you are sensitive and concerned about this being a health issue.
"I need a lid that opens fully. On the plus side I loved how quickly it heated. On the negative side, I wasn’t real excited about all of the chemicals that are in the product not listed in the Product information."
"This was a nice product while it lasted. However, the screen that indicates temperatures started to malfunction within a few weeks after the product support window closed. Since it is largely unusable without being able to read the temperature, it's just going in the trash. Can't recommend."
"The display panel doesn’t display the number in full.  After completing 195F heating, the display immediately changes to 100F.  It is not “live” as Advertised.  water limits are not clearly displayed."
"I am a coffee drinker and kind of a snob about it. So I love the exact temperature that the kettle delivers.  However, to do a slow pour over freshly ground beans is not possible without dribbling HOT water all over the counter. I want a ""slow"" pour over to extract the caffeine.  This spout allows water to follow around the lip and down the side of the pot.  Most water goes into my one cup filter but about 1/4 ends on my couter.  When you tip the kettle further and do a faster pour the water does not drizzle down the outside."
"The product description implies that it is possible to check water temperature.  ""Customers like the electric water boiler for its heating capabilities. They mention it's easy to use and set up, and the water temperature updates while it're boiling. ""This is not true.  Maybe Amazon shipped the wrong product?  I find no temperature gauge and, what's worse, I don't think it reaches true boiling temperature at high altitudes.  As soon as it starts to bubble, it shuts off.Otherwise it seems reasonably sturdy given the price range.  It is fast heating and looks easy to clean.  I have had multiple electric teakettles, some quite expensive, and if they last four years that is all one an expect."
"i love how quiet it is and how sleek the design is. very easy to use and clean. and best of all it doesnt get hot on the kettle exterior, handle, or tray. holds lots of fluid and easy to refill for more hot water making too. so far loving it right out the box and very highly recommend. will update if anything changes 👍update: it's been a few weeks now of use and I have to knock it down to a 3/5 stars. I've noticed the lid has gotten quite finicky to use. the kettle has a push top button but it doesn't successfully open the lid on first try and I find myself having to fiddle with it a bit before getting it to open. there's also a bit of a strange plastic smell to the water despite following manual instructions before first use. unfortunately, I'm not entirely satisfied with the kettle any more but of the ones I've tried so far it is the safest in terms of the outside not getting scalding hot and one of the easier ones i've tried in terms of cleaning it and using the controls.update 2: knocked off another star b/c now, since purchasing in may, the push cap has become even more difficult to open - it just won't open even at certain angles of pushing. and, worst yet, i now started noticing plastic smells coming from the water i heat up inside it ... makes me wonder if the water is getting infused with plastics..."
"UPDATEIn just under two years the ""boil"" button only works one time in twenty. Its lid has been a challenge to open for a while now. The warranty is useless. The Krupps name means nothing anymore.ORIGINAL REVIEWInspect carefully for manufacturing defects (but accept the design flaws)Close inspection my new KRUPS BW801852 reveals odd, yet acceptable, design choices and an unacceptable manufacturing defect.I love that this kettle can be set to various temperatures. The manual recommends temperatures (pictured) for appropriate temperatures, including 200˚F for french-press coffee. Unfortunately there is no 200˚F setting on the kettle. I knew this before purchase and can live with it—I plan to get it to 195˚F with the provided setting, then switching it to boil and manually interrupting it when the water reaches my desired temperature. (I hope that will work—I have yet to use the kettle.)Looking at the bottom of the base (pictured), you can see there are two feet, which is an interesting design decision because, for the same reason a tripod has three feet, two feet to not provide very stable support. My last kettle, which had three feet, would also tip a little if you pushed down on the edge between the feet, but not so much as this one does (pictured twice). Still, it's not a deal-breaker.The reason I am returning this kettle is what I hope to be a manufacturing flaw. The bottom of the kettle is flat—which is good. The top of the base is not—which is bad. The base is warped in the area where the cord comes out (pictured twice), leading to additional rocking of the kettle.By the way this kettle was packaged: with clumsy tape (pictured) and rattling contents, I suspect it was previously sold to someone else who also noticed the flaw. I am very disappointed that the seller tried to pass it off on me, particularly if the previous customer notified the seller of the manufacturing defect.I am returning this kettle for a replacement; it does have some design issues, but overall I like the appearance of the kettle: the interior does not seem to have any plastic that comes in contact with the water, there is no lip at the top preventing the last bit of water from getting out, and it is quite good-looking. I'm also happy that the descaling instructions suggest using vinegar or a citric-acid solution, rather than trying to sell a proprietary formula.One last thing: There is a sticker on the side of the kettle showing what the display will look like when it's on (pictured). I wasn't sure it was a sticker at first. Be sure to remove it before you use the kettle—but not before checking for manufacturing defects.When I receive my replacement kettle I will update my rating and review.Cheers!"
"The latch and hinge mechanism is made of plastic.  While pouring water doesn't make direct contact with these, the evaporating and condensing water does."
"It was a lovely kettle while it lasted. I loved the option to heat water to 105F for instantly drinkable cocoa. I loved using the higher settings for tea. It boiled water faster than the stove without heating the kitchen. The base is quite convenient, and the lid opened at the press of a button.If only it lasted longer than two months…"
"Well it worked great, until it didn’t!  Hope krups customer service will send me a new one?"
"Returned. I bought the Krups Smart Temp electric kettle after searching for an affordable, stainless steel interior electric kettle. This was the second out of three electric kettles I tried. I needed to replace my previous kettle that finally broke after 5 good years.Pros: I like how much water this kettle holds, is relatively quiet, is pretty quick, and I’m able to select my preferred water temp. Also, after a few uses, there were no signs of rust. (The first new kettle I tried rusted on Day 2 even though I only use ZeroWater filtered water).But! There were two huge negatives that forced me to return it!- Plastic in the interior: I was disappointed to see part of the plastic lid and plastic hinge are exposed in the boiling interior. Some people are okay with plastic not touching the boiling water, and if you’re one of these people, then the Krups Smart Temp will fulfill your needs. If you’re a person who wants an absolutely plastic-free boiling interior, then try another kettle. About 1/8 of the plastic lid on top of the kettle is not covered with stainless steel and is exposed to the inside of the kettle and the condensation. There is also a plastic latch that keeps the lid down located inside the spout of the kettle.- Terrible odor: What really pushed me over the edge is the burning plastic odor the kettle gives off after heating. I didn’t taste the odor in my water on the first cup, even though the smell was obvious. I would only taste the burning plastic in my water if the boiled water sat in the kettle, even as little as 30 minutes. And for those reasons, I’m out."
"I purposely bought this kettle because in the description it states it has a keep warm feature. It does not, only off and on. For the price I would next time buy an off brand that are $10 cheaper."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Water drips from the spout every time you pour. Additionally, since there is no rubber seal around the lid, water spills from the lid when the bottle is full. If you don’t want to wipe your countertop every time you use it, don’t buy this product."
"This kettle was used heavily for 18 months, multiple times a day.  Good kettle, fast to boil, but not as durable as one would have hoped.Quick list of thoughts about the kettle after using for a while:Hinge Quality:  The lids hinges are made of plastic, eventually weakened and finally broke.  Probably cycled the kettle about 1k times, so meh.  Rest of the kettle is fine.Stainless Interior:  The top lid is plastic, but wrapped in stainless, but water will condense and drip down from the internal plastic after a boil cycle is complete. Also looks like a silicon wrapped temp sensor on the bottom within the water reservoir.  Potential small theoretic exposure to plasticizers.Temperature Management:  Temperature range options are a fixed set of temperatures that are unable to be adjusted. I was expecting that the adjustable temp allowed you to specify a specify temp for fine adjustments.  Alas no.Apart from that, still one of the better kettles I've bought recently, and still in good shape minus the hinge issues."
"The kettle is easy to use and nice looking, Heating takes about 5 minutes.  However, the lid will not always open and have to repeat pressing the button on top several times to get it to open.  This occurs often.  Not sure why because the mechanism in lid to allow to open moves appropriately.  This did not start happening until about after a week of use or I would have returned.  Otherwise kettle works well.Update:  The electric kettle lid not opening until pressing lid button several times has gotten very annoying.  Now, after using for a little over a month, has stopped working.  Digital temp reading reads ""212"" when water in kettle is cold, then if press on button again, reads ""EI.""  Too late to return.  Will need to contact company."
"We were delighted when we received this lovely electric kettle by Krups. [Order was placed on 14July 2023 and was received on 15July 2023] Because this purchase was heavily researched; we were happy when it arrived on time and intact. HOWEVER, the kettle has since died! Tried different outlets and no dice. On Friday, 22 September, I called Krups North America and spoke with someone named ""Emilio"" (at 9:55AM) who assured me that I would receive an email from Krups where I would get my kettle repaired and if not repairable, I would receive a new pot. I am extremely disappointed and somewhat disillusioned because I have been  a big Krups fan with many of my electronic kitchenware."
"This was disappointing in several ways.  For one thing it's pretty heavy, with even 1 liter of water in it.  Someone had done a comparison between this and the Cuisinart, concluding that this was definitively lighter.  I should say that I'm over 70 with small, somewhat weak, hands and wrists.  While you can set it to maintain it's selected temperature for something like 30 minutes, that's only if you don't break the circuit by lifting it to pour.  I've never tried just leaving it as I've no reason to do that.  I also thought that it came with some sort of filter but apparently it does not.  I do like the fact that it brings the water to temperature quicker than my electric stove top and probably uses less electricity.  It also allows me to set the temp to 195 for my coffee.  If I got another electric kettle, I'd probably buy a 1 liter instead of a 1.7."
I use this product to boil Water for tea. Can't see how much is filled.  Other than that I like the KRUPS Cool touch
"This is a nice sized kettle, easy to use, and very nice except for the lingering smell of melting plastic after each use. The odor really bothered me, so I returned it. The interior is all stainless steel, I'm not sure what part (base, plastic exterior?) is the part that stinks, but it did not fade or go away after a couple of weeks of use."
"UPDATE 12/27/21: After less than two years, the lid broke (as has happened to many others here). So one star.---------It's not the easiest kettle to use. My wife, a tech writer who's no slouch with gadgets, couldn't figure out how to turn it on.  I'm an engineer (not a German engineer, alas), but after several months, I still fumble with it:- To turn it on when the display is dark, push BOIL twice.- To turn it on when the display shows the temperature, push BOIL once. If you accidentally push it twice, it turns off (oops).- When you place the kettle back on the pad, the display initializes for a second or so. Even though the display is on, it's not showing the temperature yet, so you have to push BOIL twice. But if the temperature displays between the time you see the display initializing and you hit BOIL, be sure to hit BOIL just once -- otherwise, you'll turn it off.- To activate the 30-minute stay-warm (no option for 60 minutes), press and hold the thermometer button until a little icon silently appears. If you don't hold it long enough, it turns off the kettle (oops). Since the kettle turns off after lifting it off the pad, to activate stay-warm after replacing it on the pad, first turn on the kettle again by hitting BOIL twice if the display is still initializing or once if you see the temperature (see above). Then press-and-hold the thermometer.  Got it?- Since the buttons are modal, it's crucial to see the display. But that's difficult if the kettle is in front of a bright kitchen window, even when the sun isn't directly on it.- It's less convenient for left-handers -- we have to make an extra effort to turn the kettle so the oh-so-important display is facing us.I like that the kettle boils water quickly and is reasonably straightforward to clean.  The lid can open almost to a 90-degree angle, though it's hard to get big hands into the kettle.We'll see how long it lasts. My last three electronic kettles from Amazon lasted about 18-24 months each, despite having good initial reviews."
"This does heat water to the requested temperature and hold it there for 30 minutes if you like.  So it does what it claims to.  However, it's enough of a pain that you would be better served buying something else.  My issues:*) The beeping.  If it is keeping water warm, it beeps regularly (probably every time it brings the water back to the requested temperature.  Beeping to let you know the water is ready is useful.  Beeping to let you know it is still ready is just annoying).*) Keep warm turns itself off when you pour the water.  If you are boiling a large pot of water so you can make yourself several cups of tea, every time you pour the water you will need to restart the boil and push and hold the Keep Warm button.*) The fact that there isn't actually a Keep Warm button.  They saved some money by combining the temperature-select button with the keep-warm button.  If you don't push and hold the button long enough, it changes the goal temperature and stops the boil, so you need to start again.So none of these are major issues (well, except the beeping which drives my wife crazy because this kettle is in the TV room), but they are all annoying.  I certainly wish I had bought a different kettle."
"I ordered this kettle mainly because I wanted something with live temperature readout and NO plastic inside. Unfortunately this kettle has a plastic clip right above where the water comes out of the spout that heats up, but comes close, however ultimately doesn't, touch the water. Also the latch mechanism for the lid inside also gets hot and condensate could drip from it. It is also plastic.Ultimately it's a decent kettle but if you're plastic conscious this is not the holy grail, not even close. I wouldn't have purchased had I realized this.Also the temperature presets could be better, a few more would be nice. Something like 120f, 140f, 170f, 185f, 195f, and then boiling would be nice."
"The kettle has an almost-good design with its multi-temperature setting and some attempt to prevent hot water from touching plastic. Yet, the top of the lid and a part of the lid bottom are made from plastic, so the steam goes right to these plastic parts, condenses, and drops back to the water. This almost-good design is completely ruined by poor manufacturing, which uses cheap soft plastic. This plastic is affected by the steam and emits a heavy chemical smell. I used the kettle for over 7 months in the hope that the plastic will  ""season"" and the smell will gradually stop. But the smell is still there.Moreover, it is hard to pour hot water so that it doesn't touch the plastic in the lid. As a result, the tea has a very light plastic smell as well. I started to use it less and less and eventually gave up. It was a very disappointing experience. I hope that Krups will do better in their next model. I have several other Krups devices and have no complaints about them."
"Though I don't really like this thing, I'm keeping it.  My goodness, you shouldn't have to spend so much time finding a kettle.  But, I have.  This is my, 5th?  I'm so sick of buying awful kettles I've decided to keep this one.First, it boils well.  It's not the fastest, but it's fine.  I like the looks of the actual kettle, but the handle is super cheap looking.  Hate it.  Really Hate it.  From a distance it almost looks as though someone fashioned a handle out of aluminum foil.The lighted temps are useful.  I like this feature.It has a huge design flaw though.  Flipping the kettle open doesn't come up all the way.  It opens about 80%.  This causes two problems... 1, it's hard to get your hand into clean.  2, and more importantly, if you open it just after you've boiled water, it will fling all the condensated boiling hot liquid onto your hand.  I know this because it burned me badly, and I know now you cannot open the top until several minutes after it's finished.So. This thing badly burned me.  And I'm keeping it because it isn't as awful as all the other ones I've tried.  Not really a recommendation as much as a ' I give up! '"
"As a serial hot-tea drinker, I had high hopes for the German made Krups Electric Kettle. Alas, my experience was not a positive one. Instead of venting, here are some bullit-listed points I experienced:- The On/Off button and overall user interface of the kettle was confusing and unruly to me. (And I work with computers as my day job!)-  The boiled water smelled like plastic even after months of using the kettle.-  The mechanism that opened the lid worked intermittently.-  The inside material kept developing mineral deposits despite using distilled water to boil.-  Cleaning of the kettle and reaching its bottom to clean is extremely difficult.-  The lid's cover popped out and dropped some plastic shards inside the kettle.I decided to order an old-fashion stovetop kettle instead."
"My reliable Krups kettle of many years stopped shutting  off when boiling, so I bought this one. I immediately heard a noise like a loose part rattling around when I decanted water. I called Krups and the representative said that it is probably just the metal contracting (what??). Now it is 2 days over the 30 day time period when Amazon allows returns. It is a burn hazard.  To return it to Krups will probably cost more than the kettle. Very disappointing."
This is good but very loud while heating the water up. That part is hate about it.
"I like this kettle. It heats quickly, insulates pretty well, and gives decent control over the water temperature.But: the keep warm forgets once it's lifted off the base, so that's useless. Also it beeps and I friggin hate stuff that makes extra noise (and stupid bright always-on LEDs, etc).I disassembled it and cut the wire for the buzzer. Now I like this kettle, but I'm annoyed I had to do that myself.I'd buy another since I know it can be fixed, but they jacked up the price.FWIW this is better than JDJEN or whatever other 'brand' kettles. But for frick's sake stop foisting cheap anti-features (BEEP BEEP) and flubbing the the useful features (keep warm, please, even after pouring)"
"I purchased this in late July and got a couple month's use out of it before it formed a rust spot on the stainless steel interior near the spout. The lid is cheaply made/poorly designed and doesn't always pop open when the button is pressed. Their warranty process is horribly slow and it's taken over six weeks just to get confirmation that I will receive a new unit another six weeks from now. If I hadn't pestered their CS via email, I would have been left in the dark since they do not give you any status updates unless explicitly requested. By the time I receive it, I would have had it in service twice as long as I've used the product. It's too bad it didn't happen during Amazon's 30 day return policy. Disappointing.Warranty troubles aside, I do like the kettle. The digital gauge is easy to read and the overall design is pleasing. It does what a kettle does but looks and feels mostly nice in the process. One big plus is that the lid is reasonably free of gaps that would allow hot steam to burn your hand while pouring. Some cheaper kettles I've used had this issue. That being said, I think the product should really be closer to $40-45 than $60. It's a steep price to pay over boiling water on the stove."
"We purchased this kettle in June of 2020. It’s now July 2022 and it’s about dead.It works great! I liked the ability to choose the temperature. I also prefer a kettle with a larger spout as this on has.The design is simple and easy to clean.A couple months ago the lid broke. It would stay closed but was difficult to open. No problem, I just Filled it thought the spout.Now the kettle is telling me it is at the set temperature when I know it isn’t. I tried unplugging it, wiping down the areas where it connects to the base and it still tells me that it is 212 when I’ve only just filled it with water.So I’m done with electric kettles and have ordered one for my cooktop."
"I did not like the led numbers, hard to read. I also prefer to see the water line with a fast glance"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Following the directions for use, I set this Krups digital kettle up and clicked the boil button. The water was not overfilled. I was excited about the kettle and was running video to show a friend. The kettle would not shut off and spewed boiling water everywhere. I unplugged the unit and mopped up the mess. I drained most of the remaining water and pressed the lid button so I could refill the kettle. (The instructions advised to discard the water the first 3-4 times to rid the unit of ""dust."" Dust must be German for ""plastic smell."") After draining the kettle I pushed the lid button and it splashed boiling water on my arm. I plugged the kettle back in and it had not reset and continued towards boil. I also made sure the water was approximately ½ - ¾ inch below the ""max level"" line. No water spewed out the second time, however the kettle did not auto shut off. I waited over a minute and finally unplugged it.Initiated a return and I won't go there but the ""troubleshoot"" option was a joke...good luck with the contact the manufacturer option as well. 🙄 Since the UPS Store is across town in a very bad area, and the most convenient UPS Access Point nearby no longer provides that service, I am further inconvenienced by having to pay for UPS to come and pick up the hazardous kettle shipped and sold by Amazon. WTG Amazon for doing a double donkey 🫏 to your customers."
"This thing looks great sitting on the counter, but is frustrating because it has no memory for settings. Instead, you have set temperature and keep warm after every lift of the kettle. If you’re pouring water several times over a short period, you might not be happy (hellooo, Gaiwan users), especially when you experience the kettle’s poor usability.Pros:- looks good- boils water- wide opening for cleaning (see picture)Cons:- no memory for settings- the display, especially keep warm, is hard to see in a sunny kitchen- too many beeps- latch and hinge are both plastic (but otherwise metal inside)- “Only a German engineer would find it easy to use” -another reviewer"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I initially purchased a Krups water kettle, which unfortunately failed after just one year of use. Despite my disappointment, I decided to give the brand another chance and bought a replacement. However, after only 4 months, this second kettle developed a serious issue—it stopped shutting off automatically, posing a significant fire hazard.What’s particularly frustrating is Krups' response to this problem. When I contacted their customer service, I was told that I would need to send the kettle in for repair, which could take 2-3 weeks. They refused to send a replacement or offer a refund, leaving me without a functioning kettle for weeks.This entire experience has been incredibly disappointing, and I will not be purchasing any Krups products in the future. If you’re considering buying from Krups, be aware that their products may not last, and their customer service is far from accommodating."
"we have owned many electric kettles over the years, some more expensive, some cheaper. before this one, we owned a different, simpler krups model that lasted many years and that we loved. when it finally died, we got this one. we've had other krups appliances and generally find them to be sturdy and well-made. this kettle was a big disappointment from the start. because we live at a high elevation, the temperature control setting is a big pain. water boils at 202 degrees where we live, and this kettle refuses to auto shut-off for a very long time, boiling and boiling, trying to reach 212 I suppose, and there isn't a way to adjust the temperature to what we need. our bad, for buying something too advanced and yet not advanced enough. but besides that, the shape of the kettle and handle are not ergo-dynamic at all and makes this tall kettle very awkward to pour. finally, since we got it, the pop-up lid has given us problems, not popping up and requiring repeated pressing of the button. finally, about 9 months now since we bought it, it gave out on us and the whole lid has now broken off its plastic hinges. true, we use it several times a day since we work from home, but we've never had this issue with any other kettle. the warranty/returns process sounds far too much trouble for what it's worth, so it seems hopeless to try that route. So, for the price and the good brand, a big disappointment overall."
Great idea but the water tastes like plastic.
"The way they have overlaid the numbers versus the numbers that illuminate makes it extremely difficult to read what the temperature actually is. Also, you have to press the buttons on the handle quite hard to get it to start. It shouldn’t be this difficult to use."
First — this thing is big! And you have to fill with at least 12-16 oz of water based on the “minimum” line.The temperature control has several preset temperatures and displays the current temperature at the push of a button.Cleaning and filling is a bit tedious as the top of the kettle doesn’t come off.Water heats up quickly but the heating unit produces a sort of burning smell that I was hoping would fade after use but has stuck around after almost daily use for 3 weeks. Water sometimes tastes like metal which can be off putting as well.This was a good attempt at being a bridge between higher end temperature controlled electric kettles and basic electric kettles but I hope Krups brings their A-game when they re-design the product for the next iteration.
"Pro: Looks great sitting on the counter top, large digital temperature display, multiple heating options, large capacity, heats quickly, all metal interior, no plastic touches the water. Saves a lot of energy when making coffee and tea with the specific settings. Nice tone when the desired temperature is reached.Con: Select buttons are very hard to push as is the start button, lid release button does not open to an angle where you could actually fill it from a tap, heavier than expected, more loud than expected while heating, when on the boil setting it takes longer than is comfortable before turning off, steam escapes from around the lid, not just the spout. No external water level marker.Dealbreaker for me: After a couple of weeks of use, select buttons were way to hard to press and make a horrible noise when moving through the menu. Too heavy. Too loud.Alternative: Primens  1002"
"When you lift the kettle off the base any hold temp setting is lost. You need to setup hold temp after pouring. The lid is supposed to pop open by pressing a button on the top, but when you release pressure to allow the lid to pop up the catch instantly slides back (you just released the button) and the lid stays shut. Very frustrating. Poking it very quickly eventually makes it work."
"I got about two years out of it. Then the electrical plate started shorting out, which is less than desirable. Since that is an obvious point of failure, pretty disappointed that the design wasn't better."
"Ordered one for my mom one for me both were broke had to send them back….the replacements did worked, but I failed to realize that it has every setting except the 205° setting ……disappointed to say the least."
"I'm searching for a perfect kettle, and I really liked this one.Looking sleek and stylish on my countertop;Temperature control and current temperature indicator, stainless steel interior - all wonderful.BUT why for Pete's sake a lid on this wonderful thing is plastic?It does smell when heated up. Tried keeping it open during boiling process - not much help.I also don't like that lid does not open up properly, it is uncomfortable to add water and see MAX capacity marking inside."
"I love everything about this kettle.The temperature settings are amazing. I can finally make white, green and black tea with the pre-set temps.It’s quick.Stainless steel interior is great and easy to clean, but removable filter would be nice.I had a problem with opening the lid. The trick here is to press it gently and it will open very easy.100% recommend this, especially considering the price!Edit: the kettle broke down after about 18 months. Their warranty procedure is pain, so I ended up ordering a new one."
"The kettle is easy to use and nice looking, boiling water fast.  But it has some kind of plastic smell after boiling the water.  The lid doesn't open up further for easier cleaning inside and the dark spots keep coming back after heating up the water each time.  I used vinegar to clean the dark spots inside. But the dark spots keep coming back so quickly."
"The pictures led me to believe this was a semi-matte finish. It's high gloss. You know, fingerprint magnet. Impossible to keep clean. Shows every speck of dust, like a mirror. Prone to scratches from the kitchen sponge, or anything really. Barely out of the box, this was instant, immediate purchase regret. This is the downside of buying things online. If I had seen this in a store, I would not have made the purchase. Part of the issue is that the handle and lid has texture, and the reflections on the side are photoshopped in such a way that product does not appear to have a high gloss finish. I own other Krups products - my coffee grinder is going strong after ~ 25 years. The general design of this kettle is good, but Krups missed an opportunity and should have offered this with a more practical and durable semi-gloss or matte finish instead of high gloss."
"ETA:  I smelled burning and found a melted spot in the base of the kettle.  It's just outside of the warranty, but I don't want to keep something that may be a fire hazard.  I could've spent more on a kettle, but this is not a bargain basement kettle - I expected better from Krups.I know the novelty will wear off, but watching the display showing the temperature as the water heats does make the the time fly.  I typically heat a quart of water, using this for a small pot of tea and pour the rest in a thermos to top the pot off.  So I timed boiling a quart of tap cold water and it took 4 minutes, 4 seconds.  The kettle pours nicely and looks good.I deducted a point because you have to be very firm pressing the button to boil/start the kettle and I would prefer a lighter touch.  Also, even though the outer box was clean, the product box had a stain from a spill and it smelled very strong - I think its citronella.  I don't think it got on the kettle inside the box, but I'll keep the shipping materials just in case I need to return.  I hope not, because I already like this kettle."
"Okay design but the button to release the lid just does not make mechanical sense. The button is in the middle of the lid which when pressed down releases the latch. The problem is that you have to lift your hand to let the lid spring up, but the lid does not spring up faster than the latch, so the latch closes and the lid stays closed. Pretty annoying for something you use many times a day."
"So I purchased this kettle in “used-very good” condition, expecting there will be some sign of use, of course, instead, I received a heavily used kettle. I tried to convince myself to just use it, but I really can’t being cheated like this. Please see pics as proof.How is the quality of this kettle, you ask?Well, it’s a mixed one.Pros: 1.Boil water really really fast and you can select different degrees, that’s a huge plus if you need your water to be set at a certain temperature.2. Elegant look, I would say. Despite the damages I saw on the one I received, it is still a nice-look kettle. Low profile but you know it’s premium stuff.Cons:1. Only fixed temp options, there is no in-between.2. The keep warm function is the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen.  Reason being a. You have to press the keep warm function right after the water reached at the temperate you want, otherwise, if you don’t act fast enougth, you have to reboil it and then press the button. b. If the water is at a higher temp, you need to wait till the water to cool down to the one of the fixed temp it has, then quickly press the button to activate the keep warm function3. When you lift the kettle to pour some water out and put it back, everything you did for the keep warm function is gone! I was wrong, this is the dumbest feature."
Replaced my Breville with this Krups model in January.  It was great until recently when I noticed a small leak from the base while pouring water into a pot on the stove.  It has only be few months of use so I am surprised and disappointed this would occur at all let alone so soon.
"My main complaint is that the beeping is extremely loud and there is no way to turn it off. It's almost as loud as my smoke detectors and I have to pull it off before it gets to temperature to avoid waking the whole house if I want to make coffee in the morning. The lid is also very small and doesn't open all the way so it's pretty hard to fill and clean, especially since it's also quite tall. The height and weight also makes the balance a bit awkward and pouring water from it when full is a two-handed job - I admit I don't have the strongest wrists, but I haven't had this issue with any other electric kettles. The cool-touch is nice, but doesn't outweigh the downsides for me. I would not recommend."
"Too bigSo tall, if your fitting into a short space, good luck.Too heavy.Too much trouble, you have to push the button 5 times to get the water temp you want and a Sixth if you want it to stay hot until you use it.  Even then, after you use it, you have to push the button 6 more times to get it to stay hot for your wife.  Even then, if she doesn't use it in the next 30 minutes, you have to push the  button 7 times again.Top won't come open.75% of the time you push the button, nothing happens.  You have to push it 4 or 5 times, or set it down and use another hand to push it and pull at the same time, but there is a lip in the way, so that don't work the first time, and you've got to stick a knife in there to open it.Top doesn't open all the waySo, you can't just set it down in your sink and let it fill, you've got to balance it under the faucet while tilted up so the lid doesn't divert the water into t he sink.  If you ain't strong, or got arthritis, this is a pain.I do NOT recommend this product."
"Open the package: The box misses the normal tape for sealing at the opening. The wire extends a long way outside the base (not neatly coiled inside the base). Other reviews mentioned it’s important to register for warranty but there is no warranty instruction in the box. Did they send me a used item or at least an open box?Use it: Boiled water (below the full line) with it and saw water leaking on the base. Where does the water leak from? The spout area? Then boiled water about half way between the min and max lines and the base is kept dry. Therefore, this 1.5L will be used as a 0.8L one then.Decision: The price is about $5 cheaper now than it was last week when I purchased. Like its design. Decided to support the retailer and not to return it. Hope the retailer will credit back the price difference."
"The product worked well for about a year. Even when boiling water is was cool to the touch and reached the boiling point quickly. The ""keep warm"" feature was great.It took a little bit to get use to starting the ""keep warm"" feature. It didn't feel intuitive at first. And I would've preferred more then only a half hour of keep ""warm time.""After a little over a year the inside started to rust. I have a 2nd, different version of the kettle from the same company and after about a year the inside of the 2nd kettle is also starting to rust. If it wasn't for the rusting issue it would be a five star kettle. If wasn't so pricey (compared to other electric kettles) and rusting I'd give it four stars."
"I bought this kettle because of on/off and temperature control are both on the handle, meaning no extra pad or space is needed. I like its slick design. The kettle boils fast which is very good. However, there are three bad user experiences: 1. It's hard to open the lid. I haven't been able to open the lid at the first try since I got this kettle for almost two months. I'm afraid one day the lid won't open at all. 2. The kettle is quite heavy. 3. The spout doesn't pour water easily. I had to tilt the kettle a lot to pour water faster. Because the kettle isn't light, the pouring isn't a light and easy job. I won't buy it again."
"Based on the most thorough, comprehensive review of this product, I had high hopes. It is very easy to clean, though the lid does not detach. The product is intuitive to use, with the understanding that you have to press the thermometer button on handle to select through desired temperatures. Keep warm function works for as long as the kettle remains on the base. Once removed from the base, kettle turns off. Reaches temperatures very quickly (I have not owned an electric kettle before so I do not have a point of comparison).The day I received this kettle (midday), I unboxed and ran it through the boil function 3 times, as instructions suggest. By the evening, I was receiving “E3” error (temp regulation error). When trying to reach 212° for herbal tea, the digital temp on the kettle would not read above 199° and would immediately turn off. I troubleshot per the instruction manual which has not resolved the issue.For some reason I haven’t been able to I initiate a return on Amazon, so I’m stuck with it until then.Functionality works as described up through 195°.Such a disappointment."
"If you just want hot water, this is great.  If you want to warm anything else, it is a pain to clean since the top doesn't come off.  It has a nice digital display of temp, and is stainless steel inside.  The only other issue, is that it will only stay on for 30min max.  Not a bad choice, but for the price it should be easier to clean and have a long timer."
"I first purchased this electric kettle in Jan 2019. and it died in Jan 2024. I got 5 YEARS of daily use out of it and was happy enough, that I purchased the same exact model Jan 2024 to replace it. It failed within 10 MONTHS! What happened to the quality? Extremely disappointed with the quality of the newer items of this brand. Will NOT purchase again."
This product is very unreliable. I keep getting a “E3” error.  I believe the heating plate is mal functioning.
"It boils a lot of water quickly and the hidden lcd display on the front looks great. The buttons are mushy and don't always register.Unfortunately, when it boils it has terrible burning plastic smell. Setting it to 195 degrees instead of 212 lessens the smell enough to use it (although the smell is still there). Hopefully I am not poisoning myself every morning. Would not buy again."
"I wanted to like this. Krupps usually has good quality from past experience. The looks are nice, Nice to have temperature settings. However, it didn't reach 212 degrees when pushing the boil button, about 208 according to the display. The boiler looked decent, but after one cleaning boil, I noticed some bubble looking rings in the bottom. Another review showed rust spots in the same area as the spots in mine. I am returning this unfortunately, as I did like it to a point. Another issue was the lid, it warped after heating and was difficult to open, and also didn't open far enough really to get in and clean it or wipe it down. Big hands. I noticed a lot of the chinese boilers of this type to have rusting/staining in the same area. Too little stainless in the stainless"
This sometimes leaks and sometimes does not start heating. I have to press the start button a second time. It seems to take a little longer to heat then a previous electric Krups kettle I used to have with the tea type and water temperature selection on it.
"While it was working, the kettle was easy to use and clean. However, it broke soon after the 2-yr warranty was up."
"Bought this mid July.  Started using it soon after delivery.  After two weeks of use the kettle would shut off before reaching the set temperature.  First time I shrugged it off.  Then it happened again, and when I started the kettle again it refused to keep heating the water.Trying to contact Krups to perhaps have a warranty repair was difficult, even though I had registered the purchase.  As I was within the return period I decided it was more effective to return the kettle than deal with a problematic item."
This kettle heats well and quickly but hot water gets between the double walls resulting in hot water pouring out the bottom of the kettle when you return it to upright after pouring!! Boiling water everywhere!! Not a safe product!
Not at all like the Mueller it replaces. For the price it should be higher quality. The Mueller was dropped by my husband and otherwise was such an exceptional kettle. The clear plastic on/off lever on this is an eyesore and will prob break soon. Ugh
I DID NOT NOTICE WHEN ORDERING THAT THERE WAS NO GAUGE TO SHOW HOW MUCH WATER YOU HAD TO PUT IN THE KRUPS SO I NOW HAVE TO MEASURE THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF COLD WATER IN A MEASURING JUG BEFORE BOILING..
"The kettle seems to work as advertized, controls are a bit counterintuitive but easy to get used to.One negative thing which really stands out - it is hard to read the indicators in a sunlit kitchen, they are pretty much invisible.Being able to pick the exterior color would also be nice."
"The double walled construction works well and keeps the kettle from burning you. However, it doesn’t hold the temperature very long. The push button lid doesn’t work on the first try and you have to keep pushing it repeatedly for it to pop open. It’s overly tall and takes up a lot of space because of it.Overall, it’s just okay, not great and not really worth the price."
"I guess i assumed all digital devices could switch between F and C but this one doesn't. Also the presets are just that,..preset. zero customized temps. The button at the top to open the lid is not easy to use...often have to hit it quickly and sharply w fee times to open.  Otherwise it's fast and well insulated."
"We’ve been using this for a few days and I really like it, but my wife is quite annoyed by the loud shrill beep it makes when you Turn it on and when the water is done boiling. I’ve looked in the manual it online but there’s no way to turn it off."
I did not like that is was obviously used and I was unaware that I was buying a used item
I bought this a couple years ago and have only occasionally used it because there is this chemical or metal  smell that happens when I use it. I'm not sure if it's the coating on the metal inside or what but it's been two years and it still hasn't gone away. I've probably used this thing about 50 times because of that. I'd suggest going with a mostly glass one.
Amazon deleted my truthful review. Here’s the same review in different words: THIS PRODUCT DESERVES ZERO STARS!! Krups lost its quality.
"The kettle works fine, though the button that opens the lid doesn't always work; sometimes I have to jab it several times before it finally springs open.The problem is Krups's online warranty registration and (lack of) customer service. I bought this because I wanted the Krups quality and warranty. But, when I went to register it on their site, the model wasn't a choice in their dropdown box, and there's no way to just...ya know...enter it. So I emailed Krups. Four days later, I still hadn't heard anything, so I emailed again. Four days after that, I finally got a reply to the first email, and they told me I'd have to mail the warranty card in.Well, you're supposed to register the warranty within 10 days of the purchase date (not even the delivery date), and we were past that point. I mailed them the card anyway, along with a letter explaining what happened, and noting the 8-day delay it took them to reply. Of course, I haven't heard anything back. I could have mailed the card in, but with the mail delayed as it has been, I doubt it would have gotten there in time -- which is why I wanted to register it online.So, I'm not inclined to buy anything from Krups again -- not after this kind of customer service."
Cheaply made. Pass this one by.
"This is a nice kettle with adjustable temperature option.It feels and smells a bit too plasticky, but I think most kettles are built the same way. Wish it had all stainless steel interior."
"I bought this to replace an older Krups kettle having a similar design.This kettle boils water ok but a couple of negatives stand out.It does not sit flush on the base and so rocks slightly.Water spills out the sides of the lid and not just the spout.  So when I pour, unless I am careful it pours all over my counter.  If you swirl the water in the kettle it will leak from the top also.The old model felt much more solid and did not have these issues.I'm not sure how they managed to go from a good solid design to this."
"The water smells and tastes so bad, even after rinsing and boiling it multiple times.Bad quality ~ found out it’s made in China no surprise!"
"The size and speed are as expected, but the base is unstable, which means when there is water it’s also somehow unstable.  Perhaps was the product delivered to me, but it’s the first time a ser this brand with so many problems.  Since, the handle was broken and the pieces were inside the bag.  Overall, it seems like even without the problems it isn’t going to last very long.  In my case, it was returned."
It worked okay for a week. Then stopped switching itself off when boiled. This is a safety hazard. Do not buy this product.
"Lovely appearance, but poor overall design because of one fact. And that’s because after boiling water, the entire pot of water smells and tastes like plastic. I suspect that is why other manufacturers put a metal plate on the underside of the lid. Whereas this one has exposed plastic and my assumption is the condensation causes some kind of leaching that makes the water taste and smell like plastic. It’s very apparent and off-putting. I was hoping it would go away after a few weeks, but that doesn’t seem to be the case."
"It looks snazzy on the counter and works well.  This is my third one since they only last me about 2 years because the little pin in the bottom that connects it electrically to the base eventually bends due to casual use and cannot be fixed, like it disconnects something inside, bending it back does nothing (but different kettles I have had have been smaller, ridiculous looking, or even more flimsy).The thing that I have always hated about it was that there seemed to be no way to clean it.  A human hand cannot fit down inside to scrub, and even a tough 15"" bottle brush (if you can find one that long) with baking soda and/or a wash cloth pushed down in there would ever get the ""minerals"" off that crust to the bottom.  Worse when boiling water they swim around in there like sea monkeys, till eventually they're actually bigger than snow-globe flakes, and is not something you would ever drink out of if it weren't your own.My wife finally found the solution to clean it though.  Take about 50/50 lemon juice and water and fill it half way (quite a bit of lemon juice).  Boil and let cool all of the way (like two hours between, cool all the way down).  Do that a few times throughout the day.  Scrub with a 15 inch bottle brush (we found one on Amazon but it's no longer available).  About half of that crush will come out.  Now repeat the lemon juice thing only with more lemon to water, call it 75/25 lemon juice to water and boil and leave it overnight.  The next day boil and cool again, then hit with the bottle brush... ours is gleaming like new (except for the light forever stain-spots that always happen on the pan) and tea and coffee taste so much better now I am ashamed at how long we used it with that stuff on there.Pro-tip, use a little of the lemon juice water mix and brush the water spots and stuff around the rim and it will shine too."
"UPDATE #2 (11/19/2018):Revising back up to 3 stars based on positive experience with 3rd unit (which has now been working flawlessly for 18 months), and positive experience with Oxo Customer Service Canada.To summarize, we purchased Unit #1 in Fall 2016, but the product broke (lid would no longer open) after 3 weeks of use.  Returned it to Oxo Canada (at their expense), who replaced it at no charge.  Unit #2 broke (heating switch no longer worked) after 2 weeks, so I returned it again to Oxo Canada.  I was very skeptical about ever receiving a good, functioning unit.  However, Unit #3 has been a gem.  Over 18 months of daily usage and no issues whatsoever.In reading reviews of competing products, it seems that many sub-$100 glass electric kettles have quality issues (I have no idea why it's so hard to make a reliable one).  But they're very useful, so if you are buying one, be sure you purchase from an organization that has good customer service.  While I've been disappointed in the build quality of this product, I've been very impressed with Oxo Canada's customer service.  They've stood behind their product and have been quick to take action to make things right.UPDATE #1 (3/1/2017):Revising this down to 1 star due to additional product quality issues.Per below, a few weeks after purchasing this kettle, I had problems with the lid button so returned the unit to Oxo and received a replacement.  Unfortunately, the replacement kettle (which was brand new) was no better.  This 2nd kettle worked fine initially (like the 1st one did), but after 2 weeks of use the heating switch at the bottom of the handle stopped working.  I am now processing another return, and will receive my 3rd new kettle.The good news is that Oxo is committed to good customer service.  However, I've concluded that Oxo should probably stick to plastic utensils.  They clearly don't understand how to make a quality electric appliance.  I really wish I could just get my money back so that I could purchase a glass electric kettle from another manufacturer (someone who has been making appliances for many years), but I am outside the return window.  I have no confidence that the 3rd kettle will be my last one...ORIGINAL REVIEW:Giving this 2 stars because:1) Product broke after 3 weeks of use.  The soft-open lid, one of Oxo's primary features of this kettle, won't open any more.  This seems to be a design flaw, since most of the other negative reviews cite problems with the lid.  It's an expensive product, and we purchased the Oxo brand due to its strong reputation for making quality products.  Bad on Oxo.2) I ordered this as a Christmas present for my wife, but since it arrived on Oct 27 (I like to get my shopping done early), Amazon won't accept the return (their holiday return window apparently starts Nov 1).  Bad on Amazon.3) I would've given this 1 star, but prior to breaking, this had been my wife's favorite Christmas present.  The water heats quickly, and (with the exception of the lid) it seemed to be well-made."
"Update Jan 2018. Broken: does not heat water anymore. Happy with its function while it worked, but too short a lifespan for an $80 item. I removed a star, and would not recommend this item due to cost vs. lifespan.Purchased Oct 2015. Used 7-days a week several times a day by two adults. Our last kettle died, so I purchased this one as a replacement based mostly on OXO's reputation (I'm a fan of OXO products). Very good so far. I've owned a fair number of these electric kettles over the years.PROS* Quality construction. Overall very solid/well-made.* Fast boiling (about 5 min for 60 oz/1.75 L).* Large capacity* Holds rolling-boil for about 20 seconds before shutting off (I like this)* Sufficient room so water doesn't splash out of full kettle when at rolling boil (a problem with some kettles)* Works as-expected for second/subsequent full-kettle boils (also a problem with some kettles that don't stay on because they're hot)* Shuts off when lifted from plate (I like this, but others may not)* BPA free. Very minimal water contact with petroleum-based products (nearly impossible to find electric kettle with no contact)* Usable water level markings for both oz and L.* Balance is good for pouring when full. Seems like I have good water flow control.* Comfortable non-slip handle* Good-size opening for filling* Illuminated (blue) on/off lever is easy to see when on and makes audible ""click"" when it shuts off* Filter screening itself seems well made and it appears water will mostly flow through it rather than around it (problem with other kettles)CONS* Somewhat loud (but, neither the loudest nor quietest I've used)* Slightly taller than is typical for an electric kettle (normal circumference at base). Might be too big for small people/elderly.* However minimal, there is water contact with petroleum-based products when boiling (seems like all electric kettles have this problem to some degree)* Water level marks are sometimes hard to see, particularly when there's condensation in the kettle (slightly small, white on clear glass). Contrasting color might have been a better choice.* On/off lever's attachment to the kettle seems like it might be a little flimsy* Filter screen frame is all plastic, seems flimsy, and doesn't seat well in holder.* Balance is not so great for pouring when water level is low (kettle is bottom heavy)* I agree with other reviewer that you have to nearly tip the kettle upside-down to get all the water out of the kettle due to a lip/ledge inside where the glass and top part of the kettle meet.* Tough to reach inside kettle to clean it. You will probably need a cleaning wand/brush.* Price. Most I've every paid for an electric kettle."
"The seam between the glass and the stainless steel causes the water to pour unevenly. As you tilt it, it pours a small trickle and then quickly it pours too much. Almost feels unsafe if you pour fast. I much prefer how the Breville that I had before poured.  Everything else about this one is great though, especially the lid and the switch."
"This was a highly recommended item that I chose based on reviews, but personally I'm not sure I'd purchase it again. It was already more than I would like to spend on such a product, so I had some high expectations. It did work well while it lasted, boiling water quickly and efficiently. It did get some scaling on it that would not be cleaned despite following the descaling instructions and washing the kettle. Finally, it lasted only 3 years with moderate use, just past the manufacturers warranty of 2 years, which seems far too short a life for such an expensive product."
I bought a previous OXO kettle and it was absolutely excellent in all ways.  This kettle has a lingering metallic taste in heated water after 15 fresh kettles.
"I was very excited about this kettle when I received it.I am a huge fan of Alton Brown's Good Eats.  One thing that he does is use an electric kettle to make brine as well as stock as well as hard boiling eggs.Upon reading the instructions and warnings of this kettle, I realized that I wouldn't be able to use any of these tips the way AB does.  This kettle is made for boiling water...period. There is no way to clean the inside of this kettle if you have large hands. The lid does not come off, which is a good thing, but it does limit the size of the hand that can fit in the small opening.The other issue I had is that it recommends using filtered water only.  I completely understand that requirement and I would absolutely oblige, but the kettle does not fit in my built in water filter on my fridge.  I have to take water from the fridge spout and put it in a different container to them dump it into this kettle.  A lot of extra effort.The upside is that 2 cups of water was boiling in this kettle in approximately 90 seconds.  If the kettle is filled all the way to the top, it takes about 6 minutes.I began to think about how much this kettle costs and all of the extra effort that I had to make in order to do what I bought it for.  In the end, it is not worth the price in my opinion.  If it was $20 or $30, I wouldn't be as bothered. But, the fact that I still have to use multiple cups and dishes that I already own in order to use this pot is a huge disadvantage.  I can buy a measuring up with handle for $10 and microwave it to get the same performance that I do with this kettle.If you are buying this for tea or for French press/pour over coffee; then this maybe a wonderful asset to your kitchen. For me, there were too many disadvantages to justify the large pricetag"
"For everyone looking for a plastic free electric kettle, this is not it.1) There is a giant piece of plastic right at the stainless mouth of the kettle, that is NOT removable.  So every time you pour hot water out it go through this piece of plastic.  (yes you can remove the filter, but there is a giant plastic that holds the filter in place and is not removable).2) There is huge amount of silicone at the bottom of the kettle that attaches the glass side to the stainless bottom.I returned this.For anyone's information, there is NO pure glass electric kettle for whatever technical reason.  ALL of them has silicone rings at the bottom, and most with plastic cover / mouth.  Your options for plastic free water heating are:A) Stove top all glass kettle (see my other review), it's not practical and isn't very user friendly.B) Secura stainless electric kettle - this is the only option in my opinion. The entire inside is 1 seamless stainless steel, no silicone / plastic whatsoever. And mouth/cover are also full stainless steel. It's also been around forever as an old brand.  After trying all options, including the expensive $200-300 glass kettles, i can conclusively tell you there is no electric glass kettle without silicone ring.I would also get an all glass (high heat resistance) jug, so once you heat the water in the secura stainless steel kettle, pour it into the glass jug to let it stay.  As i dont think you should leave water in stainless steel for long periods of time, but it is infinitely better than plastic/silicone under high heat."
"It was ok kettle, worked totally fine. I bought it thinking I would buy something that would last for long time (since it's not cheap and other OXO products are solid and last forever). But it did last only two years. The switch that turn on the kettle doesn't work any more. You turn it and the light on it flashes for a second and then disappears. If you hold the switch by hand it might work for a bit while you holding, but no guaranty.Over all I didn't like design of this kettle, it looks cool, but the shape is not balanced right. When it's full of water it's not comfortable to pour water because it's off balance (it's tall). Plus it doesn't fit every sink, in my previous apartment I couldn't pour water to it without holding it at an angle. Although it easy to clean and I never had any problems with rust or any other dirt on in it. Would be great to have less plastic on the kettle, the top of it could be easily done with metal, that would be so much better.As much I like other products of OXO, this one is not holding the quality to their standard. I wouldn't but this kettle again. I want something that would last longer than 2 years."
"This is undoubtedly a good looking kettle. The stylish, modern design looks good on well manicured kitchen countertops. I can't fault the aesthetic. As a British tea drinker (stereotype) I boil water for a tea pot or mug five or six times a day. it was time to get rid of the rusty old stovetop whistling kettle and go electric. Pretty much everyone back in the UK has an electric kettle. So here are the limitations:1 - if you like knowing when your water is done boiling, this kettle won't tell you. While some might like there is no whistle to run to the stove for, that naturally means there is no indication your water is ready. For a tea drinker who needs extra hot water, getting to a kettle even a couple of minutes after it boiled requires you to reboil the lot. The glass is not very insulating so I find the water is lukewarm quite quickly.2 - the flow is not smooth. Pouring from this kettle into a vessel with a narrow mouth, like a hot water bottle, or a thermos flask requires a steady hand. There's something about the mesh filter at the spout that means it either comes out as a trickle or pours liberally, risking your hands getting scolded in the process."
"This is a good looking and sturdy glass kettle that unfortunately goes into a dump not reaching its second birthday. First of all, this product boils water for a long long time before the auto-switch turns it off. Considering overboiling when you warm up remaning water several times, in the absence of other settings, not being very healthy, I was trying switching the kettle off manually when was nearby. Don't know if this is the reason, but after a year, the kettle started turning off and on sporadically by itself, eventually refusing to boil water at all today and demised after only 1 year and 9 month of service. RiP. Much cheaper options will give me even more than that, or I will go with Cuisinart that gave me at least 6 years of hot friendship prior to me attempting finding a better looking  companion"
"The kettle did what it was supposed to (boil water), until it didn't. Two months short of four years seems short at this price point. Other reviews mentioned the switch as the likely culprit and this probably applies to our unit.  Also, the metal bottom was showing rust-like discoloration."
"I am an avid tea drinker, I needed a really good kettle to replace my old one because I probably drink close to 10 cups of tea a day. I chose this kettle for 2 reasons: It was voted 'best kettle' by Good Housekeeping and it was expensive relative to other kettles. Both of these factors made me think that I would be getting a great kettle. Unfortunately, this could not be further from the truth and I ended up returning the kettle for the following reasons:1) This is not a fast-boil kettle. It took 8 minutes and 32 seconds to boil 1.75L of water. This is way too long.2) There is a weird ridge where the glass connects to the metal at the top. This prevents the water from completely pouring out, even if you completely turn the kettle upside down and shake it.3) This one was the deal breaker.....I could have tolerated points 1 and 2. The kettle made the water taste awful, especially if some water had been left in the kettle and it was being re-boiled. It had a funny twang that tasted something like plastic combined with metal. I tried boiling the kettle over and over in an attempt to get the taste to work it's way out but it just would not go away. When you opened the lid and stuck your nose into the top of the kettle, the exact smell that you could taste was very prominent.So, I'm back to the drawing board in my quest to find a great kettle!"
"I usually love OXO products, and usually agree with ATK evaluations. However, I bought this winner last week, and am returning it this week. I want to control what temperature the water heats to, and boiling isn't for every task. Herbal teas need less heat than regular. Also, I have very hard water, full of minerals. The FIRST TIME I used the kettle, I could see scale on the heating plate. The first time. Now, this is not OXO's fault. This happens in all my kettles, I am sure. But because the body is glass, I can see the scale building, and it is unsightly. I don't feel I can put the kettle on the table in front of guests. Finally, there is no feature to keep the water hot. By the time I come back to make the next cup, maybe 20 minutes later, the water is lukewarm. Partly the problem is the uninsulated glass, and partly there is no keep hot setting. I am going back to my Cuisinart PerfecTemp CPK-17."
"I loved this electric kettle because I could see when the water boiled and when it needed to be cleaned.  So disappointed when it broke after 8 months, although I admit I used it at least 2x a day.  It was expensive so I didn’t buy another one, instead went back to the Hamilton beach kettle that luckily didn’t give away when I bought the Oxo….the older kettle was 5 years old and still works!"
"This kettle has been the best - it is easy to adjust temperature, it keeps water hot until your ready for it but not so long that it wastes energy, you always know how much water your heating, it is ""cordless"" and carbon monoxide free, etc.  But, after 5 years the contacts for the heating element are failing.  Sometimes we can fix it by rotating the kettle in it's base but that has become less successful and it is time to buy a new one.  Yes, I am buying another OXO, I hope it lasts longer."
"Even after multiple test boils, the tea still tasted quite horribly of plastic.  We sent it back."
"Overall, we really like this kettle.  It's easy to use, boils quickly and shuts off as expected.  The only thing we don't like is that it's hard to get all of the water out.  There's a sort of lip around the top that holds about 2-3 tablespoons of water.  That water doesn't pour out and unless you use a towel to absorb it (see photo), it remains in the kettle.  It's not a deal breaker but at this price point, I would expect a kettle that empties completely.  Still, I'd purchase it again.  It's so much better than the 'bargain' kettles."
"this is one of the best purchases I've ever made on Amazon!  Heats water up so fast! Fun to watch it come to a swirling boil.  Spout doesn't dribble.  Ergonomic handle.Long enough cord.  Terrific productThe only problem I'm having now, 6 months into owning this tea kettle, is that a white ""salt-like"" residue is appearing  inside the kettle. I might contact the maker and apply my insurance policy to return it for a new one.  I can't figure out if the seal has been damaged, or what, exactly.  I am wondering if anyone else has experienced this.stopped working entirely January 30 2018.  I had washed it (holding it in my hand, with OXO bottle brush,  not immersed )and allowed it to dry overnight,  and went to use it, and it completely stopped working.  I can only assume water got into some part of the electronics that were delicate and water sensitive."
"The kettle has always leaked a bit from between the glass and the metal band at the top. I didn't think it was worth returning for that issue, so I kept it. About 3 months ago it quit working while the switch was pushed down to turn it on. Now I have to rotate it around and jiggle the switch to get it to work. Definitely not worth the price for it to last such a short period of time. I purchased in Dec 2021 and it is Sep 2023. I bought the glass kettle at Costco before this for 39.99 and it lasted 4 years."
"I chose this kettle because I wanted a glass body so that I could keep an eye on mineral buildup and make sure the interior of my kennel was clean. The kettle itself is fine, nothing spectacular, definitely not worth all of the money when you can buy another kettle for a quarter of the cost. I thought that maybe the extra dollars would mean a longer shelf life, no. The kettle crapped out after less than a year and a half. Don’t bother, save your money and get some thing else."
Product worked fine for the first 2 years but now the button that opens the top is stuck and I cannot get it open. Wrote to OXO for support twice and have not received a response. I guess the useful life is 2 years.At the price I expected more.
"Updated review:Some months down the line. We are throwing ours away. The kettle stopping working. We are suspecting bad contacts between the kettle and the base. Upon closer examination, there were quite a few flimsy things that are critical for the electrical components. We believe they were bent. Ours can no longer be lifted from from the base without shaking the base off.At $80, I thought it shouldn’t be this fragile.Original review:Bought this based on the America’s Test Kitchen review. Didn’t realize I wanted a transparent kettle until I got this. Heats fast. If I have to complaint about something, it’d be the weight. Elderly or those who has weak arms might find a food pot to heavy to handle safely."
"This was best rated. That was my reason for buying.  And my favourite Capresso kept breaking down.  But for ease of handling, the Capresso is best. This one is heavy and cumbersome and the thing at the top which you press to opena nd fill it is awkward and counter-intuitive - for me.  It would be good if you have a very large family that needs cups of tea and hot water bottles at the same time.  For oen person it is about 3-4 times to large and heavy."
"Received a ”new” tea kettle that was totally dripping wet inside—obviously a return from another customer. Or do all new OXO electric tea kettles arrive with water inside?  I washed the daylights out of it, and it seems to work, and I plan to keep it. But any future Amazon Prime deliveries originating from “Save Done Deals” in Hebron, Kentucky will be returned unopened.  I regret dinging the device’s rating, but this was a crummy experience."
"I really like the look and functionality of this kettle but it is a pain to clean.  First, it starts to develop visible scaling on metal parts on bottom/inside of kettle.  Second, it's impossible to clean.  The opening at top is too small to fit hand and not removable so had to clean and hard to dry.  The drying is the most annoying since I leave it upside down in my dish rack but seems to take hours to dry.  I can stuff a dish towel inside and use a wooden spoon to dry but difficult."
"I just discovered that I'm not the only one whose OXO electric kettle randomly popped its lid on its own.  For weeks, I thought I was simply forgetting to put the top down after I filled it -- that it was user error.  But then, 3 times in just a few days, I was standing right there when the top popped, and it happened both when I had filled it just a little past the minimum line and when I filled it to near the maximum line.But the good news is that I otherwise love the kettle, and Amazon is taking care of me directly even though the 30 days recently passed.  So I'm reordering the same pot -- and fingers crossed that it doesn't suffer from this same defect."
"The product does what it’s supposed to do and it seems like the water doesn’t touch any plastic while it heats up, but the one thing I don’t like is how there’s a lip plus the filter screen that seems to make the water pour out funny.  I don’t think you’re able to get all of the water out unless you go past the 90 degree angle, and then the water comes out but not in a nice stream.  It works, but it annoys me."
"This is the second OXO kettle of this model. I purchased the first one 4 years ago from Bloomingdales and was VERY happy all these years! It would have lasted me even longer, but when the pandemic started and we were spraying the alcohol on the kitchen counter top a lot, it might have gotten inside the switch and it only work about 70% of the time and the indicator light is not working at all- which is not convenient with the heavy use and that’s why I decided to purchase the same exact model now from Amazon.The quality is NOT the same anymore- the main problem is the SMELL! Now It is probably made of the cheaper materials, which have a distinct smell and not acceptable for drinking water! I cannot have my tea with added smell and taste of plastic!I have this kettle for a few months now and have been trying to boil and dump the water in it every day hoping that the smell will “air out”- but it doesn’t seem to even ease!I wish I could return it!"
"No matter what I do, the lid keeps popping up.  This is broken, basic functionality.  Serious design flaw.Also: The water does not pour out all the way.  No matter how you tilt it, there is a good bit of water that won't come out.  It's a serious pain if you want it to quickly dry out between uses.  Another big design flaw, though not as big as the lid issue.Yes, it heats water, but so do other kettles.  This kettle gets a big fat 0 rating, because if the lid doesn't work..."
"When it worked it was fine. But the switch button below the handle broke within 6 months; it was still usable, but only if you jiggled and pressed it just right. And now 2 years later it failed completely."
"As title says, 2 months later and every cup of water boiled reeks of plastic. Feels pretty unsafe to drink out of so I don’t use it anymore.. back to boiling water on the stove."
"It's tall, heavy (when full), has plastics that touch the water, takes longer than other kettles to boil, keeps boiling long after the water's boiled (auto-off doesn't work well), expensive, short/difficult to pour spout, and corrodes (rust) inside.  But, it boils more water at one time than my T-Fal.  It's one of the few products I wish would just stop working.  Perhaps my biggest OXO let down.  Their other stuff is good; this kettle needs rethought."
"It's only been 7 months since I bought this kettle. It broke yesterday for no obvious reason. I really liked this kettle, and it worked great, but for a product this price, I didn't expect such short life expectancy. I wouldn't recommend this product. My friends' $20 kettle has been working for years. This is not a good purchase.Follow-up: I contacted OXO customer service regarding this problem. They responded very quickly and sent me a new kettle with and a pre-paid return shipping label. I'm changing my rating from 2 stars to 3 stars."
"I purchased this product for my mother about a year ago.  When visiting I noticed that the auto-turn off stopped working.  This is a significant safety issue for my elderly mother, who has a tendency to turn on the kettle and then forgot.  I sent in a warranty claim but received no response.  Recently noticed that their general satisfaction warranty specifically exempts Brew products, like this kettle.  I would avoid and buy the similar amazon basics model at a third of the price.  Not only is it significantly cheaper, but Amazon has in my experience stood behind their products."
I like the way this kettle looks and it is well built but it just does not replace my T-Fal for daily use. I only use it when guests come over and I need more than the 1 liter that the T-Fal makes. It is also hard to get all of the water out of the pitcher. On the up side it is quick and efficient and easy to judge when to stop the heating early (for lower temp teas like green and white teas). I am going to keep this kettle but I do not think it is up to OXOs usual standards.
"This does boil water quickly but after two years of use (mostly daily, sometimes twice a day), the tab for turning the kettle on broke so it no longer works.  For an $80 apparatus, I'd expect much better.  Very disappointing."
"There's a metal lip inside the kettle that keeps it from being fully emptied so water just sits in there getting slimy between uses. Maybe if you're a daily user this isn't as much of an issue but I don't use my kettle every day. And because of the nasty stagnant water I can't get out, I don't use it at all.It does heat the water quickly and the measurements are easy to read though."
"This unit seems to function properly; however, it was missing the removable stainless steel strainer that was supposed to be in the spout. When we contacted OXO, we were informed that they cannot send the strainer to us without returning the entire unit for a replacement. That is absurd for such a small part. I guess we will simply use the unit without the strainer. We have always purchased OXO products with confidence but they certainly let us down on this one."
"Not what it seems.... I am returning this kettle unused. It was described as glass and stainless steel. Unfortunately, the description did not mention the rubber gasket that attaches the metal heating element to the glass. The gasket is in contact with the water and is of unknown material. It looks like silicon rubber. This rubber-silicon-whatever it is will be subjected to high heat and boiling water. It is only a matter of time before it ends up in my tea and inside my body. So no thank you! OXO you can keep it."
Purchased July 2019 and am searching for a replacement because it stopped working. Paying a bit more for a product doesn't necessarily guarantee a long lifespan. Will replace it with a less expensive one.
"I am incredibly upset by the inferior quality and the lies.That's that OXO spreads about this being. A glass kettle period the boiling water runs through plestic and contaminates everything.  Period I spent twice as much as other kettles because this promised to not have plastic in contact with the water period period this product should be taken off the market. If you buy it, enjoy comsuming your toxic microplastics, endocrine disruptors, and letal carcinogens."
"Nice capacity, easy to use. But a shame that it started to rust soon after purchase, even with best efforts to dry it between uses and only using it 3-4 times per month."
"I bought this because America's Test Kitchen gave it a thumbs up. However, I must disagree with their assessment.1) It's corroding after maybe a year of service.2) It's hard to clean, since there is a rim structure that often catches foreign objects (like ants, e.g.) when rinsing. It can often take three or four attempts to do away with one small bug!3) It was quite pricy! Like 4X the price of other 1.7 liter electric kettles! You'd think that this would make for a very tightly designed machine, one that didn't have these issues.4) But most importantly, I think there is a safety issue. I have on more than one occasion had the auto-shutoff fail, letting the water boil out, and have it still heating! This can't be good.5) Lastly, after maybe a year, the thing has just failed outright, and the switch no longer turns it on."
"I have owned this kettle for fourteen months. It has just become temperamental, will not sit on base correctly and therefore will not always switch one. Shame, it a nice looking kettle and when operational performs quickly."
"A kettle is for boiling water, and this kettle lives up to the mark. However, I dislike the rim of metal around the neck of the kettle, as it has a ridge on the inside, making it impossible to fully empty the kettle. There’s always a small amount of water left in the base. Living with very hard water, I have to descale regularly, and this makes it that much more difficult. Wish I’d bought a much cheaper kettle. They all do the same job, but my cheaper kettles were easier to clean and empty."
"I bought it because of the brand, because I have many other quality gadgets from OXO as well. I think this brand is still reputable, except for this electric kettle. It was broken in less than a year. The switch was in the on position but the light indicator and the heat went off. You will have to manually turn the switch off and on to restart it, and the same problem happened again. Also the design is flawed. There is a rim on top of the glass pot that prevents you from completely empty it. A small amount of water is always trapped inside, and it is impossible to get the limescale out. I am very disappointed especially given the price."
"I really dislike the look of it!  This was a replacement for our 12-year old, trouble free, easy to clean, unobtrusive Aroma Housewares Hot H20 X-Press 1.5 Liter (6-Cup) Cordless Electric Water Kettle, Stainless Steel which is less than half the price of this OXO.  Negative reviews list base corrosion and failures to function within months of purchase.  Wiping down the outside of our nicely compact Aroma with a microfiber sponge was easy and quick and that’s all we ever had to do.  This Oxo glass one shows drops and spots inside and outside its surface.  Found it impossible to wipe away water/dry inside because of crevices in the construction, even after emptying and leaving lid open for days.  Electric water kettles are appliances worth having but not this one for me.  This one will be returned."
The kettle switch won't turn on anymore so in the garbage it goes. For $80 this should have lasted a lot longer. Really sick of every appliance breaking after only a few years of use. What a wasteful world we live in.
It has plastic on the inner lid. Does not match the claim the at it is made of steel and glass. Not worth the price for a kettle that has plastic on the inside.
"After only 3 months of use, the kettle began to develop rust. No amount of cleaning could reverse it and the kettle is now useless. Buy instead the Amazon Basics kettle for $27 of the one from Costco for $25. This item is also huge, unwieldly, difficult to clean and empty. Oxo customer support is no help either."
"For the first 5 months of use, this electric kettle had been wonderful.  It heats the water quickly, the water is clear (my tea tastes great), and I appreciate the auto-off feature.  Unfortunately, last week the switch began to malfunction.  The water begins to heat and then the switch shuts off.  After fiddling with the switch the water begins to heat again, but then turns off.  If the switch is left in the on position, it may cycle on and off but does not stay on long enough to boil the water.  I am having a difficult time contacting customer support to make an exchange. Will update the review if there is a satisfactory resolution."
"This OXO electric kettle served us very well for six months. We used it quite hard - every day 2-3 times a day. However, after one year the electrical connection in the bottom just seemed to fail and ""boom"" it was dead. We had to pull down our old DeLonghi off the shelf which, was still working after many heavy use years. I did like the geometry of the handle on the OXO which really gave you good leverage against a full pot of water. It is also pretty when the water boils. But I feel that, for the price, it did not last as long enough not to be a rip-off. I can't recommend it."
"I am very disappointed since I had exactly the same one and it worked for a good few years.  I ordered exactly the same one to replace the old one.  At first, I did not notice the crack on the top metal part of the kettle.  However, when the water starts boiling, it starts leaking water.  So I checked and the crack outside as well as inside.  I have to return it."
"Did not have this issue with other electric kettles. Water turns out with an awkward smell. After 10 days of usage, smell did not subside. There is no visible plastic parts touching the boiling water. It is either the steel, glass or maybe some sort of sealant that is used at bottom. Returned and switched to a different brand. Also design a bit industrial and bulky."
"Got this kettle upon recommendation of a friend. Like how simple it is to use, and that you can see the water inside. After ONE DAY of use, rust spots started showing up on the bottom of the kettle. I would understand after maybe even a few weeks but this was one day. Amazon customer service directed me to Oxo customer service who said they couldn't help me. Will be returning. For $70, I would have expected better."
"I purchased this but did not use it until 2 months later because of a move. I followed the instructions for cleaning for first time use. It boiled the water. Then when I went to use it, nothing. It never worked again. Of course, I now missed the return window.I do not recommend buying this item."
"This is the third electric kettle that I purchased.The electric cord on the electric base on this new kettle is extremely short, unable to reach a wall outlet.I am currently using the electric bass and cord on a kettle I purchased several years ago.I am requesting that the base of the kettle and the electric cord be replaced.I love the kettle, and request a reasonable solution to this problem."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This kettle doesn't last long. It's our second one bought at full price in 4 years. After 2 years, it suddenly stops working, and the metal starts to peel and delaminate over time.I do not recommend this kettle."
"This works.  But if you have hard water, you'll have to clean it frequently.  Also has a design defect mentioned elsewhere that you cannot pour all of the water out.  If you have an RO system, you'll want to use it to eliminate the mineral build up in this otherwise functional electric kettle."
I would prefer wider open mouth top for easy pouring instead of tapered.  Also would prefer metal instead of glass.  I bought this one bc of oxo brand not bc i necessarily liked the design
"It may be a beautiful kettle and boil water quickly, but this thing started rusting after only a couple month's of use- more alarmingly, bits of rusted metal have actual started showing up in the bottom of the pot, which would be horrible enough on its own, but I am also using this to boil water for my baby's formula, which makes it outright dangerous. You can see the biggest piece of rust, which I fished out, in the first picture (next to my finger for scale). There are lots of little bits in the pot still, as you can see in the second picture. This is a lawsuit waiting to happen- the design needs to be fixed so that the metal around the rubber seal is NOT rusting and breaking off into the pot. This would be unacceptable at any price point, let alone with a higher-end appliance. Of course, this happens juuust after the return window has closed. Unbelievable."
"Bought in 2019, stopped working 3 years later.  I expected this product would last longer.  Shame it will end up in a landfill.  Buying a new electric tea kettle from a different manufacturer."
"This is the second time I buy this exact product and though I love it, it’s just not durable enough. Both times, it lasted me a little less than a year. I use it daily, and at least couple times a day. We take special care of this product (eg. don’t soak the bottom, don’t let calcium build up etc), and did same or more especially the second time around.  I guess life span is about a year..."
"As usual, these electric tea pots last about 1 year and crap out. I bought this one because it SEEMED to be built better - how wrong I was!  It just crapped out...one year and 3 months.  DO NOT BUY.  I don't know what to recommend now.  Are they all built in China engineered to break after one year?  What a waste of money!"
"It heats the water quickly as advertised, however, after having it for a week and drying it thoroughly, spots started to show on the bottom. The following week rust started to show over the spots and had to return it."
"The design is excellent, however, the execution during manufacturing is subpar.  What I liked:  sturdy, solid base and handle design, smooth operating lid, heats fast.  What I didn't like: plastic in front of the pouring spout which is permanently attached.  What I REALLY DIDN'T LIKE:  died in less than a year.  Basically, it was good until it broke.  It just stopped working.  The electronics failed.  For the price of this kettle, I expected better longevity.  I might as well have bought a cheap one.  Oxo products are among my favorites, but this kettle disappoints.  I did have a good experience with OXO as they replaced the unit as I was still under warranty, however, the replacement stopped working after three months!"
It boiled water really quick and worked fine while it lasted. It just stopped working.
"I had one of these pots since November 2018 and loved it. A few months ago, I accidentally banged it into the corner of a granite counter top and the glass broke. I immediately ordered another one. The inside smelled of plastic or rubber. I followed all the instructions, washed it etc. After boiling the water several times, the water tasted awful. I  waiting a few weeks figuring the smell would dissipate, but it did not. Finally I ordered a replacement figuring I had a defective pot. However the second one arrived and I have the same problem. Oxo must have changed something in the manufacturing process is all I can figure. So I'm returning the second one as well.  Very disappointed."
"Not thrilled with this product. Less than 3 months later and the bottom has rusted. It is used 2x daily. I purchased this with the hope that it wouldn't end up rusting, and it did faster than I would have expected."
"I usually love Oxo products because they've got great products, but I'm not a fan of this electric kettle. After another reviewer showed the rusty bottom of his kettle, I was hesitant to buy it, but decided to give Oxo the benefit of the doubt. Mistake! Only after a month of use (used about every other day), my kettle is starting to rust as well. It's not as bad as the pictures Amy posted in her review, but its definitely rusting! There are several rust spots along the botTom ring and in the center. I highly doubt I'll be buying another kettle from Oxo again."
"I generally have had GREAT experiences with OXO.  However, this time around, I'm quite disappointed.  The kettle, although usable and reasonably well-designed overall, has a problem with the plastic lid clasp.  In just one year, the lid no longer closes, and I have to use a heavy weight to keep the lid closed while I heat it.I'm having to ditch this kettle and buy a new one.  I wouldn't have expected it to be a 1-year only investment.And to make matters worse, I called their 1-800 customer service line, only to receive a recorded message that the line is currently out of service, and under repair.Looks like it's not just the cheap plastic lid clasp that's an issue for OXO.   :("
"I purchased this less than 3 months ago and was willing to pay more than the average price for an electric kettle because of the band, which has traditionally been reliable, but in such a short time the lid now won't stay down and causes problems with it shutting off.  It is difficult to wash as the opening is small for a hand to fit into and it takes a long time to heat water. the quality isn't there and it looks like it won't last four months, I would not recommend it, definitely not worth the extra money."
"It sells as a premium quality, but it is not.Never had a kettle that is that hard to control pour flow. Very easy to spill over. There was some rubber/plactic odor from the water for first few MONTHS.  Aaaand it died without notice in 2 years, not turning on. Seriously? It's a keetle, not a chinese laptop...I had a unit from Saeco of he same basic design for 5 years. Flawless."
"The glass carafe is nice, but the lid, filter, handle, and base parts are plastic, with a pretty strong, and very tenacious, smell. We cleaned it thoroughly, boiled multiple pots of water, and still found that tea made with the water tasted of plastic. I set it out on the porch for a week, a treatment that usually will get the perfume smell off clothing (comes in smelling of ozone, like it's been out on the clothesline). It didn't work on this; it still smells, and tea still tastes of it. We've had several good OXO products, but they've messed up this time. Either they didn't specify an appropriate material, or they aren't controlling their suppliers. Sorry.Amazon seems to be taking it back for a refund readily."
"I always read the cooks illustrated recommendation for kitchen products and this was their pick- it is truly AWFUL. The worst offense was that when it reaches its boil the steam from the water serves to open the top, when the top is opened the auto shut off stops, which means this will boil continuously until all the water evaporates or someone shuts it off manually. After a thoroughly cleaning and TWENTY full books the water still smelled awful, like some sort of chemical. It’s nice looking and boils quickly, but I must say I’m shocked, oxo usually makes some of my favorite things. This is a dud."
"This kettle lasted almost four years. I feel it fell short of being satisfied. Within a year the top wouldn't pop open until i noticed a small ""O"" ring laying on the bottom of the kettle that had fallen off. I was able to retrieve it and put it back on and the top worked till it fell off again. From that point on I would fill the pot though the spout. About a month ago it kept shutting off and on before reaching boiling temperature. It became to frustrating to use anymore. So it went into the bin and I'm afraid a land fill somewhere. Not well made."
"I followed a review from a source I respect. Big mistake. I’ve had my kettle since January, 2018. I use it to boil water for tea. Best thing about it is it’s large. For the last 2 days I’ve had to take the electric plate off the kettle with my hand when I lifted it. It kept sticking. There is no food residue, no water, no rust. It sticks because the connection is bad. This morning it wouldn’t turn on at all. I have not been pleased with most Oxo products. This one is just very expensive and has quit working much quicker than expected.I DO NOT recommend this kettle. It is expensive for not 2 years’ use."
"Kettle worked great for three months and then the heating switch stopped working.  What a shame - it was a great kettle while it lasted and we love all Oxo products, so we expected the same quality in a $79 tea kettle.  We missed the 30 day return window and did not have an extended warranty.  Our previous one was a Mollo and lasted for three years."
Was great until a plug prong broke off in the outlet after 7 months. Very pricey item for such a short lifespan.
"I saw the rubber ring between glass and metal in the bottom, and I can touch it too. I don't know the rubber ring is safe or not, the seller didn't say anything about it. And the filter is also different from the picture."
The metal flakes off from the bottom surface as tiny particles in the water.  You can’t pour out all the water. I can’t recommend this product.
"Love the style and design of this kettle but we are disappointed with it's short shelf-life for the price. I would expect it to last at least 2 years as our old one, which was cheaper, did. Daily use should be part of a kettle's engineering tolerance but when I went to make the tea just the other night, the switch would not work at all. She just kicked the bucket."
The kettle worked great until the cheap plastic on/off switch failed after only 1.5 years of use.  Using for something that gets as much use as a switch is a design flaw.  Sadly had to throw it away.  I will be using my old-fashioned stove top kettle now.  Tired cheap electronics that don’t even last a couple of years.
"Was great ... for two or three weeks, then the bottom started rusting out. Bought it to keep water on the counter so we could have boiled water and morning tea at the flip of a switch, but apparently this one can’t store water in it overnight and must be dried thoroughly between uses. Not much use to us."
Like new purchase looked like soap or a chemical was used in the kettle. It was ruined and not git to contain anything for consumption.
I am very sorry I bout it.
"Love this but it broke already. Something fell off the lid lifter so it will no longer close however it was a fantastic fast glass, pretty kettle until then. I ordered a new on and will return this one when the new one arrives. I am hoping it was just a lemon. I had it about 6 weeks. I had the 2nd one for about 6 months and the same thing happened. This is a VERY FAULTY  product!! All kettles in the past lasted for years. I need a good quality glass kettle. Anyone know of one?"
Everything works well and I love this kettle but after purchasing it on May 4th 2019 it has lasted only until December 11th. The lock on top of the kettle that holds the lid in place broke and now it is permanently open. This causes water to take longer to boil not to mention an additional risk of injury from steam coming out the top. I expected a much longer life for a small appliance that cost $80. Would not purchase again unless there's a part to replace that's easy to install.
"I never thought I would write something like this about an OXO product. I've had my electrical since May of this year (2021) and already it is not functional. The mechanism that turns on the kettle to heat the water no longer functions. It seems like it was really flimsy and poor quality. Needless to say, I'm an extremely disappointed customer with this product and has me concerned about the direction this company might be headed. If you need/use an electric kettle DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ONE!!!!"
"I’m really bummed. This kettle was recommended and not cheap. I’ve only been using it for a few months and it’s LEAKING around the base of the pot. Apparently it’s too late to return it and I get to eat the cost and buy another one. POOP!! OXO usually creates such excellent quality products, what a pisser! I guess I’ll buy a different brand! I also don’t like the glass, it’s hard to keep clean so I’m going stainless for the next one."
"We bought this tea kettle because we had one just like that from this company; however, we had to buy another as our old one just stopped working after 5 years of faithful service.  We had very favorable opinion of this tea kettle and bought this one but it has very disturbing chemical odor that makes tea absolutely undrinkable.  Unfortunately we got rid of our boxes and cannot send it back, now.  If Amazon ever reads this review, I hope they can resolve this for us."
"It’s hard to believe that Oxo tested this product before bringing it to market. The design is so poor that it’s impossible to pour all of the water out of the kettle. A significant amount remains behind. It’s a fast kettle, good looking and simple, but its poor design was so frustrating that we sent it back."
I have used this electric kettle daily for the past eight months.  Unfortunately the on switch has to be jiggled and manipulated to start the kettle now.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t.  Not worth the price when a simple product like this doesn’t even last a year.
"This kettle seemed ideal but unfortunately after 3 tries I'm throwing in the towel.. It lasts a few months and then stops turning on.  OXO has been good at providing replacements and honoring their policy and their products in general are reliable, but sadly this glass kettle fails repeatedly.  it's also a real hassle to have to return failing kettles one after the other. I hope they can work out the kinks but in the meantime, I'll have to find another brand for a cordless glass kettle."
We have loved this tea kettle and have used it often for 1 1/2 years.  Then it died.  I expected after paying good money for this product that it would continue to function longer.  Another bit of landfill I guess.
"I had the same off flavor in my tea that several reviewers have noted.  With many uses, it was reduced.  But I am now on my second kettle in 2 years because the water stops heating up, the light goes out but the switch is still clicked on.  Now the 2nd kettle doesn’t even turn on. I will choose a different brand."
"This kettle does not produce clean tasting boiled water. It has a strong chemical flavor that is very apparent in tea. You can smell it also. This after washing the kettle with hot soapy water, rinsing well and boiling several jug fulls. I find the Chef's Choice brand to have a clean flavor. Going back to that brand. It is a beautiful kettle and seems to be great quality otherwise."
"Reading some comments, these Kettles seem to suffer a common death: They lose the ability to correctly sense the temperature of the water, and thus fail to turn off at the right time or at all.When our first kettle started to do this, after a year and a half of use, I purchased a new one. But while we waited for the new one to arrive it occurred to me it might be a simple repair. We have rather hard water, and the consequent mineralization can lead to problems.So, duh, why didn't I try demineralizing the kettle before buying a new one? Filling it with white vinegar, bringing it to a near boil, letting it sit for a couple hours, then rinsing, scrubbing, resulted in the kettle working again. We gave this Kettle to our children who have used it in their apartment daily for a year and a half without a problem.The second Kettle started to fail in a similar manner, also after about a year and a half of use. This time, I first removed the black plastic base screwed into the bottom of the kettle, and discovered something like a teaspoon of water rolling around in there, unable to get out. This cannot be good for the electric connections, and would explain some erratic behavior. I blew the water out with an air compressor. Setting it upside down in the sun for an hour or two would accomplish the same.After drying the water out of the kettle's base, I demineralized it with white vinegar. It now works flawlessly again.Update November 01 2013So it has been about six months. The other day, the Breville Kettle failed again, boiling away almost a full pot, never shutting off. So, time to descale, again, I presumed. Filled it as far to the top as possible with white vinegar. Put on boil. Turned it off prior to boil! (If you let it get near boil it will overflow.) Waited an hour. As I poured it out into the sink, I noticed a bluish-green tint to what would otherwise be clear liquid: So, it definitely removed some mineralization. It's been several days and works fine, now.Note: A couple weeks later it started again. This time I used commercial grade demineralizer; the same fluid we use to demineralize our ice maker. It seems to be more effective and the problem went away; it's been a couple months now...Update December 28 2013Ok, this thing failed again. This time I used a demineralizing solution based on phosphoric acid. It worked thereafter once, and then, fail. Ok I am done with it.By the way, a few months ago the ""ding"" stopped working when the water came to temperature, and we just lived with it. Another nail in the coffin of my opinion about this thing.In sum, demineralization seems to work, at first. Then each subsequent demineralization works for a shorter time period, until, forget it, it's dead.We are going to buy another electric kettle but not Breville. Hopefully newer models from other manufacturers are a bit more immune to mineral build up and the other ills we have experienced in the Breville.It's a handsome and accurate appliance but three strikes and you are out, Breville."
"We bought this on March 17 2020 and it is now not working 100% of the time therefore it was time for a comment.  Frustrating that it is just over a year old (need to check warranty but I am sure that is now expired).  We had an older Breville that simply heated water to one temperature.  Not as fancy and very basic so maybe that's why it lasted for 4-5 years.  We also drink tea (not as often thought) and thought this might be worth the $60 upgrade (now that I think about it, that's almost double the price of the previous model so maybe not entirely worth the added price even if it lasted more than a year...oh well).I would have given 5 stars for its functionality and ease of use and overall feel but a few months ago, I started to notice that the kettle wouldn't always start to heat up.  Initially, I thought it was me not hitting the button or something but this has been happening more and more recently.  Now, I expect the kettle to not start the heating process so I wait and confirm that the heating process has really started before I leave and do other stuff; today, it took me 5-7 attempts before it finally started to heat up.  So just over a year in and this is already malfunctioning so much so that I'll probably need to get a replacement.  I haven't checked the warranty so am making no claims on that.  I am simply writing about the durability of this product.  I don't think this was defective since it's been a year (let's say 9 months hassle free) but for a $120 kettle, I expect more than a year's worth of work!Anything short of a free replacement from Breville will lead me to change brands (I doubt I will go back to the lower model; not because of the lack of functions but more about the brand quality) . Again, I haven't checked the warranty but it is disappointing to have to write this review at all (I normally don't write reviews unless a have a bad experience or an exceptional good experience).  I will say this: I did not fully read many reviews on this one product; it had received i think 4-4.5 stars and most people were happy with it).  I probably just assumed good quality based on my previous experience with the prior kettle ($70 and lasted 4-5 years).  PS: I know enough to read the bad reviews on most new products that I am not familiar with but on this, I don't think I did (lesson learned).As for the product itself (the intended experience), I will say that this had worked pretty well for 6-9 months and I did like the capacity (I think 40oz).  The handle was nice and it felt like good quality (rubber texture on the inside) and sturdy to hold.  As far as the temperatures, I think they were always a little below the target but I am not sure if this is common across other brands (I also did not do a scientific test on these.  The main reason I decided to go with this upgraded model was for the KEEP WARM function and this worked well (and for making tea but to a lesser extent).  Anyway, it's a bummer that this didn't hold up/last longer than it did.  Honestly, I would have been happy for 3 years at least given how products are made these days (lack of quality parts/more plastic use/maybe designed to fail so that consumers are pushed to buy replacements or maybe just too high-tech).  Whatever conspiracy you believe in, products are not as durable as they used to be.  Anyway, 1 star for the lack of durability and 1 more star for the intended experience as I just mentioned."
"I have had a prior model of the Breville Electric Kettle that I purchased in 2011.  The kettle still worked fine, but when I got it out to use it this Fall, there was mildew in the kettle, which was very odd and gross. I decided instead of trying to use bleach, etc. to get rid of the mildew, I would go ahead and get a new one.  I just opened up my new kettle and I am so sad to see that there is plastic on the inside of the kettle.  The plastic is part of the pouring 'system' and holds a little strainer.  There was no plastic inside of the 2011 version.I am pretty cautious about using plastic in general, but especially when heating anything that I will eat or drink.  I never use plastic in the microwave, etc.  Having plastic in an electric kettle that will be heated to a boiling over and over again seems very TOXIC.  The kettle is going back.  Maybe I will get a good old fashioned cooktop kettle instead (:"
"This is a very expensive kettle that performs no better than any other kettle I have owned before. For the price of this Breville, you can buy 3 cheaper kettles that have the same performance.Maybe this kettle would last a bit longer than others, but I will be returning and replacing it with a Krups Smart Temp. Also a name brand, but it also comes with an insulated shell and a live temperature reading and costs 1/3 the price."
"I am so angry about ordering this kettle.  I had breast cancer last year so have been making various changes to my life including about what products I use in my home.  I had largely ignored the BPA issue before.  I had a Breville Ikon kettle for years and loved it.  I had taken out the scale filter at the spout and was relatively satisfied that as long as I always emptied the water that I didn't use and always have fresh water to boil that there was limited contact, if any, with plastic.  I was however not going to buy another kettle that I needed to worry about.  I did not know how difficult a task that this would be.  It finally died early this year.I researched for months and made do with a stove top all stainless kettle in the meantime.  After a fruitless search (I cannot believe that it is impossible to find one, the manufacturers should be ashamed of themselves!) I decided to buy this kettle as I had liked my previous Breville and wanted to have the variable temp feature as I have purchased a lot of herbal teas lately.  Plus I thought that I would just remove the scale filter again and would be relatively safe. We live on an island so I ordered this for my husband to bring home when he went to the States on a trip.  He of course discarded the packaging to bring it home.  I was so excited to use it.  I read the instructions first and was horrified to come across this message on page 6:This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm.I could not believe what I was reading.  Especially the part that the warning only applied to California residents like they were the only ones at risk and everyone else would be fine.  So irresponsible.I opened the kettle and rather than just having the plastic filter as in the old models, they now have a large plastic contraption going all the way from the spout to the bottom to hold the filter which I cannot remove.  So now even more plastic is touching the water as it boils or sits in the kettle.  This may be BPA free as they claim but as there is no transparency about the plastic used and its health impact, add to that the warning for California how can I use this kettle!  I have also just wasted the purchase cost and the 25% duty that we had to pay on bringing it home.Some people (even after the research out there) may not be concerned about this but if you are and have been conducting the same fruitless search that I have, please don't purchase."
"My first Breville Variable Temperature Kettle was returned because the black tea setting wouldn't turn off automatically.  The replacement kettle was returned for the same reason.I contacted Breville about this problem, and the first person I spoke with was unable to make me understand why the kettle might take 8 minutes at full boil before it turns off automatically, which, she said, was perfectly normal procedure.  The lady said she'd have the Scientific Expert call back.  He did.The Scientific Breville Expert explained that the amount of water in the kettle, the volume of steam in the pot, the astrological convergence of Mars and Jupiter, and the financial health of his company were all factors in the shutting down of the kettle.  Not being scientific, I understood little that he said past ""volume of steam"" except that the kettle could be expected to boil water 8 minutes and some odd seconds after reaching the 212 degrees for black tea.  (He was quite specific - 12 or 13 or 14 or 15 seconds - I don't remember the exact number.)  Again I was told that this was perfectly normal.  He suggested that I time the kettle myself to verify that my kettle was performing normally.I explained to the rep that I had goats to tend and chickens to feed and didn't have 8 minutes and some odd seconds to watch water boil.  I did time the kettle soon after I got it, but turned it off manually after 5 minutes.  Nowhere in the brochure that comes with the kettle does it mention the 8 minute and some odd seconds rule.Eight minutes and some odd seconds after the water starts to boil would eliminate any oxygen left in the water, and probably boil the pot dry.  This sounded like a fire hazard to me, but the Scientist assured me the empty pot would not cause a meltdown.  After this conversation, it became clear that this kettle was way too complicated for me.  The second was returned, and I did not ask for yet another replacement.In Breville's favor, the green tea and oolong settings worked flawlessly, the lid operated smoothly, and the design is sleek.  If only these features were under consideration, I would give the kettle five stars.  But since there are no negative stars to choose from, a one will have to do.[...] offers a small, variable temperature kettle for a fraction of the cost of the Breville.  It looks a little like a penguin, has a dial to choose you water temperature and works as advertised.  The water boils.  The kettle turns off.  Every time.  Without fail.  [...] has never heard of the 8 minute some odd seconds rule."
"Alright, so. I really wanted a reliable temperature variable kettle for a long time. I looked high and low, and checked out entirely too many kettles before I made my decision. The problems and complaints with all of them: water exposed to plastic, poor quality electrical elements, never lasted long enough. But I love Breville, and it seemed like a safer bet (and more aesthetically pleasing, honestly) than its similar Cuisinart counterpart. So I thought I'd pull the trigger and try this one.To make a long story short: I wasn't any different from anyone else. Two months shy of two years, this kettle is quickly giving up the ghost. I've done everything I should - I clean it regularly, perform good kettle maintenance. It's a family tea kettle, and we've all used it religiously. This thing goes wild when you try to use it, now. Often times, when you push the buttons to select a temperature, it won't take. It turns itself back off. If you try rotating the kettle on the stand to reestablish the connection, as some reviewers have suggested, it MIGHT work then, but it's really hit or miss. About 50% of the time, it will. About 50%, you'll end up in a battle of wills for 5-10 minutes longer, just trying to get to your cup of tea. By the time you're feeling really thirsty, maybe the kettle will decide to heat and give you what you want. Maybe she'll keep throwing a tantrum. You never know. And if she's really feeling sassy, you'll hear a random series of beeps two or three rooms away when nobody is using the kettle to make tea. That's right, it's attempting to turn itself on. Sometimes it does, sometimes it just beeps randomly and turns itself off. Honestly? We're all a little afraid of this haunted kettle at this point. Afraid that this angry ghost is going to start a fire, more like.As much as I loved this kettle at first, paying this price for less than two years of good tea is completely absurd. Please spare yourself from the headaches, and buy something else."
"I purchased this kettle from Amazon in 2016 for about $100. It lasted about two-and-a-half years before the base failed. As another reviewer reported, the unit wouldn't shut off and continued to boil until the kettle was removed from the base—an obvious safety issue if you left the room and trusted the device to do what it's advertised to do.I really liked the kettle and took a chance that this was an isolated problem and purchased another unit in October, 2019, also for around $100. Roughly 6 months later, on 3 occasions over the last month, the start button jammed and wouldn't depress. All three times, I tried different things, including un- and re-plugging it (which at least once resulted in all the base lights lighting up), reseating the kettle on the base, letting the unit sit for a couple hours, etc., and somehow managed to get the device operational. I should point out, I'm obsessively careful with electric appliances. This kettle gets a full cleaning, exterior and interior, per the manufacturer's instructions, once a month.The last time it did this, I finally wised up and started looking at alternative units. When I happened to look up the Breville on Amazon out of curiosity, the price had gone up to $129.Seriously? This a brand killer in my opinion. I don't own any other Breville appliances and after this experience, am very unlikely to do so in the future. My next purchase:, the Cuisinart CPK-17. $74.95.Update—May 09, 2021:I purchased the Cuisiinart CPK-17 and kept it, unopened, as a backup. I managed to nurse a total of 1yr. and 7 months out of the Breville from cradle to recycle bin. The ""no shut-off"" problem never reappeared. It was fairly well behaved until a few days ago, I noticed a sediment in the water after boiling. Although, as I mentioned, I regularly clean the interior of the unit with vinegar and water, as recommended by Breville. I did another 12 hr. vinegar and water decalcification process and 2 days later, the same chalky sediment appeared in the water after boiling.Adios, you overpriced POS.The Cuisinart, although the price has increased to $99.95 (I paid $75 a year ago) appears to be a much better designed appliance: Faster heating, much better features, and lighter. We'll see."
"We have two of these, one at each of our houses. We bought the second because we were initially extremely impressed with the industrial design and and accuracy of the temp control. However after a little over a year (just out of warranty) the temp sensor on the unit that we use the most broke, no longer turning off when it reaches the correct temp.Because it was out of warranty, I took it apart and was a little appalled to see how cheap the electrical design is for a device that costs so much. Rather than using a thermo-couple, there is a kinda janky setup with a pair of metal disks that deform as they heat pushing a linear potentiometer with springs as the rebound. In a harsh environment like a kitchen, this scheme just seems designed to fail as condensation collects in the springs etc. in addition to what I considered to be a poor design, my unit also had the thermal paste applied without care, half of the paste was to the side of rather than under the metal thermal disk.I was able to fix the unit by taking it apart, cleaning the springs and applying fresh thermal paste. However, I expect that this won't be the last time that I need to service it.Unfortunately, further disassembly is almost impossible because rather than assembling it wth screws, the temp sensor is assembled with 14 very small very thin bent sheet metal tabs that at best will open and close one additional time before snapping."
"This was a great kettle, it worked exactly as advertised, until it didn't. I bought it just a little over two years ago after deciding to spend a bit more to get quality, because all my previous kettles failed after a while. Well the investment turns out not to be worth it, now it still boils water, but you have to unplug it to get it to shut off. All of the controls have failed."
Well in all fairness I did get almost 2 years out of it but it has now stopped heating the water. I've used this Kettle multiple times a week since I got it. I make coffee almost every morning using a French Press and this thing used to heat the water perfectly every time. Well until this morning that is. This morning I poured in about 20oz of water turned it on and walked away. A few minutes later I returned expecting it to be completed but the light was still on indicating it was still heating up. So I waited and then noticed it didn't seem to be even warm. I unplugged it and plugged it back in. Everything reset as always and it looked ready again. I tried it again and the same thing happened it just acted like it was heating up but it wasn't. Then I felt the base of the unit and it was getting rather warm but not the kettle or the water. I unplugged it and now I'm worried it might burn my house down so now I'm probably going to buy something new. I did get two good years out of it but I'm surprised it only lasted Two. While it worked it was a great product.
"We've had this kettle for about 8 months or so. During its first 6 months it worked really well and quickly became our favorite way of heating up water. However an issue has appeared in the last couple months that makes the kettle a lot less useful. It seems the temperature sensor inside the unit may be faulty because the kettle shuts off way too early. When you first start the cycle you can hear the unit click on and the water start to heat up, then after about 20 seconds of heating there's another click and you hear the heating element turn off (the lights remain on, but no additional heat). After about 30 seconds or so the unit will click back on and heat for another 10-20 seconds or so before cycling back off. The unit only will reach temperature after about 10-15 minutes this way - it's really unacceptable.At first we thought maybe the inside just needed to be cleaned so we removed the filter and checked the inside of the kettle - it's completely clean. After emailing Breville they have issued an RMA and we are returning this item for repair. Will update this review once the issue is resolved.Update 12/28/12. The new RMA unit is doing the same thing again after about 6 months of daily use. I can no longer recommend this kettle at all. For the money you pay for it this shouldn't happen. Again, our water isn't hard, there's no residue built up on the inside of the kettle - it's perfectly clean. It's just if you use it on the lower temperature settings it starts taking forever to heat the water to 175 degrees because the unit cycles on and off so much.Update 7/13/13. After around 6 months the replacement unit ended up doing the same thing. It seems to happen less if you are only going to use the kettle to boil water on the highest setting, but if you make a lot of tea like I do and use it on lower temperatures it seems to have this problem after a few months of daily use. It makes the temperature setting virtually useless. I now regret purchasing this kettle and wish I had gone with something else."
"I have owned 3 of these, but after a year, year and a half they just die, and they should last longer than that.Maybe too much fancy circuitry, I don't know, and it's great while it works, but I will never buy another.You can buy 4 cheap non fancy teakettles without all the bells and whistles for the price of this one, and I will see if they break down as often. Time will tell, but for $140 Breville needs to make a more durable product."
"This is a great product. It heats quickly, can hold variable temperatures, and all of those other great things you already know about. Oh, and it's gorgeous.So why the lousy review? It's junk quality and Breville doesn't stand behind their product.Well inside of the warranty period, we started having two problems with this kettle. First, pushing the button no longer opens the lid if it's hot (you have to pry it open) and second the beeper no longer works so you have no idea when your water is ready.I contacted Breville, still well within the warranty period, and was thoroughly unimpressed by the quality of their service and willingness to stand behind their product. The best I could get them to agree to was ""ship it to us - at your expense - and we'll decide whether to replace it or to ship it back to you - at your expense."" So despite a clear manufacturing fault with an in-warranty product, they want me to go out of pocket to send it to them before they decide whether or not there really is a problem at all. Shipping cost both ways is half the cost of the kettle itself.I'm now well out of the warranty period and wanting to replace this with a fully functioning kettle, but it looks sadly like Breville might still be the only show in town on this product. I'm going to see if I can repair it myself first.Bottom line: Awesome kettle when it works. But don't count on this lasting a long time, and don't count on Breville to honor the warranty.UPDATE AUGUST 2019:I was gifted another one of these kettles about six months ago. It has failed in the same ways. The lid must be pried open, it no longer beeps when the water is heated, sometimes it continuously boils the water endlessly instead of turning off, and the buttons are unresponsive and unpredictable. This thing is junk, do not buy."
"Purchased this in June is 2016.  Initially, I was quite pleased. It was, at the time, the only kettle that offered a coffee French press setting (200F), and it really made a difference in the taste of my coffee.  Two years on, of at least once per day usage, the electronics are broken such that it beeps constantly, as if the water was heated to temp and ready for use, regardless of whether it's turned on or not.  As long as the device is plugged in, it sounds the 'ready' tone every minute.  Maddening.  Of course, it has a one year warrantee, so we have no recourse.  It pretty pricy for a two year obsolescence window.Fortunately in the interim lower priced models have the French press setting.  At least if your spending $45 for the kettle, replacing it every two years or so, while still not ideal, is a much less bitter pill to swallow."
"Since I make tea 5-10 times a day I liked the temperature controls, the swivel base, and the thumb-controlled lid; together they allowed the whole operation of filling it and turning it on (except for running the water) to take about ten seconds.  I can go back to my desk and work without worrying about heating the water longer than necessary.Two things I didn't like: (1) The beep is very loud, and when I use the Hold feature, it sometimes got into a feedback loop where it would keep reminding me several times a minute that it was ready.  (2) It failed after 36 months of use, whereas my previous kettle lasted well over a decade before I replaced it due to a sticky mechanical switch.  The way it failed was this:  One day I heard the water boiling even though it was set to a lower temperature.  (Presumably it would have stayed on until the backup sensor detected it had boiled dry.)  After unplugging it and letting it cool off, it beeped continuously every time I plugged it in."
"I have owned this kettle for 2 years and bought one for a present for someone who stayed at my home one time and liked it so much, they wanted one! It's an attractive kettle. The various temperature settings are really nice as well for those who drink various teas, such as greens, where it is recommended not to use boiling water to prevent a bitter taste. On the downside, the bottom of the kettle develops a bit of a film over time. Also, I found that the lid would stick after owning this kettle for some time. This week, the kettle broke in that it no longer senses what temperature it has and just constantly boils any water placed in it. Hence, I'm looking for a new kettle, since this one is either on (when plugged in) or off (when I pull the plug) at this point. My hope would have been that it lasted longer given the cost."
The dreaded beeping every time you touch a button or move it is silly.  It does the same thing the other brands do and they are rated higher and cost less.  I got suckered into the brand name!
"Straight out of the box this didn’t work. Powered on, pushed correct buttons for Black Tea and it literally did not work. No heat, nothing! At first thought it was Operator Error, But No! Own other Breville products and they’re great.  What a disappointment and What a Shame!Side note:  Do not like or appreciate the fact that although the interior is all stainless steel, the water is always in contact with plastic because the filter from spout to nearly the bottom of the pot is PLASTIC. Breville could have and should have made this piece in stainless steel as well.  But of course the electrical components need to work as well. LolBreville….back to the drawing board with your R&D on this one!"
"I drink various types of teas constantly to my dentist's consternation, such as Irish and East Frisian in the morning with Pu Erh Tuo Cha and Green Jasmine in the evening. On the weekends I drink French Pressed coffee.I did it the old fashioned way with a thermometer. Needless to say, but I will anyway, this kettle did make life simpler, but, (always a but) it has not functioned as advertised.The primary issue is on the boiling setting for black teas.  Sometimes it shuts off, and sometimes it doesn't.  The other presets have worked flawlessly, and this may only be an anomaly with this particular pot.I will say that I am going to order a second one, and send this one back to Breville for repairs.  That should tell you how much I like the idea of this kettle."
"Purchased this kettle in May 2009 with high hopes.  We are avid French press coffee drinkers and also enjoy a variety of teas.  This kettle seemed perfect for our needs.  We use the kettle on a daily basis, usually heating water 3-4 times per day.  Near the end of the first year I started to notice that the temperature sensor was not shutting off at the desired temperature and would continue on to a FULL rolling boil despite lower temps being selected.  Magically, this would correct itself and then happen again.  Now it is happening more than not, rendering the kettle unreliable for our needs.  I am also concerned that with a malfunctioning thermostat (which is what appears to be the case) this kettle might not shut off at all, leading to a fire hazard.  Overall, while we enjoyed the kettle for it's first year, it is now lived out it's usefulness and considering it is out of warranty, a loss. My silver lining lies in the fact that I purchased it w/ my AMEX card so through their Buyer's Assurance program, my warranty is doubled - so I will recoup my investment in the end.  So buyer-beware, this kettle seems to have a useful life of about 1 to 1.5 years.  Other reviewers have also noted a similar breakdown after this time-frame.  For the price, this kettle is overall a poor value.  I will not be purchasing a replacement from Breville with my AMEX reimbursement and will shop for other options...maybe the new Cuisinart will be of better quality.  I hope this helps you in making your choice!"
"Lip is too thick to insert in refrigerator's water dispenser to fill kettle.  Spout is too stubby for same reason. Also, I prefer a skinny spout for high pouring / aeration. I'd need to develop 'muscle memory' to adjust my method of pouring water for tea."
I initially bought a cheap kettle of this kind but after a few days the lid would not open. So I got this one thinking it would be the Rolls Royce of kettles only to find out that it would have the same problem. Not as bad but sometimes the lid will open about half way. I had to open the lid with a tool but I can open this one fully by hand. However if I wanted to do that I could have saved myself $100 and kept the other one. If I buy a Rolls Royce I expect to be able to enter through the doors and not have to climb through a window. I emailed the company to see if there was some fix that they might have to allow the lid to open but they have just ignored my question. It has been over a week and I have not heard a word. I must say that I have contacted other upper end appliance manufacturers with problems or questions and have always received a response. I guess I will not be buying anything from Breville again.
"I love Breville products (we have 6 different Breville appliances.)  This kettle is the first one that broke down, and made it necessary for me to interact with their service department.  We had it for a little over one year (really? Only one year warranty on a top of the line product?).  The kettle simply stopped boiling the water.  Since this is the primary function of a kettle, it became useless.  Initially, the service department responded.  Opened a “case” number, and took a week to come back with an offer:  Repair at the cost of $70, or take a discount of 20% and buy a new one.  I replied that I want it repaired and please send me instructions on where to ship it to.  That was the last I heard from them.  Despite multiple emails.  I should have read the other reviews here.  It seems like this is one of their worst products.  You can only be happy with it until it breaks down, and it WILL happen shortly after the warranty expires...  My big worry now is:  what if I need service for my expensive coffee machine?  What a disappointment."
"I should have read these reviews and shopped smarter. I had the same experience of this thing failing on me exactly two months shy of the two year mark just like previous reviewers. In that time I used this kettle almost three times a day, so it saw some fairly heavy use.Right out of the box the variable temperature settings were not accurate, a simple check with a thermometer showed that actual water temperatures were always way lower than the button setting. For this reason using the variable temperature settings were a moot point as the highest (Black Tea) setting was about the only one that got used from then on. The keep warm function was a joke: it never stayed set and the kettle required babysitting to keep it hot if I needed to step away for a moment. Ultimately the electronic base component had a stroke, any time it was plugged in turned into a beeping and blinking electric light show and the kettle became useless.For the price I expected way better than this, two years of sub-par service. If I wanted a disposable temporary appliance I would have shopped at Walmart and spent WAY less."
"Why oh why oh why oh why do I always think when reading poor reviews 'oh they just got a lemon, it's going to be fine, I must have it, because that won't happen to me'.  So of course, even with pretty mediocre reviews, but because it's a Breville, and it looks so cool, and it will match the Breville toaster oven and espresso machine, I opt for this one.  Big mistake.  Now, I might be a very frequent tea drinker.  But I'm British, that's what we do.  We drink tea.  A lot of tea.  Every single day.  Morning, noon, evening, midnight.  But even with that kind of usage, you still shouldn't expect a kettle to die after two weeks.  That's just ridiculous.  So back it goes.  Defective and as lovely as it looks, I just cannot bring myself to get a replacement.  It's like breaking up with a bad boy.  You know they're bad, and you really, really want to have him back even though you know he's just going to mess you up again.  So I am relying my now 40 years of maturity and not replacing this one.  I don't trust it.  So, sorry bad boy, go work your charms on some other poor unsuspecting sap of a wussy bird who likes tea.  A lot."
Not exactly thrilled with the Breville BKE820XL. I'm keeping it but don't like the almost inaudible beep it makes when the correct temperature has been reached. Good thing I have a very small kitchen otherwise I wouldn't hear it. The method by which the kettle gets to the selected temp is strange. The kettle rumbles like it is approaching boiling and then it quiets down then begins heating again and then you hear the faint beep when the correct temp has been achieved. I called customer service and the rep told me that it was suppose to do what I just described. It's strange - I hope I haven't wasted my money. Keeping my fingers crossed!
"We had this kettle for about 1.5 years. After a couple of months the lid stopped working properly - it was not always opening when you pressed the button. Not a big deal, but an inconvenience. Now the plastic below the handle fell off. Also would not be much of a problem, but for the fact that it was held by two bolts that went THROUGH the side of the kettle, so that now there are two holes there (I'll try to insert a pic, but not sure if Amazon allows that).Anyway, it's a great kettle, but for $150 I expected it to last longer than 1.5 years.[...]"
"I knew the reviews were not great, but I’ve had such great luck with other Breville products I wanted to give it a try. I’ve had mine for 4 months now, and I’m so disappointed that I came here to give it a bad review which I NEVER do. It worked fine for 2-3 months, and then it acted like it had lost its mind. It “works” in that it boils water, but the Keep Warm function no longer works (one of the main reasons I bought it), and after you pour out your water and it is allegedly “off” it then beeps at random intervals until you finally unplug it in a rage. Then when you go to boil water again (since it won’t keep it warm for you as it’s supposed to) you can’t turn it back on. I don’t mind paying a lot for a kettle if it works as it should, but this thing isn’t worth the money at all. Get it together, Breville!"
"I’ve had this electrical kettle for a little over a year. One night the kettle turned on by itself and started smoking. It smelled like burning plastic, now when it’s connected it turns on by itself and starts to smoke. Thank god I was awake when this happened because this is and electrical hazard, again I can’t even plug it in the wall. I’ve tried calling customer support and no one answers. Seems like this was really badly manufactured and is a potentially hazardous product.. if I wasn’t around /awake when this happened my whole building could’ve burned down. I would take a video but honestly not going to risk it."
"We are very disappointed in this product.  The idea is great, and for the first few months it worked perfectly.  But we have now gone through 2 of them that have failed after several months.  We think that maybe it's the moisture that causes it after the water heats up - a lot of moisture builds up between the kettle and heating unit.  At first you have to dry it off and keep hitting the buttons until it goes on, but ultimately it stops working all together.  We're going to try a different brand this time..."
"It's a pretty contemporary looking kettle. Does what advertised.The major issue is it's single wall so body becomes extremely hot. The handle is well insulated but I still touching the body with my knuckles from time to time when grabbing it. The other flaw that follows is it's cooling down very fast (if not using temperature hold function, which is waste of electricity if you will leave it on and wouldn't have a tea any more for some reason).Boils water slower than my old plastic one but not significantly.We're drinking tea all the time, not coffeeMy wife likes it so let it be."
"Black spots emerge on base inside the kettle, some of which are removable others not. Water once boiled has a sheen of particles on top of the the water despite following a good cleaning on the inside. Any idea where all of this is coming from. I use only bottled water."
"When it works, it is fine. However, about 2.5 years after purchase it started malfunctioning: it would stop way before the water reaches the desired temperature, and do that repeatedly so that we would actually not be able to boil water in it.When I called Breville Customer Service, they basically told me that the unit was ""old"" and that therefore the only thing they would be able to offer me was to send the unit in for service. The cost would be 69 USD. This is 53% of the original purchasing price.On top of that , the customer service representatives were unfriendly and condescending.I wanted a unit that lasts for less than 3 years, and sales associates that treat customers with disrespect, I could have gotten that for a lot less money."
"Seriously, this thing is beep crazy. I love the brand and my mom has a previous model which is fantastic.  BUT IT’S SO NOISY! Beep to start Beep to press your temp Beep when it’s done Beep every time you pick it up Beep every time you put it back on the base. SAY NOT TO BEEPS!! I returned it to find a quieter model so my morning post yoga tea moments are not interrupted. OK bye."
"I love this kettle when it works, but wouldn't purchase again.Originally purchased in 2015, this kettle started having electronic problems approx one year after purchase. The kettle wouldn't turn off, wouldn't respond when a specific temp level button was pressed, etc.customer service was good about taking it back and shipping a replacement. However, they did initially send me the incorrect product -- a toaster -- which caused additional hassle since they required me to provide a credit card number so they could charge me for it if not returned.The replacement arrived and has been working fine for a few months. However, as with the first, it has already developed some rust around the rim. No electrical issues so far, but I wouldn't be surprised to encounter problems in 6 months or so."
"I ordered this item because it seems to be popular with a number of users. Not all should I say and I did not listen to the voices of wisdom. The complaints were mostly about the lack of reliability of this pot. People were complaining about the kettle not working after a few days or months. Well... They were right! I bought this thing mid October 2013, a week later the kettle lights up but won't heat. Great Amazon Service I got a replacement immediately and I have been happy ever since until last week. I got up one morning and started my tea routine and realized that the kettle is not working. After several tries, I came to the conclusion that it was dead. So I did better than some and got satisfaction for 7 months for $129.00. Breville who are you kidding? How can this piece of scrap metal be still on the market? Maybe because of too many softies like me who keep buying this kind of trash.Frankly, Amazon should take it off the ""shelf"" to protect its consumers"
"I've had this tea kettle 2 years, and really liked it until I found out about the BPA in the plastic, which was disenchanting. I stopped filling the kettle to the top and re-heating the water until I used it  up(for me,  just several hours). Filling it each time I made tea was a pain.Today, I picked the kettle up to wipe it off, and the plastic side piece fell off. I didn't pay much attention, figuring I would just use the kettle without it. I didn't realize the exterior plastic piece was screwed into the interior of the pot until I tried to boil water and discovered steam coming out of a whole in the side of the pot. Apparently, the exterior plastic piece was held in place by screws, both of which broke off. One screw and the attached silicone plug fell in the pot.Needless to say, I'm very disappointed that a tea kettle costing over $125 lasted only 2 years."
"Completely agree with ""kalzo's 1-star review (and others) that I would have given this 5 stars after a few months but cannot recommend it since it stopped working properly after a while. kalzo wrote: ""The kettle intermittently does not shutoff when it reaches the proper temp of 200F. Instead it continues to heat to a boil and will boil itself dry unless turned off."" The same thing happened to ours. It worked perfectly at first but now shuts off properly only half the time. I must always check it to make sure it doesn't just endlessly boil the water. Since I drink green tea, this is especially annoying since I bought this kettle precisely because I did not want to boil the water. This kettle has a ""green tea"" setting, but it works only half the time."
I heated on the lower heating option..it was silent fast and OK BUT the kettle gets SUPER HOT outside BEWARE!
Rusted top rim after 1.5 years of use (we had a Breville kettle before - was was working and looking great for at least 5+ years).  Also has a poor contact with the charging base resulting in constant beeping till you get the alignment right. Worked great while it was under warranty.
"So the first unit we purchased lasted 5 or so months.  Then the lid would just randomly open of its own accord.  We returned and got a replacement unit.  That lasted another year, until the heating element just stopped working.  Lights work.. buttons work.. but it doesn't actually heat the water.  Unfortunately their warranty does not extend to replacement products, it retains the original warranty, which doesn't make a lot of sense to me.So they offered a 6 month warranty for 70 bucks.  Considering it will probably fail again under a year, I'd feel like I am leasing a kettle, instead of buying one.  Not recommended for quality reasons and a poor return policy."
"Kette worked fine, but value for price turned out to be pretty low when it died so quickly, Will buy a less expensive replacement."
"We've had this kettle for 3+ years. Boils water quickly without fail, but the last couple years has been very inconsistent about stopping at the lower temps used for teas. I initially was enthusiastically recommending this to friends, if purchesing this type of product again I would be considering other brands."
"I got this kettle to brew the perfect cup of coffee and I loved it for the first 6 months. Then things started going south. The kettle intermittently does not shutoff when it reaches the proper temp of 200F. Instead it continues to heat to a boil and will boil itself dry unless turned off. Now the audible alarm has stopped working. I can't trust the thermostat and the kettle shouldn't be left unattended - the 2 main reasons for purchasing it!I feel that for what this kettle costs it should have lasted a lot longer. If I had written this review when I first got this kettle I would have given it 5 stars, but experiencing such failure in so short a period of time I can only give it 1 star. I wonder how many of the 5 star reviews were posted right out of the box.I really got spoiled when this kettle as working properly. I'm on a quest now to find a reliable replacement."
"This is a good tea kettle but it doesn't last. I've been through two of them, used every day, and they burn out after about a year. Not what I expect from Breville, not what I expect at this price."
"I have owned this product less than one year and it has stopped working. I am in the process of obtaining warranty service. The Breville voice mail system appears designed to make the customer go away. Almost any number you press leads to a lengthy recorded message, not to a live rep. Having called the voice mail system multiple times, and tried various options, I finally, after a lengthy hold period, got through to a live rep.I was informed that I can exercise the warranty but that I must purchase my own shipping materials. I suggested they ship a replacement unit to me and I would ship the broken unit back in the new unit's packaging but this is not their policy. So I must pay (in money and time) to remedy Breville's defective product quality.To summarize: Breville product quality, customer service, and warranty service are poor."
The kettle is very nice but it stops and starts heating two or three times until it finally comes to temperature. This takes longer than normal and wastes energy. Breville who were very helpful told me that it was because I live at altitude (only 2400ft) but I don't think that is the reason.
"It worked well for exactly two years, and then it simply stopped heating water. The lights in the base still came on, so I assume the element had burnt out. I think we deserved four years for the price."
Update...**** I bought this a little over a year ago and all of a sudden it started beeping...cutting off and on according to the little lights but either way I saw it as a hazards...I paid $129 for it because I thought with the brand it would be better...not for that length of time! After seeing new reviews I knew of failure rate I knew I had made a huge mistake...too late for me but not for you!I love this and I am only disappointed I didn't own it sooner...no more waiting for water to heat up especially for making tea...
"I have tried so many Tea Kettles and I finally splurged, convinced that Breville would get it right... Notwithstanding the BPA in the plastic, which is silly, the temperatures are 20 degrees off.  Book says plus or minus 10 degrees, which is annoying but livable, but 20? no... I tried each of the temps and the all were really high.  I bought the Oster before this and had the same problem, but the Oster was only $30.00.... not $130.00.  If the temp doesn't matter to you, and the BPA is not a problem, you will LOVE the kettle because it is beautiful and cool... But, for me, the temperature is a HUGE deal because, when making coffee and tea, it makes all the difference in the world.  So, I am sorry to have to say it... Big Thumbs DOWN... Don't buy it."
"I read good reviews about this item, but nobody mentioned that the plastic bottom portion of the tea kettle smells has burnt plastic. When I contacted the seller about the problem, he advised me that if I want to return the item there is a 50% re stocking charge, which is very high."
"First kettle stopped working after 12 months. Breville exchanged it for a new one at no cost. The new kettle worked fine for 4-5 months, but occasionally would not shut off when water reaches the desired temperature. I decided to write a review tonight after it happened again: the kettle was on for about 10 mins and water continued to boil. Evaporations caused a damage to kitchen cabinets and outlets. IT IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE. I probably wouldn't buy it again. The only reason I gave 2 starts because Breville exchanged the first kettle without any hastle."
"A lot of the 1 star reviews are super bitter, and usually over something stupid. I initially rated this 5 stars, but it just has to be dropped down. The very first one of these I ordered, years ago. Was fantastic. Got almost four years of life out of it. That's fine, I don't expect it to last forever. But I purchased two now, the first barely survived one year. And then upon ordering a replacement, it arrived dead on arrival. Won't even start up the boiling process. I don't know if they changed the chip manufacturer in the base, or what changed, but the quality has come SO far downhill, and so quickly, I won't buy from them again. Went from a glowing 5 star recommendation to a 1 star warning to stay away in 5 years. Don't buy it."
"I received this product today and I was very disappointed. Breville sent me a used, broken product, it even had water in it. I am very unhappy."
This tea kettle has lasted for a year and four months but it should have lasted for years.  It no longer shuts off automatically and it doesn't always come on when the heat button is pushed.  It is sturdy and a beautiful design but it just isn't holding up.
"I am a heavy tea drink and variable temperature kettle just sounds so good for me.  I really like the intuitive control functions.  Very easy to operate.  I read the reviews from others on concerns of plastic.  It was mine too but at the same time I didn't know who much it would bother me. But after I have used it for a few weeks and I could still smell the plastic in the water, it does bother me.  It is a shame since otherwise this could be a perfect one for me.  I am going to return this and will continue to search."
"We bought this kettle about six months ago.  We were initially very pleased with it - it's very easy to make water the appropriate temperature for your tea, very easy to use, etc.However, about two months ago, the plastic top of the kettle began to develop cracks.  We've been using the kettle normally, haven't dropped it, etc, but now the top of the kettle is completely cracked, and mold is beginning to develop in the cracks.We're contacting Breville since its under warranty, but this should not have happened under normal use."
I received this kettle today.  I filled it for the first use and watched the water leak out of the viewing window into a puddle on the counter.  It appears the plastic viewing window is not sealed properly.  It leaked about half a cup of water in less than 30 seconds.  I am just glad I did not place it on the plugged in base; I believe that could have been very dangerous.  Very poor quality.  I am returning it today and will go to a specialty store to see if they have something of higher quality.  It seems that every kettle sold here on Amazon has reports of serious flaws.I am not unhappy with Amazon.  They will take the product back promptly and I have never had an issue buying from Amazon.
I've just had it delivered. Well now this kettle has a plastic filter inside. My old kettle didn't have any plastic except water level viewing areas. Unfortunately this filter was not mentioned in the product description.  And there is a small metal nail inside the kettle with a kind of a silicon gasket. I have to return it. It is sad because I had the same kettle for 8 years and liked it. I would give 5 stars to my old model.
"This is my second Breville kettle.  The first one quit after a couple of years.  I looked at all the kettles Amazon sells and decided to give the Breville another chance.  I ordered another one.  It arrived in short order due to Amazon doing an excellent job.  I took it out of the box and filled it with water and guess what?  It doesn't work.  There seems to be no quality control at Breville. I have a Breville toaster and a toaster oven and to be fair, have not had any problems with them.  They just do not seem to want to put the effort into making a really reliable Tea Kettle.  I certainly would not recommend this product."
"I purchased the Breville BKE820 XL, electric tea kettle in March of 2015.  Today, December 4, 2015 the Breville tea kettle no longer works; the start/stop button is non functioning, the notification of the water reading a boiling state no longer works.  I believe I paid close to $100.00 for this appliance, for that amount of money spent, I do expect the item to function for the one year warranty.  Don't buy a Breville..........."
I purchased one and when it quit after 6 months I liked it so much that I bought another one.  I bought the second in November 2013 and it stopped heating water in April 2014.  It would be a great appliance if it didn't stop working in such a brief amount of time.  The ROI simply isn't there for the cost.  We used it once a day which I don't think is excessive.  I would advise not to buy this based on my experience of two failures.
This is the 2nd one I purchased!.. First one was on 2015.. this one was in 2016!  Both were purchased on Amazon. I can send you a picture of both of them. Both have electric short!  I made sure I didn’t have any water come in contact with the electrical elements.. yet they both don’t work!  Too expensive to keep replacing. It’s a shame because you’re a reputable company tats obviously heard this complaint before- yet haven’t fixed the problem!It’s misleading to the consumer!.. I hardly ever take the time to review a product but felt the need to let others know:-((
"Get it from Best Buy. At least they can follow through with an accurate delivery estimate, unlike Amazon, which was late three out of three separate occasions with 48-hour delivery delays."
"I used to have a kettle like this for almost 5 years without any issues. When it broke down I bought this model and it looks like the design is much worse - there are many plastic parts which didn't exist in the prior model. Also, it started rusting after the first 4-5 months and it completely died 2 months after the warranty expired. I would not recommend to spend 130$ for a kettle that rusts and breaks down very soon."
We purchased Breville to avoid frequent replacements of cheaper kettles that started leaking or got rust within half a year. What a surprise awaited us! A $100+ product did it 2 times faster - bottom and edge got rust after 3 months.
Loved it but . . . It lasted a year and 1/2 month (until just after the warranty expired).  Then it started beeping and lights were cutting on and off.  I had to unplug it to get it to stop beeping.  I have to place the kettle just right on the base to get it to work -- which takes several tries.  It's getting worse and worse.
It is not working after only 8 months of use.  It had issues from the beginning. It would turn off by itself. Company does not support and respond to your calls or emails despite the fact that warranty is 1 year. It is under warranty but I was not able to get support
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The Breville BKE820XL kettle started to shut off intermittently. Sometimes it's impossible to even turn the kettle on and it shuts off in the middle of heating up water. The kettle basically became useless after three years of gentle operation.After finally reaching Breville I was offered a repair service for $70, making it perhaps one of the most expensive (and still unreliable) kettles: $130 purchase price + $70 repair would equal $200 for three years of use at $66 per year.Save your money and buy from a different company that makes solid products and that respects its customers a bit more than Breville."
"We purchased this Breville tea kettle 3 years ago and it's already stopped working. It would shut off half way through heating the water. After a few months, it wouldn't even heat when it was turned on.  While we do like the Breville brand,  I did expect more longevity from paying $130 for an electric tea kettle."
We purchased a replacement Breville BKE820XL in January 2012 and then another in July 2013.  We have had problems with the plastic lids cracking &/or flying off on both them and even with a replacement (refurbished) for the first purchase.  Result- will not buy any more Breville.  We don’t mind paying for quality products-  this one has the price but not the quality.  We’ll look for a glass or metal lid.
"I've had this for 4 years and now when I use it on the highest setting, it only goes up to 140 F. I've checked with a thermometer. Disappointing for the price. That and the beeps are annoying. Will not be rebuying."
"This is a very high priced item for the product which has a plastic smell after even 2 weeks of use. It was to replace the cuisinant one with similar features but i think it’s the other way around. Maybe the materials and plastic parts heating up like that make that smell. Not sure but otherwise, it is nice looking and a good idea in theory."
This is what I received a used cuisineart tea kettle. I ordered new not used
"Since the cheaper coffee pots I had been buying kept falling apart within 6 months to a year, I decided to splurge and buy this more expensive model highly recommended by a friend.  Within two years it started falling apart, too late to return for a refun.  So I didn't save any money after all.  So disappointed, because it's a beautiful looking machine."
"I was waiting for this product for a week. I paid for this 119$ because It was mentioned that made in USA, however on the product is written that made in CHINA ! We found the same one for 68 $. It looks good. My friend purchased the same one which is made in USA, but there is a big difference in material quality made in USA and in China. So I am very disappointed and going to send it back  ! is a fraud !"
"This is the second time I purchased this kettle. Very disappointing. Works great for about 18 months then the beginning of the end starts. The auto shut off does not work, and when you put it on to boil, it often just turns itself off before it's even boiled. I just purchased a new kettle and this time it won't be Breville. I expected far better quality for the high!"
I have had this Kettle for 4 months and the keep warm function doesn't work.  The first IQ Kettle from Breville did the same thing. I guess it is a problem with them. Trying to get service is unreal. I have call multiple times and have to hang up after two hours of waiting. Tried their call back option.Still waiting for them to call me. It has been well over 24 and still no call back. I thought Breville was better then this.
"Unfortunately, this item has turned out to be yet another example of the poor quality and workmanship that has become the current standard. No doubt made in China or some sweat shop, this kettle burned out a year and only a few days beyond its warrenty. My last cheapy kettle is over 17 years old and my nephew states that it continues to work like a charm. But such quality is only a small reminder of what once was. I am informed that it would be cheaper to replace this item than to have it repaired. Not likely!"
I never write bad reviews but this kettle didn’t come with the mesh filter and the box was damaged.  I suspect it had already been used!!!!  Extremely disappointed as this was supposed to be a gift for someone and I won’t be able to get another one in time now!
"Loved the design, but very unhappy with the product itself. When boiling water it smells as if the plastic part that gets immersed in water is melting. Initially thought, it was happening because the kettle was new. But it smelled even after initial use. I am a big fan of Breville products.. this one disappointed me though."
"I have had this kettle in daily use for a year and a half, and while it performed well for much of that time, it now is flakey.  It turns itself off randomly while warming water, and often doesn't register that the kettle is in place. For the money, I expected a bullet-proof kettle.  I have had much cheaper kettles that have lasted for far longer than this one.  In short, a waste of money."
"A bit on heavy side, especially when it's full. One too many functions/options... this is what makes it so expnsive. Not worth it."
"This kettle is essentially brand new - very lightly used for just a few months and now has stopped working completely. Flat out won’t heat water, it’s actual only use."
"This kettle was doing great job. But stopped working 2 months ago. When you make selection of brew type / temperature buttons on the base plate, it will come off immediately. Sometimes, after repeating the process pressing the buttons about 10 times, the heating process will start. Now it does not start heating at all.My family bought another brand at fraction of the price I paid for Braville, but I convinced them to return it saying that Braville is a higher quality premium brand."
This kettle was dirty  and does not work at all ..  I am going to send it back to get refund
"Controls don’t work at all!  This product is defective, too many reviews have similar issues. My problem is I have to insert the plug into wall to get kettle to work and then pull plug out of the wall in order to turn it off."
"I bought the used like new box, for so saved just $20 from the $120 and the bottom was rusty and scratched throughout. Ontop of that, two of the five buttons didnt work at all.Should not be like that for an top of line kettle."
"Breville IQ Electric Kettle, Brushed Stainless Steel, BKE820XL when we received it.we also need the warranty to refund $21.00Please give us credit back."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            After only a few days use, the sound of the water coming to temperature is so loud that it is hard to hear the tv in the connecting room. This kettle was a replacement to another Breville that had the same issue after only a few days. Temperature control is great but sound is too loud. The video is only a moment after setting it to green tea. Higher temperatures are even worse."
"Kettle was great for two years, then it started randomly powering on and off while trying to heat water.  It appears some electrical connection in the base is either loose or shorting out.  Out of warranty now, so looks like it goes in the trash bin."
"After a while it stopped turning off automatically, boiled for a very long time, or wouldn't switch on. I'm very disappointed because I have other products by Breville that are working well.Basically, it doesn't function for too long. Going to look at a different company for a replacement. 😕"
The lid pops open at the slightest disturbance (you don't have to come close to touching the button). Other than that it's a nice teapot.
This electric tea pot is extremely loud. Sounds like an engine starting up. I previously had a Cuisanart electric tea pot and it was ver quiet. Very disappointed with the noise.  Everything else works fine.
I bought this in September of 2016. Wishing a year it started having problems turning on and staying on. It would switch itself off intermittently before boiling. It is now leaking water from underneath when it reaches boiling. From the reviews this all seems like common problems. This is my second Breville and probably the last.
"At first we did like it, but now it works wrong most of the times- starts heating, then suddenly stops, the n starts again...Looks like it's has some issues with contacts or something like that. Unfortunetely it's little bit late to return it...Don't know what to do.."
Horrible product. Used it only a few times (not a tea drinker only use for guests) and it has stopped working. Contacted Amazon customer service and was told I have to work with the manufacturer because it is it is very old. I haven’t even had it a year.
"I used to love this kettle. My first one failed after several years and I bought this brand new replacement two weeks ago. This one has stopped working twice now. I no longer have confidence that Breville products work consistently, as I’ve been stuck three times in one month without a way to boil water."
good product except that it takes a while to come to full boil; no temp control
"I purchased this kettle a little over a year ago. I had a previous version of this from this company. It was a great kettle worked fine. Had it for about four years and it was getting a little bit used and then I noticed they put out a new model, so I jumped on it. The minute I took it out of the box and held it in my hand. It felt uncomfortable. The changes they made. I don’t think we’re very good. Most of this is subjective but let me continue. The handle design is uncomfortable compared to the previous model. The design of the cover which goes up halfway and then can open actually more is the biggest pain.  Opening the thing up, halfway makes it a disaster trying to put water in. It is extremely difficult to then open the cover up all the way. I don’t know what this function does but it’s completely useless. The major issue I now have is that after timing the heating yesterday it now takes six minutes and 33 seconds to bring tap water to a boil. Sometimes change, or “updating features” are just not the way to go. I’m gonna look for something new. And I’ve learned that if I don’t like the handle the minute, I pull it out of the box. I’ll send it back."
Arrived in manufacturers packaging and the kettle had a large dent in the side of the stainless steel. 😞
Failed the stainless steel magnet test so I returned it.
"This little kettle boiled water like a champ, until it didn't. It's surprising how such a simple device can fail after only 3yrs of use. Now, being without a kettle, I hesitate to buy the same one, as it turns on, but doesn't stay on - it automatically turns off after a few seconds. Three stars because it's very economical, is stainless steel, and did the job. It would be great if it could be repaired easily and I didn't have to buy a new one as that's incredibly wasteful."
"Generally speaking, it functions.  Higher than average capacity, cool touch, stainless double-layer interior.. basic electric kettle features.  Major fault is the cover barely opens.. like 30 degrees, so you have to shoot the water in at an angle to fill it, and try not to spill - to the point it's just stupid.  It doesn't shut-off until well after it's rockin' and rollin', mad boiling for a good while... you're staring at it like... ""are you ever gunna stop... or you gunna burn my house down?""  Also, the handle sticks out far and makes it feel a bit unwieldy.  Trying to pour carefully for pour-over coffee (this is replacing a gooseneck that died prematurely and other kitchen functions,) I still had water leak out the side of the lid instead of the spout. Meh.  I generally don't return stuff, and it's cheap enough for the function.. so I didn't.  Consider your options."
"Edited Review (October 18, 2023):We received the new kettle directly from Kosovo and have been using it for a year.  It’s generally been a positive experience.  Our usage has been on average about once a day with the kettle filled with RO water upto the “max” mark.  Its held up quite well with no rust or pinholes observed.  As others have pointed out, it is quite noisy as it heats up but becomes very silent several seconds before autoshutoff when the water starts to boil.  While I am still not sure why we had such a bad first experience with the new kettle purchased from Amazon, I am leaning toward recommending this kettle and have updated to 3 stars.—————————————————————-I am very disappointed with the kettle quality.  The water contact layer inside is  most certainly not “food grade” stainless steel as the company advertises on Amazon.  We used the kettle to boil filtered water for less than 2 months and observed rusting and small pin holes on the bottom surface.  Quite sure we’ve been drinking water that has been contaminated.  I contacted the company and they were quick to blame Amazon for selling me a “used” kettle.  I asked them what that has got to do with the kettle rusting and they didn’t answer.  They are shipping me a new kettle which is fine, however, I am not convinced that’s going to change the situation.  I will update the review if I find the new kettle to be different.  Please use your good judgement before purchasing this kettle and potentially putting your family’s health in danger!"
"My morning ritual consists of waking up, taking the dog out and pouring my morning cup of tea. I have a tea kettle which sits on the stove that I don’t mind using to boil water, but sometimes I forget to take it off the stove while cooking and it quickly becomes covered in food splatter. (Gross, I know.) That’s when my lazy self turns to the microwave to heat my water. I needed a better way, and why not buy an electric kettle! I found this kettle had fantastic reviews and I loved the color options available. However, I’m sad to report this kettle may not be for me and I may end up returning it soon. Here’s why...Pros:- Price point is great! It’s a very nice kettle for the price.- Color selection.- Heats water rapidly!- Easy open top, cool sides while boiling. You won’t easily burn yourself with this kettle.- Super easy to use! Put water in, press down the button, done! It shuts off when it’s ready.Cons:- The size. It’s pretty bulky. I imagine most kettles will be bulky and seeing as this is my first one, I’m unsure what I was envisioning.- The lid- while the lid is super easy to open and close with the touch of a button, it makes it impossible to fill up the kettle using the refrigerator dispenser.- This is not a seamless kettle- I went back and read through the description and it does not mention it’s seamless. (I looked at so many I think they started to blend together.) However, I personally prefer a seamless design. I dumped the water, even wiped out the inside, left the lid open, and a few hours later when I went to check to see if it was dry water seeped out of the seam on the inside. I worry about grime/mildew forming in that area.- I saw a lot of complaints about the inside discoloring. This did happen to mine after two uses despite boiling vinegar and water to clean it as mentioned in the instructions. I’m not going to knock off a point for this as I do think it’s normal seeing as I have very hard water, but it still doesn’t look great.- I also wish it had a warming feature but for the price point, I don’t expect it to.Overall, this is a great kettle. It heats water quickly, it looks pretty nice, but I just don’t think it’s the right one for me."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I have loved this kettle since buying it three months ago. It boils water very quickly and I used it often with no complaints until now.Today it suddenly stopped sealing when closed. The lid used to come down and stay solidly in place, but now it won’t close all the way.  Steam and water are flowing through the unsealed top and soaking the walls, cabinets and counter around the kettle.It’s not an expensive kettle but I did hope to get more than three months out of it."
"As simply, an electric hot water kettle, the cosori kettle is just fine.  But there are a couple of really big things about it that may impact the way you feel about it.  (1) The biggest problem we've had with this kettle is that while it started off FAIRLY silent when we first bought it, at about 4 months the kettle has gotten really REALLY loud, and I'm not just talking about a little loud, I'm talking about REALLY REALLY loud, it sounds like an airplane trying to take off.  (2) We've had many other hot water kettles in the past, not cosori, comparing the cosori to the other kettles of my past, the cosori scales very quickly and so descaling is something we need now do every two weeks or so, which I believe to be pretty often.  Keep in mind that our water has not changed and we live in the same home with the same pipes and the same water as when we had our other hot water kettles.  (3) The outside of the kettle which is quite beautiful is peeling, the kettle is never washed on the outside due to the underside having a little metal rod to heat up the kettle but the outside of the kettle never gets dirty either, at most we may wipe it down with cloth if need be, but we rarely do this.  The peeling has occurred after only 4 months of use, and I have contacted the company about this but am sure that they will do nothing about it as I've noticed from my other cosori appliances that had other major issue- generally cosori tends not to care too much about their customers.Having said all this, the hot water kettle does it's job and may be a good one to try if you don't mind all of the above, one of the things I do like about this kettle is that it doesn't drip from the spout.My overall opinion however, is to get your money's worth with a different brand,  because while the kettle may do it's job the amount of problems it exudes along with the poor customer service, in my opinion, is not worth the amount paid for.  Hope this is helpful."
"Arrived wrapped in plastic, no box, no manual. Interior bottom of kettle had a possibly burnt ring (see picture). Looks like I got a returned USED ITEM.Boiled a 1.5 liter of filtered water twice to see if stain could be removed. It didn't. PLASTIC SMELL came out of the pot after boiling both times. There is an inexplicable round hole on the interior of pot (see picture), into the plastic handle. I assume that plastic parts in handle heat up during boiling and outgas into the pot.It deserves three stars, one deduction for plastic smell, one deduction for burned bottoms. Additional star deduction is for sending me a used item without user manual.I like the handle and the overall feel and balance, it is lighter than a glass old Farberware kettle I am trying to replace.Overall, this could be a great kettle after a few redesign improvements. I would pay more for an ultimate healthy, reliable tea kettle made of quality materials. Still looking and boiling water for tea in a pot on a stove.I will be returning this item."
I purchased this kettle in March 2024 and it was working great up until November 2024. It developed a leak in the inner stainless steel area. Not sure how that happened. We handled it with care and did not drop it.Too bad. I will not purchase again.
"I purchased this because I wanted a full stainless kettle. I ended up getting the same one as a gift so I returned the one I bought. I wish I could return the one I received. The kettle seems to boil water for too long. It does this because the lid sometimes doesn't fully close, letting out steam. Because of this it'll be at boiling for a while before kicking off. It's very annoying. When I notice it, if I push down on the lid it'll turn off."
"I recently purchased the COSORI Electric Kettle, and here's my honest take:Pros:  Stainless Steel Interior: I appreciate the stainless steel interior as it ensures no plastic comes in contact with boiling water.  Heats Quickly: It does its job when it comes to boiling water quickly, which is the primary purpose.  Wide-Open Lid: The wide-open lid makes it easy to clean and fill.Cons:  Loud Boiling: This kettle can get quite noisy during the boiling process, which can be a bit bothersome.  Handle Gets Hot: Unfortunately, the handle tends to get quite hot during use, so you have to be careful.  Durability: I've had this kettle for a few months, and I've noticed some minor issues with the lid not closing properly at times.In summary, the COSORI Electric Kettle gets the job done in terms of heating water quickly and having a stainless steel interior. However, the noise and occasional issues with the lid and handle are minor drawbacks. It's decent but not exceptional."
"In October 2023, this product is titled as BPA-free, but the plastic lid and grip were actually not BPA-freeAfter they criticized, they erased the BPA-free description in the title. Watch out for the product who wants to buy this product."
"Will not buy again and do not recommend. Although it works well, there is an odor in the kettle that cannot be eliminated, tried white vinegar and lemon juice, neither were effective."
"I was drawn to this product for the smooth, single-element stainless steel interior, no seams, no plastic window or other elements that might leech into my water. However, upon boiling the first two full-kettles worth of water, I noticed that rust spots had already formed. Super unfortunate!!! I really wanted this product to work out as I have yet to find something that has this feature while having the capacity of this product and the flip top feature. Not sure if it's to do with my tap water (NYC) and something that i'll have to always deal with, or to do with the actual product. Either way, I'm going to return this and keep trying other products."
"The auto shut off does not work, which I suspect also impacts the protection from boil dry.  Disappointing as this kettle had such good ratings.  Have used it multiple times in the few days I've had it and it just boils continuously until I manually shut it off.  For that issue alone would not recommend."
I have had hot water pot for less than a week. It does not always shut off when water comes to a boil.  Will continue to use and see if this problem is ongoing.
"It is a plus that the interior is metal and water does not touch any plastic parts and the 1.5L capacity is nice. However there are flaws that make it difficult to use.1. The lid has holes were water accumulates when you pour. Since there is no way to clean inside the lid, mold and rust can occur.2. The lid has to manually be pushed back to open 80 degrees. The push button only opens it 45 degrees. It is difficult to manually push the lid back while carrying the kettle as the kettle is designed off balance.3. The kettle naturally tilts forward which is fine for pouring but makes it very difficult to carry it upright when your transferring it to the table or stove especially if you have arthritis. Forcing it in the upright position while most of the weight is near the front hurts my wrist. Just thinking about carrying it hurts my wrist. Our old Hamilton Beach one was smaller at the top and wider at the bottom and never had this problem.Overall the 3 negatives outweigh the 2 positives."
I like the stainless feature. Double wall safety won't burn your hands. Blue LED light. No seam inside kettle. BPA free. 1.5 L capacity. Price is right.it failed when the top lid (cover) slightly pops open causing a lot of steam to escape and takes boiling time much longer.  The lid should remain closed during boiling. Sorry but returning it back to seller.
"This thing did the trick, but after about 11 month it tripped the GFCI circuit breaker and stopped working."
"I use filtered water pitcher to fill this . It is hard to do because the lid does not open all the way. It is bulky, there was no smaller size option . The base of the it is not very sturdy. If you press the lever down hard enough , you can probably tip the whole thing off. I would return it if it was not a hassle."
"The product seems well made, and usage is safe, simple and convenient.  But I'm disappointed - bad stains appeared on the bottom of the unit AFTER THE VERY FIRST TIME IT WAS USED.  (See photo attached).  I only use purified water... and I also tried 'descaling' the unit using vinegar and water (as the manual directs).  Wiping the steel with a clean damp cloth was also futile.What gives??UPDATE Dec 10, 2018 - After posting my original review, I was immediately contacted by 'Shirley' with the Cosori Customer Support Team.  Shirley genuinely wanted me to be completely satisfied with the Kettle, and (without my having to ask!) made immediate arrangements for a replacement to be shipped out right away.This truly exceeded my expectations and is nothing less than first-class service.  I am genuinely impressed!More importantly, I performed a vinegar and water ""flush"" before using the new kettle.  This was effective in avoiding the unsightly water stains that I had complained about previously.  I highly recommend you do the same when your kettle first arrives (and before the initial boil)."
I love mostly everything about it except for it pitting at the bottom after only a couple of uses. I am hoping it doesn't turn to rust and it is not harmful to my health. Definitely disappointing.
The Cosori Kettle works as advertised and would have been a reasonable purchase but it arrived damaged. It was shipped in the manufacturer's own cheap cardboard box with shipping label attached rather than double boxed with a heavier cardboard. The manufacturer's box was torn and the thin metal the outer wall of the kettle was badly dented. Had it not been damaged we wouldn't have noticed the flimsiness of the double wall construction because the features work as advertised. However good it operates though is offset by the poor construction and should be taken into account if purchased.
"Bought this kettle bc I thought it would be nice to have an all-metal water heater kettle. It's true that it's all metal on the inside and water stays heated for a long time bc of this, but there are some product defects that keep it from being the great product it could've been. If these issues were addressed, the product would be much better.1. Water keeps leaking from the kettle in inconvenient places. It leaks from the base, it leaks from the handle, it leaks from the spout. Not the safest thing when water is hot from boiling. Continual water leakage is also bad for countertops and floors.2. The spout is shaped too broadly, which allows water to flow out too quickly. It's not a ""precise"" or ""pointy"" spout. It's a wide and flatter spout.3. The lid isn't able to securely stay shut. There are no snaps or teeth to hold the lid down and stay securely shut. The lid I got was slightly off-center as well.4. Wished that it could hold more. It only holds 1 L but there's quite a bit of space at the top and the heater is quite big in general.Overall, it's a pretty appliance that heats water fine but has some drawbacks. For upgrades, I'd recommend a pointier spout for more precise pours, something that holds the lid down to prevent spillage, and a design that allows to heat more water."
"I got this as a replacement after the Amazon basic product I got failed. They seem to run the same heating element. However, this one doesn’t get nearly as hot. It has a much larger capacity, however even running it with half the water it still doesn’t get nearly as hot, but it gets water warm enough to make tea so it’s fine"
"Man I thought I found the perfect product! Unfortunately after only two days of use, the bottom of the kettle started chipping. I don't leave water in it to prevent rusting or other defects so it couldn't have been that. Very sad to see."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Product was delivered on Dec 29 and within three weeks the button has started malfunctioning. It takes me several tries for the button to remain on. Once it starts, the water heats fine and pours easily."
"Unit feels very cheap, lid is a bit floppy, entire unit is very lightweight. It boils water quickly and hasn't corroded at all in the few months I've had it.I don't have a lot of confidence in it as it makes quite loud noises when turned on and actively boiling water. Like fairly regular loud clunks that seem to interrupt the boiling process. I'm wondering if there is arcing going on in the heating element."
"We wanted a one piece kettle that didn't have plastic or rubber parts coming in contact at all with the boiling water. This one fit that need. But it doesn't have temperature control so the water is often boiling extremely hot unless we turn it off earlier. There's only one switch to turn it on, no timer, no temperature control. Someone else complained about the browning bottom over time. Ours started to brown so we tried the suggestion of cleaning it using vinegar. That makes the whole kitchen smell of vinegar, but it did loosen some of the browning to clear it up a bit, but it won't go away completely. The top lid is plastic covering a stainless steel cap.It is large for 1.5 liters, and looks stylish in matte black. You can open the top easily for cleaning."
"I am will be so happy to give this item away, I’m sorry….. it does look nice and it’s a little bit small as than usual and I do like that, but it’s no opening, it’s no way you can see how much water you put it in and if it would be enough or not for your coffee or tea, of course it’s half measurements inside. No it just a very wrong design please if somebody would like to have that pot, I can give it away for free. I am very very disappointed."
"Bought this kettle because it was advertised as all stainless steel. However, you can't see how much water is in the kettle without opening it. Also the lid doesn't open all the way.The worst feature, however, was a strong plastic smell when the water is boiling.. There is no plastic touching the water, but the smell is annoying and a member of my family noted an aftertaste in water after we started using this kettle.. back to Amazon it went."
No plastic inside. Good kettle. But takes long time and too heavy to use. Didn't like the fact that you can't see the water content from outside
"This water kettle worked nicely for about 1.5 months, but something happened to the top and now when we set it to boil, we have to manually turn it off (the blue light is supposed to turn off when it's done) or it will keep boiling forever. The same thing actually happened the first time we ordered this kettle and we got a replacement, and now it has happened again. Unfortunately we are outside the 1 month warranty now."
"Works great, but lid doesnt open all the way, so it makes it a little harder to fill"
"Inner is all metal which is good. And the handle and buttons design is comfortable. But the outside plastic parts are too smelly. Every time I boiled water, the smelly flavor make me sick. Can’t stand this. And don’t believe this kind of smelly kettle can boiling healthy water. Another small shortcoming is the led light is too bright, made my eyes uncomfortable. Will return it."
"I used it to make drip coffee for some time so never actually tasted the water after it was boiled. Then one day just wanted hot water to drink.. EKKK aweful taste.... TOXIC. I cleaned with soap and water many times and boiled with vinegar to try and get the it ""CLEAN"" to no avail. Now past the return date ARGH!! TRASH>NO WONDER SO MANY OF US ARE GETTING CANCER. Beware of stuff from China!!"
"Love this kettle! Had a metal electric one before for years and I thought it was great until I found this one. Not only is this one bigger, but it doesn't burn my hand when I touch the side like the old uninsulated one did. Plus it's easy to clean, looks modern and matches my other white appliances. Only thing I'm not keen on is the pour spout isn't as wide as I'd like, therefore you have to pour slower to prevent spillage. To avoid that I open the top and dump upside down into a pot of pasta or veggies, if I'm cooking for instance. If I'm making a cupa then I just pour slow as usual. Plus the blue indicator light is fabulous. I would recommend this.Update: I purchased this in October of 2019. On Sunday, July 3rd the lid broke. I was hoping this kettle would last more than three years, but sadly it didn't. I am now looking for a kettle that has a removable lid to avoid broken lid issues in the future. My toaster oven also made by this same brand didn't last more than 3 years. Be aware that this brand is nice while it works but isn't built for longevity."
"This is a second review on this kettle. So it’s about a month that I have it. It started out ok but now when I pour the water out , water is also spilling out from under the lid. It’s not even filled up all the way. It splashed and burned my hand. I contacted Amazon, they are sending me a replacement today. I’m hoping that perhaps the last kettle just had a defect. I’ll keep you posted."
"I got this electric kettle for my family after our previous one is finally retired. This is a great design stainless steel electric kettle with double-wall that keep my water warm for a long time that I don't need to spend a lot of time to boil my water. It's boil pretty quick and it give you 6 cups hot water at once, I can make myself with green tea, white tea, or black sweet tea. And it's very easy to clean for the inner shell.Pros,- Boil in 3 to 6 minutes- Stainless steel inner shell keeps my water warm (double-wall) and outer shell won't burn my hands- 1.5 liters (6 cups) is a good size for me- BPA Free- Auto shut-off 30 seconds after my water comes to a rolling boil- Bule LED means the hot water boiler shuts off- Boil-dry protection that turns off the kettle automatically- Easy to cleanCons,- If they have different colors of electronic kettle I can choose that would be great"
From the outside when u touch it. It gets very hot. Super big too. When filled with water it's so heavy which I sprained my whole hand.
"I boiled the water and emptied it several times (the user manual says only three times) - still the water had metallic taste after boiling.I used tooth paste and brush to clean inside after that - still the taste remaining in the water.Then, I added some lemon juice in the water to boil, after that the taste subsided significantly.However, even after around 30 attempts at boiling - if I keep the boiled water in the kettle itself to cool, the water tastes metallic.I liked the style and quality of the kettle - not sure what else to do to get rid of the taste - is it some metal leaching in to the water? or is there still some chemicals from the manufacturing process? I am worried whether continued exposure will cause some decease?"
"Kettle was ok but sometimes did not shut off right away because lid was not sealed tight but my biggest complaint is the strong chemical smell. I smelled it right out of the box and even after boiling multiple full jugs, including with some vinegar, the smell was still present. Not sure where it was coming from but no way was I drinking that water. Returned."
"I had high hopes for this product, as it appeared sleek and clean. Once arrived, the interior of the pot off gasses, tainting the water in the pot. Really odd for a stainless interior. This continued for days. I even boiled two full pots of water to dump out to see if this would get rid of the smell. ALSO: the top does not open fully, making filling difficult. Lid will open more fully, but I think over time the lid would fail. ALSO: the spout does not deliver cleanly...water off to one side. Returning for full refund."
For $40 the cut off when at rolling boil should work.
"The kettle works fine. Pros: Heats water fast. Cool touch on the outside keeps my toddler safe. Con: no mesh filter, so small impurities from any hard water deposit will get into your cup.2 stars for amazons warehouse experience.  First time trying out Amazon warehouse for a used item. Thought i could save some money and give a 2nd life to a open box item. Bought ""Like New"", where the description says are 'no product damage...original box may be damaged"" etc. First one arrived with two large dents and a big scratch on the outside. Rust along the rim. Pot works ok but the rust area is expanding after even a few uses.  Thought it was just my bad luck. Ordered a 2nd ""like new"", it arrived with the inside layer of the lid fallen off into the pot (Pic 1). Couldn't put it back. Ugh. These descriptions are not accurate. I've had better open box experience elsewhere."
"Quick hot water when you need it, But the water cools down pretty quick (Room temp was about 65-70F)Not returning cos I don't have the patience and time to pick another one. But if you are still debating, then give this a skip and look for something that will hold heat for 2+ hours"
The side was dented when it arrived.  The box showed no impact.  When pushed on some of the dent popped back out as the casing is very pliable.  We need and want something a little more sturdy so we returned it.  It appears to be very good otherwise.
The kettle looks nice and has the benefit of hiding the cord.  Unfortunately the workmanship is very poor and the kettle began gushing water from the bottom the second time it was used.  My other kettles lasted for years not days.  Would not recommend.
"This is a great electric kettle, works as expected. But recently rust started showing on the bottom. It has only been cleaned by cooking a mix of water and vinegar twice since the purchase. Not sure why the rust suddenly appeared. Unfortunately it’s way past it’s warranty, but I thought it’s a good thing to know for future owners. Too bad because it’s a good item in its price class."
"Heads up for those looking for a plastic free brewing experience. This isn’t it.I’m extremely disappointed that this seemingly plastic free design is flawed. The hole above the two screws in the picture leads to the plastic handle.When brewing the water, the machine smells of heated plastic. Then, when the lid is opened, it is made clear by how the smell becomes much more intense, that the plastic is in that hole and the steam from the water goes in that hole and evaporates up to the lid and drips back in to the water. Blech.So many things could have been done to prevent this when this kettle was designed. I’m beyond disappointed. So…I will send this back and continue my search."
"It's been about 2 months, I still smell the plastic in the water after boiling."
"I ordered two of these for Christmas for different family members, in white and black. The black one arrived by UPS yesterday boxed in another box very well, but absolutely no packing inside the box to absorb being thrown around. The inside Cosori box that  held the pot was crushed in the corner that was holding the pot. I opened it up and the pot seemed okay so I re-boxed it to wrap for Christmas. The white one arrived today via US Mail in just the Cosori box and the lid was not tapped shut at all. I brought it into the house, completely took it out and put on the counter and was surprised at how cheap it felt. So, So disappointed. If I had seen it in the store I would not have purchased it. I have purchased a Cosori pressure cooker and four Cosori air fryers, one for myself and three for grown children for Christmas so I was really shocked at the lack of quality build  to this pot. I went with the Cosori electric tea kettle because of my previous purchases and was very happy.  Not sure if I will be returning them or not. My husband is very ill so it's hard for me to get away and shop, but will seriously think of returning them. Sorry I cannot speak on the use of the pot itself because they are gifts I don't want to use them."
"This is a nice kettle; fast, efficient, keeps water hot. What I found disturbing however is the fact that when you pour the water it spills out the sides, especially when it is very hot and ""sprutting"" it does not go directly into the container. Just be careful as to not burn yourself!"
"What I liked about this product is that it is mostly made of steel and not plastic. It has two drawbacks in my opinion, the lid doesn't open all the way to vertical making it a little difficult to fill it with water depending on what type of faucet you have, the other is the way it sits on the bottom electrical base element. When it is on the base it wobbles and doesn't sit firmly and i'm certain my counter is level. While the wobble doesn't cause any problems it's a little disconcerting. This unit is also quite a bit noisier than another one from a different brand we had."
"I started out LOVING, however after a year (I descaled EVERY month) it started making a loud banging noise - so loud, it also scared the dog!  I didn’t trust that it wasn’t going to blow up, so I threw away- I loved the size, quick boil and overall look for my new kitchen however, I’m not going to chance it happening again.  So if will look for another."
"Good: all metal, no plastic inside, double wall keeps the outside cool and holds in heat, lid has the option to open to 45 degrees so it's easier to clean and fillBad: the lid does not have a tight seal. when you pour water out it can leak out the top. this is easy to do because the spout is so far up and it is a large container so if you aren't very careful, when you tip the kettle over to pour water into a mug some of it goes around the spout and pills out the top"
"The spout is really small, so you have to pour really slowly or hot water will come out from the lid, which is made of plastic. So you're getting a dash of microplastics every time you pour.We fixed this by opening the lid before pouring, but this seems like a pretty obvious design flaw. Not sure why they made the spout so small.Also, the lid only opens halfway (45 degrees) vs fully (90 degrees). You have to manually pull back the lid to open it fully. Again, obvious design flaw...Great insulation, though, keeping the outer shell of the kettle from burning you."
"I really wanted to like this kettle because it is mostly stainless steel which is great. Unfortunately when the kettle is full it's very heavy, and the handle is slippery, making it difficult to hold and pour. Also, the on/off switch is plastic and feels like it could really break off. Returning, and will find a different one."
"A solid performer so this tea kettle gets 3 stars for “good”. The reasons it did not get more are for factors that could easily be improved:1. An errant dishtowel dropped against the switch will press it down and turn it on. This is the same problem several other kettles have. Not as bad in this unit as the switch is stiffer than some others, the handle partially shrouds the switch and a very bright blue light comes on making it more noticeable, but I still consider this a safety risk. I discovered this weakness with a different kettle years ago when it turned on un-expectantly, twice.2. There are not enough holes between the main water tank and the outlet spout, limiting how fast you can pour. When you attempt to pour more quickly the hot water backs up and starts drizzling out around the lid.3. The packaging uses two large Styrofoam blocks. Today’s consumer expects fully recyclable packaging."
"I have been using this for about two months. I don't use it everyday and sometimes I don't even use it for a week or two so it has taken me this long to recognise - every single time I boil water in this kettle, it comes out tasting horribly acidic. It is NOT the water I put in - I have used both spring water from a grocery story and thoroughly filtered water originally from my drinkable tap water. In all cases, the water tastes so horribly acidic and astringent and actually leaves my through feeling SORE and burnt. I finally have to stop because I am afraid of what is coming off the kettle into my water. I can't find anything clear about what is happening from a Google search which is why I am writing this review - so there is SOME information somewhere. I have already tried cleaning the kettle in various ways and tried different kinds of water. It's the kettle itself - not the water or any ""dirty"" residue"" inside the kettle. I'm really disappointed in this kettle. I strongly recommend AGAINST buying it. I will be doing very thorough research before buying any other kettles."
"I was excited about this stainless steel kettle. However, after boiling and throwing away the first 3 rounds of water (as mentioned in the user guide), a metallic taste still remains. Pretty disappointed since I don't know what is leaching into the water and this could have severe long term health consequences. I have another similar kettle (Secura Brand) for my other home which does not have this problem. It was out of stock when I was looking to purchase another kettle and that's what I bought this one instead. This company needs to seriously figure out what is going on with the chemical leakage since I'm not the only one who is having this problem according to other reviews. I would have liked to keep this kettle since everything else is great about it. It's one of the few kettles that has little to no plastic on the lid. However, I will be returning this product for the reasons mentioned."
"The auto-off function relies on the hot steam that gets ""pushed"" from top to bottom. Notice there is a hole close to the lid. That is the steam inlet. But only after 8 months, the lid cannot be fully closed, which causes the steam to escape rather than going down to the auto-off switch (a bimetallic snap disc)."
Makes a lot of noise. Needs frequent cleaning.
"I’m consistently “light” handed with my appliances. I take good care of them, follow the directions etc. Started having problems opening the top after a couple of months and while trying carefully to figure out why, what in the push button top might be causing a problem, the whole lid broke off. I should have purchased the warranty but this might just be an example of one of those items you should spend more money on. I use mine everyday and maybe I should have considered that. So I will go up a 10-30 dollars and also invest in the warranty even though I so rarely have had to use them or have even when I could. Live and learn but as someone who likes to give a favorable review when appropriate, I’m sorry to say this product didn’t earn that distinction. Spend a few more bucks. Not for bells and whistles so to speak but for well manufactured. Going to buy American as well."
"Boiled one liter of water, 0.25 liters is on my kitchen shelf and rest is leaking from bottom drop by drop. Sad but planning on returning it. Had high hopes."
"The kettle operates as expected and seems to heat water in a reasonable amount of time.  However I find that when I go to pour the water that it leaks from the top if the angle is too steep.  If I am careful it is fine, but I haven't had this issue with any other kettle that I have owned over the years.  From looking at other reviews I see some of the same comments so this seems to be a design flaw."
I like the large size and all the stainless steel inner construction. Looks very nice from outside too. No option for temp control which I knew before I purchased and am ok with it. The only thing about this kettle is if you tilt it just a bit too much especially when it's pretty full the water will be all over the kitchen counter. Would not buy it again u less that flaw is redesigned.
"I bought it in Dec 2020 and used it daily. It works very well but recently it starts to fail auto shut-off after the water is boiled. I found this is dangerous, it kept boiling and the very hot water splashed everywhere on the countertop and on cabinet. Fortunately I heard the noise and quickly shut it off. The handle is already very hot and I can smell something like burnt rubber. If I left it and went outside, it could become a big problem."
"I could be a bit spoiled after living in Ireland for the last year, but this kettle takes double the time to heat the same amount of water as the kettle I'm using overseas. Could be the 230v vs 120v power differences. Other than the slowness, it works fine and is relatively easy to clean. The area around the strainer/spout is hard to get a brush into, which is why I gave it 3 stars on ease of cleaning. The pop release for the lid doesn't always work unless you hit it just right either. A simple flip lid is sufficient. The water goes to a boil before shutoff, so I'm not quite sure why Amazon selected 2 temperature related topics as features to rate vs the speed or something else more relevant."
The 1.7 is a large kettle..it is not small wad looking for a smaller one
"I bought this kettle back in January, having been sold on its stainless steel promise (assuming that such a material would translate to durability). It is now October 30, and the kettle is already leaking water when I boil it, suggesting a weakness in some kind of seem within the product -- hot water is dripping out of a hole at the bottom of the kettle on the side opposite to the handle.Prior to this leakage, I have noticed once or twice the auto shutoff function not working, resulting in constantly boiling water until I noticed it and turn it off myself. This wasn't a consistent behaviour though, so I'm not sure what the fluke there was.Less than a year means very poor construction, and I of course didn't keep the package material, so won't be able to attempt to resolve the two-year warranty either. This of course is not a fault of the manufacturer, but the fact that the kettle didn't even live up to half of the warranted durability is slightly disappointing.If you're looking for a kettle to last the test of time, I'd give this one a pass (something I will now be doing as I search for a replacement)."
"I bought this electric kettle maybe 1 1/2 years ago, it's already started to fail.  In the past day or two, it's stopped working/heating up water unless I flip the switch on & off several times, and this morning, it failed to work until I held the switch down for a minute or more.  My guess is, soon it won't switch on & STAY on until the water boils.  The first electric kettle I had, made by Krup, lasted for something like 9 years.  The next one I bought lasted for at least 5.  Looks like corporate profits require juicing by manufacturing small appliances with shorter & shorter functional lives.  Good way to make sure there's more unusable junk in landfills, or dumped into the ocean."
"This kettle has a major design defect.  There is a seam between the the upper part of the handle and the hinge of the lid.  A small amount of steam escapes through this crack when the kettle is boiling.  If you pick up the kettle with your fingers or thumb too high on the handle, they can get scalded.  There is a further risk that the shock of the scald could cause the holder to drop the kettle, causing boiing water to splash further.A handle is by definition an invitation to hold something -- there should not be danger zones on any handle.Also, as several other reviewers have noted, there is a persistent, unpleasant smell from the cheap plastic  lid whenever the kettle is hot.I discarded the kettle after two days."
"I like the kettle, but I have to stay close to it while heating water. It never shuts off. It starts boiling out of the spout and sides of the lid. It works great if I want rapidly boiling water that spews onto the counter top."
"I just got this to replace mum’s old one, did a test and then think I will return this! I really wish this work because I do like it!1) The cover only open like 45°2) The bottom part is so flimsy3) When water was boiling, the whole kettle sort of jiggle and even spilled some water"
"I thought she would need a bigger electric water boiler.  But she’s using it as a pitcher. I had also purchased a smaller one for her condo, and she uses that one everyday. The larger one is too heavy (when filled) for her to lift.  She’s 87 and in good health."
"Bought this cause my old one(exact same company) stopped working. Old one didn’t have these spots, tried cleaning them but it did nothing. Stainless steel my ass"
"This is a great looking kettle, and warms water pretty quickly, however it has a design flaw. The spout access from the inside of the kettle is made of small holes. Water pours past these holes and will come out the spout and the top of the kettle at the same time, burning your hands. If you’re very careful, this can be avoided, however it’s a pretty significant design flaw, and I can’t imagine why it was added like this."
"Replaced the first one, it had a wobbly base, and the product seemed to these weird spots appear at the bottom. They appear as we fill water and disappear once dried, and cleaned/wiped.Ordered a replacement, the replacement's base isn't wobbly, but the product, I am not sure about it quite yet. Those spots/circles appear at the bottom (not sure why)."
Worked great for 6 months.  The other day the turn off feature stopped working and just goes and goes.  Convened it can cause a fire if the cat hits it on or I do.  I’ve reached out and am hoping for a resolution.  I just lover my coffee in. The morning and only have a pour over and this electric kettle.
"I purchased this kettle early this year and bought the protection plan. Now after several month. The kettle stopped working functionally, auto off button stopped working . I emailed the customer service 2weeks ago to get support, no reply at all. Also the protection plan says this production is still in warranty and asked me to contact Cosori. Very bad customer experience"
Good value for the money
"This is a great little water heater. It is noisy, but quick to heat. Within moments you get boiling water, and the easy removal and docking on the tray makes it very convenient.BUT....this is titles ""Stainless Steel water boiler"" which is only half accurate. I had, incorrectly, assumed that this meant a full metal construction. Only the inside is metal. The outside is a cheap plastic. This makes it lightweight, but...not metal, not the quality i expected.This is sadly a normal misleading statement for Chinese manufactured goods sold via the multiple markets available. It wasn't entirely unexpected, I had just hoped for better."
"We are trying to find an electric teapot like this that is not aluminum inside.  The product description says the this teapot has a double stainless-steel body.  However, when we used a magnet to test whether the inside was stainless steel, the magnet did not stick, indicating that the interior was not stainless steel.  We concluded that the inside must be aluminum.  We are returning this teapot.  This is the second teapot we are returning because the product description said the teapot had a stainless-steel interior, yet the magnet revealed that the inside was aluminum."
I had high hopes for this kettle based on all of the positive reviews. It worked great the first three weeks and then the auto shutoff valve stopped working and water just continued to boil. Otherwise I liked it.
It works used for its intended purpose boil water
Does not hold water temperature after pouring into cup or bowl. I think it is due to the plastic portion of urn vessel. By the time I fix a cup of tea or hot cereal and sit down the cup of tea or hot cereal is cold. Would not recommend.
"I was happy to finally find a kettle with no plastic, however after the first use there are rust looking stains on the bottom! I use filtered water and when I first got the kettle I washed it with a mild soap and water and then boiled water and vinegar, dumped that out and then boiled 2 more rounds of plain water.  I bought two, one as a gift for my mom.  Now I don't know if I should return the second one?! I am hesitant about using the one I have already washed, what are the stains from?!"
"I had the original black Cosori for over five years. It worked wonderfully. This new updated one only looks nice. The lid does not open all the up so it's difficult to pour water in. Not only that but the outside gets extremely hot which the original one never did. And I received an open box. There was two layers of tape. The bottom layer of the tape of cut so Amazon sent me a product that had been opened up. For over $40, this is not worth it."
I bought this in November 2019 and it has been great! It heats water fast and I use it multiple times a day. It is now April 2020 and every time I heat water there is a leak in the bottom and it soaks my countertop in my kitchen. Its is just not built to last unfortunately. Maybe you would get longer out of it if you didn’t use it as much as I do. I am now going to have to toss this and look for a new one.
It is ok. Just ok
"This expensive version of an electric kettle broke very quickly and doesn’t come with any warranty. The shut off switch, which is a safety feature, broke after only several months of use. I walked out of the kitchen and came back to find water spewing out of the top. The cheap one from a different brand I had before this one lasted a few years. Would not recommend!"
My fault for not realizing it is 1.5 liters but who needs a tea kettle this big??!!  It also doesn’t have a window to show you how much water is in there and is heavy.
Got this kettle and notice something after using it for a week that the steel plating inside got discolored specks on the bottom..I don’t know what it was but I felt the metal plating is reacting or just rusted away but other then that the kettle did well but I will be looking for another kettle maybe something with higher build quality
"I haveused this Kettle foronly one week- and the stainless steel is already corroding.There is already a spot in the kettle that is rusted. After having trouble getting a 1st quality product.  It’s very frustrating to get defective product shipped to you. Not sure if the kettle is safe with the corrosion this early on,  not sure if I can return the item.I tried to upload a photo but didn’t know how.Will be asking Amazon or Manufacturer for a replacement."
"Summary: good looking, good design in terms of shape and style, BUT BIG DESIGN FLAW: The mechanism to open the kettle is on the top of kettle (rather than on handle) which makes it awkward to use. FUNCTION: This kettle works fine and I like the volume and shape means less spillover than others i have used, not particularly fast at heating. Overall: If looks matter as much or more than function, this may be for you. If you want an efficient workhorse, pick another kettle"
"After using a friend's electric kettle, I was a convert: no more hanging around waiting to catch the steam kettle early in its shrieking notification of readiness. I could turn it on and go outside to do a short chore and it would be okay even if I forgot about it.I bought the Breville in part because I have their dual panini maker and am very pleased with it. And the Breville kettle functions fine, and has good safety features like a slow-opening lid to avoid sudden overpour of boiling water. I just wish a few little things were different. These are:See-through water gauge on side isn't easy to read at a glance. Of course the kettle isn't kept on the edge of the counter where it would get a lot of light, for safety reasons, but even so perhaps a little bigger window would let more light into the kettle which after all is dark inside. I was enchanted by the all-glass ones, by the way, and they'd make it easy to see the water level, but my house has high-mineral well-water and the lovely clear glass kettle would be streaked with ugly hard water traces in no time.Switch. This has a rocker switch and it takes a well-directed push to get it to turn on especially if the kettle isn't  turned right toward you. I learned this through thinking I had turned it on but it hadn’t. There is a light around the switch which comes on when it is on. My friend's kettle (brand illegible from long use or I would have bought that brand) had a flat switch sticking out at right angles, push down to turn on, that was easy to do and obvious that it had succeeded, and I'd much prefer it.Noisy. The sound of water being heated, amplified by the metal kettle, is really pretty loud. Louder than my steam kettle. This one seems louder than the one I used while house-sitting for my friend. The Breville is louder than my conventional kettle.  Looking on the bright side, the cessation of noise is your signal that the water has boiled and the kettle has turned itself off. There is a notification bell at that time, just a single tiny chime too soft to hear usually over the sound of the water. Personally I am glad about the faintness of the (rather pleasant) chime because I hate electronic beeps. My new washing machine does a lot of that. Perhaps there is a new career to be created by being the person who knows how to shut off annoying notifications from our increasingly demanding appliances. And prevent the Internet of Things appliances from reporting to their manufacturers on the details of our usage, data which no doubt they will sell to companies that can deluge us with more ads and spam.[added 2 months later] I noticed that if I tried to turn the kettle on again soon after it had boiled, the switch refused to stay on. Safety feature I guess. But I wondered what the temperature it was of the water, when the sensor refused to re-heat it. Using my instant-read food thermometer I found that the water can be as ""cool"" as 160 degrees and the kettle will not reheat it. That is 52 degrees below the boiling temperature of 212 (Fahrenheit). I think that's unacceptable. We want boiling water when we get a kettle; having had one cup of tea or powdered espresso or whatever, we come back for a second cup and blimey! we must make tea with water way below boiling. The workaround is to add some cold water, then it will allow the on switch to function, but you have to wait a bit longer. Sloppy engineering?"
"Fine kettle, but it failed after 3 years. The replacement failed after 3 years again."
"I purchased my Breville Model in 2022.  Everything worked fine till one morning, it stopped working.  This unit only heated up distilled water and was kept in a clean dry place in the kitchen.  It’s disappointing the short service life.  My previous unit which was a Braun lasted 12+ years.  I will not buy this unit again."
"I had a Breville Ikon kettle some years ago, so had reasonable expectations. Straight from the box this kettle was considerably more light weight and cheaper feeling. This model features a bell that chimes when the kettle shuts off. This bell jingled with every movement, from removal from packaging, to filling with water, to placing the kettle on the base...with one important exception. The auto shut off failed to work! So no chime! The water was in a rolling boil for over a minute when I had to intervene and turn the kettle off manually. Unsafe, imo.My original Breville failed for the same reason after a number of years use, but to have the same problem new from the box??? It seems nothing is built with integrity ot longevity in mind any more. With that thought and the fact that this model is very expensive, I cannot recommend.  I've already replaced it with a considerably cheaper Hamilton Beach which so far has worked perfectly. Fingers crossed!"
"Really sub-par for a Breville product. I have the $125 version and have to replace it often due to really hard well water. Thought I would save a few bucks and get this one instead for $80. It's a waste of money. Wider that the original multi-temp one, but heavier and awkward to pick up. Once it reaches boiling temp it shuts off, and in higher elevations that means not really hot at all."
"Let me start with this. I love Breville and think their products are better than most if not best in class. That being said I bought this kettle just a few years ago. It was a great purchase until the electrical switch failed and a nice kettle that cost 3x the competition was useless. I called (4x), submitted a complaint online and tried anything I could. Finally 3 weeks after first contact I got a human(they don’t answer the phone they generally call you back a couple hours later. Staff is ill equipped to do anything. When I explained the problem the rep generously opened a service case and will send me a return shipping label. With the caveat that a technician will call me in a couple weeks to offer a quote to repair it. Have no illusions, they’re getting it back and it will cost them as much just to send me a new one or more in the goodwill reviews like this will erode. I’ve already presented this case to a group on customer service but for a $2 problem it’s such bad optics for a well regarded brand."
"After having a Breville hot pot for over 15 years that was used daily, I needed to finally buy a new one.  I bought one in October of 2022.  By April of 2023, cracks were appearing in the lid. Still under warranty, I contacted Breville and received a replacement. Now, in September of 2023, cracks began appearing in the lid of the replacement. I again contacted Breville and they agreed to replace it.  However, they were supposed to send me a prepaid UPS label to send it back, but it never appeared in my email (inbox or spam or trash folders).  I contacted them by email and they did not respond.  I have contacted them again by email.  No response as of yet.  I tried calling their customer support line but that appears jammed up.  I've read reviews that the cracking lid is not unusual. It's a shame that Breville has not corrected this issue. If you are a daily user of this type of product, beware of buying it.  If you are an occasional user, still beware because this may happen to you after the warranty period and you'll just be out of luck. Update - Breville did get with will be ok. me and I sent back the defective one and have received my new one.  Hopefully this one"
Older version was much better. For example water level through glass window doesn't have light anymore (on previous version it was). Breville enginners probably saved couple penny this why I will save couple stars.
"It failed after three years. One day, it just stopped working.The base was okay. I fixed it by adjusting a thin rod at the very center of the bottom part of the kettle with pliers. You won't see this part of the kettle in product images. Appears to be a bad contact: this rod can move and at times break the contact. It started to work again, not sure for how long."
"We have had a few tea kettles similar to this through the years. This is the first time a kettle has rusted around the top rim, or anywhere the water touches. It also is making a clanking sound as the water is heating up, which is rather unnerving, given that it is an electric appliance. We usually have a kettle for three to five years before the electric elements begin to fail. 1 1/2 years is not acceptable for one of these kettles."
"Overall, and until today, the kettle was excellent and reliable.  We switched to the Breville after cycling through cheaper brands which only tended to last a year or so under the presumption that Breville is a quality brand and spending a few bucks more would pay off with a more durable product - the old less cost more premise.  (We used to have a Braun kettle that was great and lasted many years, but, alas, they don't make then anymore).Unfortunately, this was not the case.  We've been using the kettle for a little more than a year having purchased it in Sept. 0f 2021 and now at the beginning of Jan 2023, it has ceased to work (the switch fails to stay on - a short somewhere probably - or the switch itself died - who knows its not a serviceable part anyway).I guess, in the end, if you are a heavy user of this type of kettle and looking for reliability, I would advise looking elsewhere, or maybe like we probably will do revert and choose to go with the cheaper brand/model that you will go in fully anticipating replacement every year or so.:-(  Sadness."
"I am a Breville convert with multiple products but this item is a disappointment unfortunately.  Although works as required it has a quiet finish boil sound which is hard to hear within a normal household.  But worst still it is very difficult to see water level inside kettle, very poor lighting or non existant."
"Great design but poor quality construction....for a premium priced kettle. We're on our 4th, and all the previous ones have died between 2-3 years. The kettle is super fast heating up when new but after a year gets quite a bit slower. It seems that moisture in the base might be the reason for it dieing. We've tried to be super careful with not getting it wet.... Cheap 'good enough' Chinese quality. And of course, there's no repairing it, though the components are minimal. An expensive $125-$150 premium kettle from a brand like Breville should last 5 years. While Breville has replaced one and given us a 25% discount on the last one."
This is our third Berville Kettle.We liked the brand but I have to report it's as loud as our old one. We have gone to another brand.
"if you think that your ~$90 kettle will last long, you are wrong. warranty is 2 years, well, it lasted for 2 years and 4 months and then stopped working altogether. After calling customer service we were offered 25% off to buy a new one. How funny is that? Stay away from this product if you're looking for a durable product."
"ORDER PLACEDSeptember 25, 2021TOTAL$79.95good for only 3 years - should not have to replace a 80  $ item very 3 years"
I've been using this model for over 15 years and love the size and look of it.  I purchased this as a replacement because the bottom seal on the last one leaked.  I'd had the old one for years and thought maybe it was time for a new one.  Never did I imagine the new one would do the same thing within a month of use.  I waited 5 months before using the new one so now I'm out $80.  Very disappointed.
"Measured out 5 cups water to use in my french press in this kettle and a standard tea pot set on an electric element; turned both on at same time, teapot boiled faster. Had to wait for ping from kettle, beware, the sides are hot to touch!Probably should have sprung for the temperature setting version, perhaps it heats faster."
This is my second one bought at Amazon. First one was broken after 2years usage and this one is dead now after nearly 4years. The switch seems doesn’t work as I turn on. I even can’t open the bottom to figure out what happen because the screws are not the regular ones that I can open with any tool I have. So bad I have to throw it again.
"great kettle….bought to replace our older one of same model.  however, there doesn’t seem to have a backlight in the water level compartment outside the kettle, like my old one.  not sure whether this is a change of design or ours doesn’t work? anyway, that part i was disappointed about"
"I like this kettle, and have bought the same model several times. The problem is that it only lasts about two years with frequent use. Each time I have bought one, the same thing happens. The base connection wears out after the warranty period has elapsed. It’s either a weakness in the design or planned obsolescence. Seems a bit of shame and a waste, since this is an otherwise beautiful product."
Got this as a replacement from a russel Hobbs kettle that lasted a long time. Would have purchased another Hobbs but they’re no longer in business. I bought this kettle because I have other breville products and have had them a long time. I deducted 2 stars because if I’m not close by I can’t hear it turn off. There is a bell that rings sometimes but I can hardly hear it. Very poor feature for an otherwise well designed product.
"Have had it about two years and the switch fails about 50% of the time. It starts heating up and the switch just turns off without flipping into the off position. Sometimes I can make it work by holding it in the on position harder but sometimes it just doesn’t want to work, even with the extra touch."
"When I purchased this product, I had asked for Kettles Made in America.  It said so when I read about it.  BUT, this kettle is designed in Australia and made in China.  Your product info is misleading, actually, it's just plain untruthful."
"I love the product - it is the second we have bought from Breville.So why two stars?  Because registration on the website took me 45 minutes, with captcha verificationn having to be repeated at each step.  It was a waste of time I do not have.  And calling in?  The phone system said I might have to wait over an hour and suggested a callback.  Right, a callback in the middle of a zoom meeting.Dear Breville, I would say, your website is not helping you.  Heaven help anyone who has an urgent problem."
"Just after one year warranty expired the kettle is stuck on the stand , i cannot separate it from the stand. I have to pore water into the kettle using a cup, and to pore boiled water using it together with the stand. Bad product."
"The tea kettle has a sleek design and looks nice. Water boils very fast. The major drawback compared to other products in this category is that the metal outside gets *very* hot (much hotter than kettles I've had before), so you learn quickly to avoid touching it and only grab it straight by the handle."
Worked well but have to be careful of outside not burning your hand. It didn't last long as stopped working after a year and a half. I have to find something else to buy today as need one.
"Nothing special about this re-worked design.  You can't tell how much water is in the kettle unless you open the top and look in - the older model had an illuminated water level indicator.  Didn't know how good I had it.  This one heats the water very loudly - can't hear the radio over the noise.  I have tried different types of water - all filtered, and the same noise happens.  I am surprised that it is a Breville product.  They used to be sooooooo nice."
"I used to buy relatively cheap kettles, but after each olone of the failed relatively soon - around a year, I decided to spend more money on Breville. No difference whatsoever. I bought it January of 2020, by February 2021 it broke - the switch wouldn't turn kettle into on position. I called Breville and they sent me new kettle, something I was impressed with. The kettle worked well, but fast forward to today, February 20, 2022, kettle broke again, with the same reason - kettle wouldn't turn on. Planned failure? Bad quality assurance? I am not sure, but I expect more from $75 kettle."
It is the noisiest kettle I’ve ever owned
"Even new, this kettle would keep boiling water past what seemed like the obvious place to stop. Now, after a month exactly, it will not stop boiling at all until it is switched off manually. Fortunately, Amazon is replacing it. I'll update after a few months with the replacement. When it's working, we generally like the kettle, hence the second star."
"Manufactory box in a very bad shape, was open with some big holes. No brochure or any paper. Very bad way to send a brand new product"
This model is not as good as our original Breville. The older model had an outside viewing panel to see how full it was
I had my first one for 10 years and now the new one I ordered didn’t even make it one year. It has a serious leak at the seam on the bottom…
Did not meet my expectations
"Sadly my THIRD Breville BKE700BSS Soft Top Pure Countertop Electric Kettle has failed.I purchased this third one on November 25, 2022.Now this third kettle has the same disease as the first two. The POOR QUALITY heat-sensing auto cut-off switch is not working AGAIN.The kettle is great when it works, but I hate it when it fails."
My product broke at 18 months of usage on a 1 year warranty. Was happy with it during the 18months but I don’t think it’s fair to expect to replace a household appliance at 18 months. I will not be buying a Breville replacement but look for a product with a 3 year warranty instead
"On older models, the fill line is illuminated so you can easily see how much water you are putting in. This one does not illuminate and it’s hard to read. It seemed like a minor inconvenience at first but is a real irritation when in a rush to make tea/coffee."
My electric kettle failed after 3 years; this happened to my previous Breville kettle as well - in about the same time.  Breville quality is very poor for this premium priced product.
False description.  Opened the package and on the bottom of the kettle it said Made in China.  We bought it as the description said MADE IN CHILE.SHAME ON AMAZON AND ON BREVILLE.
"I had the same type of kettle from breville for a decade and had no issues until the connection between the kettle and the round unit connected to the outlet broke. So I decided to buy a new one of the same brand and this new one is horrible. A few months into using it, it started leaking at the bottom and it is completely crusted at the base. I wouldn’t recommend these."
"If you accidently touch the metal while hot, you can easily burn yourself.  We returned the metal one and bought the plastic one which does not get so hot on the outside, but boils water just as well .  Both are excellent products except for the danger of burning with the metal one."
"I purchased this kettle on Dec 2, 2021 and today is Feb 7, 2022. A few days ago, water started to have weird waste. I finally found the root cause was from the kettle. A screw of the lid rusted. Breville should not use low quality parts. Feel sad for this brand."
"These kettles do not last very long. On/off button stopped operating just after 8 months of use. Area around lead started rusting just after 3 months of use. I used to buy these in the past and they would last at least three years. Quality seemed to be going downhill for this brand. If you intend to use these every day, I recommend to stay away and look elsewhere."
Bought this 3 years ago and used it everyday. This is the 3rd and last I’ll buy from Breville. It will not switch on anymore. Breville service center won’t help and the small appliance repair shop states Breville does not make repair parts available. Sign “right to repair” initiatives in your state. Bad on you Breville.
"It works great, but it's already rusted after just a few weeks."
"I loved my previous Breville.  I purchased this on April 10.  I was on vacation from the middle of June to the middle of July.  The pot was empty and unplugged all of that time.  This morning, it stopped turning off.  I put water in, turn it on, and it starts to boil, and continues boiling without stopping.  I tried it a second time, same problem.  A new pot shouldn't stop turning off after what amounts to less than 3 months of use."
"Bought one in November, 2020. It stopped working January, 2022, just out of warranty. Bought a second January, 2022. It failed July 7, 2022. Still working on trying to get through to manufacturer about warranty coverage but not making headway and do not have time to wait for the estimated 30 minute wait time.Bought a replacement, different brand."
"Received one as a gift years ago and loved it. It started leaking, so we bought a replacement and within 4 months I have water all over the counter. So disappointed. We've purchased many Breville small appliances but some has happened to their quality."
This unit started smoking and broke down in less than a year.  Not recommended. The seller offered to send a new one for a full price instead of addressing the problem.
"I initially gave this kettle a 5 star review, but after using it for ONE WEEK there is discoloration on the bottom inside of the kettle than (appears) to be rust...?? I keep the kettle empty when not in use, so no standing water."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Fire hazard. Automatic shut off is not working
"These are great pots, but they just don’t last. One day you come downstairs in the morning and everything on the counter is soaked because the darn thing has failed AGAIN."
I have had the kettle 10 days and it is broken!  This is my third ( and LAST) Breville  kettle.  They have gotten progressively worse instead of better.  The on button just quit working.  It felt a bit odd from day one.
I had the one before for two years and the lid glass also cracked but this one already did after two months of daily use. it's perplexing. and can't return now?!
Lid broke within 8 months.  Kettle has since been discontinued so asked Breville to return credit to my Amazon account.  This has not happened. Am very unhappy with them.
"This is a good sized convenient kettle. However, it is quite loud when turned on and rusts within a few times of usage."
"We have had two of these and they both broke within 1.5 years, just out of the warranty."
I have purchase two within three months and I am having the same problem. It cuts off and stop working.
This is an absolute failure. This product was sold to me as new and it’s USED! It’s rusted and has dust and wear all over it. Pathetic Amazon!
The kettle is poor qualityIn less then three month it makes terrible noiseI feel it might explodeAmazon was not helping in resolving my issue
"Bought a used”good condition”, the electric base was dead and didn’t turn on at all"
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Second product that isn’t working made explosion in my kitchen bed project cant contact with the seller. Hope you could help me out
It failed to shut off after 13 months.
"Of course it works fine: it boils water. The cord is plenty long and the controls (to open the top and to turn it on and off) are easily reachable. But there's no way to prevent the single, loud ""ding"" it makes when the water boils, even if you lift the pot off the base before its come to full boil, the way I could on the Cuisinart tea kettle I had before, or by turning the power switch off. It may seem like a minor thing but if one wants to be quiet while others are still asleep, it's worth knowing. Also the water beads up on the clear top after use, which is unsightly, leading us to leave the top open after use. Not ideal."
"Received one of these as a gift. It's very fast to heat water. But there are two reasons to avoid:  1) the exterior gets SCALDING hot because it's not insulated. 2) the switch has no guard to protect it from someone, or a pet, brushing against it and turing it on accidentally. For the price, you'd think the thing would be insulated and the switch protected."
Recently purchased this brand new. Made sure to keep the inside of the kettle dry and free from water after each use. Guess what? It’s already corroding and getting rusty inside! So disappointed with this. Spent a lot of money only to get rusty gross tea!
"I've had 2 of these. The first one worked great for several years. I make tea about 6 -7times a day. I liked it so much I bought a second one to replace it. This one did not last as long. the on/off button broke. Its a really nice looking, expensive looking kettle and if you don't use it much probably will meet your needs. Maybe I  drink too much tea?"
"I loved this kettle for about a year - there were no problems. For the last few months however, I am getting a weird taste in my water (I compared it with boiling water on a stove - no taste). I also agree with a previous reviewer that the metal gets very hot and it is important to avoid touching it!"
I did not actually buy this at Amazon I found it for $40 at Home Goods and was so excited to find such a good deal. It works great and heats up the water quickly. The bell to tell you its done is like a bike bell and it only rings once then turns off so if you are not paying attention you may miss it.The 2nd or 3rd time i used it I noticed some water on the base towards the back of the kettle an thought how odd and kept trying to find a leak in the kettle without luck so I brushed it off as a one off until it happened again.  Its not enough water to create a spill but its an electric kettle you don't want any water leaking from the bottom of the kettle onto the base. So unfortunately I will be returning this to the store.
"For the price of this kettle it should be ""bullet proof"". It's not. We used it for 2 years and the switch will no longer stay in so it rocks back to the off position. That tells you that Breville didn't bother to test these switches the thousands of times they should for a product that shouldn't be considered disposable. We've had $30 kettles that lasted so long we just got tired of cleaning them. So, no bravo to Breville. I think the company makes mediocre products and overcharges for what they are. I would look elsewhere."
"I bought this kettle several years ago at William Sonoma and like it a lot. It has never seen heavy use because I don't drink tea regularly but rather go through phases of drinking tea.Recently, I started drinking more tea again. After brewing water one morning, I saw some white pieces of unidentifiable debris swimming on the top of the water. I cleaned the kettle with a moist towel and boiled three more batches of water (without drinking it). The unidentifiable white debris was gone.The next morning I wanted to brew some water and saw that there had been considerable rust built-up inside and outside of the kettle. That was the final straw, and we discarded the machine.I liked Breville products (especially their plug design) and didn't mind spending a little extra for a good quality product. But I don't think that their products are always better.This is the second Breville product (the other was their Multi-Cooker) that suddenly became unusable. We still love their juicer and waffle maker, and this is very disappointing. I can't recommend this product."
"Protective plastic parts break off. I used to love this product. I'm finding parts popping off. This has been happening over the course of a couple years so I forget and get really confused what these things are on my counter and floor. Eventually this entire plastic covering around the switch and water level will come off. When you spent $80 for something low tech like this, that just heats up water, I think it's pretty normal to be unhappy.I have 4 breville appliances. This is definitely the lowest price point and should be for its limited use but I don't think quality should be sacrificed. I'm not rough on any appliance, in fact, I nurture my coffee bar. This is faulty product defects from heat pressure. I wonder if and when it will become unsafe. When it is I'm not getting another breville kettle."
"Love the functionality and practicality of this Breville pot. But in 5 years of light use, the plastic bezel surrounding the measurement window has cracked and is now falling apart. Appears the plastic can’t handle the heat, which is a design flaw for an electric kettle. Breville is a favorite brand, and generally earns its premium price points, but not this time."
"This kettle has a large capacity and boils quickly. However the inside lining started flaking off after only 1 year of use. Also, it does not have a temperature adjustment, it is a boil only kettle. I am replacing it with a different brand."
"Liked the size and speed of heating water. However, the off/on switch is prone to easy breakage as it sits in a plastic housing that cracks if bumped with anything else. I ordered a second one and the same thing happened. Went with another brand with off/on on top."
"I've had two of these, because I truly love the aesthetic of this kettle. However, both broke in their 3rd year of ownership specifically because the button that turns on the kettle stopped being able to ""stick"" on. If you held it down manually, it would boil. Replacement of the button itself is pretty much not possible. With a 1 year warranty, they've effectively made a product that will fail outside of the warranty period but sooner than anyone would expect a kettle to stop working. My mom has had her electric kettle for 10+ years and it's still operating smoothly. I will not be trying a 3rd time."
"We initially loved this kettle, and use it daily. We are therefore dismayed to see that the bottom is covered with rust in less than a year. This product is too expensive to replace every year, and we don't want to drink hot water from a rusty kettle."
The design of this kettle is flawed.  The on/off switch for the kettle got broken after simple use and the kettle would no longer turn on.  The first thing to go on the kettle is the plastic that connects to the steel.  It developed a a crack near the on/off switch and then the switch buckled and fell towards the inside of the kettle.
"Sorry to say, after just a few months this kettle started to make banging noises while in operation. We bought it May, 2019 and it is now September 12, 2019. Neither Breville or Amazon will take it back and we are concerned the banging noise could be warning of a fire hazard. Very disappointed in Breville and Amazon."
I bought this Breville kettle expecting more than roughly 2 years of use. I typically used it ~4 times a week. One day mid boil it just stopped. I got about 23 months of use out of it. Seems too expensive for this short time period.
"It worked fine for about a year or so until one day I heard a ""pop"" noise. Then it died."
Plastic start cracking around on off button
INTERIOR RUST & METAL FLAKING AFTER USAGE!
The on off switch and the area around the switch crumpled.
Like the design except it gets really hot to touch! Not safe with kids who climb
"The water heats up pretty quick, I used to have a no-name brand but it didn't last very long.  I decided to upgrade this time to Breville but immediately opening it out of the box, it has this irritating ""ting"" noise and I can't figure out just where it is coming from.  It is also more of a wide water container than what I was expecting and takes up quite a bit of counter space."
This was my second Kettle. First one lasted 10 years . This one lasted 2 years. Lid cracked in the plastic. Kettle sticks in the base. Turn switch on and off flickers the light near by. Then this morning something started burning in the kettle . Smells like wires burning. Now it doesn’t work. Never again will I buy a Breville kettle . So disappointed. 🤬
It boiled water. Until the on and off switch broke. Now it doesn't boil water.
This is my 3 rd time purchasing this item over 8 years. I have loved this kettle in the past. My last one there were cracks that started to form inside the plastic lid cover.  So I bought this one as I didn’t know if having those cracks were safe. Now with this new one  I just can’t get to the “ dollar store “ smell out of this item. I’ve done all the Google recommendations. I never had this issue before. The quality doesn’t seem to be the same. I tried to return it but the courrier keeps cancelling and doesn’t pick up.
"Update Dec 2024.This one just broke down. The switch no longer operates correctly so it won't boil water.I can't bring myself to get a THIRD one of these so will be looking at another brand.Very disappointing!=======This is the 2nd one of these kettles I've purchased in two years.I purchased this one as the first one had a lot of cracks growing in the plastic lid. This is a common problem I found, when I researched it on the internet.For the price I would have expected it to last over two years, and possibly a lot more.This time I purchased the extended warranty via Amazon, as it is an expensive kettle, and I don't want to be spending a hundred dollars per year on these.I purchased the same one again as it is so nice looking.If the manufacturer could sort out the cracking issue, it would get 5 stars from me."
"I found this item to be very heavy and awkward to handle. Tendency is to lift near the top of the curved handle, where there is not much space between the handle and the HOT stainless steel. So my thumb ends up touching the hot part. I wouldn't recommend, especially for older people or people that might not have strong hands. I otherwise own a few Breville products and like them, but this kettle is an impractical and unsafe design in my opinion."
"This product failed for me twice. The lid of the kettle does not pop open and becomes difficult to open after about two years of use. This happened to me twice with two kettles of this brand and model, so it’s definitely either a manufacturing defect or design issue.Product warranty is one year and an alternative discount option from Breville makes no sense since purchasing from them even with the discount is the same as full retail price elsewhere.Will not purchase again."
Nice basic kettle. Nothing fancy but works well except that the light indicator stopped working after a few months and therefore giving 3 stars instead.  Thankfully Amazon was fast at issuing refund.
"This is my second model.  Had the first one a long tme and was happy to replace it with apparently the same model.  The new one was great at first but after a couple of months it is incredibly noisy while heating water.  If my wife is sleeping in the morning, I have to take the kettle into the farthest room of the house or even the garage to prevent waking her up."
Ordered what was supposed to be a new kettle but when it arrived it had water marks on the outside like it was used
"I bought this kettle as we had previously owned a Breville kettle and it worked great for ~14 years. Needed to replace it this year when it finally died. Bought this model in February. By June, small hairline cracks had appeared all through the plastic middle ""window"" of the lid. Steam escapes through these cracks, and more cracks are appearing. Will be contacting Breville directly to see if they will resolve as a warranty issue.  Will post update, but for now I would NOT recommend this product. It appears that the quality of materials used had declined sharply since the company started."
"Bought this product April 13, 2023, and it died April 29, 2024. Just out of warranty, so out of luck. Expected much much more life. I had another Breville Kettle just like this more 15 years! Very disappointed."
This kettle is easy to use and boils water quickly but it marks with every touch externally so if you don't mind cleaning the outside all the time it's a great kettle.
"There is a button near the top of the handle to press to open the lid. I found that it needs to be pressed quite firmly and sharply. I have arthritis in my thumb joints, and the amount of pressure needed to open the lid successfully makes my joints hurt. My husband (bigger/stronger hands, no arthritis) had no trouble. Probably the kettle is otherwise fine - it looks nice. Just a heads up to any fellow arthritis sufferers!"
"This kettle is probably great for some people, but not me. If I turn it on and let it boil 1.3L of water and then shut off, the water temperature is 168F. What happens is the powerful heating coil heats the water close to the coil and that is what is making all those steam bubbles. When the power is shut off the water mixes hot & not-so-hot regions in the kettle to the average temp, 168F by my measurements (A Fluke handheld remote sensing thermometer). Setting the kettle to the 195F keep warm temperature eventually heats the water to 150F (not 195), but when you lift the kettle off the base you lose the keep warm feature completely, i.e., the kettle shuts off.What I really want is a kettle that, when turned on by a pushbutton, heats the water to 195F and holds that temperature for several hours, and whenever the kettle is lifted off the base the hold timer is reset. One push of one button is my limit for interacting with the kettle's controls. It would have been helpful if the description was more in depth."
"Pic shows how after 11 months of use boil push button fatigues and chips off.  So far unit still works but wonder if this will eventually fail the button.Unnerving part is when I go to supplier website and call their number, it rings once and hangs up.Update:  I was contacted via email and 2 replacement adhesive ""button squares"" were sent.  Was fairly easy to replace.  Hopefully the new part won't fatigue/crack as quickly as the original."
"I like having multiple temperature settings, and I like the ability to hold the temperature for several hours.  However, every time you lift the kettle off the base, it all resets.So if you fill the kettle with 1.5 liters of water and heat to 175 and tell it to hold that temp, as soon as you pick it up to pour a little bit out, it turns off and does not restore the hold setting when you put it back down.This wouldn't be such a big deal, except that setting a hold temp is takes a lot of button pushes and is very frustrating to have to do over and over.  Also, if you don't get the sequence just right, you have to start over again.  The feature is so hard to use, I just never use it.Also, I would prefer to be able to turn off the beeps.  They are loud and annoying.Otherwise, it's fine.  But if you can find a kettle without these ""features"" for a few dollars less, go for it.  The implementation on this one isn't worth the money."
"Arrival of the kettle was timely. Having used it a while, I’m disappointed for the following reasons:The pouring spout restricts the flow of water when the lid is closed to a minimal stream so unless open the lid it takes quite awhile to fill a cup. Also, ongoing boiling control can be difficult to understand  Finally to wipe out the gas’s pot has a narrow enters point which makes it difficult."
Began rusting inside within the first month
"The reason I bought this kettle was for the keep warm function. Unfortunately, the keep warm setting shuts off every time I lift the kettle from the base. It's not entirely useful. The kettle takes a ridiculous amount of time to heat up water. I'll use it until I can find a suitable replacement."
"We’ve purchased three of these- one for us after we broke the glass on our previous kettle and could get the exact replacement, then two for two different family members. I know one of those latter two is definitely still working, but tonight, ours just decided to no longer turn on. It’s less than a year old. Not sure I’m willing to gamble on another just like this one…"
"I loved this kettle , but I started noticing that the plug is getting hot. That could be a fire hazard ."
"The temperature setting buttons don't work unless you press them 2 or 3 times (I tried varying speeds and levels of pressure), but once it works, it works fine"
"You setup keep it warm temp, you pick it up to pour some water to my tea cup,, put it back to it's base. Guess what will happen, you have to redo keep it warm by holding the power button for 3 second.  So every time you pick up the pot to pour some water out, you will cancel  ""keep it warm"". All those 5-star reviews...making me wonder...."
"Three years into owning this kettle everything works fine except for the power and temperature select buttons.  They're membrane switches, and they wear out sooner than they should.  The product still works, but the broken membrane buttons render this product inoperable for all intents and purposes.I recommend finding one with a rocker switch instead."
"So everything works great, but the filter/grate on the spout just broke after two months of standard opening and closing. The little arm that hold it in place just snapped so it is not usable any more. Pretty frustrating."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The base was very cheaply made and warped causing to to rock back and forth on the counter and the kettle to wobble on the base. The kettle itself was good both in quality and features.
"The temperature control is nice, and I'm satisfied with the way it works, but there are two things I don't like.  One, the metal filter gets in the way when you try to fill the kettle with water, and I have to be very careful not to scratch my water spigot.  It's going to happen if I keep using it.  Second, although I'm attracted to the clear kettle in the photos, it doesn't look that way when it's in use, or if it has been in use.  Water condenses on the inside, as in the photo included.. not a visual improvement to my kitchen as I had hoped."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The kettle doesn’t sit flush on the base so the connection isn’t right will probably have to return.
"This kettle worked well for 2 years. Then something went wrong and it stopped shutting off even when reaching the desired temperature. It beeps when reaching the temperature, but keeps boiling the water.I bought the same kind as a replacement, because overall I like the operation and design of this kettle."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            For starters it boils just fine. You can even select different target temps. However this kettle is poorly designed.First, the lid only opens about 45 degrees and the strainer sticks out. You either have to hold at an angle while you fill or you end up scratching your faucet.Second, the warm function takes too many steps to activate. Cycle the temp button up to 4 times and the hold the power button for 3 seconds. Maybe not terribly onerous, except...Third, the controls are in the handle so when you lift the kettle to pour, you cut the power and reset the warmer setting.We are returning this. We expected better usability in the additional features."
"At first the product was great. The water heated quickly. The kettle remained very hot since it is glass which is dangerous. Furthermore, it wasn’t always clear when the kettle was actually on, and after about 3 months of daily use the button cover rubbed off, and the kettle remained boiling without turning off, and despite setting it to a lower temperature setting."
"It worked great while it worked, but it broke in less than 2 months.I did have another unit that lasted over 1 year before breaking, so seems to be a bit of a gamble on quality.I reached out to the manufacturer to make a warranty claim, and it's been over a month with no response.I finally heard back after a month as apparently I was supposed to email their support inbox and not info inbox, and they made it right and refunded the order."
"I loved the varied temp settings for different kinds of tea, the auto shutoff. After 15 months, those features quit working. I can plug it in to boil water; I have to unplug it to get it to stop. For the price, I hoped it would last longer."
"I purchased this brand because the other brand that I had been using for several years, apparently was using a different manufacturer and now has poor quality. So I paid more for this particular tea kettle, and it is a satisfactory quality manufactured kettle. The programming on this kettle is all right. However, I was looking for an option in ordered for it to keep the water at a constant before, and after the kettle is removed from the base. It only keeps the constant temperature prior to removing it from the base begins. I also had to tweak the base of the tea kettles warming base because the power cord is twisted and was keeping the base from staying level."
"Worked great for 6 months!! Used it everyday, sometimes twice a day.  Then, the buttons cracked and came off. No problem. It still worked. Now there is a short in the electrical cord. So time to search for a new kettle."
"Broke in 2 ½ years. After a year the +/- temperature button busted, then about a month ago it quit auto shutting off and would boil even when it beeped and the red light went out, the water would continue to boil. We would remove the kettle from the plate, Let the water settle, and then place it back on the base only for it to return to a rolling boil even though the light was not on. I don't need to stress how dangerous this is. We would have to unplug and press the button multiple times to ""unstick"" it. So disappointed bc it really should have lasted longer!! I gave it two stars bc I do like the different color lights for the different temps and the fact that they have a 120° temp setting."
"Good-looking, but there's lots of plastic directly in contact with steam and water."
Pretty basic and gets the job done. The covering on the power button cracked after about a month. All the lights and beeping aren’t really necessary. You can find better.
Graduated setting stopped working after a few usesWe bought it for that very feature
"You need to experience the awkwardness of pulling out the hot water; once the item is in use, you cannot return it for a full refund."
Have previous older stainless steel. Insulated and keeps water hot. But container can set upon counter and no worries about burning. This glass although pretty to watch lights not practical
Ultimately dangerous. I purchased this kettle 3 years ago.It would have had a five star review but the automatic shutoff suddenly stopped working in a dangerous manner. The lights go off when the temperature is reached but it keeps heating. When the kettle is placed on the base it heats without being turned on and without any lights going on.
"Loved everything about it, however I tested the temperature because I had doubts that it was reaching 195 degrees--it wasn't. Sadly, it was returned."
Heats water pretty fast and the temperature variations are somewhat helpful and effective.The design of the pot though is clunky. The handle is thick and a lot to grab even with decent sized man hands. The pour isn’t great with little spout and a metal screen that soills water everywhere.I wouldn’t buy it again but we needed something in a pinch.
"At a month and a half after purchasing this item (and just a week or so past the 30-day returnable timeframe), this kettle began to elicit a shrill, high-pitched whine upon start of water heating. Not clear as to why, as it worked fine for the first month and a half. So far it has settled down a few minutes into the boiling process, but this doesn’t bode well for continued use."
The kettle functions fine however the filter is extremely sharp and thin and sliced my wrist.Luckily it sliced the outside not inside of my wrist.
"Product info says its plastic free, when its clearly not. There is plastic in the hinge, and also plastic that directly touches the water when you pour.Its particularly frustrating because the plastic that is holding the metal pour filter is not even needed. You dont even need a pour filter, so the entire inner lid could be all metal, no plastic.Yea i know i can pop the lid up just before i pour, but its just lazy design, and misleading advertising on top of that.Other than that the kettle seems to perform well, has several options, and heats up very fast."
"The kettle has two buttons, one to set temperature and the other to start it. We have been using the kettle for 5 months and the covers of both buttons are coming off, the cover for temperature button came completely off last week. Still works but not an easy to use.A function we do not like is 'auto' reheat to keep the temperature of water set. Our previous kettle defaulted to reheat automatically unless you hit the button to turn this function off - we like that much better. Instead of each time you take this kettle off you need to go through the same initial process to ensure the kettle will reheat.Would not purchase this kettle again."
"Rubber buttons came off in just 1-2 months.Heating is ok, but to keep it warming on all the time still requires you to keep pressing the buttons everytime you use it.  It should be on until I cancel it."
The lights correspond to the temp and it's a perfect gift for my tea-loving mother. The only issue I have is the kettle doesn't sit on the base properly!!! I'm worried that it might cease to function or that it tipping like that might cause a spark or instability as a whole.If it sat securely it would be a solid 5 stars; I don't know if it was just mine or if this normal for the brand. The base did feel a little lower quality than others I've bought before (for myself) but my mom likes the colors and the special temp selection so as long as it works I think we'll be okay!
"The reason for 3 stars has nothing to do with function. It works great. My problem is the way it has started rusting out on the interior bottom. Within 2 weeks of use the rust started. I tried to return this but, my window has closed. They only give you about a month."
I bought this product 3 years ago. The buttons broke after 2 years.  Now it won’t shut off unless you unplug it. Not impressed with the durability. I would not recommend.
"It’s a little wobbly on the base. The keep warm function does not work. After looking at reviews and following the instructions, the keep warm function on my kettle just doesn’t work…"
Probably works but....wobbles on base (doesn't sit solid).  First one did it and Amazon sent a replacement.  Second one did it.....sent them both back.
Kettle works good happy with it but within 4 months the plastic covering on off button has cracked
So disappointing. The push buttons broke off and then it started making clicking sounds. New kettle on the way.
"Really nice design- and it is so quiet, unlike some other electric kettles I have tried. But then it starts to rust...I am not sure why it is rusting- it is stainless steel after all. But it does. I sent a couple of messages to the seller- no response. I then called Amazon to see if they could help me to reach the seller as this was way outside of the one month return/refund window. They could not help with that for some reason but offered a refund- kudos to Amazon!"
I like that it’s fast. But it is to loud when heating up!!!  I would return it if I could…..  l have talked to others who said there’s isn’t loud
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I use the blue setting to heat water to make coffee in a French press. But after two years, once it gets to the desired temp, the light shuts off but the kettle keeps on heating until it gets to a rolling boil and never stops."
"I loved this kettle from the moment I got it, but the first time I used it I got white spots on the bottom. I cleaned it the way the manufacturer said in the instructions. Didn’t come out. Used it again, more spots. After the third time and getting yet more spots, I said enough. I loved everything about this kettle except the spots that appeared on the bottom of the kettle and wouldnt come off.  Sadly, I had to return it."
"I like the range of set temperatures but disappointed with the control limitations.  If it has heated water but cooled down, you have to lift it off the pedestal before you can get it to reheat the water.  If it has cooled down but the water is too close to temperature you have to add cold water to get it to heat back up.  I miss the temperature read  out of my old kettle.  However, the ability to hold a temperature is a nice feature my old kettle was missing. Also the no plastic touches the water is nice as well.  It is fine but I am considering  buying one with a temperature readout."
I wanted a water kettle that would keep the water warm for when I have company for tea.  The online description said it would keep the water warm.  You can push buttons to keep it warm but it will shut off as soon as you lift the kettle from the base.  You have to keep resetting the keep warm function.  Not ideal to have your guests have to reset your pot to keep warm if they get a refill on tea water.
"The kettle works and works well.  Indeed I would recommend.  I bought it because I've learned the optimal temperature to make green tea is 180 degrees (175 is close enough).  However, it would be nice if the kettle had a memory function so when I'm bleary-eyed in the morning I wouldn't have to 4 buttons to get my kettle working properly.  This is annoying enough that I would drop a 5 star rating down to a 3 star rating."
"The two temp. buttons broke within 6 months, they are buttons covered with a hard plastic. I contacted amazon and they sent me to the product site. Never got a response about the issue.  Too many out there to have to have this happen within six months."
"Was a great hot water pot: easy to use, keeps water at desired temperature until needed, easy to clean, relatively fast heating water.What I'm now upset about is the plastic coverings on the buttons have now cracked and chipped off."
"Bought this June 2021, so it lasted two years, but the controls were worn and broken for the last year. I used it with the variable temps, so the right button lasted fine. Got a used Krups to replace it, although it was nice to see the water level."
"Well mine made it 1 year exactly. It is difficult to drain dry between uses because to the fixed lid and shape. While propped up on my drain towel, it rolled and bumped a metal travel coffee mug. Cracked on the bump and shattered to bits when I picked it up. No more glass kettles for me"
"This kettle looks great in my kitchen and boiled water fast for 18 months. After that, it seems to have developed a short circuit. Now, if I plug it in, without any indication that it is on, it heats up VERY fast. This is worrisome and will require it be replaced long before I've owned it 2 years."
"Does a good, quick job of heating water. Yes, it will keep warm for two hours. But is annoying that if you take the kettle off the base, it cancels out the setting. So you then need to toggle through the buttons to keep it warm. I have another kettle that just stays warm for an hour no matter how many times you take it off the base. That’s much better. I would not purchase this if I had the choice again."
Pot is very heavy and pour spout leaks
"Worked great for about a year and now the buttons have collapsed in on themselves.  This is an item that should hold up for more than a year while sitting on a counter, so disappointed in the longevity and will be purchasing another brand since the warranty is only 12 months.  Not a terrible product but if you want more than a year out of it, maybe try another option."
Product worked as described except it broke after 1 year of regular use
Overall I like the kettle. It worked as expected.Unfortunately it's now tripping breakers no matter where I plug it into. Lasted me from 2021 to 2023 with fairly light use.
I bought 2 of these and both failed due to the plastic covering over the control buttons. This causes the kettle to not shut off when the desired temperature is reached resulting in a fire hazard. This product should be recalled.
"Why is it so hard to find a good kettle these past few years??? I really thought this was going to be the one, after “seeing” that the *majority* of the inner lid was metal. FALSE. The inner lid is silver plastic intentionally designed to give the impression that is metal. Extremely deceptive. Literally only found out as I was packing the kettle to be returned. As you can see in the photos, plastic from SOMEWHERE is visibly contaminating the water.Ironically, bought this kettle to replace a fully metal kettle that kept aggressively rusting. This is the worst kettle I’ve purchased to date and the worst side-effect of poor quality that has happened in such a short time after purchasing (9 days).Look at the photos and please, do not purchase. It is not worth the risk to your health. Do not buy. Returning."
The Glass pot wobbles on the base it is not secure. I found myself making sure it wasnt going to slide off and break. It wobbles going on and off the base. The pot doesnt sit on the base securely!! Try another brand
I bought this because it said it was all glass/ stainless steel on the interior. The lid has plastic on the inside. I don't want plastic heated internally to leach chemicals into my water. I returned it.
"I like that it heats fast and that it holds a lot of water. I drink a lot of tea at night, so it's awesome to have a big pot. What I don't like is that you have to reset the temp everytime you put it back on the base and it doesn't seem to get as holt as it claims. The big complaint I have is that I have to descale it daily with vinegar before use. I thought it was just the water, so I switched to filtered water and still have the same issue. It's so bad that it makes me wonder if I have a defective product and it's not sediment from water that is settling in the pot after every use."
"I was thrilled to find a kettle with a stainless steel spout - no pouring boiling water over plastic!  However, this kettles stay warm feature broke after two uses.  It's simple not responding like it did before and per the instructions.  Also, too much beeping overall.  It beeps every time I turn it on as well as when it's replaced in the base.  Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the stay hot feature needs a redesign overall.  Once you pick up the kettle to pour anything from it, it resets itself.  If you want the rest of the water to stay warm for a bit, you have to press buttons, reset it and listen to more beeping.  I'll be looking for another kettle."
"I purchased this product in December 2022.  I use it 3x-4x per week.  The plastic covering on the power and temperature buttons broke off leaving the micro switches underneath unprotected.  I contacted the seller and they offered a 20% refund.  They only offer a full refund for 6 months.  That means they don't expect the product to last longer for 6 months.  I know an electric kettle isn't a major appliance, but I don't think it's unreasonable to hope for more that 12 months of service before parts start falling off.  I was also a bit disappointed in the time it takes to heat water to the desired level.  Although I enjoy the appearance and the flexibility of different temperatures, I will not be buying this product again and I recommend you look elsewhere."
"Purchased 9 months ago. The plastic cover/label over the temperature switch wore through and the small plastic post on the circuit board below is now exposed. It still works, but it's now a little challenging to set the desired temperature. I would recommend choosing a different product with more durability."
"Quit working after only 3 uses, highly disappointed ."
I bought this as a gift for my sister and when I went to see her it liked like this. She said it turned black within a week of using.  She didn’t out anything but water in it.  We tried again remover and descaled but nothing will get it off. Looks horrible since it’s a glass  pot. Also needs one more setting of 205 degrees. 195 is just not hot enough for some tea brews
It was good but I had to throw it in the trash today because it died on me. Wish it had lasted longer
Kettle functions well but a safety issue is the push button covers are brittle. The power button cover is completely broken off after 4 months use. My concern the electrical button is no longer water tight and May pose a shock hazard.  I’m sure I’m not the only customer with this problem.
"After a week it started making a buzzing sound when it first turned on. A week later it didn't turn on at all - just a red light but not heat. Also, the lid doesn't open all the way, so it can be difficult to fill."
"While I do like this kettle, the ease of use, programming etc., I was disappointed to find out my kettle does not actually heat up to the indicated temperature, especially on the highest setting. In fact, the highest setting, 195, only heated up to about 177.I contacted the company and they said that “Temperature is influenced by environmental factors deviations within a certain range.” It is a little difficult for me to understand why, when in doors, the temperature would not be able to reach what is designated on the kettle."
"This kettle functions as it is supposed to - heating water quickly at different temp settings - however, the lid does not stay closed. This is more of an annoyance than anything. I can set a large cup on top and it keeps it closed while it is heating up, but I shouldn't have to resort to that! If the lid functioned as it was supposed to, I would give it 5 stars."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            We really loved our Brighton tea kettle until the buttons started to fail and today stopped working. We bought it 6 months in 2 days ago and now it won't work. All of the other features are awesome... Please fix the buttons. We would really appreciate a replacement.
"We've had it for 10 months and the base, where the glass meets the plastic, leaks water. The buttons also started peeling after about a month. & I wish there were lower temperature settings. Bummed that it didn't even last a year. I wouldn't buy it again"
"I bought this because it was less expensive than other electric kettles with similar features. I love the see through glass water reservoir. However the pour spout guard (attached to the lid) makes it awkward to fill. I haven’t had it long enough to clean but I’m sure this guard will also make it difficult to clean. Also, it heats more slowly than my previous electric kettle."
"I love the features of the different lights but agree with over reviewers that once you pull the kettle off it doesn’t remember the temperature it was at. My biggest problem is the kettle WOBBLES and does not fit securely on the base! I’m going to just buy a replacement for my old kettle, the Cuisnart one. Knowing this kettle doesn’t fit securely and is wobbly is highly concerning - just a warning for all who purchase (this is the kettle with the glass not the stainless steel one)."
"Will be spilling boiling water on yourself and your counter, no matter how full or empty the kettle is, no matter how slow or quickly you try to pour.It shuts off when it is placed back on the base instead of keeping warm.The different temperature settings don't all reach the desired temperatures unfortunately.Cord doesn't let base sit flat on counter, will have to adhere cord in place to keep base from popping up and moving around on counter when kettle is lifted off of it.Kettle seems to be made of durable material, lid and base look to be made of a cheaper plastic material.Stay warm function is glitchy and you have to restart it everytime you pour a cup.But the lights are pretty and do work.I purchased because it had such a high review rating, after using it for awhile I'm shocked it was 4.7 stars.Would return if boyfriend hadn't thrown out the box and packaging when it arrived."
"Bought this on September 22, 2021, and at first, I really liked the kettle.  Boiled the water for my tea quickly.  After a few months the temp control button broke off but it still worked so I kept using it.  A few weeks ago the other control button broke off.  And when I went to wash it out yesterday I noticed rust on the inside of one side of the attached lid. Now it will be going into the trash and I will be ordering a different one as this had too many issues in such a short time frame.  Don't waste your money on this one even though it says it's an Amazon Choice."
The push button settings are starting to peal off. Sometimes after refilling the kettle the lid has to be re-adjusted to close properly. We have a busy household and use it daily but I'm not confident the kettle will hold up after more than 12-18 months. The changing colors are fun and it is easy to use
"I bought this because I liked being able to see the water level, have different temperatures, and the ability to keep the water warm for 2 hours. Sadly, once you pour the water it seems the timer automatically turns off. I was hoping to not have to make more got water within the two-hour window. A smaller issue is the filter is in the way when pouring in freshwater."
"I have had this kettle since March and over time a powdery substance started developing on the bottom so I had to throw it out. Also, know that the top temperature is 195. Some teas recommend 212."
This heats water up fine sure. But it doesn’t actually boil said water. It’s kind of annoying.
I had been very satisfied with this product until the on/off button broke. When I contacted Brighton Support about it they simply told me to wait 25 days to get the part from China and to have it fixed by myself. What?
Not really good quality- buttons already broken.
"The kettle works fine and lights up quite nicely.  Unfortunately, I've been using it for one month and the kettle has already developed small rust spots on the bottom of the kettle."
"I've used this kettle for two weeks only and it has begun to rust and develop a white cast around the bottom. It is a nice kettle, and I love its compact size but it is not the best quality"
"Update: the most serious problem is durability. The damned thing fail after just over a year.Temperature selections are inaccurate. 195 is actually 190, which is perfect for instant coffee. More seriously, the low temperature of 120 actually heats the water to 130. Be warned. Furthermore, the connector is is unstable. Kettle rocks and connection is is position depedent."
I really love this kettle. We drink a lot of different teas and the temp settings are great. It's quick heating and sturdy BUT...After just 3 months there is pitting and RUST developing all along the bottom. I'm not sure it's safe to use now and I cannot find a way to contact the seller except to post this review.
"This is just ok. I didn't realize when I purchased it that I couldn't use the keep warm feature on a full boil or at least over 200 degrees which anyone knows you need to brew a proper English cuppa. It's great for keeping your brewed tea warm, I guess, which is not what I purchased it for but if it's for you, bring it to a boil, throw your tea in and then RESET it to a lower temperature on the keep warm setting.Edit: This unit stopped working well. The temperature was incorrect and it would not turn off unless I lifted it from the base so I returned it. To be fair, this was a reconditioned item."
"This kettle works well but I only gave it two stars because the functions I bought it for don't actually work. I was looking for a kettle that would keep water hot over an extended period. The description said this kettle has a two hour warming feature. When I read the instructions it said the kettle has a thirty minute warning feature. I went ahead and used the kettle with the warming feature on. When I picked the kettle up off the base it turned the warming feature off. The only way to turn it back on is to boil the water again. The warming feature, the one reason I bought it, is useless to me. Everything else on the kettle works great so if you don't need the warming feature this would work great."
"I ordered this one in late November 2019 and now it has short circuit or something bad that make my house breaker trip. I tried to use with circuit breaker extension cord and then ruin my cord.Sad thing that I didn't bought insurance to cover repair/replacement. Besides from its short life time, it was good kettle that served my daily need."
After receiving this yesterday there are spots on bottom of carafe after only 2 uses. I dried it after each use and unsure why or what these spots are. Will be returning.
The base is so wobbly that the slightest touch breaks the contact and turns the kettle off. This same problem prevents the use of the variable temp settings. Buy a different kettle
"I thought that the kettle would cycle through the LED colors as it warmed up. It doesn't. It just lights up whatever color you set it to boil to. This is frustrating, I bought this item because I am hearing impaired and wanted visual cues.The feet on the base also wobble terribly. It feels cheap. Plug isn't grounded. Wish I had just bought a Mr Coffee."
"It woking good, but some parts quality has to be improved.  The ""boil"" button cover broke after 8 months and sharp plastic edges pin in your finger when you power it on."
Broke after only a few months...Originally I loved it but what a waste of money!! Heats quickly plus has options for temperature settings. Love being able to pick it up off the base and fill it without unplugging
"I purchased this product, but unfortunately, it started rusting after 45 days of use. Since the Amazon return window had closed, Amazon  customer service advised me to contact through the official website. I reached out nearly two weeks ago but have received no response so far. I’m disappointed by the lack of communication and hope the seller contacts me soon to arrange a replacement or refund."
Beautiful and huge. Very aesthetically pleasing. I returned because it was too big and I think I prefer a kettle with temp control.Great for large families of kitchens! Heated up very fast.
"it's cute and lightweight but there is a hole on the inside where the handle connects and water can easily get in there. Seems like a major defect, since it can get moldy and there is no reason the hole shouldn't be covered."
"Kettle works great and is attractive. Two criticisms: the top lifts all the way off, which we’ve learned is much less convenient than a button. More importantly, the fill line is only on one side of the machine: the side you would see if you are right handed. In a house full of lefties, this makes use surprisingly annoying and would have been an easy thing for the design team to accommodate."
Couldn't use it when it came dented in and not usable. Replacement would take another half of a month so I just returned.
"I loved this when I first got it. Looks great on my counter, worked perfectly. About 3 months in it doesn't shut off. Just boils and boils and I have to shut it off. Too late to return now."
It has a plug that is incompatible with outer sockets!
This is poorly made. I bought this a month ago and the button to turn on the kettle is already broken and you cannot push it down. Cheap and waste of money and can no longer return. Boo to Amazon on this one.
The switch stopped working after warranty expired absolutely no buy
"Terrible item, button to turn on stopped working after a few uses"
I received the item without the tap
Don’t like the cream color
"If you need boiling water quickly, this will work for you. It's a no-frills boiling container that is sleek yet large capacity. All-steel interior, which is better than plastic. Boils quickly, 7 minutes with a full 1.7l of 68 degree water to start. Auto shutoff worked as stated. These kettles tend to only last a year or so in my experience."
This kettle worked fine initially. But then stopped automatically shutting off and boiled dry. I kept using it thinking it was a one time issue. It was not! Do not buy. It is dangerous!
I received this as a gift for Christmas 2023. A couple months ago it wouldn’t turn off unless I unplugged it. Now 9 months later it will no longer turn on. Now it shuts itself off right away. Seems like an electrical issue and a little scary!
"It's a nice kettle, with all the features they described, with hitting up to the exact temperature and holding it for 30 minutes all of that works great. The only thing I hate the lid on it. It's one of those that you got to push it / pull out but it sits tightly. So you needs to kind of force it every time you put it on or take it off. I think it would have been much better product if the lid was on a hinge, with little arm you press down with your thumb to get the lid open. With the way it is now, if you have guests and need to boil the second round while kettle is still hot, removing that tight lid while it's hot is really inconvenient and every now and then it burns my fingers."
"--edited---.  The steel is nice and thick with an attractive satin finish. No plastic inside. They actually thought of ergonomics with this one, it balances nicely in the hand, you don't feel like you're fighting against the weight of the water inside - this makes it a joy to pour. This is something I appreciate as an ex knife maker, I always tried to get the balance of the knife close to where the index finger grasps the knife.  The dial is a handy and distinguishing feature, it's so much better than the buttons. ---edited---================Revision: I've bought this 3 times because I like the design, but... I dropped the score for undependable electronics. 2 of the kettles had problems keeping the temperature up to the set temperature, it stops heating at as much as 7 degrees lower! Not acceptable. Sometimes unplugging it and waiting 15 seconds corrected it, sometimes not. The fact that I'm replacing it again after 3 months has made the decision to never invest in this kettle again. I hope you have better luck. :)"
"I bought mine in May, and I really like most of the features. Except the part about drooling hot water everywhere. That i could totally do without..."
"This is a solid product but falls short of my expectations for things that I feel like a brand like Oxo usually does better on.I own dozens of Oxo products and only have two that have have disappointed me. This is one of them.My issues are small, and I may be nitpicking, but they cause me a headache and they’re easy to fix.1. The lid. When refilling, you either have to set it metal-side down, in which case countertop crumbs can get stuck on the lid and make it into your water —2. — or you put the rubber side down, which causes countertop dirt to stick to the lid and you have to clean it frequently.The bonavita kettle addresses this by having a metal knob above the rubber so you can turn the lid upside down and no dirt gets in the water or stuck to the lid, but it’s still insulated.3. The lid takes too much force to push on. Again, look at the bonavita kettle. It feels much nicer pushing the lid on — much less pressure and feels more secure. This lid feels like too much metal scraping on metal. It needs more divots to help glide the lid in.4.  The is not watertight. When pouring too fast, water can spurt out the edges creating two streams. If you use this to fill a pot for pasta, your second stream may douse the gas flame.I also wish it didn’t automatically keep warm after removing and replacing the kettle. It’s too easy to replace an empty kettle and it tries to heat it up empty. I’ve gotten good at remembering, but I feel like this is a design flaw.While this kettle boils fast, I feel like Bonavita did a better job, and has a larger option. If this breaks I’m going back to Bonavita."
I’ve had this kettle for about 4 years and have used it daily since receiving it. I really like the design and the fact that I can heat water to a very specific temperature. Unfortunately the handle has became loose and will break off soon.
"I've seen many other reviews mention this, and happened to me too, but the lid will fall apart on you. After a couple of times screwing it back together, I just leave it sitting on top, I don't snap it all the way in. That seems to work. Otherwise, I'm pretty happy with it. A lot of folks have complained about temps not being accurate. I haven't really seen that. There is some discrepancy around the boiling point temp, but that would happen with any kettle if you live at high elevations. The pressure difference will affect the boiling point temp. Also, people complain about rust. I think it's more of a patina-type stain. I've seen in every other electric kettle I've used. It doesn't affect anything. I don't think it is worth the retail price, but at the time of this review, they have dropped it down to 75.00. I've been needing a second kettle for work. I'll probably get another one, as it's one of those devil you know things. I don't trust the really cheap ones not to catch on fire. And I don't want to pay close to 200 for a nicer one."
"Like kettle very much while it was functioning properly.However, memory chip in base appears to be failing after 8 months. Unit ""forgets"" F/C setting and preset water temperature returns to 104-degree factory setting each day (or multi times per day). Concern it will stop heating altogether. I'm going to contact OXO for replacement under warranty."
"On one hand, this is kind of a ""no frills"" looking kettle, but it's actually excellent at what it does - heat water to a specific temp and hold it.This thing is LIGHTNING FAST! Water boils so quickly, having the smaller capacity is irrelevant really.The infinite dial temp is fantastic.It HOLDS at temp for I forget how long, but it's plenty long.The up-timer counter is nice and simple.EDIT - After 2 months it stopped working, had to knock off 2 stars (I am sure customer service will make good - but there seems to be some failure rate here creeping in based on other reviews. Really disappointing because it's fantastic otherwise)EDIT 2 - Customer service is not good. I contacted them by email and they had mentioned on their website due to Covid that there would be a delay. So after three days of not hearing from them I called. The tone was a bit defensive and the excuse was on Covid and that they had seen my email but didn't have all the information. My question was then, if you are looking at my email and don't have the needed info (which I had included but they couldn't open for whatever reason) - then why not simply ask me? You are there reading the email, why not take 20 seconds to say, ""Please resend the pdf"".I resend the info, and then it was ""Because of the weather - it will be 10 to 14 business days"". Now, 7 -10  business days. Today was the 10th business day so I call, again. They NEVER shipped the replacement. They are sending it expedited but honestly for a company that claims ""At OXO, we believe in better – better design, better functionality, better experience..."". This is far from ""Better"". It's like turning the clock back 20 years or more. If I had known this would be so much of a hassle I would have gone with another brand. I'm not sure how you go from blaming Covid then to blaming the weather then to actually fumbling a request for a rather pricey product that broke on me after 2 months. I have now been without the kettle for almost a month, lol.Great product - customer service needs another employee or two. That seems to be the real issue as I believe I spoke with the same rep each time."
"Kudos for speed - almost too fast!; only had it a month; hope to  get years of enjoyment, but have my doubts from other comments.  Stainless interior BUT the sensor in the floor of the pot is cemented by a  latex compound; don't rememberer that on a previous kettle that was glass and SS."
"The kettle seemed to work well for the first five uses but then it suddenly stopped heating up the water. It was not mishandled at all, just removed from the box, rinsed clean and plugged in. I contacted OXO directly and got a warranty replacement which was appreciated but the whole process took a month. I had to submit a video of the problem and a copy of the amazon receipt then after some time they sent a replacement and a shipping label to send them back the original. Not a huge deal but overall it was kind of a pain after spending 80 bucks.Also it's worth noting the kettle is on the small side. It's good for two normal size cups of tea per fill. It does heat up fast though and the precise temperature control is cool. The ergonomics of the design feel good as well, as is OXO's standard."
"I bought this when the base of my Bonavita kettle went on the fritz. I figured I would try this one out as it had some neat features. But after trying it out for a couple of weeks, I really do not like it. Quality seems fine, but it has some feature quirks that I do not like. First, the dial is always illuminated. Even when not in use the Oxo logo on the dial is lit up. Second it will always always hold temp for 20 minutes, even after you are done using it. Seems like a waste. Third, it has this 'feature' of keeping the temp up while in the middle of using it. I actually liked the sound of this. But it turns out the way they are achieving this is by having the gauge lie to you. Say you set it to 200 for a pourover. It reaches 200, then you pick it up, start your pourover, then put it back down, the temp will never stop showing 200, even if it sits there a while cycling on an off while 'holding it at 200'. After using the bonavita for years, I know the temp does not stay at it's set point so perfectly, it will quickly drop down to 195-194 after just a few seconds. So I tested the Oxo by pouring cold water slowly into it. The temp stayed showing 200 until after enough cold water had been poured in that the gauge finally changed all the way down to 176. The processing behind the gauge is doing this 'smoothing' thing to show 200 even when clearly not at 200. I am not super crazy about coffee making, but admittedly a little bit crazy about coffee making, and this kettle lying to me about how hot the water is is super annoying. Although I have not returned it, I have relegated it to workplace kettle and gone back to my Bonavita with a new base."
"I got 7 months of blissful daily use, multiple times a day. It boiled fast and looked nice on my counter. I loved that I could pick a temperature, walk away and come back to find water at just the right temperature for my tea. That all ended one morning when I went to make my second cup of tea. No longer did I hear the familiar rumble when I pressed the start button. It just sat there... displaying the temperature of the cold water. I called OXO customer support and they sent me an email asking for the receipt of purchase, which I immediately sent back. 6 days later after hearing nothing, I called and they asked for a video of the malfunctioning pot. I told the rep, ""it's a good thing I didn't throw it away"". To such she replied, ""it sure is, we need it back"". I'm waiting for a response on the video, she said she would handle it tomorrow because she was at the end of her shift. That sounds dismissive, but she was friendly, and I get it, it was 5 minutes before 5PM. The main thing I'm sad about is that this pot is out of stock on their website with no known replacement date, so I was given the choice of getting this pot's big unattractive brother, or a store credit. FYI the warranty is 2 years from the date of purchase, so that's not bad, but I'll have to update this when I get the replacement in. Maybe you'll be lucky and get one that lasts, or maybe you boil far less than I do. I was happy with this cute little pot, too bad it didn't last."
"Already broke 1 year later. Digital indicators blink all goofy and heating stopped. Yes, I tried unplugging it and all the usual. Real disappointed. I'm such a hige OXO fan. This kettle is now being repurposed as another plant watering can."
"If you set the temp to 200F for example.  You will see the correct water temp until it hits 200.  At that point it always shows 200 despite the actual water temp going above that by several degrees - maybe 4 or 6 more.  For me not suitable for pourover coffee as I seek an exact temp.  My other kettle, a Bonavita, does not have this problem.Seems like a good kettle otherwise so this is unfortunate.  I think it would be easy for them to change this."
"Works fine, but the flashing light is very annoying, especially before I’ve had my coffee in the morning. I much prefer the Fellow Stag. I plan to give the OXO away and get another Fellow Stag."
I have to return the kettle because the cord doesn't reach any of the electrical outlets above my kitchen counter. It's not even a foot long.
I guess 5 years is a good run for an electric kettle. I buy a lot of Oxo stuff and I'm generally happy with it. This kettle was very good for a couple of years. It can be hard to clean but it worked fine initially. After about 3 years the contacts for the base started to fail and then at the 5 year mark it just stopped working. I think I'll try another brand this time.
"This unit basically perfects anything you could want from an adjustable temperature kettle. First, it is quite attractive unlike nearly every other competing product. It has a minimalist interface that works beautifully. The gooseneck is tuned so you don't get water pouring too fast like most other units. And the best feature? If you return the kettle to the base within 60 seconds, it automatically holds the temp at the last temp selected, no button presses necessary. That may sound minor, but having to turn the unit back on every time you take the kettle off the base like you have to with other units is annoying. The only thing I am concerned about is that the handle is spot welded rather than fastened with bolts. The durability of the spot welds remains to be seen. I've owned the Brewista and Bonavita and neither lasted long. In fact, both were replaced under warranty and the replacement units failed as well. I am hoping this unit lasts many years, and that the two-year warranty hopefully will not have to be used.Update: I purchased one of these for myself and a second as a gift. Both of them failed. Thankfully before the two-year warranty expired. Oxo sent replacements quickly and made the transaction easy. But why these kettles with adjustable temperatures do not last long is beyond my understanding. I've now had three different brands of adjustable temp kettles and all have failed. The first two in under a year, the third and fourth in barely over a year, and this one (x2) in about 23 months. The kettles that just boil, i.e. not adjustable, seem to last forever."
"Overall superb form and function, but the handle joint is a clear defect considering similar reports and the price.  Mine lasted about 3 years before the welds started to fail, but permanently fixed now."
"Unfortunately, there does exist plastic on the underside of the lid. They are small pieces, but still an undesired quality."
"Update 2/24/2019:Ordered this in December 2017. As of today, the handle has completely broken off. Considering RMA if OXO cross-ships.I really like this kettle. it's not perfect, yet it gets the job done.1. The gooseneck spout doesn't extend quite far enough to reach the opposite side of the filter, so you'll tend to either bump into the filter or have to raise the kettle higher to the point where the water coming out isn't smooth and contiguous like it is up close.2. Wish there was a higher capacity option. A 1.5L option would be awesome.3. It's a bit pricey.Amendment to 2019 update: I ended up fixing the handle myself by drilling a hole into the kettle where the handle goes, and wedging a fastener with large enough washer to grab the handle, and a nut on the inside. That handle isn't going anywhere. Used food grade stainless steel parts of course :)Update 12/13/2022:More e-waste going to the landfill today, probably. the unit hasn't completely died, but I am now experiencing what many others have reported, where the kettle doesn't heat up, but it does detect that the kettle is in its place. The problem Initially started with the kettle not heating up, but I could wiggle the kettle around to get it going. It eventually got to the point where that didn't work anymore. I thought maybe the contacts were dirty, so I cleaned both ends out, but it didn't work.Apparently OXO doesn't want people to repair their own equipment, because the fasteners to take this thing apart are not your typical phillips screwhead, but some proprietary BS fastener that one might find on an apple product to keep people out. I'm hoping my ifixit kit has a driver bit for this, and the problem is just a simple worn out solder joint, or bad connection somewhere. If not, this thing is probably heading to my local landfill. This thing is well beyond warranty period.I would really like to just get another one of these, but I prefer things that last, and have at least some user serviceable components."
"I want to rate this kettle highly, but I unfortunately cannot. It functions perfectly- heats up quickly, pours smoothly, no leaks, and has good ergonomics in the handle. But, like many other reviews here state, the lid has rusted.This would be less of an issue if the rusting was under OXO's warranty, but as per their website, ""The OXO Better Guarantee does not apply to OXO Brew appliances(...)""There are cheaper kettles that do not have this issue. I cannot imagine a reason why their kettles would be made out of such a vulnerable material, unless they want their customers to either risk their health, or to buy another kettle after the one they had just bought rusts prematurely."
"I liked this kettle a lot while it was working, it heats up fast and has a great water capacity for pour over coffee. Minor gripes include:- It takes a lot of spins of the knob to make large changes in temperature- It doesn't show the current temperature, only the set temperature- It often overshoots the target temperatureThis was all worth it, then it started malfunctioning. The temperature sensor became erratic, causing it to boil aggressively through the top at times. The temperature shown when heating stared fluctuating all over the place, like down from 150 to 40 or 60 degrees, then up to 120 then back up to the 150 or whatever temperature it is actually at. This causes it to sometimes over heat the water (boiling instead of 185° for example). It started off doing this occasionally but is getting worse, and descaling the kettle with vinegar water didn't help.I contacted their support and they eventually agreed to send us another unit after showing them proof that I had cut the cord of the current unit. After cutting the cord, they never responded again and no unit has been sent out. This is the worst form of customer service."
This kettle worked great but is very fragile. A not to hard of a bump against the spot broke it and made it leak. Definitely will not buy again.
"This thing has one basic job. Best the water to the set temp. It worked fine at first. But after a couple weeks, I’ll set it to 110 and it heats up to 120 sometimes higher. I know this because if you shut the unit off then turn it back on, it will display the accurate water temp. I also know this because I’ve almost burned my mouth on water that’s too hot.I like the ergonomic rubber handle as well as the rubber lid handle that also helps protect you from getting burned when removing the lid while hot water is inside. The knob could be a little higher up, not that easy to grip for a man with big hands. It also is getting scratched up pretty bad from turning the knob. For being 1500 watts it doesn’t seem to heat any faster than the 1200 watt units on the market. I like that the pour spout is wider than most electric kettles allowing you to pour more water out. Overall, this thing doesn’t do it’s intended job so it’s getting sent back. Nice features, but poor execution of its main purpose."
"When I received this product less than six months ago I was happy with it. It worked great, looks nice and appears to be well built. I used this kettle once a day to heat 16 ounces of water. That, apparently is too much use for this item to handle. A month ago my kettle started malfunctioning. There appears to be a problem with the kettle connecting to the base unit. You will have to place the kettle on the base over and over for it to turn on, and then once it starts boiling your water you will have to remove and replace the kettle over and over in order to finalize the boil. It's unacceptable and not what you expect from a $100 product. I'm upset that I decided to buy this product instead of a more expensive item that would have lasted more than a few months. Fine, so I just need this defective item replaced, right? It should be easy enough to contact their customer service to get this sorted. I went to their website and notified them that I had a bad product and I needed help replacing it or getting a refund. I didn't get a reply for several weeks. When I finally got a reply I was asked to send information about my defective product to the customer service rep that contacted me. I sent them the information they asked for ELEVEN days ago. I have emailed twice during those eleven days asking what is happening and I haven't gotten a reply. Can you imagine doing this sort of thing in your job? Most of us answer and must send emails in our jobs, how long do you think you'd get away with taking a month to send one email and ignore several requests for information? Who knows if I'll ever get help with this defective product. Don't give this company your money, they will send you an inferior POS product and then ignore you when it doesn't work."
"great kettle up until it stopped working today after less than 3 years of use (2x a day). the digital base is turning on but it doesn't heat up and the temp just stays where it is.for the money, I'm with someone more reliable next time."
"Loved it so much that we quickly bought one for my sister. But both died after about 2 years (which is the warranty period, I suspect not coincidentally). On hers, the electronics stopped working just a few weeks short of the 2-year mark, so was replaceable.  But if it had died a few weeks later she would have been out of luck. On ours, the handle broke off a few months after warranty expired. On inspection, the place, where the handle is attached to the main vessel, is quite minimal, either a spot weld or spot glue, not sure. Am trying to glue it back on. When that eventually fails, I will be replacing it with the similar Cuisinart model."
"* The base is cheap plastic and does not stay put on its surface (counter top) and sometimes lifts up with the kettle.* Spout is too narrow to allow anything but extremely slow pours.* Base does not show water temperature after it's reached the set temperature, so you can't see how far down in temperature the water has gone.* There is no mode to just display temperature after pouring: it's either off or keep warm, nothing else.* The bell that chimes when it reaches set temperature is too soft.* Also, the kettle pours so slowly that if you pour any faster the water flows out the top.* Lid leaks when pouring* Lid is hard to remove* Temperature is random - sometimes it's accurate, sometimes way off* Randomly resets itself and you have to choose F or C again* Automatically sets Keep Warm after heating and doesn't disable after pouring, so if you empty the pot after pouring and forget to turn off keep warm, it keeps trying to warm the empty pot."
Update: switched to a different model after the temperature control button stopped working.  The kettle is a 5 star piece of equipment but the base- although intuitive- doesn’t hold up to daily use.  We had this unit for about 2 years before we discarded it.This is exactly what I wanted.  My wife and I have been itching to get a solid pour over setup at home and we wanted to get it right the first time around.  After months of watching videos and reading reviews I’m convinced this is the best pour over gooseneck on the market.  You can control the temp from 104* f to 212* f in single degree increments.  Water comes up to temp super fast and the kettle allows excellent control.  The temperature hold works great and I like the minimalist interface.  I like the dial over having to push up and down buttons to change the temp- it just seems quick and intuitive to me.  Oxo did a great job with this product.
"Second - replacement - unit now failed. A lifetime of 1 or 2 years is sub-standard and reflects low quality design and/or components.It took a few polite requests, but Oxo did eventually send a replacement for the unit that stopped heating after 1 year of daily use. No abuse, no scale, but the heating element (not the fancy controller) failed; resistance heating is really simple and a century old technology, so should last for decades not months. I raised my rating back up after Oxo replaced the unit, just hoping I happened to have a unit with faulty initial build. I remain satisfied otherwise with performance, features, handsome design.Fine temperature control (remembered from one use to the next); keep warm feature so pour-over is at same temp even with pauses; bright stainless interior with lid large enough for easy filling and cleaning; comfortable handle; functional spout for controlled pour-over."
"Just an FYI if you need accurate temperatures within 5 degrees, the temperature algorithm that determines when to turn off the heater to reach a certain x temperature seems to not be very robust.  I think the algorithm is only calibrated to heat a full kettle of water.  If you have a half-full kettle, the final temperature will run hot (over 5-10 deg).  For example, if I set the kettle for 205 and only have a third of the kettle full, it will run almost to boiling when heating up for the first time.  Also, the temperature that is displayed on the kettle is not accurate when heating up for the first time.  If you try another thermometer  when heating a third-full kettle, you will see that it runs way hotter than what is displayed.  I'm guessing high altitude areas would also have a similar issue even if completely full."
"I was excited to get it, used everyday carefully using only filter water to avoid build up. It worked well for 2.5months, and stopped working now. 30-day Return window has crossed, so I am going to reach the manufacturer. Will update review.UPDATE: Reached the manufacturer, they only take calls, no email or online chat correspondence; so call Mon-Fri only. Called them Monday, the customer service person immediately said it needs descaling and she will send a descaling product. I have only used it for 2 months using filtered water and it looks spanking clean and new, I have also cleaned with vinegar and wipe it down; so I asked her if there are instructions when she said it needs to be boiled in the kettle. But, the kettle is not heating, so then she said she needed addition info sent later in an email. Within 90min, I sent all the info - purchase details, proof of purchase/receipt, pictures of the kettle, serial number, video of the kettle not working. Have not heard from them; followed up and no response.After waiting a week, I reached out to Amazon customer service and they were kind enough to offer we a replacement or refund options, so I am returning the kettle to Amazon.At this point, I don’t know if another oxo kettle would help or maybe I’ll get a different one.What bothers me is that a $100 kettle stops working after 2 months and no response from OXO customer service after they make you jump through hoops of holding on the phone line, sending all info and no response."
"The base stopped working after a few months. After some painfully delayed back and forth with Oxo, they sent me a different kettle because a replacement was unavailable. The other kettle has the exact same base, we’ll see how long it lasts this time. Otherwise it works well, heats water and keeps it hot for a while even after you pour. One annoying thing is that you need to push the button twice to heat water. For some reason they think you might want to set your temperature differently every time you heat water so the first press enters the adjust temp mode."
"It's a nice piece, seems to work well. If you want to change the temperature say black tea at 212 to green at 175, it takes forever..hold the knob, thousand one...thousand two....they could have done better there. Also, I was obviously not the first person to take this one out of the box."
"This kettle has a wonderful pour-over tip and an elegant design.  It does a good job of heating water, although I wish it could get a little hotter.  My main issue is durability.  After 4 years of use (actually, daily use rate was more like 2 years since I travel a lot), the numbers on the base started only partially showing, making it frustrating to see the exact temperature.  Additionally the unit wouldn't turn off completely, with the ""on"" light still showing dimly even after turning off the unit.  The only way to completely turn it off was by unplugging it. OXO's response was to offer me a coupon for 25% off a new purchase."
While being an excellent functioning unit.  The quality of the stainless steel used for the spout is different from the the stainless steel used for the body.  Both are likely 18/0 which doesn't have the rust resistant element added.  The nickel is what deters rusting.  In this case the 0 in 18/0 means zero nickel.  18/0 is the cheapest of the stainless steels.  The spout is more magnetic.  Mine is rusting where the two meet on the inside.  The rust was evident after just 2 - 3 uses.  We don't let water sit in the kettle.  After we heat the water.  We pour out any unused water.  The function is great.  The rusting...not so great.
"Originally I thought this was the best water heater, bit I can't say that anymore.Does it heat up water? Yes. Here are my three concerns I've had:1: I thought the reviews about the lid leaking and thought it was silly until my lid started leaking every pour unless I underfilled and sealed the lid by tapping on it with my palm. Even then it consistently leaked and was worse when someone didn't know how to seal it better. Shouldnt require a manual to close a lid so it doesn't leak.2) it died within two years of buying it. Very disappointing.3) temperature is stops at is not the temperature of the water. If you pick up the kettle, set the temp to a higher temp than your kettle finished at, and you will see the temp read higher when you put it back on the base. This means it heats higher but the heater stops AT that temperature and turns off. The heat still builds. I would prefer a live temp readout while I pour my coffee so I know the real time temp and what it gets to whole pouring."
"Update: After 15 months of daily duty my indispensable kettle has ceased to work. It shows the temperature but doesn’t heat up anything. Docked it from 5 to 3 stars. It was great while it lasted. :(——From green tea to coffee this lets you preset the temperature and go about your business without having to run at the blow of a whistle, or having to guess if the temperature is correct for your brew. Then when you’re ready you water is ready too.Pricey, but saves a lot of time and headache after you wake up (and at other times too).It also prevents disaster by turning itself off automatically after a period of inattention. “Did I turn off the kettle...?” Yes you did, get to work now."
"This was a pretty solid kettle while it was working, but it completely stopped just outside of the warranty at 14 months.Other than this, the only other major issue I had with it was that heating water to the lowest temperature was wildly inaccurate based on how much water is in the kettle. When completely full, it would come fairly close to temperature, but if even half full, the water would be significantly hotter. Not great if you're trying to heat water for baby formula.I've since switched to a Zwiling kettle which has a 5 year warranty. It's taller and not a goose neck, but does what I need it to very well."
"We got this to be able to boil water ahead of time to sterilize and then warm water for baby’s bottles to 110* (lowest temp is 104*). It worked great for 3 months but I’m going to be scrambling today because the top broke and the screw that keeps the handle on the lid dropped into the water which isn’t safe at all! It looks like I’m out of time to return to Amazon but I’m going to see if OXO can provide support. If not, I’m going to have to order something else and quickly because baby needs bottles!"
Seller rated this as acceptable to use.  Obviously it can't even hold water.  Never had a detective product come from Amazon before.  Very disappointed.
We have purchased several of these. They were great.But they shorted out. The most recent one lasted only 9 months.Sure it's under warranty. But I don't want to deal with the hassle of replacing. Especially when it's already happened to a previous one.I can't recommend this at all. It's just not well made.
"Great kettle, did exactly what I wanted and did it well.After three years it just stopped working.  Base still lights up, but sitting the kettle on it, it will go into heat mode but not heat."
"I purchased this kettle last month and it is unusable. It leaks out at the seam at the bottom. I have owned oxo kettles in the past and not had this issue, so I think I just got a faulty one. I tried returning/exchanging it but it was not an option."
"I love the speed of getting water up to temperature. It takes literally just a few minutes. The temperature setting and holding it there for 30 minutes is great. A few problems is the it rusts really quickly so make sure when you're done you let it dry out. I would do this by shaking the water out right after using it and then rest of the hot water should evaporate quickly with he lid off. Be careful when shaking it out because the handle is very fragile and mine is about to fall off. The points where it is tacked to the body are very fragile. I use a towel to hold the hot kettle and shake it out; do not use the handle, it will break.Update: the next day it broke off while pouring hot water. I’m glad my child wasn’t nearby."
"If you are a very patient pourer, I'm sure this is a fine kettle.  The temperature control is easy to use and works well; it holds the temp for a reasonable amount of time then beeps to let you know that it's ""releasing"" the temp (letting it cool down).  I have one big pet peeve; if you pour it too quickly when it is full, water seeps out of the lid/rim and can splash on your hands or make a mess of the table.  I use this to make french presses sometimes, where a slow pour is not necessary.  I've used other kettles that didn't have this leak issue with faster pours.  A small amount of rust has developed around the rim and lid.Edit: Knocking off a star; even carefully trying to move a full pot over the sink dripped near-boiling water on my foot."
"We have used this kettle almost daily for 2.5 years.  While it worked, it was a great device.  Now, it has begun""restarting"" while in heating water.  It stops for a few seconds and has to start/warm back up.  Causing the process to take sometimes 2x as long.  I am sure it is only a matter of time before it quits all together.  Disposable electronics..."
"Followed instructions to the letter, but could not get it to work.  Returned."
"Worked fine (nothing special), for two years, then abruptly stopped heating. The temperature dial seems nice but in reality it doesn't heat to that exact temp anyway. The pour spout is nice as long as you don't tip it too far forward when it's full. But one day it just stopped heating up at all and now I guess it's an expensive watering can. Got a replacement that cost 1/3 of the price from the store that I like just as well. Save your money."
"The item heats quickly. However, it's from an unauthorized seller and it leaked from the start. I have reordered directly from OXO. Five stars for a working kettle!!"
"The temperature initially goes up to 212 degrees,  but then drops down to 206 or 207 degrees. This is just about a deal breaker for me because I like to brew my coffee very hot. I've gone back to heating up water on the stovetop. I'm disappointed."
"I was really impressed by the way this kettle worked.  The temperature was great, heated fast and was reliable.  However that only last less than two months.  I got rust in my kettle.  I noticed it when I was rinsing it out.  I could also smell the rust.  Not good and it is not cheap either.  I hope the manufacturer will get back with me, but I am really disappointed with the kettle.Update: I was told that it is probably mineral deposits that look like rust?  I am to de scale it and if that doesn’t work I can go through Oxo for a refund, but I must pay for shipping. Really? Mineral deposits?  Descaling  is the next step and then I might get more assistance.  Two months and the deposits that look and quite honestly smell like rust will go away? I will update you all again. HOWEVER. This is not the norm on a kettle, DONT BUY THIS KETTLE!!  Update:  It is not mineral deposits, it is RUST.  It smells like rust on metal as well.  Don't buy it!"
I have read about people who say that a product they purchased never worked but it has never happened to me until I received this electric kettle yesterday and excitedly opened the box and took it out  plugged in this electric kettle and  turned it on and followed the instructions and when the water did not get hot I tried it again and tried it again and then the GFI circuit fired and every time I pushed the red button to turn power back onto the electric outlet after 2 seconds it would pop out again and this only stopped when I unplugged the electric kettle so clearly there is a problem with this kettle and so I put it all back in the box and will be taking it to Whole Foods when this current pandemic surge has passed hopefully in January and I must say I was quite disappointed because this had good Wirecutter reviews and oxo is a good brand or so I thought.
"It was a 5 until it stopped working. We purchased this product 2.5 years ago knowing most OXO products lasted a really long time. This product was perfect and overall really high quality with precise temperature, but it just gave out out of nowhere. For $100 I would have thought it would last longer than 2.5years."
"I enjoyed using this pot but there are two defects. The main one is that it is made with 4 small spot welds that hold the handle on...mine gave up and the handle broke off. This is with normal use (1x/day) and with water to the water mark. The second defect is that the lid has 3 vent holes and one must be careful where it is placed to prevent steam from hitting your hand as you pour. On the good side, it heats the water fast and well."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Love the look, pours well.Not too expensive like fellow stagg.Boils really fast.Almost perfect for me.UNTIL handle start to rattling loose in few weeks of use.Look like spot weld is giving up (or wasn't done right from the beginning).I don't want whole thing detached and fall on me full of near boiling water.Amazon did offer me exchange (fortunate this is holiday season). But what if this could happen again after few months?I'm returning for refund this time.Too bad I really loved the kettle.But now, this is just dangerous."
loved everything about this but then 18 months after I bought it it wouldnt heat up at allI will update if I get good response from OXO. Supposed to be a 2 year warrantystay tuned
I purchased this Oxo after a lot of research. It doesn't work at all. The temp adjust dial does nothing.
"The digital display stopped working after 2.5 years of very occasional use. At first the broken display just made it impossible to know the temperature, and then shortly afterward, it just stopped turning on altogether. VERY disappointing for a product at this price point. When I emailed customer service about the issue to ask what solutions might exist, they informed me that my two-year warranty had expired and so they couldn't be of any help to me. In my opinion DEFINITELY not worth the money."
"It was the best kettle I ever used and I loved it. But it stopped working after one year and it's such a waste of money for just one year. It's the second OXO kettle I've bought, the first one (different model) died after a couple years too. I'm not sure if I want to buy another kettle from OXO if I need to replace them that often. It's pity because I like the kettle a lot and wanted continue using it, but if breaks that fast it's not worth it."
"The single knob that controls multiple aspects, on switch, temperature selection, timer for pouring is not intuitive and the instructions don't help.  The kettle looks good, has safety features, and suggests the ideal temperature for various beverages, but I am returning it because it is too difficult to operate."
"I give this kettle a two star review because it leaks from the top when you have to pour it from an extreme angle, as in the case of pouring it into a teapot and not a cup. There is something wrong with the way that the lid fits into the teapot; it is not snug because the fit between the lid and the body of the teapot is off. You may not notice this if you don’t use a teapot. We’d like to return it, but unfortunately, we missed Amazon’s return date by a few days."
The product is awesome save 1 flaw- the tack welds that hold the handle to the kettle broke. I drilled a hole and used some hardware to secure the handle.
"Big fan of the clean, minimal, one-button design and the precise temperature control... but the lid leaks like crazy! I know maybe I’m pouring too fast but come on—put a seal in there!"
"Worked for about a year. Then it stopped heating. The display would still indicate temperature.  OXO's regular 2-warranty does NOT apply to this product. Also, it's built with hard-to-access tamper-resistant screws, which makes DIY teardown hard.  Very unimpressed given the price point.  I'd go back to my Breville electric kettle that chugged along for a decade, but I already gave it away. For those who trusted the OXO brand like I did -- buyer beware."
Loved how it worked and looked but too expensive for how long it lasted (approximately 18 months). This is the second Oxo product I have purchased that based on cost did not last as long as expected.
I've never been able to eliminate a strong of flavor in all water heater. It is nearly identicsl to that of in country hot water faucets. Coffee somewhat cover the flavor but tea is always trained.
"I must have received a faulty unit. The usability is great: one dial/button to get all the things done. It's so easy that you can begin using it without much forethought. Typical OXO, the box contains instructions printed inside in addition to a manual. I can't say enough how easy it is to use.The problem with mine? My unit wouldn't boil past 120*F, I've waited upwards of 20 minutes and it stopped heating at 120*F. So I ended up returning it which is a bummer since I like OXO products a lot."
"I have been wanting to get this kettle for a long time for my morning pourovers. Finally bought one but the product is defective. the general design for pour over is good, well-balanced for pouring. Nonetheless, water leaked from the end of the spout from day 1 and rust seemed to show up in day 2. I really hope this product could work, but had to start the return process ..."
"Operation is great, fast and consistent...just slightly too small for my large French press, but quick enough to bring the last bit of water up to add at the end.Unfortunately the rust showed up today in the bottom of the kettle...only 3 months in."
"Be careful filling this kettle, it'll fly out of the spout! Found this out the hard way, ha ha ha! Al in all it's pretty good for the price. It's a bit flimsy (especially the lid). Heats up fast and seems to keep the temperature pretty well."
Great kettle at reasonable price... was 5 stars until handle broke off. Very small welds are not sufficient to provide acceptable durability.
OxO offered me one of these as a replacement for my OXO Barista Brain coffee maker which failed twice and OXO discontinued due to all the failures they had with that product.  I used my first pour over kettle for about 6 weeks before rust started on one edge inside the kettle.  OXO again replaced my kettle and the second one of those also started to rust  within 6 weeks.  I confirmed it is rust by rubbing a paper towel on the area and the towl had orange rust on it.  OXO has great customer service and does look after its customers but I don't have time to call them every six weeks and get a new kettle or coffee maker.
"The handle broke off while moving house.This wouldn't be such a surprise or a knock against it except the kettle is clearly meant to appear as if it has a ""full-tang"" metal handle coated with rubber. This is not the case. The metal enters the grip perhaps a couple of centimeters and loops back. The rest of the handle is thermoset plastic. Very brittle, impossible to repair, and renders the kettle basically unusable.Disappointing cost-cutting. If only I could weld..."
Quit working after 26 months. Good while it lasted. This kettle is easy to use and hits the target temperature quickly and maintains it until the auto-shutoff.
Worked great until the handle broke off and I’ve only had it about 7 months 😕
"I was excited to try this pour over kettle after reading the reviews. After doing the requisite cleaning, I plugged in the base and the blue light started flashing. However, as soon as I set the kettle on the base, the light started flickering and then tripped the circuit breaker. There was nothing else on the circuit at the time except a light. However, I tried another circuit and the same thing happened. Definitely returning and trying a different brand."
"While the internal part of the kettle are metal except for a silicon gasket over the thermometer the lid does have plastic which is exposed to heat and water.  Silicone doesn’t bother me much but this type of plastic is what I was trying to avoid when buying this kettle.  There is absolutely no reason for it, and severely disappointed as I was excited about this kettle."
"Heats fast, holds temperature okay (sometimes it’s a degree or 2 off), but it gets rusty! This is even after I empty and dry it out after every use. I’ve been scrubbing the rust off and cleaning it regularly, but it doesn’t seem worth it to keep around a water kettle that gets rusty"
"The kettle itself is good, but after only owning it for three months, the “OXO button” that changes the temp display between F°/C° and turns the heating element on, broke. OXO customer support seemed to indicate that this was because you need to regularly descale the kettle, but I have yet to get a satisfying answer as to why this would cause the button’s functionality to fail."
"We love everything about this Kettle but the sensors stopped working...won't beep when done boiling, won't shut off, even turned back on after we shut off....we now have to unplug. Happy to upgrade my rating and give this Kettle another chance if OXO can help resolve....but they only provide a phone number and I waited on hold too long and can't spare the time."
"Aren’t you sick and tired of the things you buy breaking after owning them and using them shy of one year? This “planned obsolescence” has got to stop. This worked just fine in every way until it just plain stopped working one day, at about the seventh month mark of owning it. Made in China? Yup. And it wasn’t inexpensive either."
"it doesnt work properly, i thouht i could find a way to work it out but no, it takes secobds to boil up, and it just pours out quite amount of water. İ would ask for refund actuaally, does anybody hear? Help?"
"To operate the kettle you twist the dial to select the temperature and then press the button in the center of the dial to initiate. The button the our kettle is broken and does not press. Figured I'd take the kettle apart to see if I could fix and discovered it was assembled with tamper proof screws.Am now debating whether it's best to buy tools to fix this or to throw yet another piece of electronic garbage into the landfill. Last purchase of an Oxo product, at any rate."
"After a week of use, this kettle rusted inside. After 3 weeks of use, it has begun leaking hot water from the spout when I pour. Considering how this kettle's MSRP is $100, you'd expect more from a premium product. I'm very unhappy with the quality of material and construction with this kettle and will be returning/asking for a refund.Aside from that, the pouring itself and the weighting is very nice, as well as temperature control. The handle is pleasant to hold, and it does not get hot at all. Timer is a great added function."
"I got this based on a Wirecutter review,and I wish I would have stuck to Bonavita. This regularly splatters hot water when trying to use it for pour over coffee. The weight is also poorly distributed to use it for pour over. Unfortunately, the return window has closed, but this is a purchase I regret."
"Lasted just a few says over one year.  Up until that point is was great, heating the water quickly and accurately.  I am disappointed it only lasted a year and I will not be purchasing another.  I gave it two stars for the service it provided for that vert short time."
"Loved this product at first, loved the weight and balance of it, how quickly it heated. However, about 2 months ago we started to have inconsistent with it heating up. We would turn it on and press the second time to begin the heating process and it just doesn’t heat up. So disappointed."
I loved this kettle. It was perfect for about 2 years then the start button to turn it on stopped working and there’s seemingly no way to fix it. The high price doesn’t indicate that it would have only a 2 year life. That was disappointing.
Worked great for a while.  Then it started boiling at What should have been a too low temperature.
"Temperature gauge still works — heating element doesn't, so it's worthless. How long is a kitchen appliance supposed to last these days? 2 1/2 years doesn't seem long enough given the premium price. I've used the same coffer maker for over a decade... Anyway, the thing is fine when it's working. Will probably replace it with a competitor's product."
"Only lasted a couple of months, wouldn’t turn on, also too small"
Loved it for the past 7 months and then one morning it just stopped working!  I should have heeded the other reviewers who had the exact same problem. I will not purchase again.  How difficult is it to make a product that lasts?
UPDATE: all below is still true except 2 days ago it stopped working completely... less than 2 years old & KAPUT ... can hear the thermostat kick in but then no boil... very bummed ... looking for a replacementLove this kettle in every regard except for the capacity.  My wife and I each have a large mug of coffee in the morning and the capacity is sometimes not enough.  The function is great though and we have raised our coffee game with the gooseneck pouring and perfect temp control.  Absolutely would've been 5 stars if it were just a tad larger.
"This is the worst tea kettle I ever have owned, horrible quality worked randomly. I threw it in the trash"
This seems like a great kettle but it broke in less than a year and OXO customer service is horrible (aka non-responsive). Very disappointing. I liked it when it worked! But for that price I would have expected to have it for years.
"I ordered the Oxo Electric Pour Over Kettle from Amazon and was excited to have it available for a brunch I'm hosting this weekend. It arrived today, but, right out of the box, it has an electrical issue: while the unit will heat up, the temperature control doesn't work, so there's no way to set or know the temperature. Disappointed. Sending it back.Update: I ordered a SECOND Oxo Electric Pour Over Kettle from Amazon that arrived two days after the first one, and it had the same issue. It appears this may be a manufacturing issue rather than a fluke."
"Used daily for 7 months while performing regular descaling maintenance. Had a Cuisinart that lasted 7+ years. After calling the OXO 800 number, I was shocked to have someone in the US answer almost immediately. They were responsive, polite, and helpful. In the end, however, the warranty offer was either:- An $80 credit to their website - $20 less than what I paid for it. This offer excluded certain items and is not applicable to any items over $80. (What?)- A different kettle model...without the gooseneck. (No thanks)"
"If you want the device to work, remove the black plastic decal from around the knob.  It is hard to see and feel.  I had to call Oxo customer service because I thought my new kettle was broken.  The very nice Oxo rep guessed immediately what was wrong - I was not the first person to miss seeing the decal.  The instruction pamphlet should mention the decal."
"Product itself was nice and delivered quickly.  Unfortunately I had to return due to the weight - while it wasn’t too bad when empty I knew once I added the water it would be too much to lift with one hand without getting burned by the heat of the exterior. I promptly returned it unused to the 3rd party seller who then deducted $10 for a return shipping fee(so they told me, they told Amazon it was a restocking fee) even though the product page specifically stated FREE returns for any reason.  3rd party seller refused to communicate with me after I pointed this information out to them. I have been in contact with Amazon who also tried contacting the seller (Kitchen Kapers) with no response. Very poor way to do business."
"The kettle is fine but it beeps every time you turn it on, adjust the controls or boil water. It would be much better if you could disable the damn beeping! Apparently some customers have taken it apart in order to disable the beeping."
"While I purchased the ""stainless steel"" kettle, what was sent turned out to be a charcoal grey which I've now found is the ""smoked hickory"" color. It works with my other appliances since it's still in the grey family, but not what I purchased.I'd looked at this kettle before because I wanted a nicer high-end looking appliance, but couldn't jsutify the cost. But, after burning thru 2 Mr. Coffee pots and 2 water kettles in the last 6 years, I thought, I'm going to splurge and it better last! It seems like very nice quality - I believe the whole kettle is stainless (one review said it was plastic except for the handle/spout which I don't think is true), and it's got good weight to it. It is hard to see the water level, as others have noted, unless you have really bright lighting. The lid is soft-open with a button on the handle. The spout is wide enough to pour a lot of water quickly, which is good for me (I use this as a hot water kettle only to make my horses/dogs food into a mash), no bad back-splashing or drips. The base lights up and will beep when started and when done heating. Overall, very happy with my purchase so far. I will update if something goes sour!"
I've noticed that the spout is glued on. The glue is in direct contact with water being poured. I'm not sure if this makes the water safe for consumption after being poured. Honestly doesn't seem ok to me. Also the button to open the lid doesn't always work. Find that I have to push it twice sometimes to get it to work. Searching for another kettle so I can return this.
"An update from my below review just after receiving this kettle. I have been using this continuously (maybe five or six times a day) for almost two years and and now it is beginning to fail. The power keeps cutting out while heating and the lid annoyingly keeps popping up when you pour (which can be dangerous with the steam). Frankly I think an expensive appliance like this should last more than two years, even with heavy use. When I used to live in England 30 years ago, electric kettles lasted a decade or more with heavy use. Downgrading from three to two stars.___I've just received this kettle and am very impressed with it's build and quality. Unfortunately the kettle has one fatal flaw and that is that the water level is not very visible through the windows - the picture was taken in normal daylight and the water level is at 3.5. My wife can't see the level at all and is already complaining about it. Likely I'll keep it, though, and we'll just have to get used to feeling the weight or opening the lid  to judge the water level. I had a Breville k-cup coffee brewer a few years ago and that was the complete opposite: every time I used it, it lit up with a blindingly bright blue all over: with this kettle, it's the complete opposite - I was hoping for some subdued illumination.Just one other point, and this is minor: the user manual says that black tea must be steeped at 205F - as a British person who knows something about tea, I know that's just not true: black tea needs boiling water to brew properly.I'm hoping that this kettle will last longer than my last KitchenAid kettle which failed after just three years of multiple daily use: I recall that when I lived in England, electric kettles lasted a lot longer than they do in the US - it seems to me that the average lifespan of appliances sold in the US is shortened so as to keep people buying."
"I dithered over the price, then ordered the Damsen Blue kettle. When it arrived, it was black. Some people on here say that the blue is more of a navy blue, but in my kitchen, and under direct light, it's black. I did not want black.Other than that, it's incredibly heavy. The empty kettle alone is 2 1/2 lbs. Full for a pot of tea, it's 5 pounds. Who can lift that? Nope. Returning this dud."
"I can never tell how much water is in the kettle. I always have to open the lid to see the water level. My cheaper Cuisinart kettle has a light, so I’m back to using that one."
"I searched throughout Amazon’s offerings to find an electric kettle not made in China. While this item was more expensive then others, I chose this one because the item description on Amazon said it was made in the USA. Very disappointing to see “Made in China” written in the bottom of the product when it arrived today."
Expected the water to heat up faster than my “stove teapot”.  It doesn’t 😢
With scuffs and broken base.
"I ordered the stainless steel first, and it’s grey.  I returned it.Next I ordered the blue and it looks black, in any light.I’m very disappointed and don’t understand why they aren’t more straightforward."
"Saw the temperatures were preset, first, one of my teas should be brewed at 165, not there. Also, the kettle I have now and can't find again, but is dying can switch between celcius and farienheight"
"THERE ARE NO REPLACEMENT PARTS FOR THIS PRODUCT.  FURTHERMORE WHEN YOU CALL BREVILLE IT TAKES THEM 3 DAYS TO CALL YOU BACK!  IF YOU ARE PAYING THIS PRICE FOR A TEA KETTLE, THE LEAST YOU CAN DO IS OFFER A REPLACEMENT OR PARTS TO FIX IT.NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY A BREVILLE PRODUCT!STAY AWAY.VERY DISSATISFIED CUSTOMER."
"This was the perfect size to make a personal cup of pour over coffee. Was very satisfied with the speed of heating the water the 1st three times I heated the water to clean the kettle per the instructions. As I went to make my coffee, the kettle tripped my GFCI outlet. I had just used it 3 times. I tried it multiple times and even on different outlets yet it kept tripping the GFCI. Additionally, water was leaking from the handle while the water was sitting there. I didn't even get to make a cup of coffee. It’s going back to Amazon. I can understand that it could have been defective and shorted but it shouldn't be leaking!  Definitely don't recommend. Ordered a stovetop gooseneck pour over kettle."
I returned primarily because water spills over from the side and the bottom part of the kettle. I do like that it boils water so fast.
"Took a while to receive this. I like the size, and the gooseneck seems well built. Good for making a single cup of drip coffee. Attractive enough for a common product, though a tad bit expensive for what it is.I have a larger water kettle that I’m keeping. This one simplifies how much water I need to heat and it’s lighter to maneuver over the filter. Gooseneck allows focused saturation of the ground beans.Things I’m not too fond of:-The base has no rubber to adhere it to the counter. This thing slips all over the place! I’ll rig something on the bottom but that should be a basic engineering task of the manufacturer.-There is a barely perceptible “water line” mark inside the kettle, and only in one area. Without a flashlight it’s easy to miss. This is stupid- at a minimum the line should surround the entire circumference. Even better would be some enhanced contrast above the line to give a fighting chance. The opening at the top is small so there’s not a lot of light to work with, it’s nearly invisible. And if you’re an idiot like me who fails to read the instructions beforehand, you’ll have a surprise pool of water all over and around your kilowatt electrical device because it easily boils over and pops out the cap.-The pull off top is thick, probably to insulate and extend the heat. I’m wondering how long this will last before starting to rust the bottom.I’m keeping this, as the positives outweigh the negatives for me. But the rubber feet and nearly invisible water line marking are two obvious major oversights that make me wonder about the engineering on the rest of this device that has the potential to burn down my home."
"I ordered it for my daughter for Christmas. She lives out of state. My son sent me a photo, box damaged. Hopefully it will work."
"I boiled water but it ran over, so I tried putting only one cup of water in it and when I began to pour it out it went all over the counter."
Great for 1 cup of water at the time
There’s steam coming out from the bottom and also water leaking when pouring out
"The kettle looked nice and it wasn’t very well priced. When I received the kettle, I saw black paint which is supposed to be on the outside of the kettle having overspray on the inside. Quality control has some work to do."
"The size is just right, but I wanted a capacity of about 800 ml. Also, the spout on this type of pot is very useful for making coffee. However, I am a little dissatisfied with the fact that hot water drips from the switch after the water is boiled."
"Looks very nice, exactly like in the photo.  However, there's water leaking from the bottom of the kettle every time I use it. Hope this won't cause any malfunction or disaster.  Not sure whether there's something wrong with this particular kettle..."
I loved it while it lasted! Very easy to use and clean and very cute to look at. Light weight and worked perfect for me. Only until it stopped working. All of a sudden the push button would push up/down but it wouldn't turn on. Used it only a few times in a little over a month of purchase. And now I can't return it because the return window is past. A bit disappointing
"This leaks from the plug, not sure why maybe its manufacturers fault but others have commented this as well. It doesn't hold much water because it cannot fill two cups of maruchan ramen cup noodles. Only one and some (just an example)"
It’s leaking from the button? When I pick it up to pour it’s leaking from the push start button. It does it randomly too I thought it was only after the water is already hot but no.
"Easy to use with some caveats.  With the cord fully extended, the base alone sometimes does not sit flat on the table surface depending on how the cord is positioned.  Also, the steam escapes from all around the lid instead of the vent hole, causing the top part of the handle to be wet from the condensation."
"The kettle itself is tidy and compact, it came as described. The one downside is the temp only gets to 190, so it's on the lower end of standard. It's what you pay for I guess!"
I bought this item in July. I had it in my cart for a while and it finally went down in price so I bought it. I really wanted this. I Already had one which was glass. I was selling house and packing up so this HB Kettle stayed in box until I moved. Moved into a new place in mid September. I usally drink coffee but I started more tea anyway....I tried to use it this morning put water in it. ..plugged it in and it kept blowing the outlet this is a first. I tried another outlet and went to switch the Kettle on again and nothing!!!.I guess I got a bad one. 4 months of real use.....would not recommend this.P.s and it's small in size!!!
"Loved this kettle to use with my pour over coffee, it heats up quick and gets the job done, but after only 2 months it's developed a leak in the bottom of the kettle which pours out the back where the power switch is. Too far out of purchase to return to Amazon so I've reached out to the MFG to see if they'll make it right. In the meantime I'm purchasing a new kettle of a different brand."
"I've had this electric kettle for exactly three months & it's super cute but it already doesn't work. For the first few months, it worked fine (although it did leak a lot- not because of the lid or overfilling) but it was cute & worked well otherwise so I didn't care too much. Now, every time I plug it in (have tried every outlet in my home) it blows the outlet & I have to reset it. Maybe I just got a dud? very disappointed"
It’s leaking in the bottom. And only worked for one and half months 😭
"The kettle has a design issue that allows leakage into the electronics. There's a marker inside that shows where the max fill line is, and I stuck to that, but I think condensation or something was getting inside the heating element anyway since water would leak out of the back / bottom. I've been using for 30 days so I pitched the box a few days ago and this morning it wouldn't turn on, so I can't return it now.I've seen complaints about leakage from other companies models similar to this one, so maybe the design is just really bad and everyone is producing the same item with the same flaw.It's a shame, because the design is attractive and 20 ounces heats up fast and is enough for one person."
Leaks out the bottom & it will blow the breaker if I leave it plugged in. Missed the return window. I have wanted one for a very long time & this one was just not the quality I hoped for.
It is not safe to use this product as the hot water leaks from the bottom park near the switch. I had to buy another electric kettle since I couldn't return this item.
This worked well for a handful of uses. Then it boiled over once and now the entire thing is fried. After letting it dry out for a few days it still trips the GFCI the second you try to turn it on.
"I was so excited to replace my current one but it wasn’t a good idea. It blew my 4 outlets, and it also leaks ALOT. Returning it. If it could I would give 0 stars."
"After 1 day of using it, whenever I try to turn it on, it immediately shuts off and trips the circuit. Returning it. Complete garbage - waste of my time."
I took it out from the box and I saw rust inside. I can’t believe a brand new stainless steel product has a rust inside. What a shame
"This kettle is tricky because it leaks even when filled well below the max line. I tried turning it on this morning, just 3 months after purchasing it, and it trips the outlet breaker in all of the outlets I’ve tried."
I thought this would be a great small kettle. After only a couple months this kettle no longer works and is defective. Do not waste your money on this product as it is a very disappointing waste of money.
"i want to love this thing, but roughly between half and two-thirds of the time i pick up this piece of junk, water spouts out of the power switch. i also sometimes find water surrounding the electrical contacts. i dont even understand how physics allows it to get there. ive looked all over the body inside and out for cracks, and found nothingi searched the reviews hoping it was either user error or the typical incorrect instructions that are called 'user error' when followed. only found a suggestion that i need to undershoot the max fill line. didnt work. this is not user error; its a bad product"
Leaks out of the on and off switch. Not sure how safe it is to use. Most likely will not use anymore.
"Used almost daily for 6 months. Started leaking after 2-3, and trips any outlet now when turning on."
"Don’t buy this if you are looking for a quality product. Do buy this if you want water leaking from the bottom of the kettle, do buy this if you want pool of water on your floor and counter do buy this if you want the excitement of possibly getting electricuted!!!!!"
"Hot water leaks out at the base. The pour is not smooth and gurgles, causing splashing. Avoid this product."
"After 45 days of using (past the return window), we are finding that the kettle leaks out the bottom where the power switch is. A couple of other people mentioned this in past reviews. Unfortunately, it’s true and a waste of money. Afraid to use this long term."
"worked once, the night I got it.next morning, it's an overpriced pitcher with dead electrics.one use. then dead."
I was so excited for this kettle since I love my instant hot water for instant tea & coffee. The kettle worked great for a few days and then it kept tripping my whole kitchen breaker and I was so disappointed. I was bragging it a great deal for the price until it wasn’t. I’m sad I have to return it to find something else that works without constantly triggering my breaker.
"But I'll do different on here being so long and the. vent holes on top wherever you put them, because it depends on which way the lids on It still has steam and everything coming out and it's always wet on the bottom. And I have burned myself once already. I'm being very careful, but it's not something that is safe to use."
"Do not buy. Water leaks into bottom  of pot , handel and the ""light up switch. Very disappointed and going to spend a little more and get quality. I gave away my Kitchen Aid programmable coffee brewer, I was wrong."
"This is a nice size and heats water quickly, but the design of the lid causes steam to escape when you pour it out.  I've burned my thumb a few times and have to make sure I don't grip the top of the handle.  It also drips hot water from the steam that escapes through the holes on the top of the lid.  I do not recommend this product."
Every time this thing heats up it shoots steam out around the handle and around the switch. It happens regardless of how full the kettle is...it almost seems like it's missing a gasket or something.
"This product was working, but now if keep blowing circuit when I try to use it.Cannot get anyone on a call to help troubleshoot!"
Tripping circuits
Worked great for 30 days. Began to leak at the base.  Next use it shorted out and tripped the Ground Fault Indicator(GFI).  Stopped operating all together
I used it one time and it worked well. Next time I went to use it and it continuously flipped the breaker switch and does not work anymore.
"Every time when it's used, some boiling water bubbles out of the vent and will spill when you pour, burning you. Very disappointed. I think the switch doesn't go off on time."
My kettle broke after 2 months of usage! Waste of money!!!! Don't waste your time with this product!
Nothing else matters if one doesn't feel safe because the kettle does not automatically turn off.  Concerned about leaving it plugged.
