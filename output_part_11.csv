"Very good headphones for the price, comfortable enough to my ears for long music listening however, it is unacceptable that the USB C cable is too short, or maybe Amazon just lost the long version and added whatever they found, that’s my guess. Anyways, good headphones, comfy ears and decent sound quality."
"If bass is your goal, you will like these. If you enjoy a true all around sound experience and noise cancellation the Bose Quiet Comfort is a winner."
"In my professional opinion, the sound quality of the Ult Wear headphones is exceptional, however, the lack of bass is noticeable and results in a tinny sound. Additionally, the Ult button produces a mono stereo sound with a tinny quality, which is disappointing. Furthermore, the absence of LDAC support is surprising, as it limits the headphones' ability to deliver lossless audio. Considering the significant investment of $180, it is reasonable to expect better bass performance. In comparison, the Skullcandy Crusher and Bose Quiet Comfort headphones appear to offer superior sound quality. While I acknowledge the shortcomings, I will retain the headphones for further evaluation."
"Sound is pretty good. Not amazing. Pretty comfortable in long term use.Very difficult to get used to controls. Everything is black on black, almost impossible to see in low light. Touch controls are over sensitive and I trigger something every time I just want adjust fit."
"Connection issues with alternate Bluetooth sources, and SONY's worst feeling headphones to date from a material standpoint. However, I can't in good faith rate these below 3. They are extremely comfortable (I wear glasses so an important consideration) , and for the value proposition they are fantastic. ANC almost as good as comparable 300 dollar headphones.If you love bass and need sub 200 ANC headphones for traveling with dedicated compatible devices. These are fantastic.If you prefer a more balanced sound, aesthetics, or build quality. These are possibly some of the worst options in this or any price range. They look, and feel (probably deliberately) cheap to not crush their xm5s."
"I loved these headphones when I first got them. The ANC is great and I didn't mind the bass. But then after a few days, I noticed a headaches as soon as I put the headphones on. I did some research and found out this is from an effect called ""ear pulling"", which is similar to the changes of cabin pressure in a flight. I also found out that this doesn't happen with earbuds and that was my experience with my Airpods Pro 2. The reason why I got these headphones was because I wanted something that can last 8+ hours with ANC so I can sleep on long flights. That won't happen if it is going to cause me headaches. I have it this packed and ready for a return."
"I got these headphones as someone who is Autistic and need good quality noise cancellation which was advertised to me all over the place with this product. (I did thorough research). I honestly feel like there isn't even a noise cancelling feature. I can still hear so much in my environment that it is honestly just annoying to put on noise cancellation. If you are looking for something to enjoy music with, these headphones are great. But if you are getting them for the noise cancelling, DON'T BUY THEM!!!!"
"Sounds really good, nice sound, great bass"
"It is one of the better headphones in the market, especially given the price which is on sale most of the times.However, my wife wife finds it a bit heavy for her day-by-day use so unfortunately we had to return it back as it was really a deal breaker for her"
I really had hope for these headphones I had expectations thinking they where going to sound great with the bass. I really didn't feel any bass... I tried playing around with the EQ settings but nothing really exciting. There was a little bass but nothing really amazing like the skull candy crusher Evo's. Another thing is that they sound quiet even at max volume and I really don't enjoy having my headphones at max volume but these for me needed to be at max volume to be heard. The good thing about these head phones are the noise cancellation. So I wouldn't really recommend these headphones just get the skull candy crusher Evo if you really want bass and a long battery life. If these headphones are on sale and you want NC then get them if you want but there are better options out there.
"Struggles to know which device to play from and sometimes plays it from other devices and says it’s connected but won’t play.Otherwise great quality sound, comfort, and noise cancelling is amazing.The App is terrible, slow, and does not integrate with Apple well."
"At first I tested this headset by playing some Phantom Of The Night to check the bass.  Then I listened to some Nora Jones.  It was great.It fell apparat when I connected it with my Sony Bravia TV.  At first I was just walking around within 20 ft and the connection dropped.  Then I was sitting in my lounge chair not even moving and it dropped the connection again.  I removed and reconnected in Bluetooth.  And, it continued dropping randomly.  It also left a YouTube video for no reason.  There are sensors inside the ear cushions that are supposed to pause and restart what you are watching when you remove and put back on the headset.  My guess is that is where the problems originated.Anyhow, on the first day I used this headset for about six hours and had unintentional interruptions about a dozen times.  That makes this headset more of a problem than it is worth."
"I urge everyone to check the low star-count reviews. These headphones have a common breaking point that you'll see in many of those 1 and 2 star reviews. Here's another...These sound great, there's no denying that, but I would urge you to spend your money elsewhere because Sony is cutting corners. As with others' reviews, one of the ear cups has broken off at the swivel. The exact same spot, same metal C-clip fell out, etc. This is not a user-related issue, it is fully on Sony for cutting corners by either not properly strength testing or by using cheaper brittle plastic that is more prone to failure. I am deeply disappointed because they are not cheapie throwaway headphones. To spend $150 or more and have them broken and unusable after only 4 months is inexcusable. Looking into getting these repaired under warranty but really unhappy that I will be without them for however long it takes to fix them."
"Ended up returning this item in favor of keeping my old Soundcore Q45s in service a while longer. While this set has MORE bass, it's not enough extra to justify the price premium, and the Q45s in general have MUCH better definition and clarity to whatever I'm listening to. I was taken in by the massive amounts of  positivity among Youtube reviewers concerning the ULT WEARs, but they simply are not worth it in my opinion.I wouldn't budge on these again without a sale knocking at least $75 off MSRP. Probably more."
"I loved the sound.  And within barely 5 months, despite careful handling, the left earpiece broke at the hinge point.  I tried taping the joint back together to at least extend the use for a little longer, but within a day the headphones were randomly disconnecting from bluetooth/turning off.  Between the earpiece being busted and turning off every 3 minutes or so, they are totally useless to me at this point. I usually try to give negative reviews the benefit of the doubt for the occaissional faulty item, but it turns out most of the negative reviews talk about breaks at exactly the same point as mine, so it's a construction problem, not a random one-off event. Which sucks, since the sound really is very good and I loved the bass boost option. Sigh.  Sorry Sony."
Sound quality (using iPhone 16) is tinny. Not good at all. My 4 year old version of this product (WHXB900N) sounds much better. The App is tedious and buggy.  Sony has turned the simple act of pairing a Bluetooth headset to an iPhone into a major time sucking event.
"Great sound and Noise Canceling. Cheap plastic around the swival for an area of constant movement. I purchased in June 2024, money down the drain."
"I’m very disappointed with the Sony (ULT Wear). Yes, the sound is beautiful, and the noise cancellation is amazing, but what's the point if the product barely lasts? After just 2 months, I noticed a loss of pressure in the ears, which completely ruined the experience, and by 5 months, they stopped working altogether, despite handling them with great care.I understand the use of recycled materials, but that doesn't justify such a fragile build. Honestly, I expected much better from a brand like Sony. This product feels more disposable than durable. Very disappointing."
"I just didn’t hear anything that stood out with these, noise canceling is nice but overall sound performance is just not there. 50$ JBL headphones out do these."
"Sorry but the bass delivered here is slightly better than the wh1000xm5 headset. The xm5 are my go to set and for sound quality with deep bass. The Sony ULT set is a let down unfortunately. There is a cap, when the volume gets to about 75% of full the bass gets quieter."
"I wish I didn’t buy them. They blast the volume without my control when you first turn them on, then it drops to the previous volume. It’s really dumb technology. I tried to change the settings through my iPhone but I can’t."
My niece lie about this headset 1.so expensive that have no volume it  useless to play game can’t hear the sound lucky someone reach out to get one at SteelSeries.com only for 84.00 had one before was 4year but after using it the ear thing was cracking up today they have a new update lighter with volume control surrounding sound sound
Good sound but not very loud. Also fell off my head and the entire left cup snapped off.
"I was truly disappointed. These did NOT measure up to the hype. Their general audio quality is good, but the bass is weaker than older Sony models I've used.Note***: Go with the Crusher Evo (not ANC) if you're a bass head."
Save your money 💰Ever time I am listening to some the cut out it's crazy. I'll be talking on phone there cut off.
"I've had two of these headphones break at the exact same spot, above the right can that connects to the upper part of the headphones and I take care of my equipment. Very disappointing. These are great headphones and they're ruined by their terrible build quality. They cost $200 FFS."
"As someone coming from a pair of Sony MDR-XB950N1's i believe that these, despite being a successor to the model line are in fact a downgrade in a few aspects.The Sony ULT Wear's are no where near as loud as the MDR-XB950N1's and the bass, which is supposed to be their main thing is at most on par with the XB950N1's. Noise cancelling and voice passthrough are 100% an incredible improvement but the sound just isnt up to snuff, I would generally consider another pair of headphones instead of these in the future when I'm looking to buy again."
"It's really a shame, because the sound quality was great, but I have never had headphones break this quickly :(I bought these headphones on June 7th and they cracked in less than 4 months...Sony support was unhelpful.  It's probably my last Sony product for a while..."
"The sound quality was great, enjoyed it thoroughly. However, the cheap plastic holding the speakers to the headband shattered after 3 months through nothing more than daily office use. Deeply disappointing."
This happened from regular use after less than 3 months. Just broke right on my head. The warranty doesn't cover damage like this. Just buy bose
"I just bought it yesterday, and oh boy, this must go back to Amazon Warehouse. For some reasons, it works great with my iPhone, but when I switch to my Macbook for some conversations/meeting, it just completely turns into 1980s stereo radio. Sony, I know you do a better job."
The plastic hinge broke within 2 months. Flimsy for a 200 dollar pair of headphones
First set of Sony phones paired an worked very well. Second set of similar Sony phones would not pair with our blue tooth Sony big screen TV. Want to return non functioning head phones and replace with phones that pair with our same blue tooth Sony TV.
These stupid headphones disconnect and shut off while i’m in the middle of running working out and basketball. Not worth 200$ with tax and there are no good bluetooth headphones . I hate to say it apple is the most reliable out there.
I am very disappointed that the material is very cheap & breaks apart … i have used it for almost two month for this to happen & a waste of my $$ SMH 🤦‍♀️.
These headphones is not for me.
Cheep feeling almost toy like.The bass is just distortionI'm returning mine for a refund
Online instruction were not well-matched to this specific model. Instructions did not include how to operate Alexa feature and generally vague.
Good sound for price however they fit too tight and not suitable if you wanna wear them for longer than 30 mins
"For a long time, I always wanted to have a Sony headphone, especially after using my friend's XM4. When I saw that the ULT WEAR had released, I had to get it. I own a few over the ear headphones from competing brands, but none at this price range. It's definitely a new experience for me. I'll start with the things I liked, and that is, how portable the headphone truly is. It's foldable and compact to the point that you won't have any trouble packing when you want to travel. Also, a case is included which has dividers inside separating the headphone from the cables. Another feature I enjoyed is the amount of bass. Bass heads will have a good time. I keep it on ""ULT 1"" mode because it's well balanced and not over the top, but you can adjust it to your preference, if needed. The Pause/Play sensors are fast and there is barely a delay for the music to stop when you take off the headphones, which is neat.  It's definitely faster than any other headphone, I have used thus far. The UI is intuitive and easy to use. Last, but not least, Touch control is fun to use and very responsive. Now, off to the dislikes, and there are a few. First of which, Noise Canceling. I had higher expectations when it comes to the ANC, especially after I saw that it has the same V1 chip used in the XM4. The XM4's ANC is amazing, and it's not the case with the ULT WEAR. I noticed that if you turn your head away from an audio source when ANC is on, you will be able to hear the noise, until you face towards it again. It was mostly noticeable with higher frequencies, but can happen with lower frequencies. Another feature I was disappointed with is head tracking/ 360 Reality Audio. Although, Head tracking isn't listed anywhere in the description, it's still a feature in the app, but you can only use it with specific android devices. Samsung has disabled this feature, so even though you can do head tracking calibration in-app, you won't be able to use it. As for 360 Reality Audio, It's not immersive as I would've hoped and it's limited to certain platforms and tracks. Head tracking would serve a better purpose. The Microphone quality leaves much to be desired. They sound muffled, distance, and somewhat distorted. The Earcups are uncomfortable after 2 hours or so. There is barely any breathing room, so if you're using them outside, they will get sweaty real quick. So after all of that, would I still recommend them? If they're on sale, probably, but there are way better alternatives that offer some of the features, if not more, at a cheaper price.  I'm hoping there is a firmware update that fixes the ANC and possibly adds head tracking that is not dependent on a specific device."
"First off, these sound just fine. For the average person, these would probably be totally acceptable.Bass is very punchy and tactile. You really feel the rumble. That being said, the the max bass boost setting, the quality definitely suffers and it gets a bit sloppy, especially at louder volumes and this gets compounded pretty hard if you have ANC or passthrough mode on.Mids are a bit recessed and a little nasally but with good clarity and a decent overall timbre.Treble is smooth and extended with decent detail and decay, and honestly I think is the most well done out of the tuning. It sounds very natural, but it is easily overpowered by the bass boost modes and fades into the background haze created by the bass.Soundstage and imaging is very decent, this really surprised me for a closed back ANC headphone. It isn't the widest or deepest, but there is a very good sense of layering and separation instead of just a flat wall of sound like most ANC headphones. Imaging is very accurate as well, maybe not razor sharp, but that might be down to a lack of raw resolution capabilities in the headphones and it's still doing a very good job.The ANC works pretty well, it definitely works great for fans and droning noises but it doesn't block out voices all that well. The passthrough mode is actually really good, super clear and holographic. Actually almost sounds like you aren't wearing headphones.Comfort for me is an easy 9/10. SUPER LIGHT. One of the most comfortable headphones I've worn in my life. Really didn't expect these to be as comfortable as they are, so that was a pleasant surprise. The pads are just deep enough to not put pressure on my ear like most Bluetooth headphones that seem to just rest on your whole ear and because of this, I think the ANC suffers both in sound suppression and the amount of bleed and distortion you get at loud volumes with the bass boost and ANC on. Something about the combination of all of it at once just results in some awful sound, but if you're listening at loud volumes, you don't really need the ANC anyways so it isn't a huge deal.Controls took me some time to get used to and for some reason you can't turn the ANC completely off right out of the box, you have to get the app and add it to the rotation cycle of the ANC button and then it functions as normal. I was unsure of the touch controls on the right cup being the + style drag method but after using it for a little while, I actually like this style a lot more than I thought I would. I saw in the app that you can turn the touch controls off if they annoy you, but I actually kinda like them and I haven't had any accidental presses or incorrect inputs so they're a win for me.The app is kind of a mess, but actually packs a ton of features and allows for a lot of EQ presets including modified presets for the 2 stages of bass boost toggle that you have a separate button on the headphones for. Connection seems great. Battery life seems great. Build is very light but still feels pretty sturdy and well made.I'm taking a star off because of the price on these and another star because of the sound quality falloff when trying to use all the features at once. These really are good headphones in isolation but the fact that the bass boost button being the focus of these and yet causes so many issues and hurts quality so much that I can't just let it slide and I gotta take another star for that. There are a lot of competitive options around $100 these days and quite a few around that price bracket that I personally think just flat out outperform these in every regard with maybe the exception being amount of features packed into their companion app. The app is nice, but realistically, you shouldn't be buying a headphone for the app, sound quality should be number one, comfort a close second, and when it comes to Bluetooth headphones, price third since they all have a finite life and will die some day and never take a charge again."
"While sound, noise cancelling, and comfort is good, every meeting and phone call I took I had the same problem, People would say it sounds like my volume was strong, then would go really weak. It was very poor quality. I contacted Sony support did all the usual steps, and they could not fix it, so the sent me a replacement, and when I got the new one, it did the exact same thing. I was also running the latest version firmware, and tried using them with, and without the app.I also tried disabling one feature at time for about a week, and I could not take it anymore. I know these headphone get good reviews, but I doubt people are using them for phone calls or zoom. The problem appears to be by design, something is wrong with noise canceling and its interfering with the mic. I would not get this headphone if you will be using the mic feature on it."
The bass is good and thats about it. Sound quality compared to my beats and any other headphone that cost 40$ sound better and more clean. VERY. VERY CHEAP FEELING HEADPHONES. Feels like if you drop it. they break. Super cheap plastic and the inner foam is loose and feels very cheap. Ear cups feel cheap. These should be priced at $30 like JVC headphones. Get something else if you want quality.
They performed okay..for six months..just use them laying in bed to watch tv…then they developed a kind of motorboating rumble sound in the right speaker..was going to try and return them but then the plastic headband broke..wound up throwing them away…expensive to replace …would never buy cheap Sony headphones again. BOSE are more durable..have had them last years and years.
Sound is very good alot of bass
Does Sony even know what bass is I have the xb900n headphones from Sony these are identical in sound very low sound and no bass using and iPhone 15 plus I wish they would do what skull candy does with the sensory bass that sounds more like it for bass heads like me
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                *Disappointing Experience with Ultwere Headphones**I’m really disappointed with the Ultwere headphones. They do not connect to Bluetooth devices like my TV or laptop, which is a major issue. They just won’t pair. The sound quality is also lacking—it's not loud enough, and the bass is ok.but naot soo good For the price, I expected much better performance.On top of that, I’m frustrated with Amazon's return policy. They won’t allow me to return or replace the product, so I'm stuck with these subpar headphones. Be cautious before purchasing these.---I reflect my experience."
"I bought a used pair of these headphones on sale from Amazon, expecting minor cosmetic damage and non-original packaging based on the listing description. However, they arrived in the original packaging with significant wear on the earpads and a strong perfume odor.While the headphones connected easily to my phone, the touch controls didn’t work, and they continued playing audio when removed. I tried several troubleshooting steps but couldn’t resolve these issues.I contacted Amazon support, asking for a replacement, but the experience was frustrating. After over an hour of explaining my request, I was told Amazon wouldn’t send a replacement and that I’d have to return the item for a refund. I requested another used pair, but they claimed no stock was available, despite the site showing availability. When I asked to speak to a manager, I was left waiting with no response.I'm posting this review to warn potential buyers since it’s likely this defective unit will be resold. Amazon’s handling of this issue was disappointing, especially as a Prime customer."
"Built quality is very poor, while folding the ear piece it broke , haven't folded it harshly yet it broke, could only use this Sony ult headphone for only 2 n half months."
"I have been using Bose QC 15 since last 7 years.  Over these years I have had no issues with sound QC, connectivity and call quality too.  It's NC was also good until I had to replace it's ear pads which I di of a third party make.  The NC gone but the sound & call  quality remained.  During the great sale, came across this headphone from Sony.  Read a few reviews and fell for it.  Long story short, I regret my decision.Bose sound quality and ease of use is in different league all together.  Sony is good only in the color reproduction in their supremely overpriced TV,'s.  In the arena of sound, be it their headphones or sound systems, they simply lack behind. All the reviews on web of this model are overhyped.  NC is not good.  Bass is simply over hyped.  Totally dissappointing !"
I'm not expecting this type of low quality sound  useless bass when I use ult2 mode it's painful not joyful thing about it before purchase
Anc very bad
"Do these headphones have great bass? Based on my experience with Bose QC, Sennheiser HD620s, Sony WH1000XM5, the answer is ""Yes""! With ""Ult 1"" on, and ""Clear Bass"" set +4 - +6, the deep, full base is incredible! I love the song ""500 Miles"" (I'm Gonna Be). On the line ""When I get drunk..."" as the Bass and drum kick in (no pun intended), the Bass sounds incredible! If that is what you want, you have with the Ult Wear. However, I noticed that the sound seems ""far"" away from my ears. Like a speaker is at the othef end of the room or down a tunnel. And this creates a somewhat ""muddy"" sense to the sound. Compared to my Sony WH1000XM5, it was  very noticeable difference in quality. The 1000XM5's have an immediate, right there in your ear-drum sound, with such superb clarity and enough bass, though not as much as the Ult Wear.The Ult def do not have a premium ""feel"" to them. They look and feel much cheaper than my 1000X5 do. And they are currently half the $ too, so for many I suppose that will be the decisive factor. They are bulkier on the side than my WH1000XM5 (presumably due to the larger driver to accommodate that extra Bass?). They are super easy to set up. If the sound was more ""immediate"" and clearer across all registers when ""Ult 1"" is engaged (I found Ult 2 to be too much) rather than having that ""far away"" element, I would have kept them because the bass is superb in my opinion. However, Because of the overall difference in sound, I returned the Ult Wear."
"The battery is excellent, the design is good, and the product feels and looks premium.However, the ANC for which I paid double the price over the competitors is nothing to discuss. The ANC is as good as wearing the device without turning it on, for which you can buy some earplugs, which should function way better than this. Also, many reviews that I've read said they could wear it without any discomfort for hours; I can't entirely agree as there's heat build-up and ears start paining even in a few minutes wearing with ANC on. Not a great buy."
"My ears are 40 years old. While some folk seem to really like the sound, I do not. I found the bass overwhelming and uncomfortable. And despite trying my best, the equalizer in the app was inadequate to resolve this problem. Noise canceling was good. And while some may like the touch interface, I much prefer knobs and buttons - especially when on the move."
"Too expensive for what it offers.The volumen is not that great, I mean is Sony.People could hear more what I’m listening to than me."
"Giving it 3star as i came from using XB900N. And after using it post xb900n, found this as okeish. Overall volume and bass were way better in xb900n. Kind a disappointing for me."
"They sound great and they connect well to my phones and other devices. However, the pair I received makes crackling noises when I use the noise cancelling feature and ambiant noise feature. I know it’s abnormal since my friend has the same pair and it works perfectly fine for them.The issue is, you can’t just exchange your pair for another if this happens to you. You have only access to a refund and Amazon says I’d receive mine on September 10th, we are august 12 and I received the item august 10. So that means a whole month to wait for a refund.This is an expensive product and a lot of money that I won’t see for a whole month just to buy another one without being sure they will work well at all."
Please don't buy this....hinge got broken even after using gently... within few months...read the other reviews ...it had happened with many people... it's built quality is very inferior...
"This is my first time to buy any wireless headset. It's not worth the hype in short.I heard and saw many good reviews in YT and Amazon and thereafter decided to spend more than 15k for this but is not safisfied with the product.Sound Quality - GoodBuild Quality- OkayANC - Not good, I felt like normal neck band.Comfortable - NiceOverall, It's fine but not worth the money."
"i bought considering good bass sound, but soubd is ok ok in bass mode, you can not wear long time. Truely saying not worth the price"
Keeps dropping Bluetooth connection. Poor sound quality. I have had them only 2 months and it's late for me to exchange or return. I am EXTREMELY disappointed with this purchase. Probably the worst thing I have ever wasted money on. I highly recommend to avoid buying these and it actually makes me question the whole Sony brand now.
"Horrible experience. No one can hear me properly during calls, and I can’t hear outside sounds at all. The sound quality gave me a headache after long use. Definitely not worth it."
Broke mine in just 1 month. And trust me I hardly used it and I am very careful with my devices also.
"Very sad to inform everyone, to enjoy 3d sound have to take subscription. Buying headphone of 16,000 not having 3d support for free. Shame on sony. Ishse acha sound tha snapdeal se 1300 ka headphone ka tha. As compared to over priced, sound quality, waste of money"
Please don't buy save yourself
"Hi,Please don't buy this from Amazon, now they have extremely bad customer service.I called for help guy name Chandan did not help."
Bass sound  is not OK 👎👎👎 OK
"Similar to soundcore q10 ,Utter disappointment, very low quality bassWaste of money"
"I don't know a whole lot about music quality. I'll go ahead and put that out there. However, I love listening to music, it is a large part of my life, just don't expect any technical terms here.I'll also start by saying that the only listening device I had before this was my AirPod Pros, so this is mostly compared to them.Pros:I think the sound quality is nice. At least as an average music-listener, ie someone who uses them almost every day and just enjoys hearing music while doing daily tasks or working out, I enjoy the quality. I don't think they dim my playlists or make any song less enjoyable. Every song comes through just how I expect it.I care a whole lot about Noise Cancellation. When I was looking into a headset to buy I turned some very nice seeming ones down solely because I saw a couple reviews upset about noise cancellation. I feel very good about the quality of NC I've gotten with these. They drown most everything out as long as something is playing and have satisfied me when trying to drown out others' conversations and other background noise.They are comfy! I could wear these all day if feel like. I've never had my ears or head hurt while wearing them, even after a couple hours.They fold up nicely into their case. I was intent on finding a pair that I could fold up and this pair fulfills that.Cons:My biggest con is that you can't hold them on the sides while listening to music. Maybe this is just a me thing, but when I'm super into a song, I press on the sides to make it louder and more prominent in my ears. You can't touch the sides without it going into transparency mode. And it announces, ""Transparency Mode"" which ruins the whole thing. Probably a niche complaint but something that has definitely irritated me.Transparency mode is no good. It plays a loud fan noise no matter the background noise that ruins the song or video you might be watching. Completely ruined a call I had been waiting on because the other side answered and I couldn't hear them because of this fan noise, and didn't realize it was the headphones (I was outside so thought it was the busses going by) until it was too late.Can't say ""Hey Siri..."". I like using my AirPods when working out so that I can say ""Hey Siri, skip this song"" without pausing what I'm doing. That's a No-Go with these.If I'm doing workouts lying down, they slide off my ears, so I have to hold them which as previously mentioned turns them into ""Transparency Mode!""The buttons click cheaply. I'm not exactly sure how to explain this but when you click them they feel cheap and echo through the whole headseat.Overall/Long story short...I think this is a good pair for someone on a budget (as I am). All of these cons I can get over because I don't have the money to upgrade, and in my stage of life I feel good about what these bring me. The sound quality keeps me enjoying my favorite songs and allows me to wear them while working out, or to wear them for along time, so I feel good about my purchase. If you care about the perfect fit, or the perfect quality, you probably need to look into some higher price points. ( appreciate the comfort and quality but have had issues with the mechanics (falling off when laying down, transparency mode happening when I don't want it). Would not recommend the quality over AirPod Pros but have enjoyed them as my headphone option."
"Let me preface this by saying that I bought these mainly for the noise cancelling, to use both to focus when working/watching media on my PC and to mitigate external sound when sleeping. I actually don't really listen to music that often and can't say much about the audio quality beyond ""it's acceptable"". I do have many things to say about the other two use cases though.When using it on the PC :As long as you plan to use it by BT you should be fine. I had some trouble getting it to connect at first but I blame that on my PC being old (Win 7), I made it work somehow by using a newer BT dongle, the fact that it somehow works at all on such an old setup is a plus to me, whether this was intentional or not. There's two inconveniences though :1.- Even though you can connect by 3.5mm, the product listing doesn't tell you anywhere that NC or EQ features are not supported during this mode. What's worse, apparently the feature WAS supported a few years ago, but it got disabled by a firmware update somewhere down the line because of some bogus reason (the fact that more expensive models that came after this still support the feature is kinda fishy too). If you were an old user, this was a choice, whether you wanted to update or not, but new buyers will find that the product now ships with the latest firmware when you buy it, so you're stuck with it. I wouldn't blame you if you just assumed NC should work over 3.5mm, as it is a normally a standard feature in this price range, even worse, a lot of the reviews out there on the product are from the time when the feature was available, so people deciding to buy without doing research or based on old information are in for a bad surprise. As it is now, when you use 3.5mm the logic part of the headphones is completely turned off and only the speakers work, so you're left with the regular unfiltered sound, and to put it frankly, the audio quality like this is terrible and not worth it, do not buy these if you plan to use 3.5mm at all, you'll be sorely disappointed.2.- Speaking of NC and EQ, those features have several options that can be adjusted to your liking through a phone app. This is a good thing as the default config may not suit everybody's use case, what's not so good is tying these adjustments to a phone app only. Why do I have to switch over to my phone when I want to adjust a setting on the fly instead of being able to do it directly from my computer? What if something happens to my phone or the app stops working/gets pulled from the store sometime in the future? A PC app would have been a great alternative, and being able to modify some of the options just by using buttons would have been even better.When using as a sleep aid :This is gonna be a very picky and niche use case, but sometimes, I may be woken by unexpected noise in the middle of the night, at that point I like to be able to grab my NC headphones and put them on as soon as possible, without having to think too much about it or turn on the lights, to be able to go back to sleep. This product fails in that regard in several ways.First, the case that they ship with : The headphones only fit in when you fold them inwards a specific way, taking them out and unfolding them is a bit cumbersome and I wish they would have given you a bigger case in which the headphones fit normally without doing this. I think the idea is to make it so it takes less space when packing them or something, but the case is fairly big as it is, so if you want to save space you're probably gonna take them out of it anyways. Should keep the folding ability but make the case itself bigger so you don't need to store them folded.Turning on the thing is also unnecessarily complicated, the power button is same size and shape as every other button, and you have to hold it for 3 secs to turn it on, again, not the fastest or easiest thing to do in the dark. My generic brand headphones from similar price range but much older have a single slide toggle switch, it's size and shape are different from the other buttons and turning it on just takes a flick, I would much have preferred something like that.Once the thing is actually on, turns out it will turn itself off after a few minutes if it's not paired to anything. So if you want to just use the NC by itself, though luck, you better have your phone nearby with BT turned on so you can connect to it, even if you don't play anything on it. Again, not the fastest thing to do when you're on bed.Lastly, and this is a minor gripe, the device has an LED status light to indicate whether it's ON, in pairing mode, etc. For some reason the thing is perpetually blinking regardless of state. I can understand for pairing mode, but why not just make it solid when it's actually connected? If I take off the headphones and lie them around on my desk and forget about it, I can't tell from a quick glance if they're ON or OFF, I have to stare carefully for a few seconds to see if the blinking comes on and what color it is to know what's going on. Annoying.""Better sleep"" function :This is a feature of the app, it is not highlighted that often but a few reviews mention it, as one of the few people that could make use of it, I will give my thoughts on it : It's basically a white noise machine, you have a few white noise loops to choose from and you can adjust the volume of each one individually so you can mix and match to your liking, so for example, you can have loud rain with faint sounds of birds in the background or vice versa. You can also set a timer for how long this will play for. It's a handy feature but nothing exceptional, the stock noises are limited and may not be of everybody's liking, the loops also feel kinda short. I find myself using mostly the rain only. If you're into this, chances are you probably already have your own long white noise loops saved on your phone anyways, which would work just as well.Good things :Putting all that negativity aside, I do think the hardware itself is very good at this price range. The NC has 3 different settings and is worth trying them all out to see which one works better for your environment, it won't silence everything a 100%, but it works much better than my previous cheapy headphones, and I doubt you can get much better NC at this price range. The headphones are comfortable and I have no problem sleeping with them or wearing them for hours. Is hard to tell how well the build will hold over time, but after a month of usage, nothing has broken yet. The battery is LONG and I only have to charge it once a week if anything. Although it's not something I was even aware when I bought the product, turns out it has a built in mic and it's surprisingly good quality, I have been able to do many long voice calls with it with no complains about the quality from the other party so far.Overall, despite the poor user experience and having to adapt to its many quirks, I do find this product useful and plan to keep using it in the future. I just hope when/if I upgrade sometime in the future, that the newer products on the line don't suffer from the same usability problems."
"The noise canceling feature and the ability to toggle it is fantastic, but putting it's mode toggle as a tap and hold on the earphone is a stupid novelty gimmick. It adds no value or convenience, I just activate it by accident taking them on or off. This ""feature"" is something I predict is just more likely to break than if it had just been a toggle switch where all the rest of the control buttons are.The headset can get a little uncomfortable if you have a big head and wear it a LONG period of time, but I don't hold this against it. I recognize I just have a big head.The battery life is great, and I hope it holds up. They claim it can get a 4 hour charge with only 5 minutes of charging time. I have not had a chance to test the veracity of this claim, but it feels a little dubious. Not every USB is the same, not every USB slot has the same electrical output. I had it plugged into my computer for an hour or so and the headset was still dead. I had to plug it into a cellphone usb power brick that goes directly into an electrical outlet. It's a HUGE bummer if you can't charge, even if slowly, through a PC USB. I did not take the time to try other USB ports to see if its just a difference between USB 1/2/3, but if it HAS to be through a USB power brick this should have 100% been included with the product.The USB charging cable it comes with is only 6-8ish inches. It would have been nice if the cable was 3 feet and you could use the headset as a wired headset in a bind, but using while charging is apparently not an option at all. What a shame.Sound quality is fine but not great. About what I expect for wireless and at this price point. This is not a complaint, but just don't purchase expecting to be wow'd the second you put them on.It comes with a stupid app to unlock some settings/features. I know this is basically standard, but it's still annoying. I don't want another app or software for every single piece of technology I own and having all its features available on the device, out of the box would be a big value add for me.It took nearly 2 weeks of the order just sitting in the system before it was processed/sent out. This isn't some niche product, there's no reason I can fathom it should take this long. What's the point in offering different delivery priorities if they all amount to ""no time particularly soon."""
"I’m giving these headphones a 3-star rating based on my personal preferences and what I was specifically looking for. They’re not bad, but they fell short of my expectations for true noise isolation/cancellation without audio.What I Was Looking For:I wanted headphones that could effectively block out background noise (e.g., a TV on low volume) without needing to play music or sound. Unfortunately, these didn’t meet that standard.Testing & Observations:1. Noise Cancellation Without Audio:Straight out of the box, I put them on and tested with the TV playing at a low volume. I could still hear everything clearly.2. Noise Cancellation With Audio:Low Volume: Even with music playing softly, I could still hear the TV clearly.Medium Volume: While the volume level increased (indicator light turned red), the TV was still audible about 10 feet away.Full Volume: This muted the TV significantly, but faint sounds still came through.3. Ambient Noise Mode via App:I loved the option to play ambient sounds like rain or thunder. This could be great for relaxing or reading.However, the feature didn’t block out surrounding noise effectively, even for its intended purpose (e.g., sleep).Positives:Comfort: These headphones are extremely comfortable, which is a huge plus for long-term wear.App Features: The variety of soundscapes in the app is a nice touch, especially for creating a calming environment.Why I Returned Them:While the comfort and app features were tempting, the primary purpose of these headphones (noise cancellation) didn’t match what I was seeking. I already own a pair of headphones that block noise better, so I couldn’t justify keeping these despite their comfort.Final Thoughts:If you prioritize comfort and enjoy added app features like ambient sounds, these might be a great fit. However, for those looking for serious noise isolation/cancellation, especially without audio, these may not meet your expectations."
"After rocking the Soundcore Q20 vs Q30 on a side by side test, it turns out the SoundCore Q20 are the better headphones. The Soundcore Q20 are easier on the ears and doesn't fall off of your head easily from bending over or shaking your head. The Q30 fall off after a light shake and I have a big head. Trust me. The soundcore Q20 surprisingly has a better sound quality but the Q30 can play music with a larger range of frequencies. There are in no way Bose Headphones (Q20) but they do hold their own and worth the money. I am sadded because I chose the q30 due to many YouTube reviewers reviews and honestly thought the upgrade would have been worth it. So here it is...The Sound Core Q30 has okay sound. the q20 sounds better overall and i don't need an app to adjust the sound. I find that the app helps but I don't like going back to the app just to adjust to the type of music i listen too. It becomes more annoying to keep going back and forth. The bass in the q30 when adjusted is amazing! However, as I said, you are going to have to keep going back and forth to adjust to the sound which gets annoying.  The SoundCore Q30 are a cool looking set of headphones but they hurt my ears. I am not sure why they hurt my lower ears so much but they do. i think i might need them to wear in because they are to tight at the bottom of my ear lobs but not tight in the middle so that they don't fall off of my head. Not a good choice of materials unfortunately. I also didn't like the noise canceling feature since it was on and I could still hear everything like the AC running in the background. Something that doesn't happen with the Q20. The headphones will need some getting used to but I think that with the price being twice of the q20 then it's not worth the upgrade and to just stick with the q20 w/hard case instead of the q30. I DO like how to SoundCore Q30 has a hard case. Very nice and a plus. Adds a touch of elegance for a budget headset. Anyways, I did also upgrade the firmware and it didn't help to much. I think the q20s are the way to go and just save the rest of your money. I'll update if it gets better over time or if I hate it enough to return.Update***I ended up buying another pair of Q30's to see if my first one was defective and it could have been. Reached out to Sound core but no one ever responded so I just purchased another pair and returned the old pairs.Do I think the upgrade is worth the money? No. It's not worth the money from the Q20's. I gave the Q20's a better review and should have kept them vs these but that's okay. The noise cancellation is not really noise cancellation. It's more like noise isolation. My ac runs and it doesn't make much noise and I can still hear it  with the noise cancellation on and the music playing. I swear I am not kidding. The noise cancellation was way better on the Q20 then they are on the Q30s. I think (am not sure) that the reason why there is noise still coming in is because the padding around the ear is thinner than the q20. I think that's the reason but noise cancellation is on (as I type) and I can still hear the air blowing. If I can hear the air blowing now in my house as I work from home then I know I am going to need another pair of headphones for flights and stuff to block out the noise which kinda negates the purpose of these because I was hoping they would cover all my bases. That's okay.Anyways, I wear these for work about 9 hours a day 4 days a week and then 2 hours a day at the gym three times a week and another 2 hours a day studying for school about 6 times a week. I have music playing in the background for school so i get to know headphone pretty quickly. First thing is first is that they still hurt my ears. Mostly towards the top of the ears after and hour or two I have to take them off to not make my ears to sore. The Q20s were comfortable AF and comfort wise the Q20's were better. However, the Q30s do not cause a lot of sweating around the ears, something the Q20's is known for. Like the Q20's makes me sweat big time around the ears and I don't sweat easily. The Q30's win there but they could have kept the memory foam like the q20s but just used a different material instead of the faux leather is they were trying to address the issues. maybe the q40s will have it down the road who knows.The factory setting is not as good as the q20s and I hate going back to the app to adjust everything for every song. I still haven't figured out the custom settings in the app and it is what it is. However, once adjusted the Q30's do take off and sound awesome but i just personally don't like changing settings all the time so for now I am just keeping them at factory settings.I like the part where you can put your hand over you right ear and it changes the settings. That's the best feature of these head phones to be honest! Love it ! I play with it sometimes and IDK, I personally like the feature. Overall, soundcore does make good products and i've watched all the youtube videos and read a lot of the reviews and I think the youtube videos are full of crap because I think a lot of what they touched base on was more of a selling point then actual feature but I get the game. If you review the headphones in a positive light and you'll get more views and more request to do more videos. Anyways, the headphones are not bad. They are okay at best and at worst. I think a solid 3 stars is appropriate. If you want to get them go for it but you might need to lower your expectations from what the youtubers are Reddit Forums are saying. They are okay and the case is a nice touch. If you want to save money then go with the Q20's and save $40. If you want the hard case , like me, then just get the q30's because that's the best feature of this product. Case is cool and very sturdy and included with the purchase!*Update,The noise cancellation is non existent. I have to blast the music to shut down the noise. Id say, just get some AirPods Pro's and save your money. Doesn't work well on airplanes either."
"I’ve had these guys for at least 7 months now, and I absolutely loved them when I first got them. They were comfortable, had great sound, connected to my devices easily, were portable, and most importantly, had a pretty good price. The MAIN problem I have with them, is that they are unfortunately not durable. Within the first 3 or 4 months of having them, one side of the headphones cracked in half, and I had to superglue it (I know, “Why don’t you just throw them out and buy a new pair?”, I’m a broke college student.) Then, a few weeks later, it broke, this time chipping off some pieces of the black plastic. Again, superglue, despite the missing pieces. Now, just today, the end—where it had already cracked—completely broke off (randomly! I gave it the slightest tug!) AND the complete other end of the headphone (with the OTHER speaker) cracked in half, just as it had done the first time (mind you—that end was perfectly fine for months!) At this point, I have to buy a new pair of headphones, but it’s ridiculous that this pair couldn’t even last a year. Please make these more durable, because they’re really great headphones in every other way, and I really love them, I just can’t handle constantly having to superglue the pieces together when I haven’t been handling them roughly in any way, shape, or form. The images attached are both the left and right side of the headphones."
"***To clarify I did try getting help for the issue much earlier but the headphones were just out of warranty. The issues started popping up and getting worse a few months into having these, however.So before getting into the problem I wanna say that these ARE a wonderfully well-rounded set.Sound feels actually decently alive for bluetooth standards, like I wouldn't say there's any aspect where these headphones are amazing but I just liked the balance.Now, the issue: about a year into use the noise cancelling started really melting down.Weird popping noises...a weird, metallic tinny noise that has only gotten worse with time.At least ""normal"" mode seems to work right and transparency also sorta still works so not all is lost, though it's a bit awkward as I can't justify getting another pair just  for the NC feature and well that's actually half the reason why I got these to begin with!"
"I love my soundcore motion boom/plus. Love them and soundcore app. So, the Q30 looked like a winner. Great price and reviews, and my previous experience with soundcore has been great. I really want to love these headphones, I was so excited to get them. They are awesome in every way...except, do they size these for basketballs? Seriously, I'm a big guy and I've never had headphones, winter knit hats, or ball caps be too big. These absolutely do sound great, cover my ears nice, and feel very comfortable. Indoors they hugged my head okay but not snug. Certainly not snug enough for exercising or working out. But, I bought these mostly to wear while on my loud tractors mowing and plowing snow. The noise cancelling feature sealed the deal. I had chores outside and repairs to do on my truck, so I put them on and went outside. Now, it's pretty cold here in January, so it was nice to have tunes and my ears covered. But, once outside in the cold I was constantly sliding them back in place because they're not snug enough. The headband doesn't have enough tension, I cannot imagine smaller guys or women not having issues with these slipping off their head, also. When leaning over my truck engine they would almost fall off if not for grabbing them. I think they have less tension in the cold because I was constantly repositioning them while outside. Very frustrating. They do sound great, super bass, the app just dials your preferences in, and battery life is incredible. The noise cancellation worked great outside, it was very windy and my air compressor is very loud. Both were drowned out well. The transparency mode is nice and works better than expected. The noise cancellation does not do nearly as well with voices on indoor mode. With noise cancellation on any setting, it doesn't work well blocking people talking, like TV background or I suppose an office or similar environment. It just wasn't very good at that. I was surprised because if worked so well at wind and much louder compressor noise. Inside my aquariums and heat register noises virtually disappeared. I haven't worn then using my tractors yet, but honestly I worry they'd fall off if I tilted my head down and I'd drive over them. The control buttons aren't as intuitive as I'd like, but I guess more time wearing them this really wouldn't be an issue. Phones calls worked great, also. People I spoke to while wearing these said I was clear and sounded good. The hard case is nice, not available with the Q20/20+ or Q10 models. I'm not sure if I got a pair with a bad headband or if anker makes these specifically for melonheads and volleyballs. Most people don't have a bigger noggin than I do. They definitely got more loose in the cold. So, i am concerned how much metal, if any, is in the headband, and how durable the plastic will be, especially in the cold. I really want to love these and they have features not found in other headphones that don't cost hundreds. Returning these will be a difficult decision because they dound great, their price, features, and soundcore's reputation. But, if they won't stay snug on my head what's the point, right? Real bummed, I spent so many hours deciding on these. If soundcore sees this and believes a different set will stay put like they should I'd be very happy. I'll update this review if that happens because I  won't find another over ear anc headphone in this price with these features. Now with that said, if you're looking for portable BT speakers that play LOUD with SUPER bass and forever battery, buy their moton boom, or get the smaller motion plus for indoors. Both awesome, you will not regret that."
"For the money, you can't beat these headphones. The sound is great and the battery on these last forever.- Type C charging- button controls on right side- noise canceling works great. I don't use any other setting.- hardcase is nice but feels like a puzzle sometimes.- comfortableThe reason for 3 stars is mainly the ear cup on the left side is ripped and the foam is starting to pop out. I use these everyday so they do take a beating but I was expecting a little longer than a year of use.The only other thing that annoys me is the touch sensitive ""button"" for transparency mode. I don't use transparent mode that much to need it and gets to be a hassle.I'd buy another pair for this price."
"Other reviewers have praised the same things I love about this headset; the thing that I love the most is the battery life and charge speed. Coming from Anker this isn't surprising, but these things can go all day, let you play music all night when you fall asleep with them on, then still have power for the next day.The audio may sound off if you're an audiophile kind of person, but if that's enough to bother you then you should already know how to apply an equalizer (per app is best for me; my music app applies one equalizer, a different one for podcasts. The included app is okay but applies profiles to all sound from your phone.) If you WANT to drop into thicc bass land for a little trap or dubstep you have that ability, but for most applications I find myself cutting a little bass.Now lets talk about why you should be SURE these are the headphones you want before buying them.Do you wear glasses? Be careful.As I mentioned, these are comfortable enough to sleep in. But once you put your glasses on two things happen: first, you break the noise canceling seal. My frames aren't huge or thick in any way, but the noise canceling is significantly worse when I'm wearing my glasses. Second: they'll squeeze the frames into your head. I don't know what it is about this design, but my Bose and Astro headsets don't suffer from it. It was tight enough to give me a headache after a few hours. Does that mean the headset at least won't slide around on your head? No. I still wear a hat to keep it in place.Do you tilt your head? Be careful.Another review mentioned that the voice when changing modes is robotic and jarring and that's pretty accurate. Switching between modes means losing your audio for a second and a half and suddenly getting a full volume robot woman announcing ""TRANSPARENCY"" ""NOISE CANCELLING"" in the middle of your podcast you're trying to focus in on. Furthermore, while wearing a t-shirt (or none), making contact between the right earcup and your shoulder will also change modes. This might be a plus for some people but it only serves to annoy me.Do you intend to use these with multiple devices? Be careful.A big selling point on these was the idea of using it with my phone and computer seamlessly to hand audio off when I step away from my desk. What I got was a hacky, frustrating guessing game of what the headphones FEEL like doing. For instance, if paired to my Windows 10 computer, in order to play audio from my phone, I have to change the output device on the computer to something else and ensure nothing is playing audio to the headset. And that's IF I was able to connect it to both devices. It seems like I HAVE to power everything on, then explicitly connect with my phone, then my computer. Of course, half the time the headset automatically connects to my computer first and requires me to go into the settings to disconnect it before I can connect with my phone.This feature basically doesn't exist. Don't count on it working and let yourself be surprised when it does.I've been in contact with customer support and was told this is all intended behavior and some of it may be addressed in future firmware updates, so it's not a faulty model. I've had these and used them daily for about the last two months and while I obviously didn't return them, I wish I had spent more up front for a better product.Edit: with the release of firmware 2.1 for these headsets the voice is now quieter. Now I notice exactly how long it cuts audio to talk for no reason. Pause your podcast before switching modes. Some gentle beeps with the audio changing would be ideal; this trend of speakers using heavily compressed voices needs to go on mute."
"These sound great, a 5-star in my opinion, but the noise cancelling is just a 3-star at best in my opinion. But here are the things that earn these cans an overall 2-star rating.First, they are designed horribly! Obviously nobody at Anker Life tried using these while lying back on a pillow or with their arms up & their hands behind their head. If they had they would have realized in a few short moments just how easy it is to accidentally press the buttons on the back edge of each ear ""can"" with the pillow or their hands, especially if they turn their head even slightly. The only solution is to turn them around so the left can is on the right ear & the right can is on the left ear - of course all stereo-tuned movies & tv shows will be ruined because sounds that are coming from the left side of the show will play in your right ear & sounds from the right will play in your left ear! That is a terrible option & payoff when you want to lie back & chill to your tunes or tv so minus one star.The next design flaw is the 'touch the right for two seconds' feature to change between normal/noise cancelling & transparancy. That has the exact same issue as the buttons on the back of the cans because every time you're lying back & need to turn your head to the right your pillow covers the right can & two seconds later it changes your noise cancelling settings! Same thing if you leave your hands behind your head as you look to the right for a few seconds - or it happens if you are wearing them backwards so none of the buttons are being pressed & you look to the left for a few seconds. Trust me, it happens waaay more often than you might think it will & it become infuriating very quickly - so minus a second star.Third is the most disappointing design flaw I've experienced with any pair of cans I've owned in years: they won't work while charging! My last three pair of cans I've owned over the last decade ALL still played WHILE they were charging - even the four pairs I've returned because they sounded like absolute garbage still worked while charging! It's lucky these charge in 5 minutes for roughly 4 hours of play time or I would have given these only one star before returning them! As it is I've still had them run out too many times during a long day of writing while zoning to my tunes & NOTHING ruins my train of thought or writing sesh more than my headphones interrupting by saying, ""Battery Low"", every minute even though they could probably keep playing more than fifteen minutes longer which was the longest I could ever take hearing them tell me the battery was low over & over every freaking minute! These are the most bone-headed design flaws I've ever seen & because there was no mention of them being forcably off while charging anywhere before or after buying them or mentioning the horribly annoying battery off announcement even single minute before buying them I nearly gave them a one-star rating here. But instead I'm only giving them their third star off.So you might ask why did I give them two stars? First is the app that allows you to change the EQ between something like twenty presets or to your own custom EQ settings. That's definitely a huge sound plus especially for the greatly improved bass compared to the bass setting out of the box so the app is a must & is worth one star.Next is the bluetooth functionally. I can go anywhere on the same floor of my house as the device they are paired with & to many points one floor up or down without losing any sound or sound quality at all! I can literally be at complete opposite ends of my home from my paired device on the same floor & the connection stays solid - & my house is a fairly decent sized dwelling. They pair with two devices with ease & then dump one to connect to a third like butter! That's great when you've got it BTed to your phone for controlling with the app as well as BTed to your TV, then you wanna jump onto say, your computer for some gaming & need to BT to it while keeping it BTed to your phone. It's easy-peasy, so yeah, the excellent Bluetooth capabilities earn it a second star in my book.In quick conclusion: three stars off for terribly bone-headed design flaws that will really disappoint if not ruin your listening experience versus two stars for an EQ app & great BT? That adds up to finding another pair of cans to buy in my opinion because I honestly wish I had bought the other pair I was looking at instead of these.I hope these opinions of mine help."
"I have had almost exactly two years of using these at work, M-F daily, 4-8 hours, in an open office. to give them fair credit they sounded fine, noise cancelling was better than listening to an open office, but no where near as good as my BOSE QC35.  You can still hear people and talking in the background, and traffic, but if you turn the volume up a fair bit you can cut that noise (outside of a 20' range) out and just hear music. Positive -that  works out because when your colleagues call you over the desk, even with a little bit of music you can still hear and respond them, Negative - if one of your colleagues are having a meeting within 10' you can hear every word without turning the music volume up quite high, on that note the noise cancelling is mediocre.  but better than an open office - JUST.noise cancelling: 60%.  not in the same league as the big players, but its o.k for $60.  battery:  90%  they have a good battery life, more than adequate for 8hrs listening daily.comfort:  70%  tend to clamp a little bit hard on the head for prolonged use, but are very light. When i first started using i would be sore after a days use, but they broke in after a year.Durability: 65%  after 19 months the skin came unglued from the foam pad, as pictured.functionality: 50%  after 20 months the left ear speaker has dramatically reduced volume shifting the listening balance to my right ear.Overall- you get what you pay for, these are not no where near as good in quality or product life as the big players,  I have had my bose QC35 for 5+years still functioning perfect except for the ear pads which need replacement every now and then.  anyone that has reviewed these inside of 2 years is reviewing too quickly.  these are mediocre at best and faults develop.would i buy again? probably not , for open office I will invest in a new pair of higher quality headphones to cut more meeting noise out, it will be worth the money both in quality and durability.how ever, if you are not wanting to spend more than $60 these might 'get you by'"
"I admit to not wanting to spend a hot fortune on some decent noise canceling BT headphones (former owner of the OG Bose pink travel 'phones that lasted 8 years RIP) but this is definitely a case of you get what you pay for. Sound quality is ""meh"" and comes nowhere near my earbuds. And using them with a PC is typically terrible (not the fault of the manufacturer but definitely a PC bluetooth issue); Apple devices works fine but the sound quality is still not great. My biggest issue is the overall build quality. It’s quite cheap feeling, which you notice right out of the box, specifically around the ear pieces, which are made of insubstantial plastic. The metal headpiece is decent but again, the general materials feel subpar. I'm comparing them to higher end 'phones that I have (LogiG, SteelSeries, Audio-Technica) so that's probably unfair, but I did hope that they would be just slightly better quality than they are; especially at the initial price point of $85.99. Makes sense that they're dropping the price to $61. Even so, that's not a small chunk of change for a noise canceling headset and I'd hope to get something of more substantial quality for that. YMMV."
"Follow up review:  Look at the photo.  The fabric that holds the foam ear cushions failed completely.  It's not repairable.  The fabric started tearing more than a year ago.  Bit by bit , the tear grew until it got to the condition you see in the photo.  The headphones are completely unusable now.This isn't acceptable.  Fabric doesn't cost a lot.  They should use a better quality fabric that will last longer.  This is no longer a set of headphones.  It is now a piece of electronic waste - because of Anker using the cheapest fabric they could find.My original review is below the dashed line----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The main reason I bought the Life Q30 headphones is to listen to the TV news each evening while I'm preparing and eating dinner.  The TV is in the living room, and the kitchen/dining area is around a corner from the TV in the living room.  I had to turn the TV volume up pretty loud so I can hear it in the kitchen over the noise of the stove fan, the microwave oven, etc.After repeated complaints from my wife and daughter about how loud the TV was, I started using a pair of bluetooth ear buds that I bought a couple of years ago for less than $20 - pretty cheap, but they worked OK.  Instead of blasting the TV, I heard it through the earbuds.  They are a bit on the quiet side - and the don't have noise cancelling.  So I decided that I would splurge on a better quality over-the-ear headset for listening to the evening news while making/eating dinner, and I bought the Life Q30s.I have used them in the kitchen and also connected to my phone and my computer for phone calls and Zoom calls.  Here is what I have experienced:Pros:•  Sound quality is good, especially for this price point.  Bass is a bit too strong for me on the default settings but...•  The phone app lets you adjust the equalizer.  I set it to Flat, which reduced the bass and it sounds better.  I think the UI of the app could be less cluttered and a bit more intuitive, but it's not terrible.•  It's comfortable.  I have a pretty big head.  The longest I have worn the Q30 for a single stretch is about 90 minutes.  During that period, I'm aware that the earphones are pressing on my ears with a bit of pressure, but it's not bad.  The ear cups are big and soft - and any over-the-ear headphones need to put pressure on your ears to stay on your head and make a tight acoustic seal.•  Noise cancellation is good.  With NC set to ""Indoor"" mode, it is very effective at cancelling out the stove fan noise in the kitchen and the noise of cars outside my window during Zoom calls.  I'm very happy with the noise cancellation.•  Microphone quality is good.  People hear me loud and clear on Zoom calls.Cons:•  Every time you change modes (for example if you switch the noise cancellation mode, or turn transparency on and off), a voice that is much louder than it needs to be announces the change you just made.  It's pretty jarring.  I recommend a firmware change that let's you set the volume of that voice, or turn it off altogether if you don't want it.  I would turn it off if I could.  When you change modes, the difference in audio quality is very apparent, which is plenty of indication to you that you've changed modes.  You really don't need a loud voice telling you what you just did.•  When you turn on Transparency mode, the microphone pics up your voice and plays your voice back to you through the earphones.  It's pretty unnerving.  Maybe they had to make the microphones active in Transparency mode to achieve the Transparency effect, but I really wish there were a way to not have my voice play back to me.  I have stopped using Transparency mode because of this.  (I just ask my wife to speak louder!)•  Microwave oven interference.  When the microwave is humming, the Q30s start clicking.  The closer I am to the microwave, the more they click.  The $20 earbuds had much less interference from the microwave oven than the Q30 does.  So there must be a way to design headphones to be less susceptible to microwave noise.So, these aren't perfect, but overall I'm happy with them.  I will continue to use them.  And I really hope there will be a firmware update soon that lets me reduce or eliminate the voice that announces to me every time I change modes of operation.  If that ever happens, this review will change to 4 stars!And if they can modify Transparency mode so that you don't hear your own voice playing back directly into your ears, I would change my review to 5 stars!!!"
"I bought these as my first noise cancelling headphones in early February. I was initially drawn to these because of their lower price, and the people that wrote reviews for this seemed to really enjoy them.I don't know if there was something wrong with these specific headphones in the first place, or if this is a general problem for all headphones of this model, but after the first month, I started having connectivity issues, where the connection would randomly drop out. As time passed, more issues arose; buttons wouldn't work properly, modes would switch without me touching the button, and connectivity problems got worse. I've been treating these headphones very gently, being careful to not drop them or anything, not letting them get wet, etc., so I don't understand why these things would start happening. About three months after I bought these, I stopped using them. (Elaboration below)Button issues:Holding the volume up or down button for one second wasn't always guaranteed to switch tracks, it would sometimes just change the volume.Holding the power button for three seconds wouldn't always turn the headphones off/on, which I found annoying when someone tried to speak to me and I would miss what they said/need them to repeat it.Buttons just straight-up wouldn't work at times as well.Mode switching issue:I'd set the headphone's down (not on the side with the buttons) while they were on noise cancelling mode, and when I picked them back up, they'd be in transparency mode, which was a shock every time.Whenever I tried to adjust volume with my left hand instead of my right, it caused the headphones to switch back from noise cancelling mode into transparency mode. I know this doesn't seem to make any sense, but I'm guessing that there's some kind of wiring issue where the slight twisting motion caused whatever mechanism that switches modes to activate. Except, I didn't think that the modes were supposed to be able to cycle backwards, unless you were using the app.As someone who has sensory issues, having the world suddenly blasted in your ears, especially when all you need is quiet, is really not fun. This mode switching issue has also happened while I was running the air compressor in our dive locker, and if anyone knows how loud a compressor is, imagine having your headphones suddenly blast that noise into your ears. (For anyone else, the best comparison I can make is if you decided to put your ear right next to a large lawn mower engine, and then make it about five times louder).Connectivity issues:I'd turn the headphones on, and they'd refuse to connect to my phone, or they wouldn't automatically connect to my phone. This may have been user error on my part though, I don't know.Randomly dropping connection was another issue. I'd be walking to class and suddenly my music would stop, and when I checked my phone, it said my headphones were no longer connected. Then I'd have to turn them off and back on again, which was annoying because of the issues mentioned previously.Other comments: (positive first, then negative)Comfort level: actually very comfortable, I really like the ear cups (very squishy and comfortable), and the headband is pretty flexible, so the headphones don't squeeze my head even after wearing them for long periods of time. They're also not too bulky, and I could put string bag and purse straps over my head and across my body without having them catch on the headphonesButton organization: easy to find and distinguish from one another, I like how they're spaced out so you don't accidentally press one button instead of another. I also like how the play/pause button is not in between the volume button, so it's not a guessing game of will I change the volume or will I press play/pauseOverall sound quality: pretty good, not the best, but the other headphones I'm comparing these to were much more expensive (I'd look at other reviews if you want better descriptions on sound quality)Noise cancelling quality: decent, it does the job, but again, there's better. I did enjoy that there were multiple modes of noise cancelling, so I would be able to change how much I could cancel out.Mode switching: I wish I didn't have to pass through transparency mode every time I wanted to get to noise cancelling mode, I know you can just switch directly to it if you use the app, but again, annoyingI'm giving these an overall two stars because I don't know if these were just problems specific to my headphones or if anyone else is having these issues, but I did find them really comfortable to wear and I liked the button arrangement."
"Summary: Has a good sound & battery life but noise cancelling mode only muffles, transparency mode has issues, and they have a poor user design experience across the board. They’re not bad for the price point, but I probably wouldn’t repurchase.Pros:- Comfortable- Good sound- Excellent battery life- No connectivity issues- Switches between multiple devices easily- Easy to adjust to your headCons:- Noise cancelling mode is certainly not noise cancelling, but it does muffle a lot. Not bad for the price point, but not accurately advertised- Transparency mode has a weird whooshing sound- L/R symbols poorly placed. The L/R symbols are inside of the ear pieces, so you don’t really see them unless you go out of your way to check.  Putting them on the right way matters a lot since each side has different controls. I wish there was a tactile or at least more obvious externally visible way to distinguish between the left and right side. I want to be able to put them on without having to thinking about it. I also want to be able to put them on the right way in the dark.- Their tap to switch to transparency feature isn’t well designed. The feature is supposed to make it quick and convenient to hear someone talking to you, but I don’t think they fully followed through on that logic since switching to transparency mode via tap does not also pause what you’re listening. That kind of defeats the point of the feature in my opinion. Might as well take your headphones all the way off at that point.- The tap to switch to transparency feature is SO easy to accidentally activate when you’re just adjusting your headphones/taking them on or off. The placement wasn’t well thought through.- They have 5 rectangle buttons that all feel essentially the same, so it can be hard to keep straight which button does what. I would have loved to see some of the buttons be different shapes to help further distinguish them from each other.- I wish there was some kind of visible cue when they power on/off. Something like a brief light flash that is common in so many devices like these. The only way to confirm that you held the button long enough for it to actually turn off is by putting them back on to listen."
"Used these for both work and pleasure.  Plastic is cheap quality.  Bought in August, the are broke easily from normal use.  Also had lots of connection probelms with my laptop.  I would have to reboot the computer just to get them to stay connected during meetings.  They would be fully charged and would drop during Zoom calls.The noise canceling was good. But leaving on a trip tommorrow and now have no headphones for the trip. When they worked, they worked well, but seem to be more of a hassle than with easier use."
"I thought I could use these headphones as a gaming headset, but the mic stops working every time I plug in the aux cable.Aux is plug-in from the right side, which means the cable tickles my right arm every time I am playing the video game while holding the mouse. Also, the aux cable is too short, I have to buy another one for this.Decent Noise Cancelling, is better than Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, although it's still far from perfect, and I don't think it's active noise canceling, but rather physically blocking the sound outside. However, the noise canceling is not strong enough to block out my roommate's screaming, which is why I bought these headphones with active noise canceling.The neck gets sore and the ear gets hot after wearing it for hours, uncomfortable when wearing it while lying down on the pillow. Moreover, every time I adjust the headphones, I accidentally switch the mode and hear it say loudly ""Transparency  mode"""
"First of all, my review might not be fair so please read this with a grain of salt. I do consider myself an ""audiophile"" which frankly isn't a status symbol of my knowledge on audio, it's simply that I have hole in my pockets from spending on audio gear. I do own several high end TOTL IEMs and Headphones from the likes of Empire Ears, Unique Melody, Meze, Hifiman and Audeze, but I am also trying to be as fair as possible in my review here as I can't compare any of these brands to Soundcore. But on the other hand, I do other ""consumer"" headphones from Sony and JBL, so I'm trying to frame this review around that as a comparison.I was looking for something simple that I can occasionally take with me to the gym, for walks, at an airplane, etc., where I wouldn't be absolutely paranoid about dropping, scratching or breaking them in the process. From the reviews, seemed like a no brainer, but unfortunately after receiving them it was a bit of a disappointment.On the build quality... Plastic""ky"" is the best word to describe these. They feel brittle like its one drop and done, $79 bucks down the drain. The controls on the headphone are also very cheap and finnicky. Even putting them in the case makes me nervous as it crackles just by folding them together. On that note, the case is just way too small, some wiggle room would be nice to make sure there isn't so much pressure on the frame when closing the case.The app is decent, Bluetooth connection is solid just note that it maxes out at AAC so you don't get LDAC (not expected at this price point), but overall solid connection with no issues.Now to the sound. Simply put, EQ can't fix how broken the sound is. Everything sounds muddled up, and when I say everything, it seems like it's the entire frequency range, and not matter how much you cut either the bass or high frequencies it seems like everything is just blended together with very little instrument separation. I tried everything including going to the extreme of building custom profiles in Squig.link against the Harman target and loading them up in Wavelet (Android app) and there's no way to fix it. The only plus to the sound is that it's loud and rarely clips - even with EQ profiles in the +7 to +10 db range for certain frequencies which didn't require any global negative gain adjustments.So to wrap this up, how do these compare to other consumer headsets I own? It can't hold a candle to Sony WH1000XM5 in either sound quality or ANC, but that's still a $400 USD headphone. Now if I compare these with something within a similar price range like the JBL Live 660NC that goes for $99... Unfortunately the Soundcore Q30 can't compete with the exception of ANC, which I think is on par with the 660NC if not slightly better. But in terms of sound quality for an extra $20 it's the 660NC any day of the week, with a much better build quality (sturdy frame, solid build, feels ""premium"") and much better sound quality that is extremely responsive to EQ, with a strong bass that can ""rumble"" if pushed, without muddying the entire mix."
"I had these headphones for about two months and I love them. Fully charged them one time since I had them and use them almost every day at the gym. Great noise, cancellation. The color is cute, but it gets a little dirty lightweight. But the Bluetooth connectivity and mic quality suck. The headphones completely stopped working and now I won’t connect to my phone at all and yes, I have deleted it from my Bluetooth and tried to add back several times."
"I bought these to provide noise cancellation for when I do woodworking in my garage.  The dust collection systems and various tools can be pretty loud.  I've been using shooting ear protectors, which are rated at -37db.  These headphones are no better, and I tried all 3 modes.  The only advantages to them are that I can still hear my music while attenuating the noise, and turn noise cancellation on and off at the touch of a button."
"I loved these headphones and have been using them for about six months. I take good care of them, and have had zero complaints until a little piece of the plastic suddenly fell off today, leaving this big crack. Obviously you're not paying as much for these headphones as some of the high-end, $300++ headphones out there, but I figured I'd at least get a year out of them. They've been really nice, but I guess the material is pretty cheap."
"This is the 1st ANC headphone I've owned and I've been somewhat disappointed with them. The main reason I bought these was because of noisy neighbors and barking dogs from 10pm on. From reading reviews here and other sites I knew that for the price to not expect a miracle but in ANC mode I can very clearly hear the neighbors talking; the barking from the dogs is ever so slightly muffled. And that is with the volume of whatever I'm listening to turned way up.Other issues that make no sense or are annoying concern the headphones, case, and app.1) The headphones apparently don't have an auto-off feature. I've fallen asleep while listening to music and waking up hours after the music has stopped the headphones are still on. I know this because if I turn the music back on it comes through on the headphones. I don't know how much this drains the battery; I assume no signal means no speaker movement, so little battery drain. But if ANC is on then the headphones keep processing any exterior sounds.2) The feature for turning on transparency mode by touching the right ear cup is ridiculous in that it cannot be shut off. You have no idea how many times transparency mode has been turned on because my arm touches the cup when I want to rest my arm over my head when reclining, or reached over to scratch the left side of my head with my right hand.3) The ear cups get unbelievably hot if wearing for more than a half hour. Maybe provide an optional set of gel-filled cups for users in tropical climes.4) The battery indicator, whether it be the voice when the headphones are turned on or the app icon, does not adequately relate to either a percentage or estimated time remaining. Battery ""medium"" means nothing when I hear it over several uses. Medium could mean minutes away from low which gives a false sense of usage remaining.5) When the headphones are turned on there is nothing indicating they are connected to anything. My old headphones would say ""Bluetooth connected successfully."" I've turned on music on my tablet, not realizing the Bluetooth had been shut off, and woken my wife when music started blasting out the speakers. I had assumed the headphones had connected; verbal confirmation would have been nice.6) I wish the drawstring bag with the cables was instead a pouch attached to the underside of the case cover. They'd be less chance of a lost bag of cables or damn drawstrings constantly getting caught in the zipper.7) The 1st time I tried putting the headphones back in the case I was unsure how they went. I realized after almost a week I was putting them in wrong and easily could have ended up with broken headphones. Instructions on this? None.8) The app is entirely useless for users with less than perfect eyesight. Even with all the empty space available the developers see fit to make icons and text so small that a magnifying glass is needed. The icons on the sounds for creating your own ambient ""white noise"" in most cases make no sense. I also can't figure out why some sounds, like a person chewing food, are even there when there are plenty of other natural sounds that could be used, e.g., tree frogs, cicadas, shore birds, channel buoys, etc.The sound quality is nice with a somewhat effective bass boost. But to me the extra money for ANC could have been saved by getting a just-as-effective pair of passive NC headphones."
"I've been a longtime user of the Anker (now Soundcore) Q20 headphones, which I considered to be the perfect blend of price and performance in the realm of noise cancelling wireless over the ear headphones.  I've liked them so much that I've bought several pairs for family members over the years and everyone's always been happy.  So, when my current pair began to show signs of old age (split ear cushion, a battery that doesn't last as long as normal) I decided to purchase these newer Soundcore Q30 headphones as an updated, upgraded replacement.Unfortunately, they're a rare disappointment from this Anker sub-brand.  Whereas the Q20s punched way above their weight class — with noise cancelling and overall sound quality that was shockingly close to the high end products from Bose and Sony — these seem like they would be better suited at a price half of what they're charging.The main attraction to these kinds of headphones, the noise cancelling part, is the biggest letdown.  Despite now offering three different modes (indoor, outdoor, and transport), none of them come anywhere close to the abilities of the one mode on those old Q20s.The second biggest issue, for me, was comfort. The headband is thinner and has less padding than competing headphones.  The earcups are also thinner and lighter, so they don't seal out exterior noise nearly as well as the Q20s do.  Despite being lighter than the older model, they put pressure points on the top of my head and on my ears that made them uncomfortable to wear for more than a half hour.  This lightness also meant they slid around if I turned my head side to side, which caused a lot of noise in noise cancelling mode.I could mitigate the poor noise cancelling performance a little by gently pressing the earcups against my head, but that just made them even more uncomfortable.  This is not an issue with the older, heavier and more padded Q20s.That's not to say that these are all bad, however.  If you mostly listen to music, the addition of multiple EQ modes accessible through the Soundcore app is a welcome way to tweak the sound to your preference.  The ambient sound mode that can be activated by tapping the right earcup is a nice little bonus at this price point, and other than an annoying vocal interruption to the music, it works well.  These headphones will play for hours even with noise cancelling active, and charge over USB-C.  Also, the three noise cancelling modes really do behave differently depending on your needs, it's just none of them work well enough to be useful.Sadly, those few good points are just not enough to overcome the poor noise isolation/cancelling, poor fit and poor comfort issues I experienced.  So, back to my old Q20s I go.One other good thing I will say not specific to these headphones, but to Anker in general is their great customer service.  When I first paired these headphones to my devices, the audio quality was weirdly bad and their support helped me ""factory reset"" them, which fixed the odd hollow sound they had.  And they also sent me free replacement earcups for the old Q20s so I can eke out a few more months of life from them.  So a big thumbs up to Anker customer support, but a big thumbs down to this rare disappointment from their audio brand."
"I’ve owned (and loved) the Soundcore Life Q20’s for several years now. Thought I’d upgrade to Soundcore’s Q30’s for better noise cancellation! And indeed they are awesome at noise cancelling (and battery life!!). HOWEVER, they are also a LOT less comfortable on the ears compared to the Q20. Should not be a trade off between comfort and tight-fitting noise cancellation."
"Finally a product that I felt extremely obligated to leave a review about! As a lifetime audiophile (musician and producer) on a budget, that just wanted some over the ear wireless headphones for occasional times I wanted the freedom to listen to music while tasking where I didn't need to worry about a cord catching on things, but am absolutely not willing to sacrifice sound quality, I was extremely impressed with these. I have owned a variety of amazing headphones over the years spanning a variety of price points from reputable brand names for different purposes (DJing, studio mastering, general listening) and these held up to my high standards. I also spent months shopping around for over the ear BT headphones before I finally purchased these, which included testing as many demos as I could access, as well as purchasing and returning some brand name sets that met my spec requirements and stayed in my budget that ended up being complete disappointments.I was stoked when I found these from doing even more extensive research online and lots of time spent reading reviews. I've even been recommending them to loads of people over the past 10 months since I've purchased a long with a window of time for me to gather experience with using them.I would rate 5 stars if it weren't for the flimsyness of the design and material these are made out of, which I wouldn't expect to hold up to heavy usage over a year's time, but I'm extremely disappointed these already have a HUGE stress crack considering I honestly have not used these a whole lot. (I'm a single mom single handedly raising a child, so I don't have the luxury of being able to listen to music in noise cancelling headphones rarely ever. They've mostly been worn in the summer when I'm gardening. My opportunities that I am able to have my hearing blocked out by music are all used up for producing music and practicing my instruments, which I have completely different playback gear for)Like, if I had to estimate my usage of these thus far measured by how many times I've killed the battery and had to recharge, I think I've charged them no more than 10 times since I got they brand new, and I've ONLY ever used them wirelessly.On that note, the battery life is extremely impressive. I'm just extremely bummed I already have to deal with a broken pair of headphones, when I previously had nothing but amazing things to say about them, cause I can't afford to replace these and shouldn't have to when it hasn't even been a year and I've been trying to take extra care when handling these because of how flimsy they felt right away. I definitely regret not adding on the protection plan, but every single other pair of headphones and earbuds I own I have had for an average of 7 years with no damage, even less expensive pairs. (like, I STILL use all my other headphones that are that old)Sound quality blows every other pair of WIRELESS over the ear headphones out of the water at this price point though. Too bad durability was compromised."
"These are great headphones overall. The battery life is amazing, the sound quality is pretty good, and they fit entirely, and comfortably, over my small ears.The only nagging issue is the touch sensitivity on the right ear cup. Even the slightest touch will change the sound mode and it happens constantly. Even leaning your head on your shoulder will trigger it. It's extremely annoying and there's no way to turn that feature off. I had to disassemble the right cup and remove the cable that connects to the motherboard. There's a tutorial online on how to do it properly. After that, no more issues with it.But I would still highly recommend these headphones nonetheless."
"Love the sound, noise cancelling, fit, comfort, and look off these headphones. However, after just 2 years of very light use at my desk at home the thin vinyl fabric that covers the padding of the left ear has split at the seam so that the foam shows. It's not visible while I'm wearing them but it's still disappointing and reminds me of the cheap headphones that came with walkman cassette playerrs that this would inevitably happen to. Sadly I don't see a way to repair it without gluing my fingers together.  I guess to keep the price down they are going to cut corners somewhere but 2 starts removed because they cheaped out."
I have been using these headphones for more than a year and have never had a problem with the sound quality. They are super poorly made though. Both sides of the headphones have cracked and I have to have them taped up to be usable.
"The box it came in was stained, slightly damaged and sticky for some reason. Other than that it was a pretty good purchase. Colour is just as pretty as the pictures. It’s light and comfortable to wear and the Bluetooth connection was super easy."
"[10 month / ~3 month Update]I gotta lower my rating to a three. I mean, I'd be upsetti spaghetti and put One-Star. But like. I feel like that's reserved for Actively Hating something. And I don't. I love these headphones. They've been a real game changer in how I listen to music and create a personal space. The first pair, the left side just Stopped working three months in. BUT- as you may read below, they were really good about taking care of me and sent me a new pair no problem.My Second pair now, after like 5 or so months? has started pausing every 5 seconds which really puts a damper on music, yanno? So like? I'm not.. MAD or anything I spent $60 almost a year ago, the headphones showed me a good time! But now they're kaput for tunes. Hopefully they still function with my switch/computer as pc headphones. :)I think I'm still within the warranty period, but I don't want to sound like I'm trying to weasel them outta anything so I'll just enjoy my music some other way? S'all good. I still think Anker stuff is pretty good for folks like me who can't afford fanciful things.[Post Customer Service Update]I decided to keep trying to make them work to no avail, but saw Anker provides an 18 month warranty! So I reached out with all the details to their customer service email and within two days! BOOM! They're sending a new set. :) Very happy! And still set on buying a pair for my wife! pobody's nerfect! But these headphones are great![3.5 Month Update]These were great and perfect~! Until last night. They were working fine until I put them to charge for a little bit and the right ear stopped working. The buttons on it still work, and I have to use it 'cos it's all I have now. BUT. Yeah, kinda sucks that randomly after taking care of them for this time that they stop working due to... charging the battery? :( Sad times.  from 5/5 to 3/5 'cos I feel bad doing lower.[Update]So I wore these on a trip across the globe. The noise cancelling function did WONDERS on the plane to drown out the engine and people sounds. It helps when I'm in public spaces, because it cuts down on sensory overload. :) BUT. I was on my trip for 14 days and I didn't need to charge them once. I used them for NC on the plane, with earbuds under them for watching movies. Absolutely worth the price! I'm getting a pair for my fiancee! :)[Original]They not only fit my massive head, but aren't MAX EXTENDED to do it!! There's room to spare!I can blast music and no one else can hear it until i take them off.This is my first intro to noise cancelation and it is really an incredible thing!Uhhhhh... They're good headphones man. Battery life is incredible. I didn't download the app.Aaand it works almost simultaneously on laptop and phone. Though it does bug out a lil. But no biggie to do one at a time. :)"
"My skull candy headphones had broken down and I wasn’t looking for something too special, just a tiny bit of an upgrade. Instead, I fear I might have downgraded in the process.I will say that I’m not an audiophile or anything. I don’t know what a high or low is and I’ll probably never know. Either way, the sound quality in these headphones are truly mediocre. You're not getting anything mind-blowing unless you use the equalizer in the app, and even then, it’s only slightly better than the dingy headphones that high school classrooms had passed around in computer labs. If you’re looking for some bass, definitely do not buy these.This is my first time getting noise cancelling headphones, and I did like how it reduced some of the surrounding noises around me. If you’re using these in the park, it’ll mute out sounds like bugs buzzing and maybe even the engine of a car. Not anything major but it is still a noticeable absence. That being said, I don’t see the point of the transparency mode. Furthermore, it is absolutely infuriating that I can’t switch off the settings for changing ANC modes by holding the right side for a single second. This makes it annoying to use if you prop your head up with your hand. Don’t even try lying on your side with these headphones on. You’ll grow tired of that electronic voice saying “Noise Cancellation Mode” and “Transparency Mode” very quickly.I won’t say I’m the biggest judge in comfort. As long as they fit in my ears, I’m pretty fine with using them. These had a good fit and I didn’t find any problems with it slipping against my head. I will say that the material of the ear pads are similar to those leather couches you would easily peel. Its been about two weeks though and there hasn’t been any damage.Battery life is astonishing. It’s been three days without charging and the battery decreased slightly from high to medium. With the type-C charging, it only takes about an hour to charge them back up.Of course, I would be fine with these headphones if not for the fact that they leak sound. It only takes two volume notches before everyone on campus can hear exactly what music library you listen to. As someone that likes to listen to music in the library, it makes it 1) embarrassing, but 2) completely inappropriate to bring seeing as even playing music in low volumes would still have some sound leaking. My friend has the same headphones and I confirmed it also has the same problem so go figures.If it weren’t for the sound leaking, I would have probably been too lazy to return these. But my irritation is much too high. If you’re using these at home and mostly sitting up on your desk, then these are fine. For me, however, I can’t justify paying $80 for these. I’ll rather take my business elsewhere."
The sound quality is good. Noise cancelling is ok.  Using this for music and movies is good.The microphone is not good. It does not do well for gaming or phone calls
"have had these a year and padding is starting to rip. The sound also leaks, so if you're in a quiet office, people will be able to hear your music."
"I first purchased this product in September of 2023. I won’t lie I’ve gotten 2 pairs of Q30s. The first pair were defective and Amazon did a good job of replacing them so kudos for that. Once I finally got a working pair I loved them. For context I’m a college student I take the bus or scooter to campus a lot. I would also work out in them. I loved these headphones, I loved the app, I loved the customization they were good headphones in my opinion but I’m no audiophile or anything. As long as I could block out the loud rumbling of the bus and the people at the library,  for 80 bucks I was really happy. But then a few months in my headphones would have random and sudden spikes of sound to the point it was painful. For example I would pause my music to send a text or stop listening to talk to someone and when I would play my music again the volume had turned up to the max and I had to quickly turn it down. Crazy thing is when I would click the volume down button the volume quickly went back to the initial volume. I usually listen to music at about 40-50% sometimes a little louder or lower depending on the day. I tried to troubleshoot it but nothing worked. So I had decided to get new ones and suddenly the seam on the left earmuff ripped so it might’ve been a sign lol. Anyways I got some soundcore Space Ones and they’re very nice hopefully I won’t have the same problem with these lol. Anyways hopefully mines were just defective (again lol) and everyone else who decides to buy these!"
The sound on these are great!  I really thought the sound quality was good.  However the head support broke after 5 to 6 months of use.  I used some gorilla glue to fix them but it simply broke again and broke all the way off right above the right ear.  It's a common break point unfortunately.  In addition the ear pads separated too.  The durability was poor.  It's ashame because the sound is really really good.  3 stars because I got these on sale.
"At first I really like the headphone it was exactly like the description. However, I'm writing a review because only after 2 and a half month of use. It's already not working well anymore. The left side doesn't function at all now (no sound) and the right side is starting to break. So the durability and the quality really isn't that good. I'm really disappointed because there were no problem at first and I really liked the headphone. Nevertheless, i contacted the company and they issued a refund so it's a positive thing."
"The Soundcore by Anker Life Q30 Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones offer a compelling feature set at a budget-friendly price.  They boast excellent noise cancellation, good sound quality, and long battery life. However, a significant durability issue significantly compromises their overall value.Pros:Impressive Noise Cancellation: The Life Q30's hybrid ANC effectively blocks out low-frequency ambient noise, creating a peaceful listening environment.Rich Audio: These headphones deliver clear, well-balanced sound with good bass response, making them suitable for most music genres.Extended Playtime: With 40 hours of playback on a single charge (advertised), the Life Q30 are perfect for long journeys or extended listening sessions.Multiple Modes: The headphones offer different ANC modes to tailor noise cancellation to your environment.Cons:Durability Concerns: Several user reviews, including my own experience, highlight a concerning issue with the headphones cracking or breaking easily. This can render them unusable and significantly shortens their lifespan.Comfort: While not the worst offenders, some users find the Life Q30 headphones a bit heavy and uncomfortable for extended wear.Overall:The Soundcore Life Q30 headphones offer a great balance of features and affordability, with impressive noise cancellation and good sound quality. However, the major durability issues are a serious drawback. If you're looking for a budget-friendly pair of ANC headphones with a focus on long-term use, you might want to consider other options that offer better build quality."
"I have 2 pair of these headphones and while they work really well - good quality sound and great at noise blocking, the casing falls apart too easily.  The first pair I purchased in July 2023 and broke by October.  I suspected it was just a fluke.  Purchased a second pair at the end of August of this year and they are broken already.  Used by a college student while studying so it isn't like she's treating them roughly.***Wanted to come back and add that I reached out to the company and had a great customer service experience.  Very pleased."
"I really want to love these. The various noise cancelling modes mean that I can adjust the noise cancellation to suit my environment--I, especially, like the transparent mode for when I need to hear what's going on around me. The multi-point connection is also super helpful because I can switch between my work and personal computers, or work and personal cell phones. However, the touch mechanism on the right ear cup for transparency is sensitive and I frequently hit it inadvertently when I'm just trying to reposition the headset. It happens everytime my hand brushes the ear cup. Most importantly, after using these for six months, they've started developing a weird high-pitched tin-like noise during use. I use these for work meetings and this distorts the sound of people's voices. I have to turn them off and turn them back on again (which, when using Zoom, sometimes means you have to readjust your audio settings.) It's disruptive, so 3 stars because I'm now looking for a new pair."
"I bought these headphones one year ago. I do NOT recommend them, mostly because Soundcore is sabotaging itself. Here's how:- The ""TRANSPARENCY!"" touch setting. This is the big one. -Does your hair reach your jaw or lower? Better not let it brush over your right headphone cup! Want to use these headphones while doing housework or exercising? Better not EVER put your arms over your head for any reason! Basically, the second anything brushes your right headphone, you'll hear the blaring ""TRANSPARENCY!"" voice in your ear, and your audio quality will suddenly drop to nil. Sounds like a minor thing, right? Well, imagine that happening multiple times per use over the entire lifespan of your headphones! Literally cannot fathom (1) who is using this setting at all, ever, and (2) why Soundcore thought it would be a good idea to make it so easy to switch on by accident, (3) why the switch is so loud and disruptive, and (4) why you can't turn off the setting at all. Again, I know what you're thinking, because I thought it too: ""No big deal! I'll get over it!"" Listen to me. Seriously, listen to me. There has not been a single day of using these headphones in the past year where I didn't think about how viciously annoyed they make me. If I could get my money back or mentally justify being wasteful enough to throw usable headphones into a landfill, I would.- The quality of the ear cups. (See photos)This is more minor. The fake leather here is actually really great - it shows no signs of wear or peeling, even after frequent use for months, like cheaper headphones sometimes do. HOWEVER, the seam of the right ear cup on mine slowly unraveled about three months in, and I thought it was just a fluke. Nothing a needle and thread can't fix. (In the photo, you can see where I already shoddily repaired the right seaming.) Nine months later, the left ear cup is starting to unravel as well - which is a pattern of quality issues that absolutely shouldn't be happening on $80 headphones.TL;DR: This is a decent product with the single most frustrating issue you will ever encounter with a pair of headphones. Don't buy them. I see you thinking about it! Don't fall into the same trap I did!(P.S. If you HAVE to go with Soundcore, downgrade or upgrade to another headphone model instead - none of the brand's other offerings (to my knowledge) has the ""TRANSPARENCY!"" issue, and I pray every single day that Soundcore realizes the error of its ways, pushes some kind of digital update that kills this stupid audio mode forever and lets me enjoy an otherwise great product.)"
Loved the headset but it stopped charging about 3 weeks after I got it. Now it's limited to being a wired headset
"Have had these for a little over a year, but have not used them aton (I just don't wear headphones alot, bought them for airline travel and ANC). The sound is good and the ANC seems to work pretty well. The tech is sound but about a year in the left ear cup started to come apart and show the foam, now the right has done the same. The seam seems to let go, you can't see it when wearing them though."
"Decent headphones but they are slightly too big, feel a little cheap, but the sound quality is good"
"Tldr: anker good, Amazon sent used product, didnt return cuz gf didnt want to wait again.First of all, these headphones are great for the price. Sound quality is great and NC is pretty good too. I'm currently in my kitchen next to dehumidifier on little less than half volume and I don't hear it at all. I got these for my girlfriend cuz she really liked the color and how they looked.The reason for the 3 stars is that these were obviously returned as there were these clothing tags in the box and the headphones were not placed back into their case properly and on the soundcore app I can see that these were already paired to someone's iPhone. Only reason I didnt return was cuz my gf said she didn't want to wait for them again."
"The headphones have a decent sound and the noise canceling works pretty well. Bluetooth disconnects periodically at a distance of only 1-2ft from my tablet. After a year and a half, both air cushions have ripped. I realize these are inexpensive headphones compared to Bose or other high end ones. Hopefully I can find replacement ear cushions and do it myself."
Quality is ok but don’t understand why tearing apart
"The sound quality is very middle of the road, nothing great and nothing terribly wrong. I even tried to adjust the EQ within the app without much success. The balance of the sound just isn't quite right and really sticks out when compared to my other headphones that were cheaper. I ultimately returned them since sound quality is absolutely #1 priority.The noise cancellation/ transparency is a great feature and very effective (transparency mode is bit sensitive, over-boosts the sound). When activated, it doesn't distort the music like some other headphones. I would definitely recommend this for the office/travel (aside from sound quality).The dual device connectivity works but you have to go into the second device to connect to it, some other headphones will automatically connect to both once they've been paired. Minor thing but can get annoying doing it every day.A major item for me, other than sound, is the microphone won't work for the second device. Since I use these during work and various meetings, I have to set up my phone with Teams to get the audio to work. Even changing the computer settings to use the headphone as a headset doesn't work. Might be an issue with the dual connectivity, but I have other headphones that do this without a hitch."
I didn't find Noise cancelling feature very effective. I used the headphones with my electric lawn mower (Ryobi which makes a lot less noise than gas powered ones) and seemed it only stopped about 80% of noise. not what I wanted so returned it. Sorry. Price was good though.
Controls are tiny and hard to read.
"I really liked my Q20 headphones, but after lots of use they finally broke. Before ordering the q30, I wanted to ensure they had the 3.5mm jack, as I often use that with Noise Cancelling on long-haul flights. After seeing it had that, I purchased them and was excited to try them for the next trip. Unfortunately, I found out on my first trip that the Noise Canceling turns off as soon as you plug in the cord. I researched this online to find out that the new version apparently doesn't support Noise Cancellation while using the 3.5mm jack. While I like the fit and the fact that it came with its own case, this is very disappointing."
Honestly just get AirPods
"Update 9/11/24: Soundcore confirmed the headphones are defective and need to be replaced. They provided me with a return mailing label and will send a replacement pair when they see that the headphones are in the process of being returned.Pros:Delivery was greatProduct has very good sound for the price. The Soundcore app enables a lot of options to adjust the sound based on personal preferenceStorage case is sturdy and fairly compactHeadphones are comfortable after wearing for hoursBattery life seems to be very goodConsThe voice prompts for battery life and ambient sound don’t playTapping the right earphone doesn’t change the Transparency modeI am working with Soundcore to resolve these issues and will update my review based on the outcome of my inquiry. Overall I like the headphones and, if properly handled and stored, I think they will hold up well."
"I like the design, sound is great, but….girls with smaller heads might have issues. Working out laying on a bench these slide and fall off my head on the tightest setting. Its annoying, if it werent for that id give them 5 stars"
"I have had this specific set for over a year now, and they are fantastic! I use them daily, and I have never really had an issue with them until recently. They are by far my favorite and most comfortable headphone set. They're great for filtering noise while I do homework. They provide great sound quality, allowing you to appreciate the little nuances of music and sound effects, and I couldn't be happier. They're also great sound buffers when I am working with loud dogs.The speakers work just as well as the day I got them. However, the fabric over the foam of the ear covers has recently started to come apart, leaving the foam exposed. I'm not rough with the headphones, so I am not sure why this is happening. I may look into getting another Anker pair soon, but I am a broke college student so I will be wearing these until they are completely unwearable.Would have been five stars had the glue held up (like I said, these are so comfortable and fantastic). Sad they have worn out so quickly. I wish there was a way to have them fixed."
"I have two pair of the soundcore q20's and they are awesome but they only have a micro usb to charge and that is one more cable to keep track of around the house and while traveling so I bought these which cost a bit more but have a now industry standard USB C port.  They work, but they work less effectively than the cheaper model in every way but one.  The one way they are better is that they have an actual case vs the bag the 20's come in.  The sound on these is okay, including the noise canceling but they let in a lot more ambient noise than the cheaper headphones. The headband is also shaped differently so it takes up more space and doesnt hold the headphones on nearly as well.  So leaning your head against the side of a plane doesnt work as well for instance.  If I look up there is a 50/50 chance the headphones will slide off. Finally the interface is finicky. Turning them on or off requires a really long button push, it claims it is something like 3 or 5 seconds but it is longer than whatever they claim.  The tranparency function works well with a quick touch to the earphone and they look ""nicer"" than the cheaper model but functionally they are not."
"I am an average sized/ slightly petite woman and even on the smallest setting these slide right off my face if I look down. The sound quality is pretty nice (sometimes I find myself wishing they got a little louder, but I guess that would be bad for my ears!) but they really are too big for my head. It’s a shame because they are good quality headphones and music sounds incredible through them, but I find myself avoiding moving my head so much when wearing them.The active noise canceling and then transparent mode would be great for walking around in public or grocery shopping while still hearing what’s going on around you, but they slip off so easily I can’t wear them while walking around or bending down to pick things up at the store. Kind of a shame they made these so large.I tried my partners audio technica headphones and they don’t have this problem so it’s not like I have an abnormally small head (I wear a medium size adult helmet!)  a friend of mine recommended these to me and mentioned they fit her a little big but I thought since I have kind of a bigger head for a small lady I wouldn’t have the same issue, but..too badIf you have a really large head I would recommend these though"
"I really love these headphones and even have thought about repurchasing them, but after realizing it's only been about 3 months and they are already broken due to breaking at the joints I'm not sure I can. I am not rough with these or anything, but the plastic just cracked around where the joints are and now the headphones are no longer attached to headband. The features are great minus the fact that if you have two devices connected you randomly get this very loud, very high pitched frequency blasted into your ears so I made sure to never actually have two devices connected at once. I love the pink color too. It's the perfect baby pink color. I also love being able to tap the side and have noise cancelling mode toggled on and off quickly. I really wish they hadn't had broken so quickly. It's really a shame. I love the sound quality and I did wear these everyday, but I can't understand why they broke. I never write reviews so it's sad that I am having to write this. Maybe they'll work out for you, but sadly they fell a part on me."
"Long battery life! Love the color. Controls make sense and are easy to use, however, if my right hand inadvertently bumps the right earpiece, it will randomly change between “transparency “ mode and “noise cancellation” mode. I have also experienced this short happening constantly when my hair is damp after a shower, just by putting the headphones on my head. The range is very good. I the weight is a bit heavy. They tend to slide off my head a lot. Oftentimes slipping off the back of my head while I’m just sitting in a chair. The sound quality is very good."
"So I've had these about three months now and I've used them almost daily since then.The good:The sound quality is great and the ANC is impressive - especially at the price point. The audio is clean and the pads on the ears and quite comfortable for me. The battery also really gives you very good playing time. The weight of the earphones are fine to me, you notice that they're there but they aren't painful or difficult to wear.The bad:I, however, was a little worried about the plastic body and today my worry turned to reality. The plastic around the right stalk cracked (almost all the way across) and I have no idea how/when/why. I've included pictures of the crack and a few more centimeters and I think the earphones will no longer be wearable. That's really annoying to me for a 3-month-old item that's kept in its case when not being used.Item informationItem: Soundcore Life Q30Purchase date: April 27, 2024Purchase price: $69.99Item shipped: May 12, 2024Delivery date: May 14, 2024"
"This is my usual experience of using these headphones:Open laptopput on headphonespress and hold power button for 3 seconds1...2...3...headphones play ""turning off"" chime""they were already on""press and hold power button for 3 seconds1...2...3...4...5...6...nothing is happening...""I pressed the button too early, they where still turning off or something""press and hold button for 3 seconds1...2...3...headphones play ""turn on"" chimedeal with bluetooth settings until they connectheadphones finally workwhy not just have a power switch?turn on switchconnectdonecons:can't use while chargingcan only use noise canceling and transparency mode with bluetooth, not while wiredtouch controls that can't be turned off. I opened up the headphones and cut the wire to the touch surface. I don't care if this voids my warranty. If disabling the feature is an improvement, it is not a feature.cycling between 3 modes instead of two is a little clunky. If you're in normal mode and want to switch to noise canceling, you have to go through transparency mode first. You can't double press to cycle throw two modes either because a double press counts as a different kind of input, even though double pressing the mode switch button does nothing. Why not press and hold or double press the mode button to enter transparency mode instead and let single presses toggle between normal and noise canceling?no earplug mode where the headphones stay on and noise canceling stays on even if they're not connected to something. Although, I'd much rather they turn off automatically because I'll never remember to turn them off myself so unless they can tell that you're wearing them and use that to decide to stay on, ignore this one.no way to force headphones into pairing mode while connected to a device besides disconnecting from within the device's settings or turning the headphones off and on again, which takes at least 10 seconds.as far as I know, there's no way to check the battery level without turning the headphones off and on again, which takes at least 6 seconds. Or by checking in your devices setting, if it shows you that kind of information. Windows 11 does, I can't remember if android does."
"After purchasing about four pairs of their earbuds (a spare and a couple for my dad), I decided to try the over ear headphones. Like the buds, the sound quality and features (transparency, noise cancellation, eq, pairing to two devices simultaneously, etc) are great value for money.Unfortunately, after owning them for a couple months they broke right above the right speaker. I dropped them and the flimsy plastic cracked and broke so easily that I was obviously annoyed and disappointed. Having a metal headband is almost pointless if the parts that are constantly moving or prone to stress break so easily. You can call me clumsy, but I take care of my things, fold and put them away regularly.A few years ago, I’d found some cheesy headphones my dad had laying around that he’d bought from Chinatown for probably $20 or $30 that had more metal and better construction. If I could replace a few of the parts with metal with less screws, etc. I’d pay $30, $40 extra. But maybe that’s too much to ask."
"I do love these. The ANC is great, the charge lasts forever, and they fold up nicely for my tote. But the frame of these things is so cheap. The stickers came off, and the left earpad ripped almost immediately. According to other folks, this happens super often, not only on the same earpad, but starting in the EXACT SAME SPOT. The ""hold to turn on transparency"" feature also can not be disabled, so good luck laying on your right side. With these two things fixed, I would've found my forever headphones."
"Great quality of sound so far and the feature set is great. Can't give it more than 3 start though. No ANC when using the AUX cable?! WHY? This makes absolutely NO sense whatsoever. Bluetooth isn't reliable with headphones on my PC (where I use them most often), so I can't really use them for my day-to-day making this a MAJOR deal breaker. This is in part my fault for not noticing it in the description, but I find the idea so intolerable that I had to make my point here. If you're going to include ANC and an AUX cable, make the feature work across the board.Was going to replace my old headphones with these since I thought it was a great price point, but not if this is the case. Guess I now know why the price is so low. My kid needs a new pair and doesn't need the ANC feature, otherwise, I would've returned them immediately for a refund."
"So obviously this is not going to effect the majority of people, but if you have ear gouges, these may not be for you. They do not have a very right fit, so anything a little in the way, pushes them off your ears easily and makes they pretty useless as far as the sound reducing function goes. I wear glasses and have 1"" gouges for reference. Again, I knownthis won't effect most people, but something yo consider if you have them"
"Man do I wish this just worked. Apparently earlier models used to work with AUX, but something changed in manufacturing and now these no longer support AUX + Noise Cancelling. Such a waste. It's frustrating because while not technically called out as a feature there's no reason they shouldn't support this and having to pay $35 more for the Q35 just for this feature seems nearly predatory.Overall review:- The top comment about not pairing with iOS is just wrong. They do. They don't support the ""touch to pair"" feature which is what they are referring to. These work just fine with iOS devices although the app UX leaves a lot to be desired.- The noise cancelling is good, not great. It definitely cuts ambient noise down a TON, and allows non-ambient noises through in a way that's nice. You can still hear things that aren't ""drone-y""  which is nice.- Transparency mode is useless. Everything sounds weird and amplified and drone-y noises sounds awful. It picks up way more things than it should. Seems like its just amplifying ALL noise around you.- They are very comfortable. I have a sensitive head to headphones and these feel amazing. I don't get sore after extended use which is basically unheard of for me.- Sound quality is.. fine. Not distractingly bad but even as someone who is not an audiophile I wish it was better quality audio. My Steelseries 7's sound way better. Podcasts especially sound a little off. Fortunately you have an EQ in the app to use, but even after finding 'ideal' settings and applying them the sound was just ok.- Headphone controls are fine. The power and ANC buttons are easy enough to learn where they are. I have yet to really learn the volume controls cause its just three indistinguishable buttons on the right side so I've never been able to use them without taking the headphones off. You can activate Transparency mode (mostly on accident) by ""cupping"" the right headphone. This ends up mostly being an annoyance because transparency mode sucks so you're better off just lifting the cup off your ear.. which then accidentally triggers transparency mode.. Ugh.Overall, just shy of being a great budget set of over ear ANC headphones. If the AUX issue wasn't there, I'd be keeping them and living with the other issues but man, I just want to be able to watch an in-flight movie with ANC. That doesn't seem like too much to ask especially since these headphones USED TO SUPPORT THIS FEATURE.In the end, Soundcore support was helpful, got me a refund for my old set when I shipped them back and I've since purchased a set of Q35s. While more than I originally wanted to spend, the sound quality improvement and the AUX/ANC capability makes the upgrade more than worthwhile for me."
"A tear appeared inside the right earcup lining — after 14 months of intermittent (3x per week), gentle use. Deterioration like this might be expected within 2-3 years of daily use, as I’ve experienced with decent over-ear headphones in the past.Thankfully, with Soundcore’s generous 18-month warranty, they replaced the earcup promptly and without charge.I just hope this defect is a one-off and not larger quality issue.The replacement earcups did not come with instructions. Nothing on their site. Chat couldn’t help either.Thankfully, one can find instructions in Amazon ratings. (!!!)Such basic info should not be difficult to obtain. Come on Soundcore/Anker — you can do better, especially if you’re, um, SELLING replacement earcups.Otherwise, I genuinely LOVE these headphones. Everything about them -- sound, comfort, flexibility.Anker: you lost one star for durability and another for making the replacement instructions so hard to find."
"I grabbed these over the ear headphones based on a number of reviews and YouTube videos when comparing these to some more expensive headphones. I am coming over from a pair of apple AirPods pros, and cant handle the in the ear thing anymore.My use is for walks for a mile or 5 ....theme parks, gym weight work out.... nothing to crazy.The headphones arrived within 12 hours and were shipped in there product box( warning to others with porch pirate problems)When arrived they seemed to be charged, but still plugged them in to fully charge before using.The directions are MINIMAL.....and id took me a few interpretations to figure out how to skip songs, and get the bluetooth detection to activate.The ANC is good, being your ear is inside the cup, it should be.I used these for a 45 minute weight workout and here is why ill be returning them for a more expensive pair...Right away I coldn't get the bluetooth to connect, like the headphones wouldn't go into pairing mode, it would just power off and on. These headphones use the same buttons for multi uses with long or short hold durations. (Strike 1)Once connected I started my play list and thought, thats it? I had them turned all the way up and felt I was still needing more volume. (Strike 2) or 1 1/2 if you like soft low volume music.Once I figured it out I went to ask Siri to skip to next track, Siri did so but I could not hear Siri at all in headphones? No ""what can I do for you"" or anything . (Strike 3)When I tried to manually skip tracks I did take a few tries to have my finger on the proper button. ... That's a learning thing not a set back, just been a long time since I have had an actual button to push for functions as opposed to touching.The integration seems extremely limited with my iPhone and the sound was subpar for over the ear headphones. Makes me wonder about all the other reviews?!After my 45 minute work out I did notice ear fatigue and with that, I have decided to return them."
"It was nice while it lasted and these were well cared for, but audio completely cut out from the right ear. I contacted support over it but it looks like they're pretty strict on the warranty period. For the price though, these sounded amazing and were pretty comfortable and the build quality was there. It makes you feel like a victim of planned obsolescence when something dies directly after the warranty period."
"These are okay headphones. They do not get very loud. The music quality is fine, but not great (even after playing with the eq levels in the app). I get better quality from my $30 earbuds. The volume is probably fine for someone just trying to do some computer work or listening to something around the house, but they are incredibly disappointing for times where I want the volume of my music to drown out the thoughts in my head. I tried wearing them in the gym, but they are just not tight enough against my head to stay put. (Note that I might have a smaller head than most others.) They're just very ""meh,"" (unfortunately) reflective of their affordability. Better than Tozo's, but I'm still on the hunt for over the ear noise cancelling headphones that fit tightly to my head, provide powerful bass tones, and simply get loud enough."
"I brought these a couple of months ago very good pair of headsets for the price noise canceling is very good , battery life very good , however there is a design flaw my wife brought similar pair and the headphones cracked in the same spot as mine. I am very upset because these are decent headphones but that plastic  they are using will not hold up ."
"First purchased the new Space One's which were just way too heavy. Started experiencing some strain in my neck if worn for more than 90m. I like to take a break every 2h. The ANC was really very good and the cushions over the ears were of great quality...so I downgraded to the Navy colored Q-30's. Although the weight issue was resolved, the interface with the tap for ANC, Normal and Transparency was just too inconvenient and interrupted my focus way too many times. Just pick them up or brush your hand by and modes change.They do charge quickly and hold a charge steadily.Anker headphones are really decent for the price point and better than SkullCandy. I went back for Gen 1  Latte Cream colored Space One's because of the controls and comfort. *Finger's crossed!*"
Sound quality is not as shown in description.But keeping in view price it’s okay
I got a pretty good deal for prime day but will be looking at something else. The sound is very good for the price. Everything else makes them difficult and annoying. See below.CONSIssue 1: Buttons - The button placement makes it very easy to turn off noise cancelling. Simply removing and putting them back on you can end up in transparency mode. Placing them on my neck for a quick second my chest presses the buttons. I find myself constantly checking to make sure i am in noise cancelling mode. There are other sets out there for whichIssue 2: Commuting - I found that when walking fast on a call it was randomly switching to transparency mode and back. Nothing was touching the buttons. It was the stress of my steps. I ended switching them off to complete my calls.Issue 3: Mic - Even in my quiet office people had trouble hearing me. I ended up switching to the laptop mic which people said was much better.PROSPro 1: App - It is pretty cool to be able to control the functions with the app widget.Pro 2: Sound Quality - The sound quality when in noise cancelling mode is surprisingly good for the price point. That brings it to two stars.
It's ok sound... not of great construction.  But not bad for the price.
I did my research on this item and the claim is sweat resistance... Idk but it's starting to just shut down out of nowhere... So I'm not as happy with it but the sound quality is great! Noise cancelation canceled the kids nagging honey.  If you want to get some beats but don't have beats money this is a great alternative!
"I wanted to love these so much, I primarily bought them for the gym and doing house work with the hopes that I could use them for work or taking any phone call hands-free. However, these pick up so much background noise that it is virtually impossible to carry on a conversation with anyone (work or not) due to how much background noise it picks up.My other complaint it that I wish I could make these smaller. I have never been known to have a small head yet i often find myself wishing these would fit a bit tighter to stay on my head when moving around.Originally I gave these 5 stars but after about 2 months, I wish I would have found something better."
"Just got these delivered and this is my first experience with Anker headphones though I do also have a small portable speaker that has worked great for the price.This headset feels very well built and you can tell just by the general feel of the device- headband, cups, swivel points all feel hefty enough to last, nothing creaky, buttons have good tactile feedback and the controls are very easy to get used to coming from an older Sony model. The included case also feels very nice, I'm glad I got this over the lower model as the case alone is worth the upgrade.Paired via NFC to my Pixel 6 which worked perfectly (Love my Pixel but sometimes the NFC causes fits). Also paired up via BT to my computer which also was a painless operation.Sound- I have only about 2 hours of listening and my current daily is a Senn HD598 so it's a very different type just because of the closed vs open aspect. Having said that I really didn't take long to get accustomed to these and while I would never confuse them I thoroughly enjoy them at this point...just different due to design. I would say the Senns has a superior soundstage and they are more comfortable (not as warm sitting on my ears) where the Q30 is actually more comfortable at first it does get warm with the closed / leather cups vs open / velour on the Senn.Noise Cancelling- I am very new to the technology and you can run the headphones in Transparent, Normal and Active NC. I picked these up after trying on a Bose Quitecomfort in Costco and was impressed with it. Is this as effective? Doesn't seem like it but if you have any reasonable volume playing with NC on I barely hear any traffic which unfortunately is just outside my balcony even with the windows open. Since this is new to me the closest thing I can compare it to is using my Pixel Buds in ear monitors- The Q30 definitely blocks more than those (they do not have active NC just the passive effect of being IEM). It's enough that I can no longer hear my neighbors kids playing with their VR headset in the stairwell between our units...which is a big reason I decided to retire my Senn for now lol.I haven't had these long to say how the battery life is or charging times but I used it right out of the box and was playing around with NC on it's own and then listened to some of my favorite tracks for about an hour and it's fine. When you power them on the headphones will say its battery level. When I first turned it on it said ""medium"" and after playing around with it for about 2 hours it's still at ""medium"".UPDATE - Cushion has failed about u months in. So I guess I'll have to order a replacement. Pretty disappointing as I really use them gently at home. If you travel and bump them around they're gonna break even sooner."
"Headphones work great, easy to setup & use. Only complaint is build quality. I have a crack on one side & the foam cover on the other side has separated. I've never thrown or done anything to damage so no idea how/why this has occurred for normal use."
"Just received and this review is based on initial thoughts. Will update after more extensive use.Had trouble figuring out switching between bluetooth and hardwired to device  such as an I-phone or in-air entertainment on the plane.As soon as the headphones recognize the wire is connected, it will play a tone to let you know it has changed. At that point, you cannot control the volume or play/pause/previous/next-- you will have to use the device's controls. (Even if you disconnect from phone/airplane but the wire is still in the headphone jack, the headphones remain in ""wired"" mode)Additionally, after removing the wire from the headphone jack, it does not automatically go back to bluetooth -- you have have to hold the on/off button to reconnect via bluetooth. (The website/instructions are not clear on this.)I made the mistake of disconnecting from the plane so I could listen to music on my I Phone, but I didn't realize the wire was still in the jack. Once I unplugged and reset the headphones as described above it worked.Since I just received, I am not sure how battery life compares to manufacture's stated times. (if significantly different I will update this review and let you know.) However, make sure you plan ahead and have them fully charged before a long flight because they will not work while charging. (I tried both connected to plane USB and portable battery pack.)The app is interesting... it has 11 different sounds e.g. rain, wind, river, ticking clock, etc that can be selected to help you sleep. It also has a timer so you can have it automatically turn-off.I didn't want to spend $300+ for other brand name noise cancelling headphones. Overall, this headphone seems to be a good value for the $$$.If things change in the coming months after I've had more time to use it, I will update the review."
"design of product has issues. It was for my kids, but it will be broken next day. not robust enough, tiny cheap plastic holding whole speaker. I went for Q20, even if it has less powerful ANC, but seams more robust."
"This is probably the most disappointing electronics item I've bought on Amazon. Not even sure where I should begin, so I'll just go down the list.My main reason for buying this pair, over the $20 cheaper model they make, was for the advertised dual connectivity. That is, it can be connected to two bluetooth devices at the same time. This feature just does not work. I'm constantly having to disconnect and reconnect to my two devices. I'm at the point, functionally, where I was before buying these with my old headphones. My previous headphones (Beats Solo3) functioned the way these do...buy they didn't have dual connectivity! I bought these mainly for that feature, so I wouldn't have to constantly connect and reconnect, but here I am, doing that multiple times a day.In comparison, I have a Plantronics headset that has dual connectivity, and its as smooth as butter. I seamlessly transition between my laptop and phone and NEVER have to manually connect. So, I know what's possible. These Soundcores are TERRIBLE in this dept. Not to mention, if I DO have two devices connected I sometimes get crackling interference that hurts my ears. WOW, Soundcore, just WOW.Speaking of hurting my eardrums, when I connect to my laptop it defaults to 100% volume! Why is this even a thing?! I connect and my music is deafening. Then good luck using the volume buttons on the right ear piece to lower the volume, bc they do not work either. They work on my phone, but only work on my laptop like 20% of the time, tops! Terrible!Also, the product's listing boasts a 15 meter range. HA! I'll walk 12 feet away and sometimes it'll start cutting out. Terrible!Noise cancelling is good I guess. I haven't had a lot of experience with ANC, so yeah. But I have to mention this! The ""seal"" on the ears is very poorly designed. Noise and wind EASILY comes in, thus defeating the purpose of the Noise cancelling. Let's put it this way. My previous headphones, with no ANC, cut out outside noise when outdoors about as good as these. They had a really good seal on my ears, so zero wind came in and very little ambient noise. But these let SOO much noise in, so the ANC can only do so much. In fact, I NEVER use these without using ANC on. That's how much noise they let in. Terrible!I might as well comment on the sound quality. I've never been a audio snob. Tbh, I can barely tell a difference between good and high end audio quality. These tho, I can tell are ""eh"". They are serviceable, not bad, but nothing great.Here's another REALLY ANNOYING feature you'll want to watch out for. They have three modes: Normal, Noise Cancelling and Transparency. You would think that when you select a mode they would just stay in that mode. Nope. Every time I stop and start with them, they cycle to the next mode. E.g. listen to some music, put the headphones down for 20 min (they're still on), put them back on and they're in a different mode. (And no I'm not accidently triggering the right side hand touch feature). They just cycle without asking. And its not even that they always reset to ""normal"" or something, they literally cycle to another random mode. SOO annoying. Its like using them is so tedious. Every time I want to listen to music I'm disconnecting from one device, connecting to another, lowering the volume to preserve my hearing, selecting the mode, and then making sure I don't step too far away. Who the heck wants to do all that?! Terrible!Finally, I have one last complaint. This won't effect most people, but its does me. So, these things are too big. If I bend over or look too far up they start sliding off. Now, I admit, my head is a bit on the smaller side. But, I'm also male and 6'1""...my head isn't THAT small. I think they just wanted to save on costs and created a product with a relatively small range of adjustability. Again, my previous headphones didn't give me this problem. Just terrible!TL:DR Every advertised feature is either subpar or bad. Don't buy."
"So, these headphones mostly appealed to me because they are a very adorable shade of pink, and I trust Anker's Soundcore series + like my  earbuds by them. To put it simply: I would not be keeping these if I paid the price they normally are  (85$). I got these on sale during Black Friday, and they serve me decently for having paid what I did.They sound good, not great -- but, there's  not a lot of depth to the sound (even by my basic standards), and I find that I always have to turn my audio up quite high to really hear and enjoy them.The noise cancellation/transparency modes work alright - the latter helps me out for those times my roommate talks to me suddenly. You can switch the modes without having to hunt for a button as well, which is nice. The sensor on the right headphone makes the function convenient enough to switch between.Overall, certainly not bad! They are comfortable, attractive, and decent-sounding headphones. It's just that you could definitely put your money toward better quality (albeit less cute) headphones, if that matters more to you.[Minor update 10/20/2023]: Reaffirming my stance that thee are not worth the usual price; get them on sale or look elsewhere. The top band of the headsets are becoming misaligned and worn little by little, and it's bad enough that I have to wear a satin bonnet over my hair so that it does not get ripped out by the plastic protrusions that anchor the top cushioning down. (Ouch.)Same qualms about middling sound quality as before. I am unsure if the right ear cup is suffering a quieting effect, or if I've just encountered numerous videos with poor audio balancing. Hard to say.I will still enjoy these until they stop working, but in another ~year or so I will sadly not look to Soundcore to replace these. I will stick to their earbuds for now."
"At the time I bought these I had been in need of decent sound cancelling headphones, because much of my travel is  by public transportation, and they require headphones with electronics by state law.The headset offered decent, but not great noise canceling, transparency, normal, and Noise canceling, are the three settings. The application for soundcore offers a few adjustable features with noise canceling, from indoor, outdoor, and transport, which was why I bought them to filter out background noise from being on the bus.However, little did I realize that the faux leather/plastic flakes will fade away as you wear them and they literally do not have any way to replace the muffin pads.The overall quality of life of battery is decent for a full days use or a week use if you only use them when on public transportation. You can expect them to break really easily, because it is plastic the ear pieces are a foldable design, with elongated headband that can stretch for bigger heads like mine.They are decent for playing music, but I recommend you have a decent mp3 player/flac/mp4 whatever format.Hoewver, the connection by Bluetooth can  make the connection for phone calls seem very hit and miss and does not filter out background noise when walking and talking, or when trying to answer your phone with Bluetooth headphones on.There needs to be a better noise canceling Mike for the speaker because most all of my calls notice that I can barely be heard when taking on them, because of poor filtering of background noise and car noise.So as I said you get what you pay for.Hope this helps."
"Overall good noise cancelling headphones. The one issue I have with them is the touch panel on the right side, which I have never once activated intentionally. Every time something brushes up against it, the headphones enter ""aware mode"", interrupting whatever you were listening to. There's already a button on the left side for switching between modes, so this feature is completely useless. I've seen posts online from people who have unsoldered or severed the connection to the touch panel in order to disable it. If you have the skill set to confidently do this mod, then consider it."
"The noise cancellation on these is great! But these are destroyed after only 1 year of use. The pads on the ears are ripped and I had to tape the headband part together because it cracked. I wear these at night and I fall asleep watching YouTube - so the touch function on the outside of the headphone switching between transparency and noise cancellation was annoying and overly sensitive. Every night I did it by accident. I think these are good headphones for most, but if you lay down at all with them, it won't work for you."
"I’ve bought two of these and both have broke. My first one was the Q20 so I decided to upgrade after a few months. I also gifted a Q30 to my cousin and his headphones broke after a few months as well This one is my current and its broken again after a year of use. The cushion started to tear, but I didn’t mind honestly. I rarely drop it, and one day when I put it on, I noticed a large crack. The first two days was ok, but now that side is much looser and won’t tighten.This is something I cannot fix either. Imo, these headphones are poorly made as far as the material and it’s not sturdy. I would just invest in better made headphones! its better for the long run. Very disappointed since all three became broken."
"These work well and sound great. There are three different sound settings: normal, transparency, and noise-cancelling. Transparency allows you to hear the sound in your headphones AND environmental sounds equally.I exclusively use noise-cancelling, but the button that toggles between the sound settings  is very sensitive and changes the sound setting at the even *slightest hint* of a touch. Sometimes the sound setting changes when I'm pretty sure nothing touched the button at all. This is annoying because it's very jarring when the sound setting goes from ""noise-cancelling"" to ""transparency""."
"These are the worst headphones I've ever used, had them less for a year and they are already falling apart, I had to duck tape them to keep them from fully breaking apart and even then as you can see they're barely holding together. The cushion is now breaking as well which of course it is, I expect nothing less.Starting from the beginning: almost immediately if pressure is put on them in certain ways you'll get an absurd high pitched squeal, I had ignored this because at the time it wasn't as big of an issue and I don't sleep with them so I didn't mind (unsurprisingly, it does not stay a minor issue for long. I had also noticed that no matter how I fixed up the equalizer, the audio quality (though sharp in that aspect) stayed terrible, bass sucks in these so don't bother if you like that type of stuff. The noise canceling is decent if you're not anywhere loud, and the transparency is okay as long as you don't want to actually hear voices and instead want to hear literally anything else.The mic quality has steadily been getting worse and worse to the point where I have been told I'm incomprehensible and garbledThe Bluetooth has also been getting worse, forcing me to disconnect and reconnect constantly while on calls.As seen, they are virtually shattering on the arm, which is crazy because any time I take them out of the house they are kept in the case and secure in my bag, but that just shows how poor quality the case is as wellI even got the warranty and I'm STILL trying to see about getting a refund or a new pair because this is frankly ridiculousLiterally the only thing these have going for them is being comfortable and they're easy to connect with Bluetooth and that's about itDon't bother getting these, you'll have better luck finding a 20$ headset at Walmart made of better quality instead of the 80+ dollars pieces of junk they are"
"I am a huge fan of Anker and Soundcore. This was the 2nd pair of over ear headphones I have bought from them. The sound is awesome. Battery life is awesome. However, after 6 months of use, all the plastic on the headband started to crack. After a year of use, the headphones are not wearable as they are too fragile to put on now. This happened with an earlier model of over the ear headphones as well. I don't think the plastic is as good of quality as other brands."
"pros!- pink color is VERY cute, pale pink!- noise cancellation is better than my airpods pro- foam earpads go around ears = more comfortable (comfy when wearing earrings too)- ability to adjust sound output/type of noise cancellation in app- works well with apple products (all buttons work, etc!)- aesthetically pleasing design- great price for the quality of the product- long, LONG battery life (used for 3 weeks for about 3-4 hours a day, only needed to charge after 3rd week)- nice protective carrying casecons!- when you accidentally brush the right earcup for too long, it turns on transparency mode. useful in some situations, but kind of an annoyance for me! definitely not a dealbreaker though.- the phrase ""active noise cancellation"" is written on both sides of the headband. this isn't a huge issue, just something to note aestheticallyAnother reviewer said all of the above and I couldn’t agree more, but I need to add one glaring con that may change your mind.As many others have said they don’t last long. My daughter had them about 3 months before one of the sides started breaking just above the ear piece. We epoxied it and it still broke again. Then the other piece started breaking last month. She absolutely loves them but I’m definitely looking for a replacement approx 6 months after purchasing.overall!They don’t last long, but work great while they last."
"I was interested in these due to the high praise they received (particularly the rtings review). If I was really looking forward to using these as intended, I'd be disappointed. Personally, I'm not a fan of noise cancellation on any headphones. So my comments on that feature are probably not worth much. However, I did try using the headphones wireless in the ""normal"" mode (meant to be ANC off). As some others have mentioned, there is an issue of intermittent popping followed by a white noise hissing sound. My theory is that the ANC is integrated in a way that it can't actually be turned off, but rather only adjusted down to a bare minimum setting. So if you want to use these wireless without ANC, that might annoy you.The good news is the Q30s can be used passively with a 3.5mm jack. They worked perfectly fine for me this way on a 7 hour plane ride. I had no issues with comfort over many hours, though my ears are small so perhaps it is people with bigger ears complaining about part of their ear being caught by the pads.So if you want good passive over-ears for travel or home, these will do. Travel in particular comes to mind with the included carry case, and even a small bag that fits inside said case for the included 3.5mm jack and usb charge cable. However, it would not surprise me if you could find something comparable or slightly better for that purpose at a lower price."
"The good:Good passive noise insulation.Decent active noise cancellation (but not the best I’ve encountered). It’s good enough. Not like I’m trying to drown out power tools or anything.Good transparency feature (though not super necessary—I can just, y’know, remove the headphones if I need to hear something else).Good battery life (out of the box, anyway—we’ll see how long it holds up).Tells you “battery high/medium/low” every time you turn the headphones on, which is useful as a reminder to charge them.Bluetooth connection seems to have good range, and wall/solid object penetration—I was able to leave my phone downstairs and do something on the upper floor without any choppiness.They haven’t started hurting my ears or anything.The bad:The voice says “normal”, “noise cancelling”, or “transparency” every time you switch modes, and talks over whatever you’ve got playing, without pausing. It’s annoying. I can figure the modes out without that, thanks; the fact that I bought this product should imply that I have functioning ears.The audio stutters every so often, whether I’m playing music, streaming a video, or listening to text-to-speech. It’s a minor but frequent irritation (at least once a day, I’d say).Recently, the headphones have begun to emit noise when not playing anything; there’s a quiet sort of click, then about four seconds of also-quiet static, then about six seconds of silence. Then it repeats. They didn’t do this right out of the box, but I’ve only had them a week or two. I don’t know what this is or how to stop it (or if I even can).There’s nothing too terribly wrong with these headphones, but…I don’t know. Personally, I find the few minor problems hard to ignore. You might not have the same problem, or at least not to the same degree."
"TL;DR: Good headphones out of box, excellent headphones for the price and good ANC. A bit of tinkering with app settings makes the experience better. Logistical nightmare from Amazon however.Firstly, let me say that these headphones are phenomenal for the price you pay. The multi device outing was a feature I didn’t think I’d need, but it’s pretty seamless (it is hierarchal, so if the first device you paired plays something, it will ignore the second device completely). The ANC works pretty well (I couldn’t hear a loud air conditioner while sitting right in front of it). Out of box, the sound quality is alright, but you can use the Soundcore app to adjust the EQ manually or using one of their presets, and it sounds way better. There’s even an included AUX cable, but just know that you CANNOT use ANC on AUX. The only big problem is that the headphones makes your ears hot after long sessions, especially in the summer. A bit bulky, which isn’t a problem for me, but I know it’s a turn-off for some people.However, I can’t give this a 5 or even a 4 star rating because of the atrocious customer service from Amazon. I received the product a full 2 WERKS after the original delivery date, and I was trying to closely monitor the package to see what the issue was. Customer Service was a joke and sent us in circles, and even after multiple guarantees and escalations, I came to find out that the product was incorrectly placed on the wrong truck and travelled halfway up the coast before coming back to the same fulfillment center it originated from (mind you this was AFTER I reached out multiple times for an update. Bottom line, I love the headphones, but I can’t help but feel sour when I use them because of the horrible logistics from Amazon."
"I got this because of Tik Tok 😂 but the buttons would work when they wanted to. No matter how I pressed the buttons, how long or from which angle. And just adjusting the earphones will activate transparency mode and it was annoying because I had to constantly put it back to normal or noise cancelling. They felt a tad bit too large for my head. I wanted to tighten them a little more since I felt like it was a little too low on my ears. I returned them. Not for me.-Noise cancelling is pretty good for the price-Sound quality is good for music. And I think it’s okay for calls-The transparency mode on the left earphone is too sensitive. Turns on when you’re just adjusting the headphones-a little too big for my head. Constantly had to adjust-Buttons did not work well"
"I bought these headphones for a series of international flights I had to take, but now I use them in my office whenever it gets loud. The sound and noise cancellation are both pretty good. The ANC doesn't block out sounds 100% of sounds, but it blocks out most and I'll usually put on relaxing sounds of rain or waves at a low volume to help me focus.This would have been 5 stars, but after a year and a half of occasional use, the plastic on the headband broke. I tried to baby these headphones to get them to last as long as I could. (always traveling in it's included case), but unfortunately that's all I was able to get out of them. I can tape them up and keep using them, but it's a little disappointing.In summary, it has good performance for the price but questionable durability can affect its longevity."
"The noise quality is fine, but if you have a noisy workplace, you basically need to deafen yourself in order to tune things out. I work in a busy medical environment and I still, with this on and running white noise, have to close doors in order to not hear the rest of the office. Not enough to justify this price."
"As much as I would like to give 5 stars I can't. I love everything about my headphones except durability. I use them 5 times a week to go to the gym and take good care of them, always put them in the pouch after each use. Unfortunately they broke by just adjusting the size out of nowhere."
You get what you paid for. The microphone doesn't work.
"I just had these delivered on the 14th of September. At first they seemed great, great sound quality, nice features... a bit to snug on my head but otherwise nice headphones. Now less than 14 days in they're beginning to have some issues. They pick up a lot of static... The Noise cancelling feature pops on and off at will. I thought it may be some sort of interference with the Bluetooth but I can't find one single thing related that would cause these issues to happen.  I'm sorry to say that I must return them. They are nice headphones otherwise but I just can't live with static interference while I'm trying to listen to music or watch a movie. I also can't get them to pair with my cellphone. It's such a shame."
"I love the sound and functions of the headphones. I hate the fit, they hurt your ears after off about 15 mins. People tell me all the time I have small areas but these headphones hurts."
"Are they worth $100? For me no… the band is extremely tight on my head and ears, I’ve worn them now for only 5 min straight out the package and I already have a tension headache….The sounds is alright… def not noise canceling I can hear my son talking I can still hear my tv and I can still have a full blown conversation with them on the highest volume….All the co trolls and stuff are on one side so it’s hard to control what you want…. I keep hitting the wrong buttons cause they’re all on one ear.Personally I don’t like the headphones, but they might be good for other people when you just need something quick and aren’t sensitive to pressure on your head."
"Music and Beat is good but if your a person who likes to lay down and listen to music - these headphones will kill your vibing. The lart of the headphones were JbL if it gets touched it automatically stops playing, so laying down and wearing these is not very good also. I have had them stoped playing music just by subtlety moving as of getting up from my bed and walking. I don’t know what are all the aspects of it of stopping music"
"1st headphones I ever used, I bought them because a child is moving back home and i like to listen to loud music, i bought these so she didn't have to hear my music but these have no way to turn up the volume (this could be because i just don't know how) or i just bought the wrong thing for what i wanted, either way i'm not happy with these at all."
Pricey for headphones-extremely sensitive to touch you will turn it off or lower audio by just adjusting on your head or lifting your arms and touching the ear piece. They keep cutting out -very frustrating-don’t buy
"Good quality headset, but it has too many control buttons that you could accidentally pass. I would want a headset that has fewer buttons on it that has a volume control, a Bluetooth pairing button, and a power on/off button."
It wasn’t as loud as I expected. My $10 headphones were louder than the JBL’s
The sound quality is fine for me. I was excited to get these but I wear them during work or traveling and they are EXTREMELY tight - they squeeze on the ears and even feels tight on the top of the head. I absolutely would return these if I could.
Not noise canceling..
They were okay. Not really what I was after.Didn't work well with my TV and we're heavy.
"Buttons are super sensitive. I like to move around my home while listening to music or videos with the headphones ,but the pause or disconnect button is consistently being pushed when i walk or move the headset. Headset is realitively small and pinches the ears if not set right. Over all sound quality is good when it plays... Not worth the price. Avoid if able."
"I bought it and with a few time and few use, it is presenting problems with the battery which doesn't charge it. Also, it is turning of constantly. Big disappointment with a so famous brand."
"I have a JBL soundbar. All I wanted was to pair some phones with the soundbar. Read all they hype and you’d think these things can cut fish and write poetry at the same time. Truth is, you need a PhD to understand setup, type so absolutely tiny I couldn’t read it with glasses plus magnifying glass. No tech support and I finally found they only pair with Bluetooth. No mention about WiFi—-which, I guess, they won’t pair with, even though the JBL soundbar is WiFi—-what ever happened to SIMPLE?"
Not loud at all. My off brand head phones are louder than these.
"For some reason, one of the cuffs emits constant noise when the headphones are on."
Way too complicated for it’s functionality and can barely hear anything. I’ve had dollar store headphones that were louder than these. The worst pair of headphones I’ve ever purchased.
"Sucks, the ear pads are super small like they were made for children 😕. Not noice canceling at all, can hear everything around me. Sending back fir refund."
"The product came with a lot of problems like randomly pausing, muting, and it’s not Noise cancelling,"
Bad sound quality and Uncomfortable
"I bought these a few months ago and they’re pretty decent except they suddenly stopped working. Even after I had charged the headphones, they wouldn’t turn on…"
Headphone earpiece peeled
"Used for one year and it started cracking on right head till it broke off. AirPods way better atp 😂. See the tape? I tried but it give up. I hope you rethink about buying this, also the bass is decent at best lol"
Blue tooth cuts in and out momentarily.
I didn't realize how uncomfortable the 'on ear' style would be for me - the constant pressure on cartilage quickly became painful. Another issue was the 'operation' light (showing the unit was powered on). This light was as bright as a flashlight and made them unusable in bed at night next to my wife (the light in her eyes would wake her up/keep her awake).
The volume button broke on second time using it.Also it randomly pauses every minute or two for no reason while jog.The worst headphones I've ever had completely regret buying them.Couldn't return as I was away for work for a month when they arrived so when I got home I was past the date. Booooo 189 bucks down the drain.
"I recently needed to replace my pair of over the ear headphones so I began my search for a good pair of headphones in the $150-$200 range. Immediately Senhiser, Beyerdynamic, and Audio‑Technica stood out. I first received a pair of the Audio‑Technica ATH M-50x which had good sound but were very uncomfortable if worn for more than an hour or so. Then I picked up a pair of the Beyerdynamic DT 770. These headphones had amazing sound quality and comfort but the passive sound isolation was mediocre at best. Which is why I ordered a pair of the Beyerdynamic Premium 990 which are open back. I figured that the sound quality and comfort would be similar but the open back quality would allow me to talk with others while I played music. Unfortunately the 990's had worse sound quality than the 770 (a bit harsher sounding and not as clear) and were very uncomfortable even after only a couple of hours. During this time I also ordered a pair of Senhiser HD 599 headphones. While these headphones have a significantly different sound signature than the others I have tried, they were of similar quality. Overall the HD 599's were slightly less comfortable than the 770's but the open back quality was convenient and the sound was quite nice. I would have been satisfied with the HD 599's but they were the only pair of headphones I could not drive with my desktop. They produced terrible static. This did not occur when I used the 599's on other devices or when I used other headphones (even those with similar impedance and SPL) driven by my desktop computer. This prevented me from keeping them. I have attached a breakdown of my thoughts below:------------Sound Quality------------Beyerdynamic DT 770 (80 Ohm) - WinnerHighs - Quite good representation, much cleaner than SenhiserMids - Quite good representationLows - A little closed sounding but overall they are handled wellOverall this is how the music should sound. They perform the most similar to my pair of Martin Logan Motion 15's (bookshelf speakers)Beyerdynamic Premium 990 (32 Ohm)Highs - Similar to the 770's but rather harsh soundingMids - Nothing special, no major issuesLows - Not as powerful as the 770's but more spacious. Seemed a bit washed out due to the open back designSenhiser HD 599 (50 Ohm) - Close 2nd BestHighs - Not quite as poppy as they should be. They are a bit muted in the sound signature which can make them less fatiguing than other, more analytical, headphones.Mids - A bit to high level for me, it tended to make punk rock music sound very close and muddiedLows - A bit boomy but very spaciousAudio Technica ATH M-50xHighs - Quite good representation, a bit cold thoughMids - Nothing special, no major issues thoughLows - Too over-emphasized-----------------Comfort---------------Beyerdynamic DT 770 - WinnerPerfect. I wore these on multiple occasions for more than 7 hours and never noticed any pressure points or discomfort. The headband is larger than average to distribute the pressure. The clamp pressure is also a bit more than average but this was not an issue due to the soft, replaceable, ear pads.Beyerdynamic Premium 990I could not wear these for more than a few hours. The headband is made of a much harder material than the 770's and causes a painful pressure point on the top of my head. I believe this is made worse by the lower clamping force since more of the weight is on the top of your head.Senhiser HD 599I could wear these for several hours as long as I moved them around every 30-40 minutes. More comfortable than the 990's. Significantly less clamping force than the 770's.Audio Technica ATH M-50xThese were the least comfortable. I could only stand to wear them for an hour or so before I had to take them off. All of the discomfort came from the top of my head.----------------Usability---------------Beyerdynamic DT 770These come with a permanently attached 10ft cable. That was a lot of cable to get in my pocket every time I got up from my desk. The cable also has more insulation making it much thicker and stiffer than average.Beyerdynamic DT 990These come with a permanently attached 10ft cable. That was a lot of cable to get in my pocket every time I got up from my desk. The cable also has more insulation making it much thicker and stiffer than average. The open back design was also a plus for me since I work in a semi-quiet office environment and I could still hold a conversation with someone while listening to music. But I could not hear others quite as well as I could with the HD 599's.Senhiser HD 599The interchange-able cables with different lengths worked perfect for home listening as well as on the go. The cable is also thinner and more flexible than the Beyerdynamic cable. The open back design was also a plus for me since I work in a semi-quiet office environment and I could still hold a conversation with someone while listening to music. The only downfall is the issue I had with compatibility between some devices and this pair of headphones where I would hear static or computer noise when driving them with a computer.Audio Technica ATH M-50xI really love the long coiled cable that came with these. To me this is the best option since I dont have to lug around a long cable or risk losing extra cables. With that being said, it also came with a ~ 9ft straight cable and 3ft straight cable if the coiled cable is too much for you."
"I've been using A-T M50X headphones for years: they're excellent for the price point, and I would recommend them to anyone in the market for a rock-solid pair of all-around cans.Amazon sent me a clearly opened and used item in excellent condition. I did not purchase a used item. I purchased a new item. I purchased a new item shipped and sold by Amazon proper, because I wanted a properly new and unused item.If I wanted a used item in ""like new"" condition, Amazon, I would have purchased a used item in ""like new"" condition.I rarely purchase higher-priced items from Amazon anymore due to concerns about practices such as this, and will not be doing so again in the future.If you're interested in receiving what you ordered and paid for, I recommend buying your headphones from a different platform."
"The bass level sounds on this ATH-M50x are muddled. I returned these and bought a competitor's headphones, and the difference was truly night and day. I don't want to name the competitor because readers might think I'm just a shill for that company, which I'm not. I wanted these to work well, but they just didn't in that respect. Moreover -- and this was the strangest thing of all for me -- during silences I heard a slight hiss. This is NOT the fault of the CD or the audio equipment I use, because again, when I used the competitor's headphones, there was no hiss at all. A final problem with these headphones is that as most others have mentioned, unless you have ears the size of a child's, the earpads on these are, quite simply, unbearably uncomfortable. They can not be classified as circumaural. They sit right on top of the cartilage on your ear and will become painful within a matter of minutes, and within an hour they will be impossible to use. If you buy these, you simply must factor in another $20-$25 to buy an aftermarket set of larger, deeper, and better cushioned earpads, which from what I've seen on You Tube are not too difficult to insert. I never got to that stage because I returned these headphones before replacing the earpads. At this price level, you can definitely do better elsewhere."
"5 Star Headphones. 0 Star packaging.I have used ATH M50x for about 15 years now. I use them almost daily. I used to replace the pads, but now  I wear all the pads out and just buy a new pair. The first pair I purchased years ago did not package the cables like this and the cables did not have any cable memory in them (other than the coil cable). The last two pair I purchased, the cables are tied together with bread wrappers and wrapped in a protective paper. These bends will never go away no matter how long you work with it. I use the short cable when I am mixing IEMs.  In one of the pics, I placed my original cable next to the new one. This may be a non-issue to some people, but in the live entertainment world, it’s a big no no. Cables must lay flat. When I am on a long production table, I use the long “straight” cable and it may cross over two or three work areas. A cable that does not lay flat is not acceptable. I almost returned them, but you can’t beat the sound for the price. Quality aftermarket cables are available and they do lay flat. It’s a shame that Audio Technica started packaging them like this."
"I am ordering replace earpads to see if that helps, but its hard to keep these on for more than 20 minutes. Wearing them with glasses is also not an option, even with contacts in they are a PAIN"
"For starters, these are recommended from the various YT reviewers because they are LOUD, or better, can get loud and really in your face sound wise since its VERY bass oriented. Most people think loudness equals quality which we know is NOT true.  Like most things in audio, these are going to be VERY subjective cans, and I laugh at the people that mock these the same as those that praise them to be the best. They are FAR from the best. They should not be praised or mocked, but appreciated for what they are meant to be used for. Studio monitoring, and banging your head to amazing overly aggressive bass while maintaining VERY good detail. Very narrow, vocals and other instruments may sound ""confined"" when compared to more open headphones. But that's why there is no ""pair does it all"" headphone. Its just not possible.Three stars because I love these cans, but they have a lot of flaws IMO. Had them for over 2 years now, DEF broke them in. Build quality is not bad. Its not amazing, but its above average for sure. Again, had them for 2+ years and they still hold up VERY well.The original pads are GARBAGE. Absolute garbage. They are tiny, they make your ear sweat and press on your earpad and really hurt after 30 minutes. Cables are GARBAGE, the headband is HUGE, and it itches after around 1 hour of use. I have to size them JUST right which is very annoying.However - IF - you get NEW deeper larger pads, IF you break them in, and IF you use (even if these don't need to, I know) even a cheap entry level DAC / DAC-AMP like the BTR5 (more amp? what? YOU MUST BE INSANE!), and IF you're into hip-hop and electronic music and want to REALLY hear that BOM BOM BOM BOM to where yes.. there will be tracks you will go ""oh F that's too much"".. then these are going to rock your F soul and you're gonna love them.IF you're someone that likes speakers-like audio, open air sounds, more sound stage more openness.. etc. etc.,  which of course we all appreciate as well but..  NOPE! You're going to throw these away and do all sorts of rituals against it because you may as well think these are Satan's cans.. But if you love acid techno like I do.. these can be a lot of fun. But that's it, and studio monitoring but I mean, yeah..Do I recommend them for above $100 bucks? No. ( I got them for $120)Do I recommend them for lower than 100? Maybe? If you read above, you decide.Do I recommend them if you want mainly listen to hip-hop and electronic, bass oriented music? -  F YES!Don't listen to these self-proclaimed ""audiophiles"" that rip on these because THEY don't like them so neither should you. That is BS. They clearly have a DIFF taste and listen to diff music. Simple as that. These are QUALITY cans with MAJOR flaws design-wise but that serve a SPECIFIC purposes and do it VERY WELL.PS: They do not have good sound stage or imagining, which makes me wonder why these clueless reviewers suggest them for gaming. These are not for gaming at all. The moment you see a vid suggesting these for gaming, unsub, they are clueless. You need open-back with wide sound stage and near perfect imaging for gaming, not bass oriented closed-backs. Come on now.."
"Used for airplane travel mostly, 4x/ yr.Dislike-Long term durability of the material. No longer able to use the headphones."
The headphones are perfect and that’s what’s most important. But the headphones weren’t shipped in amazon boxing and was left at my doorstep without proper boxing. If I wasn’t home it could have been easily seen and stolen.
"Feels comfortable, sounds nice. But the wires they provided to connect to my computer is extremely short. My tower (PC) is literally next to me (Less than 2 ft away) and it is still too short to be used properly. It reaches, but is hanging tightly. If I move just a little bit it will snap. Might be nice with phones and other short distance activities requiring headphones, but it doesn't work with my pc setup."
As soon as I opened the package I knew these headphones would not work for me.  The ear pocket is not large enough to fit over my normal-sized ears.  I didn't take the opportunity to test the audio quality as it was pointless.  These might work great for a child.
"The main reason I purchased the Audio-Technica ATH-M50X headphones was to use them for movie streaming with my Roku3, which I've used to largely replace my Sony Blu-Ray player as a streaming device.  The Sony drops streaming signals like crazy.  The Roku3, while not perfect, maintains the streaming signal much better.Back in 2012, I purchased some Sennheiser RS120 wireless headphones for use with the Sony.  They work brilliantly!  They are very comfortable and deliver terrific sound.  I paid $69.99 for them at that time.  What a bargain!  The only problem is, I can't use the Sennheisers with the Roku3.  I still use them when I'm playing DVDs, however.  So, after doing a lot of research, I decided on the Audio Technicas.  Much to my disappointment, this was a poor decision. The Audio Technica ATH-M50x have more bad points than good.  Here is a breakdown and a general summary of those points:Pro: seem to be well made overall (a few minor design annoyances but overall pretty good).Cons:1.  Sound quality is decidedly inferior to my Sennheiser RS120s.  The sound is not THAT bad, but I've become spoiled by the Sennheisers and given the fact that I paid considerably more for the ATH-M50x, I expected even better sound quality.2.  These are incredibly uncomfortable headphones.  I am a relatively small person.  I don't think I have a fat head (some may argue otherwise).  But I DO wear glasses.  Watching a typical 1 1/2 to 2 hour movie is aggravating.  They cause my ears sweat and if I don't take a couple of breaks while watching, I've wound up with earaches from wearing them.  I'm assuming this is probably because they seal so tightly that the sweat and heat is causing this to happen.  I often get headaches as well from wearing them.  No bueno.At this point, I guess I'm going to keep them since I've paid for them and have now used them enough for me to give them a good, honest evaluation.  Oh, and yes:  I've also listened to music with them, but again I just haven't been that impressed with the quality of sound. I've had other headphones in the past that have delivered better sound quality than these and that I've paid far less for.  I almost gave these 2 stars, but because the construction quality seems to be quite good, I've bumped it to 3 stars (""It's okay"").So, given my experience, I cannot recommend the ATH-MH50X headphones to anyone else.  There are simply too many alternatives out there that I believe are far superior and less expensive."
"I bought a pair of these three years ago.  Since then I have tried numerous headphones and owned a number of different cans and I realised these are, not the worst, but the most over rated headphones ever made,(or at least reviewed).  After trying other cans (some less than $100.00 more in price range) I've found that in comparison these headphone make the M50s sound muddy with poor instrumentation separation and bleedy base.All it takes is a little research and the willingness to spend a bit more or even less, perhaps returning a few pair.  Even the ATH MRS7s will provide a wake up call.  Don't just follow the masses, they have a reputation for settling for the mediocre.  There are $70.00 cans such as Audio CB-1s which sound just as good (but a tad week on cymbals). I have no adenga,  just letting you know.  The clunky oversized M50s just sit in my storage drawer unused, everytime I give them a try they sound just as unpleasant, they are quite indistinc when listing to audiobooks.  I'll probably just toss them, the same path taken by the Sampson 950s, low end AKGs, Klipsci noise cacelling cans, among others (and a ridiculously mushy over bassy set of V-Moden Cross Overs, I gave those away).The easy to drive Fidelio X2s are a nice step up for example and well worth it (I use them a lot).  Comparably priced  Fostex 50 MIII sound great with a headphone amp or strong audio output, I  also give them regular use.  Anyway there are many cans out there with superior sound compared to the (over sized clunky too large ATH M50x that can take advantage of the inexperienced ear) available for just saving a little longer before buying.Check out YouTube, consider seriously any negative reviews on Amazon. Just don't get swept along by the M50x hype machine, you may regret it when you're not completely happy with the sound or build of the M50s and have already invested in them.Learning through hands on experience but I have father to go in my search for my dream phones.  My lasted addition the HiFiMan HM400S are a bit shy on bass without a good EQ.I quess the point is don't settle on anything before trying other cans for yourself requardless of the hype. Try some blind tests with a friend or at an audio store.  Good luck!"
"When my previous pair of cans, the Superlux HD 681, died after years of usage, I decided it was time to make a good upgrade. My old headphones were not top-of-the-line quality, but for the cheap price they were absolutely amazing. After reading countless raving about the supposed quality and amazingness of these headphones, I decided they were right for me. While open headphones are generally of higher quality, my primary listening with headphones is done on the go in noisy environments, closed was the design for me. I also listen to a wide variety of music with a lot of different production styles, but I've always been a fan of melodic bass playing particularly in metal, math rock, prog rock or jazz. So hearing that these headphones had great bass response was one of the primary selling points that made me get the purchase. However, I can say with 100% certainty that I will be returning these when I get a chance to make it out to the post office.One of the giant shortcomings of the ath-m50x is the comfort/fit. I heard that these were a little tight, but I have fairly thick, curly hair so I assumed that would help cushion my ears. Unfortunately, these are the most uncomfortable and irritating headphones I have ever tried. For 1-2 hours, it wasn't so bad for me, but long term usage really hurts my ears. They clamp quite hard, don't cover your ear very well and the pads provide little cushion. You would have to mod these yourself by stretching the band or changing the pads (which I obviously have not done since I am going to return these) in order for these headphones to be even usable for a long period of time. Quite frankly, that should be completely unacceptable.What's even more important is the sound quality which turned out to be quite lacking. Depending on who you purchase from and when you purchase, expect to pay around $100-170 for them. For this price, it is reasonable to expect a high quality of sound, and a pair of headphones that will keep you coming back for more. To be honest, my initial impressions were quite good. For testing, I used my music collection in FLAC and listened in a good environment for many hours. At first, I was wowed by the apparent power and clarity. The bass gave a strong punch, and there seemed to be new details in my music.Unfortunately, this initial impression did not last. As time went on, I was able to pick up more and more flaws in the sound and the more I hated these headphones. The most egregious offender turns out to be the bass. While it is indeed powerful, it is also incredibly muddy. This was not the accurate, tight bass that I was promised at all. The sub-bass is tolerable, but the midbass and lowermids are just blurbs. If you have any music at all with legato, finger bass playing, it will be completely ruined by this junk. In addition, the rest of the mids is recessed quite far and not very loud. The treble seems okay, but when contrasted with how awful the rest of the frequency response is; it sticks out too much. These aren't clear at all. Certainly, there is more detail when compared to my old Superlux, but that should be expected of any significantly more expensive model. To drive the point home, I tested out my brother's pair of AKG's 240 which pretty much blew the m50x out of the water. It had a far more neutral sound without a nasty, bloated bass and no mids. And they cost a whole lot less as well!To be fair, the headphones do look nice. The detachable cables are cool, and the form factor/foldability is really good. I didn't have any real complaints about the build quality. However, the most important thing in headphones are the sound quality and then the comfort. To my ears, the ATH-M50x greatly lack in both of these areas. Maybe these would be good if you only want rumbling bass and piercing treble, but if you listen to any decent variety of music stay far, far away. After a long struggle of deciding between Seinheisser and AKG, I decided to try the AKG k553 Pro for my next pair given my positive experience with the brand before. My advice is to not be fooled by this overhyped nonsense. There are a ton of competitive headphones in this price range that perform and sound better. At the very least, they won't squeeze your ears into oblivion."
"Update: I'm done with these. They are a decent gateway headphone to better things, but they actually sort of suck. If you care not about clean sound, these do play loud and are comfy, the overall sound is not terrible, it's just, I'll say low quality. I respect Audio Technica, they make great stuff, the M50x fail to keep up with similarly priced Sennheiser. Opinion, obviously.I'll sell these used for about what I should have paid for them in the first place. Not complaining that they retain value, I'd just advise against them if you care about clean sound.Original review:I must admit that I was not blown away by the comfort of these headphones. They have larger ear cups, but my old $20 Monoprice set fits better for long periods of use.That is all I have to say negative here. The overall sound quality absolutely dwarfs the Monoprice unit. As you'd expect for the price difference. Be sure to get the most out of these headphones with a proper DAC and AMP. If your output device produces a hissing sound (like my laptop does) these headphones will only make that hissing sound come through crisp and clear. Use the DAC to clean up the audio, then you can begin to enjoy the experience.While many do not believe in a break-in for headphones, I found a couple days break-in to do wonders (A mix of my normal music and pink/brown noise.) Only after that did I go in and adjust all my EQ values. Worth the wait.I also played with the overall EQ in my DAC, maxing out each frequency to see how the headphones respond. Impressive on all levels. Bass is killer on these headphones - you'll never experience this bass when the EQ is flat, but with just a tiny bit of EQ bump in the DAC I was able to turn off any other system bass boosts. I try to keep it tame, not too much thumping tunes these days, but when I need a quick fix, these headphones deliver.Overall, I am extremely happy with this purchase. If you are also in the market for great sound (in a closed sound-stage for privacy and courtesy to your neighbor) and you have a little more than just a few dollars to spend, I doubt you'd regret this purchase. Just remember, good headphones/speakers like these will not mask a bad audio source, if you do not have a clean and quality audio track, you'll know it.I am ok with 320kbps MP3 format with these headphones, but 256kbps and lower have noticeable degradation. Time to re-rip my music in a lossless format. 7 year project, here I come."
"Currently the reason for this one-star rating rests entirely on the shoulders of amazon per the title above.I received these headphones on March 3rd and immediately loved them. Unfortunately, when I finally had an opportunity for extended listening today (March 7th), I experienced intermittent buzzing distortion in each earcup with the right earcup occasionally dropping out entirely for intermittent periods. These intermittent failures occurred with all three of the cable sets, which pretty much means connection short within the headset.Update (March 8th): Last night I canceled my replacement order through Amazon and after some frustrating email exchanges ended up live chatting with an Amazon Rep, who processed my full refund to my credit card. I'm appreciative of that aspect of their customer service. Earlier yesterday, I had already UPS the defective item back to Amazon.I emailed another seller and after confirming that they were more than adequately stocked, re-purchased the headphones and a free bonus gift for the same price with free upgraded express shipping directly through their website. To be fair they are an Amazon recommended seller and those of you, who take the time to review all the questions and answers for thi(S P)roduct will know whom I'm referring to. I'll have my order no later than next Wednesday. Any performance review that I write will be on their website.I've upgraded my rating on this product here to three stars, which is defined as ""It's OK"". This is the highest review that I can honestly provide here. The headphones themselves are very comfortable to my noggin and the cables have a sufficiently rugged long lasting quality. The locking mechanism on the cable is simple and effective, which is to say well engineered. It is not necessary to rotate-lock the cable in place for functionality as the connection to the left earcup is very snug. From an external, human interaction aspect, these are well designed and constructed quality headphones. From an internal Reliability/Quality perspective...short of dissection, who really knows?When working properly, the headphones sounded great. I'm not going to trash them based on receiving a defective item. It shouldn't happen, but it does occur. If it happens too frequently then that's an internal Audio Technica problem between their Reliability/Quality Engineers and the other internal stakeholders within the company. For what it's worth, I'm willing to try again and give Audio Technica another shot."
"I loved these headphones. But I had to return them.I've been having trouble hearing things thru the walls and these headphones worked like a charm. They blocked outside distractions, the sound quality was great, the detachable cords (3 different ones) were very useful and I really wanted to keep them.But...every time I would use them for extended sessions, my ears would be in excruciating pain when I was done.The last day I used them, I was recording for 8-9 hours and the pain lingered in my ears for HOURS after. I'm convinced it was because of how the headphones sat on my ear, putting pressure against my glasses. Having said that, it was my lower outer ear (the tragus...that little bump outside the outer ear) that hurt the most. I'm guessing it was me -- just not a good fit for my head -- but other headphones in this category cover my entire ear and are far more comfortable."
"sounds great, but way too much muddled bass. Yes, I ordered the 50's first! If you like to boom, the 50x could be the ones is for you! I record music, in my spare time and the Audio-Technica ATH-M70X Closed-Back Dynamic Professionals are the greatest, clear sounding bass for recording at a professional level. I adjust the sounds, even when recording sub-bass onto soundtracks. With the 70's the recordings always comes out with clean, low, Booming, Bumpin' sounds! I adjusted properly! At the end of the day, it's all personal preference. Hope this helps."
"I've owned a pair of these headphones previously; these were a replacement for a set that was stolen several years ago.  I knew what to expect, out of the box, and went in for an initial listen before starting the burn-in process that I used with my last set, and good god, the left-right balance was AWFUL.  I did the usual: checked with multiple sound sources, messed with mixer settings, swapped to a back-up cable,  etc. but it was clear from the get-go that this particular item was defective and not worth the time to even bother with anything else.  The right can was SIGNIFICANTLY quieter than the left...not the 3-5 decibels that some report due to the cable placement, but there was a 25% dip.But the really AWFUL part of this review isn't with the headphones themselves, but with Amazon fulfillment.  I ordered a replacement and was guaranteed shipping by a specific date...only to sit around and wait for several days to see NO shipping updates until I got a message this morning at 2:36 AM to say that the shipment was cancelled--Amazon rep confirmed that THEY screwed up the shipping location for the replacement headphones--and that replacement was no longer an option.I did end up with a credit to offset the higher-cost of the item, since the Prime Day price had expired with their screw-up...oh, and I still had to pay for the item AGAIN to ensure that it will arrive on time.  I'm done.  It is nearly 5:00 AM and I have already wasted FAR too much time trying to order a single pair of headphones.  Don't do it.  Avoid Prime Day like the plague and just buy from the retailer's own website or a reputable music shop.  None of this was worth it."
"Short: I think at this price point, there are better options out there (For Gaming, studio, or personal). If you set yourself up with things like a physical EQ that plugs in to your computer, with some very much needed headband cushions +velcro, you're good to go, but if you use headphones for hours throughout the day, these things will literally dent your head. These are the most AWFULLY UNCOMFORTABLE headphones I have ever encountered, and the build quality isn’t really there as it sort of just… falls apart somehow. Otherwise though the sound quality and bass is really nice, but again, only if used with an inline EQ, I use the turtlebeach EQ with bass/treble/volume/chat vol controls on it.In terms of sound quality, if youre on a desktop, it should be a sin to not have some sort of EQ or amp or whatever. If youre doing something more simple like listening through your phone, I dont think i have much to complain about.My sorrow mostly is in terms of comfort, as my scalp now feels like its lost blood circulation and every time I try to put them back on its like im getting blown out of an airlock. Buy yourself some ""headband cushions"" along with these with some velcro and you'll be set. Do not forget about an EQ if you want some decent bass and things of that nature, as that is one thing I very happy about, as these can punch some great kicks in songs.The quality is great, packaging, and other toys provided are also great, be careful with the wires though, they sort of last as long as the apple ones do and the earmuffs may need to be replaces every 2 years or so. They also look great!"
"The fit and sound of these headphones is excellent, a 5.  However after a few years all of the cushioning material, where your ears & head contact the headphones, all breaks down and flakes off.  This leaves a mess, essentially rendering them useless.  Perhaps they have improved their materials in recent years?"
"Buuuuuuut... I can't, because I bought these. Yes, the sound quality is great. No complaints there. The build quality is solid. Not the best out there, but better than average. Nice packaging, thoughtful inclusion of three different cords, cheesy, cheap-feeling pouch, etc. Im sure you've read all about that stuff. My main beef with these headphones is that they don't stay on my head. Or won't stay on my head. Or can't stay on my head. Whatever. Is the band too heavy? Possibly, though that's a weird issue now that I see it in text and think about it a little. So, is my head too big? Well, my mother doesn't walk funny and most off-the-shelf hats fit me just fine, thankyouverymuch. Bad posture? That could be a contributing factor, sure. But for whatever reason, these things just like to slide off my freaking head. I've adjusted them and readjusted them and looked closely at them and uttered swears at them. I just can't figure it out. Perhaps my flaxen hair of silk is to blame? I dunno, but it sure is annoying to have to fix them constantly or have them slide off my head suddenly. And yes, the band is kind of heavy for what it is. Maybe I just need to break them in or something. But you've been warned."
"I am having difficulty understanding how this product got so many good reviews.I bought these for office use. It did an excellent job for cancelling out the sound. I believe it is because my ears felt like Loki laying on the bi-frost bridge with Thor's hammer on his chest. I mean holly hell ... I put the headphones on my bookshelf speaker one ear on each side to expand it up. After a week, I had to give in.It comes with lots of cables yes. However, the end of all those cables that goes into the headphone is specific to the headphone. The cable end has a shape that allows it to lock into the headphone so if you loose one or you shave off the plastic on the headphone that locks your cable, you are screwed.I think some headphones have some kind of a ""driver"" built into them that will work towards the magnets' sound spectrum to give you the best output. I do not know if these have it or not but I never thought I would that much difference on different songs even within same streaming app like spotify. I mean, if your audio quality itself is bad even the slightest, you will hear it and these do nothing to nullify the effect. I had some headphones in the past that did an excellent job on steady performance throughout *cough*sennheiser*cough*I knew the Mhz range of this headphone before I bought it. For those who would like some more info on that, this headphone is a ""V"" headphone. It means that you get high bass and high treble and not much in between. It does not work for this. Lows are not really that low. Even though headphones felt like they were embedded to my skull, bass did not even feel punchy. Highs felt like they scratched my ear drums. When I was able to suffer through the pain of these grasping headphones, thinking that pain is the weakness that leaves the body, I had to take these off after may be an hour because of the very disturbing highs.I wanted to give this a chance. I really did. That is why I kept it for a week and even almost two weeks. I put them on my bookshelf speakers to stretch them out even over a weekend etc. I could not take it anymore and I returned them. I thank amazon for a swift refund. I really would not buy this headphones and definitely not for this price."
"Clean, accurate sound for the price.  Decent mid- and upper bass.  Poor isolation, not significantly better than an open back. If isolation isn’t a priority in a wired headphone, go with an open back for a superior soundstage."
"These headphones sound great for the money, but after four years of very light use, the material on the ear pieces and the headband have begun to disintegrate. So be prepared to spend $s for replacements after a couple of years if you use them a lot."
"Unfortunately, these headphones hurt my ears and the sound was harsh for vocal narration.  There was lots of sibilance also.  I wanted to like these, but went with the AKG K371 instead."
"The ATH-M50x were my first foray into the mid-range headphone realm, and while they provide a great value for the price I have found similarly priced headphones that I prefer to the M50x for a number of reason I will note below.First the positives:Pros:-Good value -Very balanced sound-Highs and lows are dynamic-Very portable-Cancels external noise very well while not leaking sound even when loud-Comes with 3 cables (straight 1.2mm, straight 3mm, coiled cable can extend to 3mm-Bass is pronounced, but not muddy-Versatile and consistent (all genres sound good on M50x)Now for the things I didn't like so much about the M50xCons:-Uncomfortable for longer listening sessions (+1hr)-Mids aren't balanced as well as lows and highs-Tunnelled sound (claustrophobic sounding with sound tunneling to ear)-Soundstage isn't up to par with similar headphones in price range (ex: HD555, or HD598)I would be willing to put up with all the cons if they were comfortable headphones but I was unable to listen to them for longer than an hour before I had to take a break. The ear pads though not great were tolerable, the issue is with the clamping pressure on the top of my head and my ears to a lesser extent. The foam lining the inside of the headphones is very thin and provides little cushion to the metal frame. I have my headphones on through large parts of my day, between classes, while studying or commuting and comfort was among my top priorities and while the M50x's do sound great, there are similarly priced headphones that I could argue perform just as admirably, while also being enjoyable to listen to for extended periods of time."
Disappointed since I read so many great reviews. Build quality is top notch but sound quality doesn’t work for me. They sound too bright and harsh.
"Maybe it was because of all the rave reviews and the higher price, but I was still slightly disappointed. I was expecting to be blown away by these, but that did not happen. Yes, they're decent quality, but I didn't find them to be FAR superior to some of the MUCH cheaper ones I've had in the past and because of that, I feel ripped off. After the first five minutes of trying them on, they started to cut out a little too.Just earlier this year, I bought some Letscom bluetooth headphones for $16 for when I worked out. Yes, the Audio-Technica have better sound quality, but $133 better? Not at all. Either way, I need monitor headphones with excellent quality for recording music, and this will do fine until I get a new pair.Other notes:The mid range does not sound as clear to me as everyone else is saying. I think they sound a bit muddy, and they're not doing any vocals any favors.Treble is quite high, and this is one of my main complaints (I like treble!!!). Some songs I have to turn down only because the treble is so piercing and not because of the volume in general. I even compared the treble sound with those $16 ones I mentioned for the most problematic songs, and the cheaper ones were much easier on the ear. How is no one talking about this?The bass IS perfect for me though. I prefer headphones to NOT be too bass heavy. These are in good range and I think most people would appreciate this part.They are also comfortable to wear (for me.. small ears)So, yeah.. they're good. But far too expensive for their quality. I was very disappointed, as I don't have loads of money to waste. Oh well.UPDATE: The sound cutting out on both my phone and computer continued. Also, later that night I realized the 1/4""  screw-on adapter was missing from the box, which is must with these (for me). So yeah, I returned these and hopefully will be getting better ones soon."
"I was excited when I first got these given all the great reviews and hype around them. Unfortunately they did not live up to the hype and are no longer a pair of headphones that I use or own. The sound on these was decent enough, but at times they felt muddy and unclear. When I listened to songs with strong vocals, these can's seemed to struggle and even had audible sibilance. The comfort leaves more to be desired as after an hour with these on, I felt like my ears needed a break and I could clearly feel them on my head clamping down. They do a good job at bass, not leaking sound, and isolating sound but that's about it. When I compared them to the pair that I ended up keeping which is the HD 598 Cs, the M50's just sounded a lot muddier while the 598's sounded a lot more clear and did a better job when it comes to mid's and high's. Also the M50's had little to no sound stage while the 598's had a surprisingly good sound stage for a closed pair of headphones. If you are debating between the M50's and the 598's, I strongly recommend the HD 598 Cs as they provide better sound, comfort, build, and are slightly cheaper than these headphones. If you want a little more detail as to why I recommend the HD 598 Cs over the ATH M50x, check out the review that I posted on the 598's product page."
"So, I'm not an audiophile. I couldn't tell you if these things have good ""sound stage"" or whatever. I've had tinnitus since I was a kid, and the best I can say is that I know the difference between headphones that sound pretty good and headphones that sound like crap. These sound pretty good. I use a set of 1More Triple Driver IEMs for walking the dog, working in the office, and flying. I actually think I like those a bit more than these, but it's close. Both these and the 1Mores are a little heavy on the bass relative to the Shure E5cs and Etymotic E4Rs I've had in the past, but I like bass, so that's a good thing as far as I'm concerned.The main thing is that these are uncomfortable with the stock ear pads. They clamp too hard, the pads don't provide enough cushion to compensate, and they're also a little too small for my (big) ears. They were annoying to wear for more than a few minutes. I replaced the stock ear pads with some larger Brainwavz memory foam pleather pads, and the headphones got about a thousand times more comfortable, and even sound a little better thanks to the increased distance between my ears and the drivers.These are definitely not the best headphones you can buy. They're probably not the best value, either. If you're willing to pour some more cash into aftermarket ear pads, though, they're pretty good. I wouldn't buy them again, but I'm not going to send them back."
"Hello,I am a screen reader user, hence I will be wearing the headphone all the time.Unfortunately, after seeing this headphone is being praised on YouTube and other website, decided to give it a shot.I agree the sound quality is cool for the price, no much bass and stuff, precisely what you would expect from a studio headphone. however,not at all comfortable for long time usage. when I received it, I couldn't wear it for more than 15 minutes, it was pressing on ears so heavily had to take it off.I thought it would be better with more usage, and true it became somewhat less tight but still horrible. I've been using it for 3 months now, it still hurts my ears, (the outside) and also creates sort of a scar bellow my ear directly.I want to get rid of the product so badly, or retrun it, but didn' thave much option, I made international purchase and I am not certain how or if it is even possible to return, in the past attemt of my friends were not successful to return an item, it ended up costing so much.I really regret throwing this much money into this product,  now i have no choice but to stay with this one at least until next black Friday or so.and also for gaming, it wouldn't game that much of stario span, quite hard to game with, but hence not designed for gaming, i am not blaming much.i don't recommend this for long usage, get it if you have a second pare of headphones and you need something to edit your audio with or so from time to time.i am stuck since this is my only headphone now.best regards"
"I'm not denying that other people genuinely like these headphones, but I bought these on the basis of the positive reviews and ended up being disappointed. I returned my ATH-M50xs. Main reason is ear fatigue. These are not bad cans for the price but they are not ""professional"" and are definitely not ""studio monitor[s]"". (But you could be forgiven for thinking they are if your reference point is Bose, Beats, and/or Skullcandy.)These are just better-than-average headphones for a reasonable price. Definitely don't buy these if you're sensitive to ear fatigue and want to listen for multiple hours per day (me).My reference earbuds/headphones:- Etymotic HF5 (current daily listener, but that's a problem if you have earwax buildup like me)- Etymotic ER6i (now discontinued)- Grado SR125 (now discontinued, same price point, bought these about 10 years ago)These are the first closed chamber over-ear 'phones I've tried. Packaging, manufacturing, comfort is all fine, detachable cable is great, etc. etc. On the sound (overgeneralizing a bit):- Bass is eh, but a bit loud and overly pronounced. Not as ""tight"" and precise compared to the Grado SR125s.- As others have pointed out, the mids are the weak spot. It's hard to describe but they don't shine through. They lack this sort of glowing harmonious quality, and they sound a bit dead and flat.- Highs were fine and precise, but I remember them sounding a bit loud, especially on the top end. This imbalance really seemed to contribute to the fatigue I experienced.I would mainly recommend these for a casual listener who mostly enjoys electronic or hip hop music (actually most of what I listen to) and doesn't get ear fatigue (pain, tiredness) from listening to regular headphones for a long time. Definitely not recommended if you like rock or classical.Disclaimer: I didn't listen to these for more than a couple hours (got ear fatigue quick) so there may be a break-in period and the sound may get better after a few days of listening.I'm still looking for a good pair of closed headphones that has (got any recommendations?) passive sound isolation and doesn't fatigue my ears. If you're not committed to the closed design, and you prefer tight, precise bass, then definitely get a pair of Grados instead. If you think these sound good, then well, uh... wait until you hear the Grados."
"I purchased a brand new pair of the legendary Audio-Technica ATH-M50x headphones earlier this month. After all the rave and hype I've read about the M50 over the years I decided to spend the money and give 'em a go. I've had them for about 15 days now. After having enjoyed my Sony 7506 Studio Monitor headphones for years, I was expecting the Audio-Technica monitors to be roughly similar in design. They are totally different.The M50x is a very comfortable headset to wear and the cable design is well-designed. I was quite pleased until I listened to them. I guess I'm somewhat of an audiophile and I expect music to be reproduced as closely as was intended by the mastering artist. These headphones sound like I'm listening through a bookcase. The super high range is way too punchy and the bass is uncontrolled. The mid range felt like a lot was missing. I thought maybe it was me... or maybe the headphones needed some burn-in time. Either way, I didn't care very much for the sound. Time to research what I was hearing.Upon finding the frequency response graphs (from a multitude of sources), I discovered the 4,000k HZ range is totally absent by nearly 20db. In fact, the entire plot is all over the place. What kind of studio monitors are these??? The point of monitors is hearing audio as close to flat-line as possible. All musicality is lost when listening with these and just 5 minutes fatigues my ears. What a piece of crap.Another aspect that bothers me is the fact they aren't completed isolated. There is a lot of sound leak and I can hear all sorts of things outside the headphones. For $170 I had expected a lot more. Are all those Amazon reviews really legitimate? I have a difficult time believing that so many enthusiasts love these headphones. Maybe nobody else actually uses their headphones. Not recommended."
The M50X performs well when you are just listening to instrumentals but I noticed any sort of lyrics play at about 30% volume compared to the instrumentals. At first I thought it was my GoXLR so I switch over to the audio jack on my computer and it was the same. Then I thought it was the sing so I played a new song that I know the levels of and it still did not play the audio correctly. I've spent the past 20 minutes messing around with the EQ levels and I can get it close but nowhere near where it should be for the price point. Save your money and get a different headset if you want good/clean audio.
"Will change my review if the replacement I got is brand new because that’s what I expected.The headphones I received were already opened and I could tell before I opened the box that the set I got were used. The headphone wires were upended and put back the best that the previous person could do, but anybody could see that these were clearly taken out and used and put back….for all I know the previous person could have damaged these and returned them. I wasn’t willing to take that risk and keep them. Also, I expected them to be brand new! I didn’t specifically order a used pair…I’m looking forward to the replacement, and fingers crossed that it’s a brand new box and headphones…that’s what I’m paying for."
"I read many reviews saying these had good bass response, which is what I was looking for, but they don't. I needed to replace my aging, falling apart Pioneer SE-MJ71 headphones which only cost $30 but were perfect after setting the equalizer to the right settings. These ATH-M50x do sound OK without using an equalizer, but bass really dropped out and no equalizer adjustment brings it back without causing distortion. For comparison, the cheap Pioneer SE-MJ71 has a frequency response of 5 Hz to 28,000 Hz. These ATH-M50x are advertised as 15 Hz to 28,000 Hz, but I doubt it. I've tried all sorts of audio types from low end mp3 to flac to cd and even some super high fidelity tracks that are on my Blue Man DVD, but the bass just isn't there. I'll use them for watching TV, but will be looking for a better set of headphones for my music collection, even if it costs 10x more. Just to clarify... I'm not a bass head. Some of my music collection includes super low bass horns such as the tuba, serpent, bassoon, and sousaphone. You can barely hear the really low notes at all with these, and would not even know they were there if you hadn't first heard them with better headphones.Update: I installed a USB-DAC http://amzn.com/B00LP3AMC2 to see if I could wake up the bass on these headphones. It's definitely the best audio I've ever heard so far on headphones. Clear & crisp audio, but the super low notes are still missing compared with the other headphones."
I was cursed with large ears and the headphone cups were not big enough. There's also a lot of good competitors at this price range and I did not find that this headphone stood out much.
"Love these headphones - bought 4 of them for our professional audio production facility.  Of the 4 ATH-M50X boxes we received, all of them were open box items.•One was missing the 1/8"" to 1/4"" adapting jack.•One box contained a used .45 caliber gun cartridge (WTH??).•One other box didn't even contain the M50X headphones.  There was a cheap, used, duct taped, set of USB headphones with disintegrated ear pads.  Totally unacceptable.I don't recommend buying these from this seller / Amazon.  They're the same price at Sweetwater, and you'll be guaranteed a new / unused product."
"The sound quality was pretty good across a broad frequency range.  They were maybe not the best I've ever heard, but they were pretty close to optimal and quite pleasing to listen to.  But the construction is pretty abysmal for the price point.  The ear-cups are held in position against the head by the tiniest tab of plastic held in position by other tiny tabs of plastic, all of which are prone to snapping under ordinary use.  I'm pretty resourceful so I repaired them multiple times over the time I had them, constructing sturdier pieces to hold the ear-cups in position.  This worked until the thin plastic swivel holding the ear cups also snapped, clipping the wire running through it clear off.  I'm done struggling to fix this junk.Under extremely gentle use consisting of sitting on a desk and putting them on my head calmly, these headphones lasted 5 years.  It's not months, it was years, but that's pretty short for how long a good pair of headphones should last under gentle use.  Going cheap on the material for all the stress points is a terrible design choice, Audio-Technica, and I intend to buy from another manufacturer for my next pair of headphones."
"I had to return these as the bass response was weak and prone to overdriving. Also, the left cup kept cutting out and was constantly plagued with static. Built quality was disappointing as I was expecting more from an upper mid-level product. Lots of plastic, and were quite ill-fitting despite the fact I have an average head and ear size. Would not recommend based on their price point. There are other, better options out there for less."
"I'm a fan of Audio Technica's headphones in general -- I own two of this model. Their audio quality is top notch for the price. You can listen to anything from music to amateur podcasts with these. There's no gimmicks like overblown bass or the tinny sounds of cheap headphones.But the ATH-M50x has a major design flaw. Without even trying you can snap back the spring-loaded hinge that holds the headphone against your hear. This hinge is the one built into the silver bit on either side that says L and R (left and right, respectively.)A quick Google search reveals many others with this problem, and just as many solutions: rubber bands, glue, 3D printed fixes, etc. While I haven't gone quite as far as 3D printing anything, none of the simpler solutions work terribly well to fix the hinge once it's been over-extended. It's a shame because these headphones are otherwise built to last with many of the parts including the wire and the pads easily replaceable once they're worn out or lost.So I'm giving the ATH-M50x a three out of five stars simply because the poorly designed hinge component doesn't live up to the quality I'd expect from Audio Technica."
"I bought these headphones five years ago and use them regularly especially for plane rides or just hanging around the house cooking. I love the sound that comes out of these headphones is great, but I have started to notice about six months ago that the material around the ear padding was stuck to my ears and top of my head and its falling apart. It’s disappointing to pay so much for a Headphones that fall apart but like I said, the headphones sound great after the break in period just expect to buy new ones after 5 years."
"These headphones have great sound but they are not comfortable for long time use! I bought these for work but I can't wait to replace them after having them for over a year. I'm a web developer and I wanted headphones I can use to listen to music throughout the day while I'm at work. These leave my ears hurting with a lot of discomfort due to the pressure they apply. I've noticed I don't listen to music as much at work as I do when I work from home and that's because I'm always taking the headphones off shortly after putting them on. At home I have Sennheiser HD 598 headphones, which have excellent sound and comfort, but I can't bring them to work because they don't have sound isolation and can be heard from a considerable distance when I use them. I'm now considering getting the Sennheiser HD 598 CS which have sound isolation and likely much more comfort than these Audio-Technica headphones. It's a shame because these ATH-M50x headphones really do have good sound even without a DAC. I just can't bare to have them on for over an hour. I'm a 6ft 200lb male and I don't consider my head overly large by any means. Perhaps someone with a much smaller head could enjoy these more."
"The sound is great.  If I was rating on sound quality alone, it would be 4-5 stars easy.  They are very comfortable, and they naturally block out ambient noise sufficiently. Noise cancelling headphones I have tested do only a little bit better, but they make my ears feel weird after a few minutes. No such problem with these guys!I have to knock off a couple of stars for two very simple usability screw-ups. First, the headphone jack that it comes with does not fit completely into my phone (with no case on!) and most airplane ports I have tried.  It has a piece of plastic at the base of the jack that makes it pop out of the port with even slight movement.  I shaved off some of the plastic around the metal piece with a box cutter, and that seems to have fixed the problem. But why do I have to modify the jack so that it works with normal devices!?The second feature that ticks me off is the headphone cable itself.  It is detachable, and it comes with 3 different chords with different lengths and tips.  That would be cool by itself, but the end that plugs into the headphone is a special size! So if I lose the chord (or destroy it with a box cutter while attempting to modify it), I cannot simply grab a replacement from a local electronics store."
"I used these headphones for a little over a week before i decided to return them.Cons: The ear cups were way to small for my ears so the foam on the inside would press up against my ears resulting in my ears hurting after 30 min of use. The headphone on my head felt like vise also resulting in my head hurting. I couldnt concentrate on games i was playing cuz all i could think about was my head being crushed. I game/listen to music for 2+hrs at a time so i need them to be comfortable. The feeling of relief after taking off the headphones is not something i look for in ""studio monitor headphones"".  Footsteps for other players would sound like they were way behind where they were actually running. I feel like i have a normal sized head/ears so these shouldnt feel that bad but maybe i needed to break them in more. Or possibly buy new ear muffs but i feel for the price i shouldnt need to do that.Pros:They dont need much to power them at 32ohms so its nice to use them with my phone but i prefer earbuds so i can lay down while listening to music. Plus earbuds fit in my pocket when im out and about. They also come with a bunch of different cords and a leather carrying bag so thats really nice.Overall i wouldnt recommend these headphones to anyone whos looking for amazing sound quality and comfort. If you just want some overear headphones that sound alright and you can use with your phone for the price you cant really beat the ATH-M50x."
"The earcups on these are way too shallow to be over the ear headphones, your ears will press on the plastic of the drivers and hurt after a short amount of time, and I have average sized ears. The headband has very little cushioning for the top of your head and will also hurt after using them after an extended amount of time.I have a bigger than average head and these just do no work, unfortunately. If you plan on getting these and know you can handle the very little padding on the headband, know you will probably need new earcups.Despite those two negatives, I am pleased to say the audio is very good. I don't have the most experience with studio style headphones but these are awesome in the sound department.TLDR: Amazing sounding headphones but the experience is ruined by little to no thought on comfort. I ended up returning them."
"First and foremost, I am not an audiophile by any means, but I can appreciate and acknowledge good sound quality when I hear it. If you get these for watching movies or for listening to music, they are pretty damn good. However, if you get them for gaming, then you are going to be a bit disappointed. First, there is no built in microphone and I know most audiophiles think it is a Cardinal sin to have a built in microphone on a set of high quality headphones, but this is almost a must for competitive gaming. Sure you can buy a desktop mic, but most of the ones on the market aren't that good and unless you want to spend a few hundred dollars on a high quality mic, it just isn't worth it in my opinion. My second biggest gripe is that these are not comfortable, especially for long gaming sessions. I have adjusted them to fit my head and anything more than an hour gives me a headache and hurts my ears. Bottom line, these headphones produce great sound with nice base and the price isn't too bad. However, they are rather uncomfortable for long periods of time and they aren't particularly great for gaming."
Based on the affordable price. The quality and sound is a deal. Some headphones which are similar in features cost more.
"If you're basing this on pure audio quality these are spectacular. I'm not sure how I feel going from open to closed back but the sound signature is undeniably good. Along with that it sounds unique. There really is no replicating these headphones, pairing it with a decent DAC will also do it wonders. I don't necessarily  see the use in an AMP as my onboard audio drove it fine but if you have on available its worth using. Now the major con with these headphones are the comfort. Its horrendous, nearly unusable. I'd get the sudden, overpowering urge to remove these after around 30 minutes due to the awkward clamping force. The earpads also contribute to this issue as there's not enough cushion thus causing my ear to press up against the driver. A 3rd party replacement set of earpads fixed this issue but not without destroying the low end making the experience similar to a gaming headset. Modding of the earpads was needed to restore the sound to normal. Overall I think these headphones sound great, amazing even. But a product shouldn't need modding to make it shine."
"I was really disappointed with these out of the box. I got them to replace my Siberia V2s. The sound quality is superb, easily the best sounding headphones I have used, but they are very uncomfortable, especially compared to the Siberias which is like the gold standard of headphones comfort. The cables are also very bulky at the source end so they're really hard to plug into a phone.I made some modifications which made the headphones a lot more enjoyable.1. I removed the proprietary cord locking mechanism. It's really easy, just requires removing a few screws. You can find tutorials on youtube.2. I got a 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapter so I can use standard cables3. I replaced the earcushions with Brainwavs Replacement Memory Foam Earpads. These earpads are much bigger than the stock ones so they leave much more room for the ear. The stock cushions pushed up against my ear which was very uncomfortable.f4. I taped on a battery powered bluetooth adapter. This made a nice wireless conversion. When I want to use it wired, I just unplug the bluetooth adapter and let it dangle, and I plug in the new cable.They're still not as comfortable as the Siberias but they're a lot better than before."
"Not sure why the black pair is cheaper feeling than the white pair I have, something is a bit strange about the sound quality, but I can't place it yet.It is harder to hear the subtleties even with the volume way up compared to lower volumes with the white pair."
"If you want headphones that are airy, comfortable, and nicely constructed, the ATH-M50x is all of those things.  If you're really into music and love to hear every note and the slightest nuance, these are probably better left at the store.  I know that a lot of people are really happy with these headphones, and in the past, I would have considered these decent.  However, I bought these and a pair of harmon kardon headphones.  Maybe its not fair to compare them side by side, and while the HK's are not as comfortable (by a long shot) they sound so much better, that I just can't in good conscience give these a passing score.  I've actually returned these headphones to amazon for this reason, and gone back to the HK's which are so much better in my opinion.--Edit based on comments--I have the  Harman Kardon BT Premium Over-Ear Headphones with Bluetooth Technology        .  My music taste varies, I do listen primarily to Rock and Roll, but as an example of the music I listened to to compare these the ATH-MX50x to my HK:  I listened to The Eagles, Boston, Led Zeppelin, Metalica, Def Leppard, The Cars, Rush, Adele, and yes even the Beastie Boys (Brass Monkey).  So as you can see I like many styles and kinds of music, rock, pop, classical, and blues.  In particular, I really compared these two headphones while listening to Adele's 21 album.  The angst in her voice, the layers of the music are so much more enveloping with the Harmon Kardon. Tracks like Brass Monkey demonstrate the bass response, something that is rather flat on the ATH-M50x.  I will not say these are bad headphones, and for what it's worth, a 2 star rating is not a negative review, it simply means that I didn't like them, and I've done my best to explain why.I hope this helps!"
"Was excited to try these headphones because they look great and have great noise isolation, but the sound is so bad. There's no bass and the music sounds far away. There's very little depth, compared to my Grado Labs headphones. I'm sure if I was inclined to do so I could try to equalize but the problem is that the equalizer settings would be on my PC only, so if I use the headphones on my phone or iPad it would still sound pretty bad. Very disappointed. If you enjoy full/warm music, you probably won't enjoy these headphones."
"So I will start by saying that I probably had an incomplete experience of this product. I do not own any high-end stereo equipment, and I listen to most of my music on my phone or my laptop.I ended up returning these headphones. If I was listening to different types of music or listening on different equipment, who knows, I may have kept them. But as a person who mostly listens to streaming music that is heavy on guitars and higher vocals, these were really not for me. I found that the lows were super pleasant and accurate, the mids were passable, and the highs were harsh. Using these headphones, I found it very difficult to enjoy rock music, which is my go-to genre. I will say that I tried some other types of music for testing purposes (electronic, jazz, pop) and they sounded much better with all of those than they did with rock.Anyway, if you are an EDM, hip-hop, jazz or pop fan then go for it. But don't expect these to make your guitar riffs any better than tolerable."
"So, for the most part these are amazing headphones for the price. Sound quality, including bass volume, is amazing. I find incredible fidelity whenever I use them. However, there is a significant flaw that will most likely render these useless after about a year of daily use that you should be aware of. There is small piece of plastic that holds in the hinge that holds the ear cups to an angle that fits your head snug. After about a year of constant use, this fails and breaks. Both times I have purchased these, after a year of constant use this piece has broken, making the right side pull away from my ear (strangely the right side both times). I haven't had this issue with cheaper headphones ever, making me believe this is  planned obsolesence for this product. As much as I love these headphones, it's difficult to recommend them since you'll most likely need another pair after a relatively short period of use."
"I'm not a music professional by any means, but music is everything to me & listening on a good quality pair of headphones for the last 30 years has been a critical task for me. I wanted something similar to the good base I enjoyed from a pair of beats by dr dre 1st gen I had back in 2011. These do have a good crystal clear sound, more so for mids & highs, may be good for monitoring, mastering, mixing music. They are comfortable to wear & have excellent sound cancellation.However, for just everyday listening these are not a favourite. The bass response is too muddy and weak, & overlaps the other sounds.. I was Disappointed. Before these, I had purchased the Sony WH-1000XM3 and I wish they had the wired option, but the bass even on those are still not deep/punchy enough, high hopes to find the Absolute soon!!"
"Build quality and comfort are great on these headphones. The downside came when I listened to them. There is a HUGE peak in the frequency response at 10khz. It's very obvious to me, and it is not a good thing. This, along with some other obvious frequency response problems caused me to do a bit of research. Response issues can largely be fixed by digital equalization.  I came across a graph of the freq response by sonarworks, and the graph showed exactly what I was hearing. Ive attached a picture. I was able to use their graph, along with Au Lab and sound flower for mac to create a systemwide EQ that flattens the response out. Sonar works also sells a flattened EQ that I would suggest using if you plan to do any audio mixing with these. Here is their review :http://sonarworks.com/2015/05/audio-technica_m50x_headphone_review/Once balanced out, the headphones sound pretty amazing. The low frequency extension is impressive. The downside is that I wouldn't dare use these with my iPhone or any other device that didn't have an EQ. The frequency response is just too offensive to my ears."
"I'm as stunned as you to have to give two stars...trust me....but they're now packaged up with a return slip and going back to amazon.PROS:Great sound quality, build quality, and good price give it the first two stars.CONS:Comfort is absolutely terrible, shocking, and ultimately the death blow to these headphones.Beware the other reviews gushing about this headphone.  I have a pair of $100 studio headphones from Audio-Technica that I still use....are amazing on sound quality...ridiculously comfortable for hours..etc.  I also have a $350 Astro A40 headset that is amazing but has lower sound quality than these headphones, but also can be worn for 3 hours with no discomfort.  But not these headphones!  The pressure on my small skull was evident the second I put them on and I talked myself out of it being an issue. The next day we hit the road for a 2,000 mile journey....and I didn't make it 90 minutes with these before a massive pressure headache occurred and traveled all the way down my neck.  I take them off....within 10 minutes the pain went away.  The next day....put them on for an hour and it was all i could take before it was killing me.  The next 6 days were spent with crappy earbuds.If you have a larger head then the earpieces can be extended, which leads to lower overall pressure, so it might work for you.  But these are just the right fit for me so I do not have to extend the earpieces at all and they make a perfect match to my headshape.  Too bad that this allows for the maximum pressure to be put on my skull......"
"I bought these assuming the hype could not possibly be wrong.  It was wrong.I didn't hate these headphones.  I bought them with high expectations which they did not meet, for a couple of reasons:1) I found them tight and uncomfortable, and they made my head warm.  They also exerted too much ""pressure"" (of the sort that you expect with closed back headphones) and I didn't enjoy wearing them. I never forgot they were on my head, as I like to do.2) The sound quality was not bad, but they weren't any better than my much cheaper SteelSeries Siberia headset. I read another review in which the guy got it spot on.  He said something like this: When I buy a new pair of headphones, I re-listen through my entire collection excited to hear something new.  With Audio-Technica, there was just nothing new to discover.I returned these after 4 days of hopeful listening, and I never grew fond of the sound.Bottom line: They aren't necessarily bad, but they aren't the revelation I hoped they would be."
"I purchased Audio-Technica headphones on Amazon on October 2019 from a seller named Tech Sales USA. Seven months later, the right headphone stopped working completely. I believed all AT products come with a two-year warranty, but when I looked this up on the AT website, I found that Tech Sales USA is on an ""Unauthorized Online Resellers"" list and therefore is not eligible for warranty. At the time of purchase, I bought two pairs of the same headphones (ATH M50x)—one from a legit dealer, and the other not—both from the same Amazon page. Guess which one has stopped working. At the time, I believed I was buying directly from Amazon Services, because that is what I initially selected from the Amazon search window. However, the seller changed without my notice to an unauthorized dealer when I switched the preferred product color. Amazon needs to do a much better job being transparent to customers about who they are buying products from and alert you when the seller changes suddenly because you wanted (for instance) black headphones instead of blue ones. Amazon should also be much more forthcoming about which sellers are actually authorized dealers and which are going to send products not eligible for a warranty. I'm not abdicating all responsibility for this—I do a ton of homework when I buy products—but when the seller changes midstream simply because you tweaked something minor on the page, that's willful deception on Amazon's part and I think we deserve better.I've contacted Tech Sales USA to inform them about the defective product they've sent me. I'll update this review when I hear how they plan to remedy the situation."
I liked the sound quality of these headphones enough to keep them past the return period but 2 years down the line I'm having second thoughts. The materials on the headband and pads just don't withstand the normal wear and tear of daily use very well. They start flaking off after maybe 6-8 months of use. 2 Years later they have worn down so much I had to order some replacement pads for $25.  Anything but the original pads alters the sound profile of these headphones so don't think you can buy some cheaper replacements off amazon and call it a day.The flaking might be a problem for all faux leather padding but for $150 I would really have expected these to last at least 5 years. Audio-technica should make it cheaper and easier to buy replacement pads if they are gonna wear out this fast.
"I guess I have a fat head.  I wear a 7 5/8 fitted cap.  Or I have a stupid head.Nonetheless, these are my first set of ""pro"" cans.  They quickly taught me how great real headphones can be.  The clarity - especially on spoken word and a cappella stuff... it was illuminating.  I was hearing breathing points I never knew existed.Yet I was always highly aware I had them on.  They never disappeared.  They are heavy and the band sits right on the skull.  Shift it forward, middle, or back... no difference.I'm used to having seriously heavy stuff on my head for hours on end (see title).  Yet these bugged me.  Such a bummer... I've wanted these for quite literally years and still hesitate to return them for the Sony MDRs but I don't see much of a choice.  Plus I don't think I can justify the premium cost - I'm not that discerning.That said... these cans also pointed out the utterly crappy piano samples in my circa 2002 Roland digital piano.  So watch out... these will show the weak spots in your other gear!"
"Update: After 2 years of ownership and being stored in a desk drawer when not in use (in other words, not abused), the ear cup padding material is flaking off. For a high-end, higher priced product, I expect more longevity.I'm coming from Sennheiser HD280s, so compared to the HD280s, the ATH-M50x provide a lot more clarity across the range, and are expressive in low end where the HD280s were silent.  The ambient attenuation seems similar, but I do hear more sound leaking out from the ATH-M50x.  Not a negative for me, but possibly important in other settings to other people.I got these as a replacement to a Sennheiser HD280 pro set, mostly because the darn coiled cable of the HD280s was chaining me to my desk chair at work, and otherwise being a coiled pain.  So I knew I wanted something with a straight cable, or better an interchangeable cable.  ATH-M50x to the have been delivered to me by fate, and just in time!  The HD280s served well for many years and sound very good, but the M50x does out class them by a good amount."
"These sound awesome!  I have them plugged into my PC to listen to music while I am working and some games.  The sound is crisp and accurate.  The highs are well defined but don't sound tinny while the base is perfectly low but doesn't sound muddy.  To me, they sound perfect.  The bad side is while it does include 3 cables with the locking mechanism on one end they don't include a simple adapter so one can use existing cables with them.  I already have a nicer cable than they provide but it won't fit in the locking adapter port.  Found an adapter on Amazon ... for almost $50.  Are you f#$%g kidding me?  Such a simple, VERY SIMPLE, STUPID SIMPLE, thing to include yet it isn't.  -2 stars for that incredibly stupid oversight."
"Audio-Technica ATH-M50X Professional Studio Monitor Headphones, Black, Professional Grade headphones sound very good but the ear piece Foam is very Hard uncomfortable to put over your ears for more than 1.5 hours.."
"Sound is impressive, but comfort is lacking.  I find the headband uncomfortable-- the padding there is not sufficient for me.  I can only wear the ATH-M50x for short periods (10-15 minutes) and then need to move/adjust the headband to disperse the pain on the top of my head. Regardless of how I adjust it, the headband hurts. I compared the headband padding to my son's $100 gaming headphones and thought their headband padding was better.  The ear pads and associated pressure are good-- I don't find them too tight and the padding there is fine. All three cords are high quality, and the cord versatility is a nice feature. Sound is the best I've heard at this price range, but for me the great sound gets lost due to the comfort factor.  I thought the pain from the headband may just be me given all the reviews of how comfortable these are, so I had my wife try them, and independently without prompting she too said the headband hurt the top of her head.  There doesn't appear to be anything wrong with them in terms of defects-- just the headband padding design seems lacking."
I found much better performance from a much less expensive pair of over the ear headphones with larger magnets.
"I have pair of AT M40 headphones which produce a flat response. I wanted an upgrade, this isn't it. These headphones are not worth the pretty penny charged. First the 50's are uncomfortable and heavy. Compared to the 40's they do sound fuller but not by much. They put pressure on my head immediately after putting them on, that was my first impression. 2nd they are extremely heavy. I also have a pair of BayerD DT-880 which are a dream in comfort compared to these new M50's. These 50's isolate sound more but what wouldn't as tight as they are? I Just can't keep these as they are a step down not up in terms of comfort and sound quality tech between my other 2 pairs. I will be returning these and searching for a higher end set of phones. At that price point, I can do better, just need to keep searching..."
Sound quality is pretty good but what the deal breaker is comfort. I'm wearing these headphones for playing games and voice chats for4-10+ hours at a time and after about a hour it feels like my ears are being crushed. Very little padding with a super tight fit really really hurts
"So far, so good.  I haven't had these for a long amount of time, so my review may need some updating in the future should things change.  For now, the headband gets some getting use to.  The headband needs to be moved forward near your forehead so the headset could be a more comfortable fit around your ears.  So you can guess that this may be uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time.  2nd, the plug on the left ear could be annoying at times.  The plug extends out & reaches my shoulder which puts the cord in my way.  Sound wise, the headset is great!  I have NO complaints about the sound or frequency response.  Let the music play!  My 3 stars are for the comfort.  If that was better, then it would've been 5 stars all the way."
"I guess my expectations were too high.I needed headphones with sound isolation to use in an air plane to a trip to Europe. I don't  like noise canceling headphones, so those were not an option.After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to order the Audio Technica ATH-M50x. In one word, ""disappointed"". I can see how teens may like this sound signature, but I really didn't like it. The bass is so pronounced that it bleeds into the mids. The mids are so recessed that some times it is really hard to understand song lyrics, or even worse to understand movie dialogues. What is is hard for me to understand is that these headphones are used by professionals, really??????I decided to return the Audio Technica M50x and I ordered the Shure SRH840. The 840 WOW!, seriously WOW! They are about $30 more expensive than the M50x, but the moment you listen to them, you instantly forget you spent the extra $$$."
"These headphones are amazing, they have great definition and bass but the one gripe I have about these is the imbalance in volume between the two sides, it's the smallest difference, most noticeable when the output is turned down very low. The left ear cup is slightly louder than the right, I produce music and was attracted to these headphones because of that. This issue is detrimental when it comes to layering instruments and vocals, no matter what software you use. Overall I love and recommend these headphones but wish there was more consistency and I didn't have to send them back, deal with amazons system, and wait a week before going back to my creative work."
"There are better headphones for the money out there. As of Nov 2022 these are listed at $169. The bass is boosted and boomy, the bass muddies the mids, the mids are recessed, and the treble is harsh. I compared them to HD6XX, AKG K361, and DT700 Pro X -  the M50X had the worst sound to me. They just sound cheap and like something you'd get at Best Buy 25 years ago. If you can get these for under $100 as entry point to good headphones and you really like the V shaped sound, it may be worth it. If you are looking for high end sound look elsewhere. (The HD6XX for $220 blows these out of the water)"
"Before I comment, I want to mention that these headphones are pretty good for people who prefer clarity over bass. If you're expecting these headphones to have decent bass, you'll be disappointed. I returned these simply because I felt they did not have enough bass at all. The music I listened to felt like it needed something. It didn't make much of a difference to the songs I listened to compared to other headphones. It's very comfortable though. Not sure why people are complaining about the comfort. They all must have insanely large heads because these are the most comfortable pair of headphones I've ever owned. They feel like a pillow is resting on my head.So other than that, these headphones are pretty good for the price. But if you're expecting bass, look elsewhere."
"Pros:-Amazing, comfortable sound profile long listening of all music and gaming with good punchy bass.-Decently comfortableCons:-You will likely have to replace the ear-cups and headband assembly multiple times over the lifetime of these because the pleather coating will peal/flake off over time. Probably within the end of a year or after the first year of owning them, which won't be covered under warranty, so calculate this into the cost of owning these. While spending 40 dollars and some time on replacing these, it's better than re-buying them new, but still not fun. An alternative for the long term flaking would be to buy a headband cover, and aftermarket earpads that are of a cloth type of material instead of pleather coated ones that come with it."
The sound is excellent but you must use their cord. If you damage the cord you can't go out and buy a replacement as it has a twist lock that is not normal.
"I purchased this set of headphones back in 2017 and have retired them as of 2021.In the 5 years of ownership I was initially very happy with these headphones, However as they aged the pleather like material has begun to peel away. And the foam padding has lost its comfort entirely, if you have ears that stick out more then the average person you will note that these headphones become painful to wear for extended periods of time. The sound quality is great! However if you are looking for these to last you for a significant amount of time I would save your money for a higher quality pair of headphones."
"Had these for three years. They sit on my spare desk and I use them once every few months or so for an hour. The rubber coating on the earcups has started to peel in multiple places, just from aging. Not pleased about this."
"These new M50X versions of the ATH-M50 sound different than the older ATH-M50's.(as is the case these days, many things seem worse that were made recently)The first thing that immediately hit me was the weird EQ curve/notch present where Hi-Hats sit in the audio spectrum with with these headphones. Bizarre -Never heard any headphone with this particular flaw. And I like Audio Technica stuff, Mic.'s in particular. It's like everything sounds rosy and then all of a sudden you realize, what the hell is a Hi Hat doing sounding so irritating?Yes, they do sound punchy, (excellent bass) musical and enjoyable in a lot of ways, but I could not get past hearing a sector in the upper midrange EQ so clearly off kilter. Given that flaw, I could not even track with these, as this would be noticeable and drive one crazy.Got returned immediately, 10 minutes later."
"These headphones are ok, but I don't understand some of the raving qualities folks have about them.The build quality on these is solid, the padding feels great. I loved how you could get these to fold up into a small space usage piece.These are not very neutral (emphasis on treble in the mids) and they're a bit forward, bad recordings really are hurt by this. The lows are almost non-existent. I don't need Beats (nor does anyone) but I do want to hear more than a basic thump. The soundstage is non-existent and the music feels very limited.I would actually say, TV shows/movies are what sound great with these headphones. Watching a drama the vocals come through great, in watching Selma, the intonation of the actors really was great. But these are headphones that I would largely use for music. Not a fan."
"Sound is great but the padding falls apart and disintegrates into your hair, face, ears, etc.  People will ask you “what is that black stuff all over your head?”  I bought two pairs but will not buy from this brand again."
"Awesome sound, as expected. I also own the $30 ATH series, which I use for console gaming, but when it comes to PC gaming, I wanted the very best. These are certainly no exception to that! Crisp highs, mids, and lows. The best sound quality I've experienced to date.Edit: I've owned these headphones for 2 and a half years now, and the black cushions are starting to dry rot and crumble to pieces, leaving black flakes all over my ears and neck after using them for extended periods of gaming. The sound quality has diminished a bit too, particularly the lows and highs, leaving me to speculate about the long term durability of the materials used to make the driver. I will soon be replacing these headphones, solely because of the crumbling cushions, which also happened with my last pair of headphones (Sony)."
"The quality of the cushions is subpar, causing them to shed and adhere to my clothing and hair"
"I'm on a computer most of the time I'm home, weather that's for gaming, listening to music or browsing the web in general. These headphones are great for listening to stuff, in fact they sound really good but the problem I have with them is how tight they are. These things clamp on to your head that it gets very uncomfortable very fast. You can adjust the ear cups and that helps a little bit but it doesn't make the thing not looser on your head. These are great if you're using them an hour at a time but anything longer than that and you'll just be uncomfortable."
"These are very good for sound, but NOT for noise cancellation.  I bought these for a 12 hour overnight flight and most unfortunately, I could hear the two ladies yapping across the aisle behind me for HOURS!"
"I spent hours looking for a pair of headphones I would love. I watched so many review videos and read so many and these headphones got high marks. I was looking for quality not a brand name. I thought these were them, but I was very wrong. I actually came to the conclusion that everyone who gave those great review were paid bc I didn't like these at all! I tried so much to like them, but I couldn't get past the fact that it was like high pitch  screeching in my ear. The kind of screeching that would give you a headache. I listened to several different artists and songs and it sounded like the  the artists were squeaking at a high high pitch. My dog even left the room. I do not know if it is the pitch or what it was, but it was horrible. The only time I wouldn't hear the high pitch was when the volume was turned down really low. Low to the point of background elevator music, probably lower. I tried playing with the EQ, but it didn't work. I wish I never bought them.  Heads up no matter what anyone says these are not good headphones or noise cancelling. Well except if you think noise cancelling is turning it all the way up, but don't do that. The screeching will be unbearable. Trust me don't do it"
"Don't get me wrong, they sound great. Audio quality is very good in my humble opinion. Easy to use and the cushions are fantastically soft.The issue I have with them is I found them on a list of ""headphones good for large ears"". They are not. I have both large ears and my ears poke almost straight off the side of my head. The pads are not large enough to be over ear headphones for someone resembling a chimpanzee like me. While the cushion is soft, it still hurts my ears after about an hour of use.I'm sure these are fantastic for most costumers, but not for the large eared variety of headphone users."
"The sound is excellent.  When I first tried them, I could hear frequencies that were missing in my cheaper headset.  However, the ear cups are too small, my ears won't fit in them.  If they are designed to be on the ears, they are too big.  If they are designed to be over the ears, they are too small.  And my ears aren't particularly big.If you want to hear the mix, so you can tweak your mixdown, these are good for the price.  But if you want something for extended listening, you might find that your ears don't fit, and you'll get the same pain I have."
"I have had these headphones for quite a while now, but i dont use them as often as i use some smaller earbuds that i have.I noticed a few months ago that the outside layer of the foam pads started to flake and fall off.I couldnt help but notice that i was walking around with some black stuff in my shoulders and hair.  You can see in the picture how easily this lining is falling from the foam, i rubbed the two pads together for a few seconds and ended up making sich a mess.Other than that, i can never be fully appreciative of the sound quality of these headphones."
"I really wanted to like these cans - especially with the number of glowing reviews. Sadly, I was disappointed. Remember - these are headphones so all of this is subjective. I found them to be quite uncomfortable. No matter how I tugged and adjusted, I simply could not get these to set on hy head without pinching some part of my ears. Also, even with the house temp at 68 degress F, after about half an hour the ear cup surrounds became moist and sweaty. The sound was my greatest disappointment.Perhaps attempting to aim at the market that prefers boomy electronic bass, there seems to be a huge bump in the mid lows and a surprising lack of midrange. The upper frequencies also seems a bit to attenuated for my tastes. I sampled music across a wide range of genres and found the same signature throughout. Listening to solo guitar with the paucity of midrange left the recording sounding hollow. No matter the subject matter, the bottom end seemed unnaturally thick and lacked the kind of definition I was looking for.While some may be perfectly comfortable with the voicing of these cans, they weren't for me and they most certainly don't fit my definition of reference headphones."
"I use headphones daily for music and listening to TV or YouTube talk.  The pair of M50's was about a year old when the headband and earpads started flaking, but I soldiered on another year and a half before I sent for the M50x, because the sound was what I am looking for.  This pair needed ear pads and headband cover in less than a year and in a year and a half the left ear channel went dead.  So, I got out the M50's and replaced the earpads.  Worked great for a few months until now when the left ear channel went dead.  Repair is nearly as expensive as purchasing new. For two sets of headphones that have traveled no further than the desktop to my head and back and have never been dropped, it's not a good thing.Update on 3/29/22:  Third set, but this time with right ear failure less than 1 year.  That's it, no more."
"The sound is good and clear but the treble is WAY TO HIGH. That is a problem. It can be very misleading when mixing. I also think the base could be just a bit higher.  As an independent musician who creates Hip-Hop, Trap, R&B, Alternative, Funk, 80s, Reggae, Pop, and more, I would not recommend these. They are not worth the price."
"Apparently, I won the lottery with my monoprice dj headphones.  I have been using them for years (they break every 18 months or so) and I really cannot tell a large enough difference between them and the ath-m50x's.  I spent all day a/b testing flac files with them through my retina mbp regular audio jack and on my pc that has a dac  (mac sound is ok to listen at full vol. pc is painfully loud at 75%).  Every sound can be heard just as clearly on both, there were no revelations of hearing drums or cymbals roll off longer.  There was no greater immersive sound.  There was no new noticeable breathes or finger slides on a guitar.  The monoprice cans have a touch higher highs but I really had to listen.I started freaking out in the afternoon that my hearing was broken because thousands of people think the ath-m50x's are incredible. I ran tone tests through both headphones on both systems and heard and didn't hear the exact same things on both.Either the ath-m50x's are just ok, or my monoprice headphones are incredible.  I doubt I got a dud pair as they sound fine, no crackling or hissing, the artwork and molding all look like any pictures I have found.I was expecting a huge jump or some really noticeable quality difference and for my ears these are no better.I am sending them back."
I bought these 3 years ago to replace my MDR V6. Today the arm assembly cracked while I was mixing with no force on them. I always took care of them by hanging it. It will cost me 25 dollars for a replacement arm. The durability isn't great because of these plastic parts holding the ear cups. The first year of use the ear pads started flaking but it’s much better than the MDR V6s because the pads are still intact around the stitching. The 3rd year the headband is starting to flake. They sound clean as the MDR V6s after breaking them in with a deeper bass response.
"Audio quality on these headphones is great. Makes music sound clear, and I found that there's definitely enough bass, contrary to what some other reviewers said. However, these headphones seriously lack in soundstage; as in- there is nearly ZERO soundstage. That might be fine for music, but it makes these headphones really bad for gaming. So if you're looking for gaming headphones, these are definitely not it. They have great sound isolation though, I could barely hear any ambient noise when I put them on.In terms of comfort, I found these headphones to be really uncomfortable. The clamp is way too tight on my head and the pads aren't very cushiony, making it hard to wear these for long periods of time."
"For me these didn't work out.  2 reasons, first they were very uncomfortable on my ears and second after owning Sony MDR-7506's for so many years the sound simply did not float my boat, the Sony's in my opinion just flat blow these things out of the water.  I did give them a chance, listened thru a high quality Amp and Dac with Lossless Music.  Such a huge 180 from my Sony's.  Reason I bought them was they are rated so highly and I had simply wore out my old Sony's.  In the end these went back and I ordered another pair of the 7506's.  Other than that these Headphones are built extremely well, look great the whole sha-bang, to each's own. Good Listening."
"Works as advertised, you WILL need a sound card or this thing is very silent. Once a good after market sound card was added to my desktop, these would rattle my ears! God they rock now. Warning though. They SUCK for online gaming like FPS games, and with that said wear them for 3-4 hours and your ear tips will hurt so bad you would need a good solid day to recoup before putting them back on. For music...these are really really beautiful sounding headsets. They are NOT 7.1 virtual surround sound. They cannot be modded with any types of sound cards or software to act like 7.1 virtual surround sound for fps, or surround sound music. With that said, Music...love it, using for gaming hate it."
"Every time I put these headphones on the cans flop around and require twisting the cans into proper position. I have never experienced this with another pair of headphones. Irritating. Plus, after just 6 months of use the headphone jack wiring failed and not longer produce stereo sound."
"Given the rave reviews from Amazon and all around the web, I was surprisingly disappointed this set of headphones. These headphones are so uncomfortable, the pressure gave me a headache after only about a half-hour of use, and that was with the $25 memory foam replacement pads. The sound they produce is also rather lackluster. Not only do they substantially accentuate the mid lows (to a point where it actually hurt my ears), there was a crackling and popping sound in the higher register of the music I was listening to (snare for pop music, and violins for classical).I was so dismayed I went to a local shop to try out some higher end headphones. After trying a set of Sennheiser Momentum's and Crossfade m100's, I can say for certain the m50x pales in comparison. Granted, these headphones were about $100 more than the m50x's, but for the number of people praising these as the best headphones under $300, I expected a lot more.In my opinion, I would save up the extra $100-200 for something that will really knock your socks off. Also, make sure to test a set of headphones out in person before buying... I know I won't make that mistake again.All in all, calling these audiophile-grade headphones is a pretty big stretch."
"I’ve liked these headphones for the past 5 years. I’m not 100% convinced that they were worth $145, but I haven’t had anything else to complain about until now.As of this week, the headphone padding has begun of to flake off everywhere. I found black flakes all in my hair after working at my desk yesterday. It’s kind of gross."
"The oversized ear cups fit over my ears ok, but they also helped contribute to the fact that these don't hold on the head as well as I'd prefer.  The sound quality is not universal through games.  Some worked well and others were not even as ""good"" as the laptop speakers.  Some games had full bass while others were very tinny and character speech difficult to even hear.  I'm not experiencing anything near 7.1.  I would call this a very basic set of gaming headphones, just a step above those at the lowest price point.  Flip to mute function doesn't function whatsoever."
"These are very easy to move around, and generally have a very comfortable fit.  The inclusion of the USB adapter/sound card component gives these headphones a wide range of connection possibilities, depending on your needs.HOWEVER, I only got to use mine for about 6 months or so, before a crack developed in the hinge component.  It seems that in their infinite wisdom, Logitech chose to design swiveling headphones with a metal swivel post in the headband, and a PLASTIC, TWO-PART clasp on the earphone side.  That thin, cheap plastic piece is bearing all of the stresses of daily use; from just spreading the phones to fit over your ears, to even just sliding them in your backpack, every movement is another tick in the timebomb they designed into these.Eventually the hinge housing will crack and come apart, and the whole earphone then releases from the hinge pin.  With that, not only is the headset no longer actually wearable, but now the earphone assembly is only dangling by its wire, so it's now in a quite fragile state.Meanwhile, there are NO replacement parts for this, unless you're okay with spending $20 on 3D printed replacements off ebay or Ali Express.  If you have your own 3D printer, check Thingiverse, the models for the clips are up there.  I'm considering putting forth the effort to actually have replacement components milled from aluminum or zinc to make them more durable, because other than that glaring mechanical flaw, the headphones do work very well otherwise.These do work and sound great, just making sure you're aware there is most definitely a flaw to be fixed here."
"I purchased these headphones last year for my son. At first, they were a wonderful pair of headphones—he was able to talk to his friends and loved the sound quality for his games and music. However, after about six months of moderate use, they suddenly began having issues playing sound when plugged into the controller. Since then, the sound has been inconsistent, which has been frustrating. We tried different cables and controllers, but nothing seemed to fix it. It’s disappointing because they were great while they lasted, but the durability just didn’t hold up."
"This is a review of the Logitched G432s, but I mention the Logitech G35s because I owned three pairs of those, and learned how to make them last longer because of the weak structural problem point built into these headphones. Having owned THREE pair of Logitech G35 Surround Headphones, they all have the same structural weak point built in, as ALL THREE of my G35s broke in exactly the SAME PLACE, and these G432s will eventually break in the same place as well.It's the Plastic Clamps right above the headphone assembly, the little clamps with the 4 screws right above the ear cups.Eventually the plastic will crack and the headphone 'cup' will fall off.The way to make this clamp last a bit longer is DO NOT PUT THE HEADPHONES ON BY GRABBING THE EAR CUPS, this puts A LOT of extra pressure on the plastic clamps and makes them break even sooner (I learned this with my first set of G35s, they lasted about a year), instead get used to putting the headphones on by hooking your index and middle finger on the METAL HEAD STRAPS Above the little plastic clamps, that, will take unnecessary pressure of of that little plastic clamps and make them last much longer.Eventually the plastic clamp WILL break though, just because of the constant pressure of the ear cups pressing on your head.The way I fixed it on both of my G35s was to go to the hardware store and buy Marine Putty Epoxy.It's Green and White, and you mix it together like modeling clay, then you can wrap the little plastic clamp that's starting to crack, in the putty, go all the way around the clamp, front to back.The Marine Putty dries as hard as a rock. That putty has kept my old pair of G35s working for about 5 years now, and the only reason they're not working right now, is because the USB cord broke up by the earpiece, so I have to replace it. But the Marine Putty is still holding the ear cup on quite nicely."
"I use different headsets like Sennheiser, Sony, Bose and few others, and this is the only one that hurt my ears and side because the cups are quite small and it is quite tight on the side of my head.Not sure what is the deal, if these are made for kids or what but it is not the most comfortable set of headphones I had.Sound overall is OK, but can 't wear these for more than 3-5 hours a day though. I wish I could get a different model but it is too late."
"They work great. Problem being they came with no instructions, same as the mouse I ordered from logitech unfortunately. This is very frustrating to put mildly. I will probably stick with razer again like in the past since I have never had issues at all with their products and feel a bit cheated trying logitech again only to have no instuctions for either product I got from them. Always known them to be the only company next to razer that I like for most products but very disappointed with not one but 2 products now in a week having no instructions this seems like a very simple thing that should rarely happen with any products let alone 2"
"I don't know the reason but when i am trying USB or Mic-Audio ports, i can only hear voice but microphone is not working... i tried almost everything to fix it but it does not work. casual old method (double plug-in cable) works perfect..Sound is perfect but headset is very tight and its getting hot very quickly on the ears, and your ears are sweating."
"Pros:1) It's $10 cheaper than where I originally found it online.2) It's wired, so I don't have to worry about batteries needing to be recharged.3) It's comfortable to wear. I'm a big guy, so having a headset that doesn't squeeze my head while using it helps.Cons:1)  To use this properly, you need to download the, ""Logitech G Hub,"" software from the Logitech website. I was having trouble getting the headset to work properly, and thought it just needed a driver update. That's what I thought I was downloading from their website, and got the app instead. I don't need something taking up more hard drive (or SSD) space.2)  Testing the sound, it doesn't work as it should. Sound comes across as 5.0 or 5.1 instead of the 7.1 surround sound it's supposed to be. The G Hub app has a surround sound test I was able to use.  The, ""left,"" ""left rear surround,"" and ""left surround,"" channels were all the same speaker. The same with the, ""right,"" ""right surround,"" and ""right rear surround,"" channels. The way the test is designed, a slight difference on the right side was less difficult to detect. By slight, I  mean close to zero difference between the three channels on each side.I tried it with several games. Destiny 2, Call of Duty, Resident Evil Village (aka Resident Evil 8, and RE8), and A Plague Tale: Requiem, are the first games I tried. The first 2, sound was lackluster and had some spatial distortion. RE8 needed some extra tweaking in the game settings. With some research, Requiem required a sound setting in the operating system modified. The headset went from not plug-n-play, to less-than plug-n-play. If I have to do technical acrobatics to get moderate surround sound and sub-par sound for other games – not to mention movies and other forms of entertainment – then this will be the last Logitech headset I get.3) I was talking to Logitech customer service online, and she confirmed the 3.5mm-to-USB converter (she called it a USB DAC) is needed for the device to work as a true 7.1 surround sound. Even while using it and the Logitech G Hub, it still wasn't giving me 7.1 surround sound.4) The headphones do NOT work with every game. I tried it with Resident Evil VII.I.age, and sound was almost none existent, and choppy extremely low when it did exist. 5) The sound was off. I have a Bluetooth headset by another company that sounds much better. Recording games, then playing them back, the sound is even worse.I would NOT recommend this headset. It's a shame, because I've never had problems with other Logitech equipment I've used, and would like to stick with them. I guess their name on headsets (or at least this one) doesn't mean much.(edited)(Further edit) 11 months, and a few short drops later, one of the sides broke off and was unrepairable. That makes this the shortest time I've had to replace any headphone set."
"These are more or less an update of the Logitech 430 from a few years back. The intended software that goes with this headset (G Hub) has been noted as being significantly worse than Logitech Gaming Software and this headset is not compatible with LGS at all. If you're looking to upgrade to this from the 430, look elsewhere and pray to whatever deity you worship that your 430 doesn't kick the bucket or break, because the 432 has every shortcoming that the 430 had and more.Drops will break these very easily, that goes without saying. The pads are some kind of weird leather instead of the blue soft foam from the G430 and wear away very quickly and easily. This one is more of a personal qualm but the Volume Sliding mechanism and Mute function are on the headset itself instead of on their own dedicated switch like it was on the 430. The G430s tended to last me about 2 years but these tend to break every year it feels like. They also feel like a tighter fit and get much hotter as a result of the leather material they use on the ear pads.The only good thing I can say about this headset is that the mute function actually *works* on the PS4, as with the 430, it wouldn't matter if the switch was set to mute or not, the mic would still capture your voice regardless. But I would still prefer a switch over the new function of having to lift your mic up past a certain point. To avoid having to use Logitech G Hub, I've also resorted to using the G430's USB sound card instead of using the one included with the G432. You will have to find a download to LGS on your own, however, as I believe Logitech took those downloads down and even then, certain versions of it are also not very good and have their own issues.Stick with these if you're on a budget. But don't expect them to last very long."
"I'd been using a Logitech headset for years (I think it was the G430 but I'm not sure) and it satisfied all my needs. When that one finally broke, I tried to find the same one buy again but no luck. Bought this one instead thinking it'd be an improvement but there's honestly not much to be happy about.The biggest, most disappointing thing is the fit. The earcups are a little small but still covered my ears so I'm meh about that. The main issue is the squeezing. I'm pretty small and my head is fairly average sized, but these headphones squeeze soooo tightly. For the first hour or so it's comfortable and creates a nice ""snug"" fit, but for any extended period of time, it's just unbearable. If you wear glasses, don't even consider these headphones. They press the frame into your head so tightly that it's uncomfortable after even a couple minutes.Couple other notes: there's no sidetone, which is fine but not ideal. I'm not a huge fan of having no mute switch, even though it does mute when you flip the mic up -- if you're in a video call, it's just super obvious when you're muted lol. I also have a cat and she destroyed the cable in the first week, causing it to lose sound in one ear. Cat's fault, but the rubber build does make it a little more susceptible to that.Sound quality was okay. Nothing to write home about, but definitely not as bad as some people on here were saying. Aggressively average, I'd say.Overall, it would've been fine and sufficient if not for the fit."
"These headphones are very comfortable and I wear them for hours a day. I’ve had these for 6 months and they have already cracked on the right side where the earpiece meets the top bar. I have been very gentle with them and they hang on a head phone hook when I’m not using them. Not happy about this. Also I don’t like how the software is needed to fill operate them. The G-Hub software auto updates even if you have that preference turned off and this ended up breaking the software for over a month for me. Logitech updated it, made you update, and then it wouldn’t load, making most of the Logitech products paper weights. They finally fixed it, but they had to do it, I couldn’t download an older version.In the end, I like the comfort, the sound and the mic, but due to the build quality and software issues, I do not recommend.*UPDATE* Logitech honored their warranty and sent a replacement free of charge. Definitely got to hand it to them on that. Hopefully these will last longer than the originals.*UPDATE 2* after receiving the replacement headphone they have been flawless. Still using them everyday and doing several voice calls with them a week.*UPDATE 3* It's been a year and the replacement set that i received from Logitech support has cracked in the exact same place  on both sides and it's all being held together by tape. There's a loose connection in the right speaker looses connection sometimes if the volume knob is touched, and i have to fiddle with it to restore stereo. the coating around the ear pad is faking off and i find pieces of it everywhere. Time to find new headphones again"
"I have long curly hair but I part it on top which thins it out, and the firm padding of this headset digs into my scalp painfully every time I use this for gaming. I’m frequently adjusting the heavy headset during my gaming sessions - sometimes only an hour or so in. The cord feels extremely flimsy and vulnerable. It often gets caught up under my desk chair wheels, which is terrible. So far at least it still works. If you have pets that chew, I do not recommend this headset. I feel nervous just wrapping it up for travel. I haven’t noticed one way or the other about noise cancellation. The sound quality is decent - nothing too special. Friends report my volume comes through fine (maybe too loud). It took me a long time to figure out that the mic was a flip up to mute since there’s no manual mute button like my previous Logitech headsets had. Using Discord, I think it’s a bit easy to pick up unintended sounds like breathing and sniffling with this mic. I can only adjust mic gain in settings so much. It’s much better than a laptop’s embedded mic though.I find this headset heavy and uncomfortable generally though and I’ve never been happy I bought it. It does have lots of space for reasonably big ears. Bigger than mine. I had “fade in” sound issues with a previous headset - not this one - but otherwise I wish I’d stuck with my old one instead. Hope to get something different from this one soon."
Great headphones but the mic picked up all the background sounds. I returned them.
The headset had some good sound but I was looking for that  7.1 feel and didn't get it from these. The mic could be better. I thought it might have been the setup I had it on but changed it to the USB dongle and was still getting feedback/static. And it wasn't only on my end as my colleagues could hear it as well. Unfortunately this will not be a keeper .
"When initially bought headset, I had some issues setting up the microphone to work properly with the USB adapter. Eventually, I was able to get it to work due to installing the drivers. But recently, after having not used the mic in for months, I realized the microphone stopped working. I tried using the 3.5mm adapter but it still didn't work."
"I bought these headsets for my son, expecting them to work great given the numerous positive reviews. I personally use a Corsair-branded headset and assumed Logitech, being such a reputable company, would deliver a high-quality product. Unfortunately, that was not the case.The plastic feels cheap and flimsy, as if the headset might break with minimal use. The ear cushions are oddly shaped—they technically cover your ears, but not fully or comfortably. Additionally, the design includes excessive plastic purely for aesthetics. For instance, the wide band that goes over your head looks substantial, but the actual cushion inside is much narrower than the band, which is both unusual and uncomfortable.The headset also leaks sound terribly. My friends have pointed out that they can hear everything from my earphones through my microphone, which is incredibly frustrating. On top of that, the ear cushions are made from a low-quality leather material that I’m certain will start peeling with time, unlike the mesh cloth material often used in higher-quality headsets. Overall, I’m deeply disappointed with this product. Sadly, I threw away the box, so I couldn’t return them. If I could, I would. I’ve already decided to stop using them and will be purchasing a different pair."
I've had a pair of no name cheapos I got for $30 at gamestop that puts the sound of these to shame for the past 4 years.Went out of my way reading reviews and such.Ordered these and they're just bloody awful.Sound is weak. Like tin can on a string weak.Pass on them. Only gave a two star due to quality being ok.
"The unit I purchased has an issue where the left speaker always sounds louder than the right speakers when connected via the USB dongle. The issue is not present when connected directly via the 1/8"" TRRS connector. I have tried reinstalling the driver multiple times to no avail. Sadly, I discarded the packaging which makes returning it much more complicated so I am stuck with it. I can somewhat recommend using via the TRRS connector instead."
"I got these back in July 6, 2021.Pros: For the price they are ok, they have a nice noise cancelling foam (as many gaming headsets have) they're comfortable to wear for hours of gaming.  I really like the volume wheel on the left side of the headset, I can easily lower or raise the volume of what i'm listening to.Cons: The microphone picks up noise from my room or even traffic going by and can be a tad bit annoying when in voice chat with friends or strangers in games. The microphone also isn't a flexible wire (which i was hoping it was), so I am unable to bend closer to my mouth or away. It can only go up and down. The cord is also an aux cord, I was hoping to have a usb or like most headsets have both, but that's my personal preference. The biggest NEGATIVE about this is both sides of my headset are broken now. The plastic is real cheap and it somehow cracked opened.. So both my headset pieces just dangle now. I had to use tape to put it back in place. They only lasted me 1 year before they cracked open.Conclusion: I won't be getting these again.. they broke in a year if not less. The microphone isn't great and the cord is an Aux cord."
"The things I dislike, is they're practically speakers when not on your head. The sound is good, but not amazing. Surround sound works well and is a nice feature, but it rarely gets used and even with games that utilize surround sounnd, you have to manually configure it to work for individual games. Finally, the passive sound comes from the microphone. So if someone is speaking next to you, you barely hear it, but if you bite a chip, it sounds like an ASMR recording.What I do like, it's comfortable, the microphone works great, and I can adjust volume on the fly on the headphones. And you really can't beat the price.There are a lot of things I wish it would do better, but the sound is crisp and quality compared to cheaper options. If I where a die hard gamer or audiophile these wouldn't even have been considered."
"The sound quality is great and the mic is clear, but I've had this for about a month and a half and its falling apart. Left ear muff loose and doesn't sit right on my head anymore. Just wish the headset would last a little longer than that little amount of time."
"Overall this is not what I'd expect from a $50 headset. I bought it to upgrade from a cheaper $25 headset, and was very disappointed with the results. Not what I'd expect from a big brand like Logitech.1. The part that allows the earmuffs to rotate is made with a very cheap plastic part that is prone to breaking, leaving the earmuff to dangle and become unusable. Logitech's older headsets had this problem too, it's a shame they haven't fixed it in newer designs. Perhaps its intentional to get you to buy a new one.2. The included onboard USB DAC only does 16 bit low quality audio at DVD quality at best. Out of the box, if you use USB, both surround sound and sidetone will be enabled until you install Logitech gaming software. What is sidetone, you may ask? It's where you hear yourself through the headphones while you talk.3. Surround sound sounds TERRIBLE, its painful to listen to as the bass is overpowering. Also, it isn't real surround sound, it's virtual(simulated) surround sound. Look up the difference between virtual surround and real surround sound, I wish I did before buying this. You're paying $10 extra over Logitech's cheaper non-surround model for a feature you'll probably want to turn off.4. The way the earmuffs work, if you make the slightest movement, such as constricting/relaxing your muscles by your ears a bit, the headset will make an obnoxious cracking/stretching sound.  This is extremely annoying as it happens constantly, several times a minute, and distracts from the actual audio. No matter how I adjust the height of the headset, it happens.5. Sound and mic quality is very poor. Whether I use the USB DAC or aux output, it sounds almost as bad as telephone hold music. My friend also said I sound very weird when using the mic. The $25 headset I had before was way better quality.6. The packing material is designed to be pretty much impossible to open without ripping it. So good luck returning it without a restocking fee. I decided to just keep the headset as a spare in case my old one dies. It's usable, just not a pleasant experience. Only reason I didn't eat the restocking fee and return it is because the 3.5mm splitter it came with works better than my old splitter, and because my old headset isn't sold anymore, so I'm not really sure what I'd buy instead as a spare.Overall seems like Logitech took cheap components, added ""GAMING SURROUND SOUND"" branding to it, and then set it at a high price. I would not recommend it- I'd either go with something cheaper, or go with a different brand."
"I purchased these recently to replace an inexpensive AmazonBasics headset that served me reliably for the past two years.  Logitech is normally a very good brand, and the reviews for this one were good, so I didn't hesitate to buy it.  Suffice it to say, this product is extremely disappointing.My first complaint is the size of the over-the-ear part--its too small.  I don't have big ears and yet they barely fit inside these things.  It's very uncomfortable.My next complaint is the construction.  It's very cheap!  A perfect example of this is, if I'm wearing these while eating something, all I can hear is the creaking of the plastic as I chew.  I've owned some pretty low-end headsets over the years, but I've never had that happen.My third complaint is the sound quality--it's garbage!  The sound is dull and flat.  I find myself having to increase the volume to compensate for the lousy sound quality.  If this was a $15 headset, I'd dismiss it as just that.  But these were $40 with a ""list price"" of $80 (what a joke!).  For a wired headset, I expected better.Finally, when you adjust the volume with the dial on the headset, you get the sort of static that you encounter on cheap electronics with poorly wired components.Basically, this headset doesn't fill any niche.  It's too expensive for a ""budget"" buy, and the quality is too low for a mid-range purchase.I intend to order a new headset and these are going back."
"I got this hoping to replace my older HyperX headset.  I was planning on using this new Logitech G432 headset to for gaming as that is what I used by HyperX for.  This Logitech headset just isn't a good headset.  Although the ear cups are padded, after wearing it for about 10 minutes it felt like there was no padding at all.  The sound quality is pretty poor as well.  I was using this on my PS5.  The auto mic cut off didn't work when you pushed the mic up.  I assume it might have worked on my PC if I had the logitech software for it.  But out of the box on my PS5 it didn't work.  So, I went and bought the HyperX Cloud Stinger 2.  And the HyperX is night and day better than this Logitech headset.  And they are practically the same price.  Avoid this Logitech headset.  Not sure what happened at Logitech but their computing accessories are just not what they used to be."
Right ear stopped working after wire got wrapped around my computer chair arm and slightly tugged on which then caused the wire to become unplugged. I plugged the headset back in and the right ear didn't project any sound. Shortest lifespan of any headset I've ever owned and coming from Logitech it was a shocker. I don't recommend this headset to anyone. Cheap garbage.
"It looks and sounds ok but it's painful to ware, the top of the headset is too stiff and it hurts the top of my head when wearing it for more then an hour or so. not enough padding and being too heavy.I cant believe Logitech can release such a piece of carp product... i like Logitech devices but this one is junk."
"Been using over a month daily.  Sturdy, ergonomic, and decent mic.  I started noticing sound from right speaker was not working.  I downloaded Logitech app, checked computer settings, and changed ports.  Seems to be a short in headband circuitry, but no static or volume change when I manipulate band.  Initially a light tap fixed it while wearing headset, but now I have to knock it like a door in my hand.  It's a solid headset for the cost, but QC standards could be better."
"The Razer BlackShark V2 is better in every aspect, but it is not a fair comparison because of price."
Cord is a good length. Audio and mic quality is good. Bought these to replace a pair that had noise suppression for a similar cost and I miss that.
I bought these because I was in need of a new gaming headset for my PC. The headset I replaced was a top tier name brand that starts at $100 for their headsets. I was trying to go cheaper on the price and I found this logitech headset was uncomfortable after a few minutes of wearing and the entire time I'm gaming I never am able to stop feeling the discomfort. I would recommend to spend the $100+ on a good headset if your looking for a set to wear for more then a few minutes at a time. I would only recommend this Logitech headset for short intervals of use. The comfort of my old headset was a 5/5. The comfort of this Logitech is a 2/5. I'm a gamer so I wear a headset for hours on end and comfort level needs to be the top priority.
"Audio and mic work extremely well, but this is the most uncomfortable headset I've ever worn. The padding is hard as a rock. After an hour of wearing them I have to take them off or I get massive headaches."
"I bought this thinking it would be even BETTER than the g430's. I've consistently used g430's over the last couple years. I've used many expensive headsets and to me the g430's were the best headset I had come across and they were so cheap! So I figured I'd give the g432's a go and ignore all the other reviews trying to steer me away from doing so. I SHOULD'VE listened. I could instantly tell a difference the headset is a lot louder than the g430's, nice thats fine. I loaded up Valheim, a game I've been grinding a lot recently. I could definitely tell a difference from the g430's instantly but it wasn't too bad since valheim is a calm game just birds chirping with some wind. I loaded up CoD Modern Warfare and went into a private match with 2 bots on the enemy team. I am not exaggerating as soon as the bots started shooting their guns at me the sound of the gunshots were so bad I took the headset off almost instantly. The gunshot sound these headsets give are the worst thing I've ever heard. I will say this though, I managed to get the sound RELATIVELY close to that of the g430's by going into sound control panel right clicking g432's, properties, and check marking ""bass boost"" however, it still isn't that of the g430's I will unfortunately have to say farewell the the G series as I can't find my g430's any longer. It's a disgrace that logitech named these the g432's as if they're BETTER than the g430's. Ridiculous. Please do not buy thinking it is an upgrade from the g430's."
"This headset is alright, there were things I like and things I didn't like so much. So for my application, I was using it as a gaming headset for a PS4. Works with PS4 no problem, voice quality is good on both my side and the side of those hearing my voice. Sound quality of the game leaves much to be desired. The sound is ""tinny"" if that makes sense. It is shallow and has virtually zero bass range. This wouldn't be such a big problem, but the way the headset is, the settings only allow for either voice or all audio, so you can't have your stereo play while at the same time have the headset on. Plugging the set in overrides all sound output, at least that was my experience. You also cannot hear yourself speaking, so you have to be careful not to yell into the mic. The other thing I hate about this headset is the weight! Despite the thick padding, this thing is like wearing a 5lb dumbbell on your head. I ended up getting a lighter headset to replace this one, it's just too much to wear for long gaming sessions. Not a bad headset for the price, but I have a cheaper one that is better now..."
"Cons:- From the time the product was new, any movement with my head makes a loud plastic-on-plastic creaking sound, particularly on the left side of the headphones.  Eating or drinking while wearing the headphones produces load creaking and grinding sounds.- ""Leatherette"" material on over-hear pieces failed within months of purchase; the leatherette and the  underlying foam flakes off and ends up all over the place- Within a few months, the thumbwheel volume control behind the left ear has introduced static when used.Pros:- Range of sound is excellent for the price- Boom mic sound is excellent, position is perfect, swing-away on/off feature is well executed"
"The audio quality of the mic and speakers is good, but it's overshadowed by very loud squeaking coming from the plastic moving as you move your head."
"Bought for young adult for gaming. The sound is good, but the cushion on ears and head are inadequate and make it uncomfortable to wear."
"The microphone level is too low, even with max input gain on the included USB interface.  I can crank the gain higher on my laptop's mic input, but that results in far too much background hiss."
"I bought these in hopes they would be more comfortable and functional than a super cheap pair of kid’s cat headphones i was gifted. size-wise, they’re actually slightly too big for me, so i feel a lot of wobble if i shake my head. they’re definitely more comfortable, as they don’t squeeze my skull, but there are still random pressure points that become very sore after time. therefore, i think the padding could’ve been better. i can’t say anything about the mic as i never used it, because i have a proper mic. sound quality is decent, nothing amazing, but for the price, i wasn’t expecting amazing. definitely more able to determine the direction of sounds, though not entirely. my biggest issue, though, is the wire. the slightest touch or movement near the plug will result in crackling. if you’ve ever had a headset on its way out, you know what i mean. this is meant to be a brand new item, so, unimpressive. i believe the reason it happens is that the plug is not *quite* the right size for the jack (using with PS5 remote), because it literally slips out with little to no resistance. this is a huge design flaw in my opinion. so, though i didn’t expect to be blown away by a headset at this price point, i definitely expected basic functionality from a brand such as Logitech. not sure where to go from here, but definitely returning this set."
"Ok so the cable is like SIX FEET LONG, and while that sounds awesome it has to be the single thinnest headset cable I've ever seen in my life... like speaker wire thin.It took me awhile to get used to the audio as it's a little washed out compared to my previous headset, not sure if it's smaller drivers or the USB to 3.5 mm aux adapter that comes included, but getting a surround sound Logitech headset for under $20 (when it was on sale) made it worth... if just barely."
"Within a year and a half of having these, I've finally suffered the same part of the headphones breaking as many others have had happen to them. The black plastic part above where the speakers swivel sideways has cracked in two spots, so now the entire right headphone part wants to fall off of the headband. No idea why Logitech decided to make a headset out of stiff, cheap, brittle plastic that breaks with normal stress."
"I purchased this headset for my son to use when gaming.  It is comfortable and the sound quality is impressive.  It worked great for almost 4 months, however, after a while he began to have problems with low sound volume even with the volume all the way up.  Then one day there was no sound at all.  I went through troubleshooting steps with Logitech, and in the end they agreed that it was a defective headset and are replacing it free of charge!  I can only guess that there have been a few customers with this same issue to compel them to replace it outside of the warranty window.  Or the serial number I gave them identifies it as part of a bad lot.  Either way, they are standing behind their product and that is all that matters.  I will update once I receive the replacement.  In the end I have given it 3 stars due to questionable reliability.  I will revisit this review after he has used the replacement headset for at least 6 months."
"For some reason this headset is setup automatically to have a listen playback feature turned on. It is super annoying and whatever the Mic picks up is run through the headset, and I mean EVERYTHING! So you hear yourself, the dog, the fan, the kids in the other room, the TV and ALL OF IT ECHOS THROUGH THE HEADSET!!!!!!!!! A ""feature"" like this should never be the default on any headset in my opinion and the ONLY way to turn this ""feature"" off is to download the Logitech G Hub software off the website and adjust the settings of the headset. It took me 2 and a half hours to figure this out as I couldn't figure out what the problem was coming from since windows has a similar feature that you can turn on and off. It apparently has been an issue for a while and goes back to other models as well but most of the ""help"" online is outdated for older models or windows 7.As far as the physical headset goes, it seems to be a good quality, sounds good, mic sounds good, and it feels like it's made of good materials. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is the before mentioned irritation of having to do a ton of searching to turn off a terrible option that isn't listed in the pitiful excuse for a user manual."
The sound is good but they are heavy. I have a small head and these squeezed my jaw muscles causing cramps and pushed my glasses off.
Microphone very muffled and cannot be bent closerr to mouth
"1st star: It functions.2nd star: I've heard worse.I needed a backup headset. This is affordable and from a company I generally like.These meet the absolute bare minimums.The microphone works and is muted when in the ""up"" position.-Input sound stutters horrendously.-With all input options set to max it still comes out muddy and quiet unless you're all but chewing on the mic.-Boom arm has little to no positional adjustment abilityThe sound through presets is passable. With tweaking it improves to acceptable for low-end headphones, but still has issues.-Sound is generally hollow and borders on tinny. Manual equalizer adjustments are required.Build quality is what you might expect for a $20-30 range headset. Hollow and cheap feeling.-Headset body is reasonably durable despite outward appearance and feel. The boom arm is thick rubber, so don't expect it to hold any position you set it to.-Leatherette. If you're unfamiliar: imagine sweaty ears. This isn't a strike against them as leatherette is temporarily comfortable.-Weight. The earphones feel abnormally heavy. Against both my Sennheiser headphones and headset they're easily twice the weight and I have no idea why.For Logitech:Your headset game is horrendous. Stop churning out subpar products and actually put in more than the bare minimum amount of effort. I bought g930s over 10 years ago and I feel like I'm re-writing a review."
"Worked great for fiveish months, then static output and input."
"Dont think the product I received was new, as it had scratches and smudges already. Most importantly, it was missing the USB DAC for the surround sound which was the entire reason I purchased this one. Had I known I was just getting plain stereo headphones, I would have bought something else.For the actual review I guess.The audio quailty is about what im used to from <$40 gaming headphones. The mic quality is a bit better. The point where it mutes/unmutes is very easy to identify, very tactile. Plastic is bendy but doesnt feel too fragile so far. The mobility where the ears pivot from the headband was very welcome as ive had a few headphones break at this stress point. Definitely makes adjusting its position during use much more comfortable and easy. Though Ive had trouble adjusting the headband while wearing it and its not very tactile. It started out very tight to the head but i think its loosened just slightly. Headset came with a Female-2Male Y-splitter which is convenientFor the surround sound, I wish I could say as I didn't receive the DAC.Too bad as that was the reason I bought these and not something cheaper. I doubt I would make this purchase again knowing what I know now. It is an upgrade over the cheaper (<$40) gaming headphones I've had in the past, but that upgrade is in build quality, not audio."
"I originally purchased these for my work at home job, being a gaming headset my expectation was that they would be very comfortable and immersive. Unfortunately the headset was very uncomfortable to wear for even more than an hour let alone a full 8 hour shift. I think the primary issue is that they are too tight even when adjusted to the appropriate length for your ears. If you have a large head it will squeeze you and you might end up with a headache like I did. Another very significant issue that I encountered was a constant echoing on the headset speakers that was picked up by the microphone when you either spoke or even took a loud breath. I am not sure if this was either a glitch or part of the integrated ""noise cancelling"" but it was just awful and very distracting. The last thing that was very disappointing was the mute functionality  which is limited to flipping up the microphone to the up position, which can be very very inconvenient and loud unless you have external ""push to talk"" functionality, I really wish the mute functionality was a button or at the very least a switch on the usb sound card."
"I wrote a review before speaking how I was underwhelmed by this headset but at least the microphone worked. I stand by that. However, I just can't get over how mediocre these sound and how much they hurt to wear; its like the earpads are warped and apply uneven pressure to my head (more pressure on the front).I was hopeful considering I had an older pair of G430's that served me well, but this just feels like a downgrade in sound, comfort, and build quality."
"Decent sound quality, works for what it’s for, etc. For both my husband and I (we are different physical builds/sizes) it became pretty uncomfortable after an hour or so due to the heavy weight. Because it’s so heavy, it pushes the ears/head into the cushions and the hard inside bits you can feel after a while. Likely not too much of an issue for shorter session gamers."
"I take care of my things and I've gone through like 5 of these Logitech G430 headsets.First thing that happens is the volume gets messed up. It statics as you adjust the volume really bad, and one ear is lower than the other.The next is the dongle stops working, no problem I have parts from other broken ones.Next is the earphones break at the very weak connection to make them swivel.Next is the headset plastic cracks right above that point where the earphone connects to the head band.I buy them because I am a long time Logitech user, I like USB headsets, they sound ok until the static, and they are affordable.I don't use most of the fancy extras on the software like DTS and the other one. I leave the equalizer neutral. I've swent back and forth trying Dolby, Dts, and the new one and I don't like how it sounds with the enhancements."
"Don't buy these absolute trash can of a headset. I bought these during black Friday to replace and old headset and they were listed at 70 dollars but j got em for 40. I'm thinking ok, I've heard of Logitech, and that's a good amount to spend on a headset. They should be pretty good. But I'm telling you within 5 mins I'm back to my old headset despite it having a messed up mic. These are SOOOOO bad. The sound quality is horrible! It's like trying to listen to your game through a pinhole in the wall. It boasts about drivers and yadayada but with the headset volume maxed and with the audio turned all the way up on the console for the headset you can still BARELY hear the game!!! To top it off it's so inconsistent. One moment I can hear my party and the next I am straining to hear them. Hell, the game audio is like that as well. You can't tell direction with these either. At least not in the game I'm playing, which let me be clear. I am playing Pubg. Another fatal flaw is my party complained I my TV was too loud as soon as I joined. Except my TV audio was not on. It's once again these trash freaking headphones. For some odd reason my party could hear every single in game thing I did through my headset as if I had a TV blasting in the background and the mic was picking it up. I had the party chat mixer set all the way to the party (vs. the game audio). I then turned down the headset audio so it wouldn't detect it's own Audio (the idea that a headset would do this in the first place is absolutely stupidity!) But oh wait...turning down the headset audio is a bad idea when you can already just barely hear the game when the volume is maxed out. You see where I'm getting here?! There is no viable option to use this headset whatsoever!! DO NOT BUY THESE. IM TELLING YOU NOW. DO YOURSELF A SOLID. I'm about to return this crap now."
"It is a really great headsets for gaming, I can hear sounds I couldn't hear before on my previous headsets. But the durability is pretty bad. The first G432 I bought lasted for like ~4 months, right earphone piece broke off and left dangling by the wire. I thought maybe I was too rough with it? Even though, I never dropped it or anything. I made a decision to buy another one because of how great it was but this time I will treat it with extra care. So I bought another G432 and this time it lasted for like ~4 months too, but this time the left earphone piece broke off and left dangling by the wire... Maybe my head is too big? I feel like I have an average size head...TLDR; Great gaming headset, really bad durability, breaks easily and left dangling, great if you have a smaller head?"
"Bought these to replace my ancient G430 headset that finally worn out. And much like the F430, these were way too tight on my head at first. Stretching them over the box for a week resolved that problem and they fit just like the G430 had.On the included USB dongle, the sound is absolutely terrible. Don't even bother with it, use another sound device instead.The sound quality is about the same as the G430, possibly with a bit more maximum volume. I was not disappointed with the listening side of this headset.Not a fan of the leatherette ear cups. I know from experience with every other headphones with similar that the leatherette will rot in 1-1.5 years. I wish Logitech would sell replacements (I would have just rerubed my G430 again if they did, so that is possibly why they don't).The breaker for this headset is the mic. Its garbage. When it works, the audio quality is really poor. Lots of noise, pretty much backwards frequency response. The tilt up to mute would be a really nice feature if it likely wasn't the cause of the thing consonantly cutting out when being put in to use, leading to the starting every call with wiggling it up and down and doing audio checks until it sort of doesn't sound like I've thrown the thing in to a trash bin on the other side of the room.Two months in and currently looking for a different headset to replace these. They are fine for causal music listening or watching videos, but too unreliable for anything requiring use of the mic. Probably leave them at the office and use 'em to drown out my coworker's singing."
"The most uncomfortable set of headphones I've ever owned, bar none.Windows screwed up my sound settings, resulting in my microphone inputs and ALL sound from my desktop being mixed and sent over voice (so if I had a YouTube video playing, anyone in discord would hear me speaking as well as the YouTube video playing). I wasn't able to fix it, so I reluctantly hung up my 8 year old HyperX Cloud headset for this cheap USB headset.The audio issue was resolved, but these headphones immediately displayed issues.First, the sound that is picked up on the mic is played in your ears. It's really REALLY annoying and you can't turn it off. Hearing your own breathing, your own voice in your ears may be fine for some, but I dislike it and wish it could be disabled.Second, the sound quality is sorely lacking compared to my HyperX headset. It's tinny, thin, and lacking in anything resembling bass response.Third, and most damningly, THESE HURT TO WEAR FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME. The earpieces are ok, not great, but the ""cushion"" that goes across the top of your head just feels like it cuts into you after about 30 minutes of gaming. My HyperX had a thick, soft pad across the whole section, but these have a very thin and hard piece of foam covered in vinyl, and it's just painful after a while. I don't just mean uncomfortable, I mean you need to move it around your head otherwise the pain and discomfort is distracting.Really wish I hadn't purchased these. More than that, I wish Windows hadn't crossed it's wires so I could still use the 2.5mm input and my old headphones."
Ordered 4 of these ‘New’ got 4 that were obviously opened and returned in fact one of them the mix didn’t work. Very disappointed!!!!
It worked great I got them for my son for Christmas and not even 3 months later the mic isn’t working anymore
Got these to replace my ZM-HPS200 ( Zalman ) but to me the Zalman are better. Produce better sounds blocks noise just as well
"I had to amend my old review; this headset was working great up until today. It seems the microphone stopped working first which I only noticed today. Now the sound quality sounds like mono-quality with extremely choppy performance. Stereo quality is completely gone. I am so disappointed with this set. I didn't bother with an extended warranty because I have had other Logitech products in the past. I think I will use other brands from now on.  Five months was all I get? What a waste of money.OLD REVIEW: (Please keep in mind it may only last five months):Comfortable, not headache inducing, good sound quality and the mic is really sensitive. There is a volume control behind the left side headphone and the mic automatically mutes when you flip it up. That was the selling point for me, no looking for buttons to mute my mic. The sound quality is really good, I listen to music all day on them and never once thought ""this sounds terrible"". It's good for gaming as well. I'm not sure if they made a wireless model for this but I would definitely pick one up if they did. The headphone speakers themselves swivel so they always fits nicely against your ear even if you have to take one of the speakers off.Pros: Good sound quality (for five months)Volume control on back of headset (no searching for a control on the wire)Flip up mic mute (works nice for five months then it is permanently muted)Headphone speakers swivel so they are always comfortableNoise cancelling pads are comfortable and work fairly well while music is playingCons: May break before you get used to it, get a damned extended warranty in case it completely craps out on you!!!!!!!!!!Other: Wire didn't look as thick as some other models but is sturdy enough to withstand repeatedly accidentally running it over with your chair.Comes with a USB adapter in case you don't want to use your headphone jack on your computer."
"When I purchased this headset 12 months ago, everything worked great.  The feature set was nice too: on-ear volume control, flip up microphone to mute, USB or standard audio jack options, and a nice long cord.Everything was great until roughly 8 months in.  At this point, I noticed a small crack just over the left earpiece.  I figured this was cosmetic and didn't think much about it.  A few weeks later I noticed a small crack on the right side.At 12 months of owning the headset, the left earpiece fell off the headband.  The crack in the plastic was caused by the pressure holding the earpieces against my head as well as putting on/removing the headset (as you spread the earpieces wider to clear your ears when you put on/remove the headset).I tried super glueing the crack and re-assembling the headset.  The glue didn't last long and it broke a few days later.  At this point, I've super glued the left earpiece to the headband to hobble along until my new headset arrives.If the plastic part was instead made of metal, I expect that I would be using this headset for many more years."
Unit broke at the connection point of one headphone after a year. Good enough sound quality offset by cheap materials.
"The sound is great but whoever made the cable actually wants someone to crack their head open, I have tripped on this cable 10 times in a week. 10 TIMES IN A WEEK OF HAVING THESE."
"The sound and spatial accuracy are spot on, the only 2 things that make me wish I'd bought something else is a) they don't quite get as loud as I'd like on usb (which is the 7.1 surround) though they are plenty loud with just the 3.5mm, and simulated surround is still very good, I don't mind so much and use the USB for ghub, but for b) they are too tight. For teens or kids they would be great, they expand big enough, but they squeeze my head and I can only wear them for relatively short periods before it starts getting pretty uncomfortable. Gift for your teen? 5/5. Soon as I can get another pair, thats what I'm going to do. My 16 yo will love them."
"I used these for gaming, and specifically flight sim with virtual ATC where the sidetone feature came in handy. They worked well for a year, and then both earpieces broke off within a month of each other. I don't feel like I'm a particularly abusive user, and only game about 5 hours a week."
"So I received it in the mail after reading about how good the mic is. Little did I know this wasn't the truth. It was echoing and it didn't mute my mic at all, I would slide it up to mute but if someone talked or shot it unmuted me."
"I got this headset to replace a really crappy one that was wireless on July 4th of this year. For the entire 28 days I've had it, I've enjoyed it! Very comfy, especially since I have to sit with a headset on for multiple hours at a time for work. Until, that is, today.After less than a month it suddenly stops working. My headset was working perfectly fine yesterday during a game of Fortnite with friends and my wife, it was working this morning during my morning meeting. But apparently it just *quit* working randomly.The headphones themselves are still working properly and fit snuggly and I love them, but my mic itself? Nothing. I've tried two different computers, I've restarted at least four times, I've updated my system and every driver I can think of. I've tried to make calls in Zoom, Slack, Discord, Xbox, and using in game chat for games like Fortnight and Phasmophobia.Nothin' doin'. I can hear, but no one can hear me. Very disappointed, especially considering the high ratings this one had when I ordered it. The oddest thing?I can hear my mic input *in my headphones* as if it's working, but literally no device or program is picking me up."
"I received this item defective as one of the pair ain't working with the jack input, and when I use the USB converter, there is a noise. The customer agent told me that it is defective indeed and I can get a full refund without a return, and I can also follow up with Logitech to help me out maybe it can be fixed. I told her no need to refund - I was trying to be fair, so naive - until I make sure that it is defective with Logitech. They as well confirmed that it is defective. The representative called me as a follow-up call, and then the arrangement was changed. The first thing she asked about did they offer you a replacement, I answered no. She surprised me then that there is no replacement and I can't keep it if I need a refund. So, I have to get it back, get my money, and order a new one. Well, seems fair tbh, but just if she didn't change what she promised. I was furious and told her I need nothing back I'll just throw it away. Then I figured that I am more naive, being fair made me lose and now I am going to do them a favor and keep it. So, I had a fight with customer service and SUDDENLY they no longer need it and refunded the money. I thought Amazon US would be the best of all other branches around the world that I dealt with, apparently, they are all about fights and trying to screw you over. I actually had 4 defective items this month alone and each one was a struggle."
"Search up ""logitech g432 breaks easily"". I'm NOT rough with these things and I'm on like my third set in like 10 years. They all break at the swivel joints in the same way. What's more, that part is pretty hard to replace, even with a 3D printer. They are sturdy enough to outlast the warranty period, so Logitech doesn't have much incentive to fix this."
"The audio is accurate from these headphones. I have not used the mic, so will not cover that.No way these are 20-20k, maybe 45-16k, and they don't thump. Maybe that's a good thing for long term wearing with closed headphones. It took jumping around with different USB ports for the software to even recognize it. After that it took custom driver installs for the EQ changes to even do any sound changes. Once I was able to customize with the EQ (and get results) it now works on any port, even a cheap USB hub. The surround sound is a NO-GO, as it was expected. They are comfortable to wear, even with glasses. I paid about $50. At the time of this review, its on sale for $35. Its worth the $35."
The headset is a decent one for gaming however it has some serious drawbacks. The sound is alright and works like any other and the mic is pretty good but it is very basic.The biggest issue is the build quality. This headset is an absolute Failure when it comes to the build. The 3.5mm jack has a ridiculously frail connection to the cable. I jolted it one when I lowered my leg and its has been finicky ever since. The the plastic is cheap and im afraid of breaking it at any given moment. All of these are actually tolerable and to be expected with such a inexpensive headset. HOWEVER. The reall issue is that unless your a ventriloquist this headset is impossible to use without you creaking your every head bob and jaw clench. Any movement of your head tends to make this friggin thing creak. Muting is a chore and thus creates more creaking. ALL of this is easily heard through the headset.If you just need a headset for the occasional game its probably fine. If your using this to play with friends i hope they are hearing impaired or that you are a touch to speak gamer.
"the headset is good for its price, but if you  look for ones with the price of 1230 they are better, this headset is good if you buy it on sale"
"The design is good the sound is great! But there are three issues. I wear to play my games on my laptop. First, I realize it heavy on my head where it is giving me neck pain and headache. 2nd, My teammate can't barely hear me because the mic is far from my mouth where I can't adjust it to come closer to my mouth. And 3rd, it's is too tight around my head as well where it's squeezing my head.I wouldn't recommended anyone to by this because I don't want anyone to experience of what I went through over the past 15 days since the day I bought this."
"I bought these because of the Logitech name, a venerable old name in computer peripherals. The sound quality was quite good, especially considering the price point. However! And this is a big however. The ear cup padding is relatively hard and the clamping pressure is way too high. This results in an unrelenting pain that is only relieved when you take them off. Nothing, no amount of adjusting, could make these hurt less. Maybe Logitech is thinking only little children will be using these but they've got their demographics skewed. There are plenty of actual adults - with adult sized heads - who are into gaming these days.These are a pass for me."
"I decided to replace my MSI DS502, best headset to day I ever owned.I did not had a big budget so I checked amazon for headsets, just checking what I could found.I saw this ones on sale, from 80 to 35 bucks... I remembered that logitech was a good brand... it WAS a good brand, but not anymore...Im glad I got this on sale because is a waste of money.The sound quality is not that great, is not bad but for 80 bucks I expected way moreThe sound power (volume) super low for such money.The G-hub (logitech software), had the settings that you expect, equializer, noise cancelling but not as much as my MSI ones.And the ugly part, they are not as confortable as they seem.The only 2 things I can say I liked are:1. The software have an options (pnly for USB connection) to hear your voice on the headset, usefull to hear yourself while talking and control your voice volume.2. The wire is 3.5 jack but it came with an USB adapter and a 3.5 mic and sound adapter.But not only for this they worth it... Logitech I expected WAY better..."
"Just too heavy on the head, sound and mic seem ok."
"I like this headset a lot but am returning it. The audio is great, until I try to talk. I can hear myself really loud and there’s so much feedback it sounds awful and like some coils are rattling around. It hurts my ears. They sit up off my ears nicely, and don’t fall of my head easily, and I love the flip to mute. But the fact that I cannot speak with them without serious ugly feedback and distortion makes this a no for me."
"I have a complaint and it is the volume of the product, I have done everything to try to increase the volume even more, I have even read other people with the same problem. Simply the maximum volume of these headsets is not enough. I have had some headsets with three times less value than this and with the loudest sound.Other than that, everything else is perfect."
That said the moment the first person said they could barely hear me when the device was turned up and when I attempted the mute function it didnt work. I immediately applied for refund.
"I had bought this for the discounted price at the time of writing this review and some of the promising reviews, intending to replace the old headset I have since its cloth earmuffs are a hassle to clean, but the sound quality was comparatively worse than my old headset which I had for several years. It has a slightly muffled audio quality to it that once you notice, you'll never be able to ignore it. I would absolutely not recommend buying this at the full price of $79.99, and I'm returning it regardless of the 55% discount because my old headset is just flat-out better. Overall, audio quality is subpar, and even downloading the Logitech driver to modify its audio quality did not get rid of the muffled audio aspect."
I have own these for a year now. It still hurts to wear them. Also the volume control causes the left side audio to turn off. I have to either have it full blast or low to get both sides to work.
"While they're nice and easy to use, they have 3 large issues. The first is the ear pads; they're this synthetic leather that dries out and is pretty uncomfortable after a few hours. You can get cloth pads but only from a third party vendor. The second is that they're pretty flimsy, and unless they're stored and transported with lots of care, you could end up with an earpiece hanging off. Support was great and sent me a replacement, but this doesn't change the construction. The last and worst is that the cloth liners over the earpieces aren't removable, so they're impossible to properly clean. They start to fade and smell after a while, and just using a Q-tip with alcohol only helps so much."
These are made with some really cheap plastic and *will* break if you do not treat them like a newborn baby when you handle them. $50 on sale and I got about 3 months of use out of them until I picked them up the wrong way and the plastic holding the phones' to the head piece cracked and went loose.In hindsight I wish I paid a little more and went with another pair of Hyper X.. they're made really well and are very sturdy. Last pair lasted me about 5 years before needing replacing.
"My previous headset was the Cloud Stinger from HyperX. Coming from that headset, the Logitech G432 is certainly much better in terms of sound quality. The bass is noticeably heavier, which can be further customized using Logitech's software. The software features multiple options, such as surround sound, noise cancellation, and different sound profiles. Build quality is also very solid, despite it being made out of plastic.Now onto the sole reason why I removed two stars. I would rate my head as being average in size. That being said, this is the most ungodly uncomfortable pair of headphones I have ever worn, period. It's presses around the ears very tightly, particularly towards the bottom of the ear cups. Compared to the Cloud Stinger, which I can wear as if it's not even on my head, I have to take this pair off every 10 minutes just from how absurdly uncomfortable it is. Of course, some people may not have this problem. It might fit perfectly fine for them. However, it's likely that I will be returning these from the sheer discomfort I have experienced. All the best sound quality in the world doesn't mean anything if you can barely keep it on your head."
"I've had like 3-4 of these. They will last you a little over 1 year. I use headphones extensively, pretty much everyday. I don't toss it around or do anything stupid, they just end up breaking. Every time it breaks is due to one side of them breaking and they start to hang. If you are looking for ones that last longer than a year (or you know you wont use them as much as I do) then look for something else. The quality is good tho."
I expected better from Logitech. Although lighter in weight from the Logitech G35 set I was replacing it was apparent the item was cheaply made and when I used them in gaming everyone complained about the sound of my voice and they sounded tinny to me as well. I only used them twice before I refurbished my G35 set for use.Move along to another set is my advice.
"Wired headsets always create some issues with the connection, static feedback, echoing, etc. This headset is no different. You will have more issues with it than a wired headset undoubtably. But, it doesn’t have to be charged or constantly reconnected to new devices.It’s easy to use, sounds good overall. Very good for casual gaming/music. Would not recommend for anyone who wants incredible performance."
First impression extreme amount of echo god help if you have more then 2 in a group chat the feedback from both echos are enough to deafen. Do not even get me started on the quality of voice it sound like yelling into a soda can. Would not advise to buy save the money for something better. After about 45 minutes of settings editing the echo has eased up but we still sound like we are can yelling
"It seems I'm not the only person to run into this issue. I bought my headset in October, and today, a few hours ago when I went to put my headset on...it cracked. I've never ever abused my headset. I only wear it when sitting, I put it on my desk when I'm done. It seems like this is a common issue, and I believe it has to do with the design of this area. The joint bits should NOT be plastic. It's going to flex tiny amounts each time you put it on, and it might not break all at once or be noticeable until it just does.Other than this design flaw, it's a good headset and of good sound quality for the price. It might not happen to every headset, but it seems like a clear design issue that will lead to this issue happening to at least some non-negligible portion of headsets, where a tiny defect or microcrack in the plastic can eventually lead to this.Going through customer support right now and I'll update once it gets here."
"Bought these in Feb 2022.  I took them off my head two days ago and the plastic end broke off, and now one of the ear cups is just dangling.  Logitech said too bad, out of warranty.  I bought them assuming they were of better quality then the cheap imported ones I had before, but those lasted me 4 years.  DO NOT BUY if you want to use these long term."
The headphone jack tends to slide out of PS5 controllers. I tested a couple different controllers (all official controllers) and they all had the same issue.
"The headset is okay in quality in terms of sound, but the headset doesn't quite sit right on my head. it either clamps of the sides of the head or loosely sits on the top and easily slides off depending on adjustment instead of snugly fitting both (I'm a man with an average sized head). The right side also starting dying on me after a few months and sound cuts in and out. It's the shortest lived headset I have ever purchased, which includes cheaper headsets with similar sound quality."
Mic is horrible
"This is mostly a great headset and good for the price. Mic quality, sound quality, fit and feel, software and extras all were good if not great. But this headset broke after 5 months. I'm not a raging headset thrower, I don't abuse my stuff. It just simply has poor quality materials at the base of the band and start of the cans. It's where the aluminum stops and the cheap plastic begins. I just can't help but think even a sacrifice in quality, which is arguable for competitors of similar price, would be much more worth it if it lasts longer than 5 months, where I have to buy ANOTHER pair and essentially double the cost. I trust logitech in plenty of devices but never will I buy another pair of these."
"UPDATED 1 MONTH AFTER PURCHASE.I take 500-700 calls a week from home. On every call I have to flip the mic up to mute because no inline controls. After a month or approximately 2400 flips the microphone lost its good connection quality. So if you are the type of user that will use the mute function often it is not worth the cost. If it is something where you just use it for gaming its a good headset.2 STARS FOR MY NEEDS BUT 4 STARS JUST FOR GAMING OR REGULAR USE.ORIGINAL REVIEWThis headset is very comfortable. Cushion is soft, microphone is sort of bendy, sound quality is good.I don't use it for gaming I use it for taking calls from home. They only downside is the headphones are almost too noise cancelling where it sounds funny to hear myself talk but not hear myself talk. So I wear one ear on one ear off.The microphone is really good. I have tried quite a few where the windows 10 driver makes the usb mic sound very quiet to callers. This one is practically perfect. Their can hear me very well. And you can use the Logitech G hub software to adjust different settings. Only downside is Ghub is always trying to turn the microphone up. So I prefer the headset without the Ghub software installed and just the basic driver. Very good microphone for any VOIP process."
"I beg that you sort by 1-2 stars, because that's where you're going to get your needed information.  Long story short, these headphones are nice for sound and good quality microphone input.  Unfortuatly, the design of the headphones is flawed at the plastic, load-bearing flex point.  You can take care of them, keep them clean, manipulate the headphones ONLY at the headband, etc.  Won't make a difference.  After one year and 4 days after purchase I went to go put on my headphones and the left side plastic bit simply snapped off.Silly me, I thought that I was too rough with my last identical pair, and bought a new one only to have it fail in the EXACT same place.Fool me once, shame on you; Fool me twice, shame on me.  Not buying this god-forsaken headset a third time.Going to try to resolve this issue by machining the flex-point out of aluminum now."
"The sound on these is A-MAZE-ING! And the noise cancellation removes about 80% of surrounding ambient noises. This isn't necessarily bad because you can still hear someone breaking into your house or the rushing of an impending funnel cloud touching down in the backyard.However, they are heavy! They do weigh a bit, so prolonged use can feel like your head is in a vice. After a few hours, you may feel some slight neck aches."
"Replacing my last headphones, looking for same bass quality. This set doesn't have it. More mid range and treble."
"I saw a lot of comments talking of terrible audio quality that is unbefitting of a headset this expensive. Which they were partially right about! It sounds incredibly tinny and muffled on its own. However, if you get their proprietary software that has an equalizer, or really any audio EQ, all you need to do is turn up the treble a tiny bit and it sounds just fine! 3 stars bc this should not be the standard for a headset like this. An audio EQ should not be there to fix the problems of your product, but rather to tweak it so it is effective for a wider range of tasks."
"It fits OK, but everyone says it sounds like I'm in a tin can or far away. So the mic must not be great. The sound is OK but not great. I'd probably go another route in the future, at this price."
"I've had these headphones about a week (as of 2/17/2013).  I've done about 40 hours of ""burn in"".The GOOD:  They are very comfortable to wear and have very low leakage.  I'm very impressed that packed with the headphones (the back card) is the entire list of EACH and * EVERY * part in the headphone in an exploded diagram.  This implies that you can - if you wanted - repair these instead of treating them as a throwaway item in this throwaway society.  I applaud this.SONIC INITIAL IMPRESSIONS:HIGHS:  I like that the highs are very clear yet unexaggerated - without cutting your ears to pieces.  This is something I find most headphones fail at.  Sony has figured how to EQ the treble without going over the cliff , or faltering so to speak.MIDRANGE:  Initially a bit forward, it is rapidly getting mellower with burn-in.BASS:  It's there but on it's own terms.  I.e. you are not going to EQ this into a bass monster.  It has it's own mind.  You can almost go backwards by trying to EQ this for more bass...because...deep deep is there accurately and maddeningly distant but you'll cloud it by punching up 60 - 250hz stuff.  You'll also affect the overall ""slam"" to some degree by punching up the bass.SOUNDSTAGE:  Clinical, ""Scientific"" and Delineated to an almost maddening degree......THE BAD:  Lack of Audio ""Comfort Food""  I had seen reviews of various ""Studio"" type headphones alluding to this and went ""Well...what IS your problem OK?  So it's delineated and clear..how can you go wrong???""  Well.... First of all, the clarity of these headphones makes listening to MP3s - especially any Lower bitrate MP3s immediately tedious.  I've never experienced that difference so quickly and it's not necessarily a good thing.  You will hear the that the MP3 audio masking / compression has ""dried up"" a lot of the studio ambience, reverb, etc.  I've never been forced to notice this until now.  But, lets say for purpose of discussion you are listening to high quality recordings in a good format (CD - Red book audio ""WAV"" format 16bit 44.1 Khz uncompressed or better like SACD , DVD Audio, HDCD, etc)....  OK groovy.  The sound is all clear, the sound is ALL here, every detail  present and accounted for ...but but...  --->  you'll feel like a ""Scientist"" listening to your favorite music with these headphones.  <-----  Again you go ""WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM PAL ? !!!!""  I'll tell ya:  There's a part of me that screams out ""For God's sake give me  some ,  *  some *  SLOP or even the tiniest bit of SLOP or humanity!  Some integration on the audio canvas, PLEASE!""  Example:  Let's say there are 16 instruments or overlaid tracks on a song -  well...by God you hear each and every one of them happening bass to treble as a DELINEATED instance and ...it can be uncomforting and disconcerting in the way the sound hits your soul.  They all hit your ears in the same time but are not ""experienced"" by me as integrated and fun / musical.  I feel like a clinician with the microscope listening to music with these.  Imagine the grammar Nazi's designing headphones!  Emily Post with an IQ of 180 designing headphones.  NOTE:  These comments are about audio design- not the ""high frequencies"" per se.  The high frequency EQ on these headphones are just fine - commendable in fact.IN SHORT:  These headphones are high quality and many things - probably a godsend to an engineer who wants to know every nuance of what's going on but they are NOT Audio ""Comfort food"".  There are no mashed potatoes with gramma's best gravy here.  Your audio is delivered by the best scientific audio accounting design team that ever walked the Earth!  You'll laugh and think I'm crazy - but buy these and you'll see!  I hope burn-in will change my opinion on the fun factor on these.  They have made me realize that I don't want to scrutinize my music like an ant farm under a microscope - I want to ENJOY and FEEL my music on an INTEGRATED audio canvas/ soundstage.  There is a difference.  I want the music to hit my heart viscerally - not clinically.  Your mileage may vary - this is just one man's opinion.  I feel they gave a fair product for what they are charging.  Certainly they are not crap or ""bad"" low quality headphones.  By the way I have a couple of decent separate headphone DAC boxes - no difference.  I do think / speculate that a tube amp could ""save"" these.  Something that gives a slight blur or wash of even ordered harmonics....integration ....anything....SAVING GRACE:  These phones are good candidates for affordable travel headphones (long plane flight) where you don't want leakage to bug your immediate seat neighbors but also don't want to drop $300.00 for special noise cancelling headphones.I will keep these but I will renew my search for ""Audio comfort food"".Other Bright Spots / exceptions to my complaints:  One song that is a revelation on these headphones is ""Move Over"" by Janis Joplin - these bring the dueling piano and guitar parts into perfect relief.  Traffic ""You Can All Join In"" very enjoyable in it's clarity.  Also if you ever wondered what someone said or mumbled in the background - you'll hear it with these.P.S. Some perspective:  I tend to listen to old school rock (Beatles, Stones, Clapton, Zep, Floyd, Traffic, Nik Kershaw, Karla Bonoff, Neil Finn, Bowie, Robert Palmer, James Taylor, Mama's and Papa's, etc) and on the flip side Bach, Chopin preludes, Beethoven (symphonic and piano concertos, sonatas) and some jazz(Weather Report, Brubeck, Airto, Guaraldi).  So far my favorite older headphones are the discontinued Koss A-250 closed back headphones.  Those were Koss's one attempt at making audiophile headphones.  They were leaky as hell and had durability issues but were fun and musical to listen to.  Have also owned various mid-level Sennheisers over the years."
"I bought these headphones for exactly one thing -- to plug into my work laptop for Teams meetings to keep the noise level down for those working around me, and to plug into my personal laptop to listen to YouTube, Amazon music, my purchased MP3s.That said, the cord length is ridiculous; it keeps getting tangled.  And the articulation of the ear coverings (for lack of a better term) is more than frustrating.  It takes me 2-3 minutes to get the darn things adjusted over my ears properly EACH TIME I put them on!The good thing is, they do a decent job of tuning out some of the exterior noise around me."
"I owned a pair many years ago when in radio.  Great headphones.  I purchased another pair years later.It's simple and to the point.  Sound quality is great.Only complaint is after a FEW uses, the padding was already peeling.  It's unfortunate because I have a cheaper pair of Sony headphones that was put to far more use, and no peeling issues.I would recommend them with a fair warning for flaking and peeling from the padding."
"I bought these back in 2017 for field recording for film, which I wouldn't recommend these for, especially if you're bagging and booming. The cable is very long and gets tangled easily especially if your boom setup isn't wireless. The muffs wear out pretty quickly, and I've had to tape them to the headphones to keep them from falling off. When filming outside if there is any wind it sounds very loud blowing past the ears, and makes it difficult to tell if the wind noise is passing by or coming through the mic.I've used these same headphones for editing though, and they are excellent for that."
"I can understand where many people like these headphones but the overhyped reviews were misleading to me. I had hoped they would be a good choice for both location sound monitoring as well as reasonably good ""audiophile"" level music listening headphones. At first I was impressed with the sound but then again I haven't had anything other than fairly cheap low-end headphones for awhile. Actually maybe I never have had any high quality headphones - years ago, before they were stolen in 2004, I had a set of Sennheiser HD400 (I think that was the model number) that I had since the 70s and I had always loved them even though the bass was insufficient. As someone who mostly listens to orchestral music (I kinda hate to use that term ""classical"" music because so many people have no clue what it really is) I found them to be close to sonically accurate. And as an orchestral trombone player I know what a trombone in the orchestra is supposed to sound like. I decided to buy an older set of Sennheiser HD400, HD414, HD424 or as I found on Ebay, a set of HD420 headphones - and then replace pads and/or clean them. So about the time I got the Sony MDR7506 from Amazon I received the Sennheiser HD420 and I was able to compare them. Using a short section of the Britten Four Sea Interludes that had some prominent trombone passages as well as bass and treble content I found the Sennheisers to be more realistic sounding and the Sony headphones to be extremely bright making those trombone passages very brittle and bright sounding. My initial guess was that there was a strong peak somewhere in the region of 4kHz to 10kHz. Later I found a test review by SonarWorks on YouTube of the Sony MDR7506 that shows an extreme upper freq. response peak - (since posting external links is not allowed on Amazon reviews search YouTube for Sonarworks and Sony MDR7506 to find this review) - although one should always wonder how unbiased the test is considering it comes from a company trying to sell you a product which is designed to improve the headphones being tested.  I also looked at other websites where there were frequency response charts and user reviews of the Sony MDR7506 but I remained skeptical of the accuracy and lack of bias in these reviews until I could get enough data. This website sells headphones so I'm not sure how accurate this info is: (search Google for headphone dot com then go to their page call Build A Graph) and then this page supports advertisers (although that doesn't necessarily mean that the reviews are biased) - (search Google for goldenears dot net then search for Sony MDR7506 reviews). Another website with ratings, opinions, and information is head-fi dot org (just do a search since I can't post live links here).But with all that information I was starting to see that the sonic qualities of the Sony MDR7506 (strong bass, bright highs) are probably appealing to the masses generally and are not so well suited for someone who likes acoustic/wide frequency spectrum/wide dynamic range music (like symphonic orchestra music - Wagner, Mahler, Bruckner, Holst, etc.).Since I also plan to do some location sound mixing I almost kept them since, as the SonarWorks reviewer mentions, they're well suited for that particular use since they have good acoustic noise isolation and the high treble emphasis could be helpful when trying to make sure you're not recording unwanted sounds on location.As much as I love the vintage Sennheiser HD420 headphones I plan to buy either Sennheiser HD558 or HD598 phones (maybe I'll spring for the HD600 since they almost universally have glowing reviews and from what I can see, reasonably flat frequency response) and when I do I'll update my review here as well as provide a review of those headphones.Back in the old days when we could visit a ""hifi audio store"" we could audition the speakers (and usually headphones) using our own records (or CDs in later years) - and in an appropriate and quiet environment - before making a purchase. Now most of those stores are gone (or don't stock all the products we may be interested in - especially if it's not the high end stuff) so the only thing we have to go on is the user reviews and what we read on the internet. At least until we make a purchase which thankfully is returnable. (Thanks Amazon!)I certainly couldn't in all honesty give these a 5 star rating nor would a 1 star or 2 star rating be appropriate either. You may love these headphones and prefer their sound but for me they weren't what I had hoped they would be."
"They work great for being able to hear in a loud environment and they would be 5 star if the quality of sound was good. 3 star because these sound terrible for listening to music. I have a pair of Beyerdynamic dt-770 I use for mixing and mastering and it's a night and day difference against the Sony. The Sony are a good choice for taking out to a venue where you just need to keep music in tempo and I would recommend them for that scenario, although they don't sound as clear as something like a set of Sennheiser. These are more cost effective than a set of Sennheiser and the option to pay in 5 installments is why I choose these."
After nearly five (5) years of casual usage the film surrounding the foam has deteriorated. It has not effected the overall quality of the sound...
"What I like: A) Clarity. B) Comfort. C) Coiled Cord. D) Removeable 1/4"" plug end converts to a 1'8"" plug.What I don't like: A) Adjustment never stays where you put it. B) Permanent cord attached on left side. C) Bass not that good.This set is comfortable to wear and has decent clarity. The ear cups are soft and comfortable. The coiled cord is a plus too.The fit adjust is a friction fit and never stays where you put it. Why can't they have a locking mechanism for this? The cord that goes into the headset is permanently attached to the left ear while on my computer the plugin is to the right and the cord is constantly in my way. And last but not least, the bass is seriously lacking, and the sound is lacking because of it. I wouldn't buy these again for the price."
"I like everything about these headphones except that they are heavy, and the cushion on the top should be at least 2-3 times thicker."
"I listened to some music with sounds/effects that can be described as S... SSSHHHH, HIIISSSSS, WiSSSSShh and noticed a little bit more ""emphasis"" (I'm being nice) on that S. No problem, I seen the sound profile from notable review/testing website(s) and read the info there. The MDR7506 has that headphone typical 8kHz climb to it which so happens to peak around 10.5kHz. Listening to music I was trying to convince myself I can work with it...not too big of a deal...for music playback. Lots of the time high treble gets cut out or tamed down, that is what a high cut is for. So enter the problem. I'm not using it for music, I record sounds from nature and life's ambience. Sounds that can be considered White noise or Pink noise. Rain, waves, wind, city sounds etc. When I record I try not use a cut filter. When editing I try not to cut off the highs or lows, I work with them. They are the sounds that open up, gives depth and imaging. I bought the 7506 because I saw that nice low end profile. Flatter of course then the open back headphones I been using (figured I need more headphones to get a idea how they will sound on other designs closed/open). So noticing the S distortion (my bad) emphasis and putting them to work for what I really need them for another reference headphone I pull up the audio of ocean waves crashing onto a beach I been working on using my HD560s. Recorded from sitting level, nice gentle ocean tide just passes in front. Larger ocean waves in front distant and side crashing. Very beautiful sound made to put you mentally sitting down enjoying the water hitting your feet on the beach. Get the idea, remember I don't use cut filters why collapse the stage. First reaction listening to my work on the newly bought MDR7506 vs HD560s. Ok.. they're smaller body not open back I get it...wait now what What! Omg what is that a ringing sound! I plug in and out switching between the HD560s and MDR7506 about 6 times. Yup that's a ringing aura I'm hearing and its noticeable. Very destructive. NOT EVEN present on the HD560s. Not wanting to compare against a 2x priced headphone, they are just the 1st ones I bought for the job. No Window audio enhancement are on. Figuring out where's the ring. My EQ around treble range is up 2.5db peaking at 8kHz then sloping back down, normalization -22db. Audio analyzer showing a downward sloping 6kHz~12kHz range waving from -60db up to -50db. Still stats don't matter cause EQ flat and aura like ringing still there. I put a point on the EQ at 10.5kHz and pull down to -7 gain. Aura like ring goes down but still is present. The aura like ring is more impressionable at 10.5kHz then any other freq. range. Now I wonder why the MDR7506 couldn't handle the frequency range of the ocean. Could it be because intensity of treble on a bad driver?  I would have to do a high cut starting from around 9kHz to get rid of the aura like ringing?! Just guessing because I put the 7506 back in the box ready to return. So I reason the drivers were bad or a driver was bad? Now why I question and go into length. Well, because I'm bored and want to bore the 3 people that read this lol jking somewhat. No. It is fishy to me that I can lower the ringing like aura pulling down the gain at the frequency point on the MDR7506 sound profile highest peak,10.5kHz. What's it mean for you? Do you listen to sounds that are white noise like? I never replaced them to find out if they where bad drivers and not write this mess. And well you 3 don't have my ocean waves recording. But the ocean is really like a white noise at times. Listen to a white noise generator. Do you hear that aura like ringing? It may pop up in your music..jking. Hopefully its a bad driver."
"Painfully high treble, these are only good for studio monitoring so you can detect imperfections during mixing.  For music listening these pick up every single treble and amplify it.  Not pleasant to listen to.  Sennheiser sounds so much better."
"I’m a little disappointed in the sound quality from these headphones.After reading a lot of the reviews , I ordered a set .The sound from several different receivers was disappointing, so I ordered an adapter to fit my iPhone and iPad so I could listen to some Amazon music .The sound is ok but not much better than my earbuds . And the over the ear headphones make my ears sweat .The box they come in is thin and the way it’s sealed makes it difficult to open without damaging the box .I would return these , if the box hadn’t split with me while attempting to carefully open it .Guess I’ll keep them around and maybe find a use for them ."
Didn’t last very long. Another item I bought in the trash.
I’ve owned two pairs in the last 25 years. The first pair lasted about 15 before the trim started peeling off. The newer pair just 3-4 years before the same thing happened. Now I get bits of black pleather all over the place when I use the headphones.
Tbh I have loved these headphones to buy them twice. But sadly no more. It’s time for another brand. For the price point i guess you get what you pay for. The sound & fit are great!! But that’s where it stops..The durability is really bad. Expect the headset cushions (which are very comfortable) to peel off within a year or two. You can get replacements but they aren’t as soft.The plastic parts of this headset are so cheap! so even if it looks screwed together. If you take them off wrong like i just did they will snap apart! At which point you can try and glue them or duck tape them like i did my 1st pair. But your better off just getting a brand that’s built better.Added note: The coil cord is long and stretchy which is great for movement. But it’s really annoying because you have to unwind it by dangling the headset. A coil cord was the wrong choice imo
"The description for tese headphones said that they come with a soft case. No case was included with these headphones. They just came in cheap cardboard packaging, which made me wonder if these are brand new headphones."
"I bought the SONY MDR 7506, the SONY MDR V150 and AUDIO TECHNICA ATH-M40x headphones for my home studio. I've tested them, comparing their sound to each other and to my sources.The V150 are the cheapest (reg $50 CDN, sale $30) and they feel (in construction and materials and comfort) and sound cheap when compared to the other two. I bought these first and they were fine for a singer or drummer recording parts, although not inspiring. I was happy for the money I spent and was wondering if more expensive headphones were worth it. The V150's sound and isolation isn't good enough to give keyboardists, guitarists, bassists an accurate representation of their parts.I didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars on headphones and began researching on-line. The M40x's (reg $180 CDN, sale $150), along with their sibling M50x get excellent ratings. I bought the M40x on sale and was pleasantly surprised at the huge improvement from the V150's... WOW!!!  So there IS indeed better headphone sound at a higher price.However, since I bought the M40x's I've not seen them on sale and their price has increased a lot. I wanted to get 3 more headphones with such good sound but can't afford the M40x's. More research led me to discover excellent ratings for the SONY MDR 7506 ($140 CDN). SONY has been making these for decades, so they're tried and true and it's easy to find replacement parts. When I read numerous times how the 7506's are often used by professionals in the recording world, I thought they'd be perfect.The M40x's come closest to what I hear from my sources. The 7506's are very bright, with the highs being very forward, the bottom restrained and the sub-frequencies lacking. It's a very noticeable difference between the two headphones, like listening to FM radio (the M40x's) and then AM radio (the 7506's). This is odd because the 7506 claim to have a frequency range of 10-20kHz while the M40x's have 15-24kHz, and yet we hear more bass from the M40's and more highs from the 7506's. So, sonically, these are very different and some people prefer one over the other. They both sound good, and you'll quickly adjust or get used to the sound until you compare it to the other.The SONY headphones have attached cords, the V150 has a straight cord and the 7506 has a coiled cable. The M40x has detachable cables which can be locked/unlocked, so you can replace or change your cables, which is a bonus and potentially means the headphones will last much longer. I should say that I read many reviews of people claiming their 7506 headphones lasted them 10+ years without hassle. There is more padding for the ears and head on the M40x's, so it fits more snugly and is a bit heavier and feels a bit more solid too. Both headphones can collapse to be more portable. Both come with a cloth carrying case.Ultimately, if you get a chance to hear the 7506 and M40x to compare them, do so. They're both good headphones at a reasonable price that I would recommend. I don't think the Dre's compare in sound for the price, and I also think the Sennheiser HD280 sounds too boxy in comparison."
These are the best headphones ever! What would make them perfect would be a detachable cord so a six-foot cord could be used for travel. This headphone comes with a 400-foot cord that is ridiculously long and awkward unless used in a studio. I have searched for years for a service that would shorten the cord with no luck. So I sold them and am using wireless. I would love to have these headphones with a six-foot cord.
"I'm not an audiophile by personal description, but I can discern sound quality, I just want to listen to music without it sounding cheap (this isn't bad, but it's not the upgrade I expected from switching to a purely headset priced the same as a 2 in 1). It sounds just slightly better than my old Razer Kraken Pro V2. To qualify better, with this I can feel some bass (I don't care about this, but it does feel nice up to a point), and the higher range has a bit less noise (clearer overall sound).The build quality is as cheap as feasibly possible while maintaining something that probably won't break. It has metal band extension pieces, which is a requirement for anyone with a big head. And the cord is good, I do love Sony's tendency to put coiled cords even if they aren't braided. That's about it as far as positives go for build. Everything else is lightweight and cheap feeling, crackles with every movement (auditory not physically cracking), pads are going to be replaced with some third party cooling gel options because the vinyl coating is the kind that will break down nearly immediately and flake all over your house. The ear cups ride the line between on and over the ear, and I was hoping for and prefer a roomy over ear. The folding is aggressive and annoying as the hinge is so loose that it wants to pop into folded position at every opportunity.I don't think any aspect of them justifies the price, I could have just got a new 2 in 1 Razor gaming headset, I just didn't want to deal with Synapse so I separated into individual mic and headphones to hopefully get better respective quality from each. I ended up with just vaguely better for a substantial price hike."
"These are a horrible option for DJing. Tons of sound comes through, despite the ""closed back"""
"The headphones are good quality. I have them from 6-7 years may be more. Works great, but I've used them maybe-9-10 times the most. Just realized that the lather is falling apart. After my last use, my wife start cleaning my face and sides, wondering what it was. I took a look at the headphones and figured it out. Very upset about it. They are almost brand new. Why???"
"It feels very nice and comfortable to wear, but the sound leakage is so high. It's so unfortunate because I bought these for a film class so that I would have the highest quality of sound when editing in public. Unfortunately, I cannot use these in public because it has the most amount of sound leakage, even when I use it on a very low volume."
"There's a huge hype on the internet saying 7506 hits the Harman target listening curve perfectly and in terms of sound quality, it only second to Sennheiser HD800, which costs $2000+.  I didn't hesitate to get a 7506 for only $84. After listening to 7506 for just 1 hour I realized I can't use it very long, because it makes my ears very uncomfortable. I am still feeling that deafening effect 10h later. I listened to 7506 with the volume I usually use, but no other headphones has caused such an effect on my ears.7506 amplifies high frequencies sounds, making the faintest details unmissable. On the first hearing of 7506, I was impressed by its clarity of human voices. No wonder why it is so popular among professionals because it helps them finding all the glitches. However, this feature is not good for human ears. Loud high frequency sounds damage the hair cells in the inner ears, and it might causes hearing loss. I noticed that many users of 7506 reported they could no longer enjoy other headphones after using 7506 for a period of time. It's obvious to me that it's not because 7506 is so good that it beats the sounds of all other headphones, but rather because it damages their hearings and making them less sensitive to sounds.On the other hand, 7506 is great at restoring the true sound of the recording, which makes it very edible with EQs. I haven't really mastered the art of tuning my audios yet, but lowering the volume of high frequencies on 7506 would definitely improve the comfort level on my ears. However, I still couldn't eliminate that ""zing"" sound with EQ tuning, which makes strings in music harsh and less enjoyable to my ears.In conclusion, professional headphones like 7506 are really made for professionals. For private/leisure uses, there are other suitable options even at this price. (Phillips SHP9500 or Sennheiser's mid-range products are usually highly rated)"
"Having earbuds in my ears all day for Teams/Zoom meetings, I wanted some external headphones to give myself a break.  These were highly rated and reviewed, so I splurged.  Honestly, I wouldn't do it again.  The frame creaks and groans, which is a distraction from whatever you are listening to.  The sound quality is nothing special.  Maybe I am showing my age, but the headphones on my dad's old Hi-Fi system back in the day sounded a million times better.  My little one has a cheap set of Leap Frog 'phones that came with a toy, and I think the quality is similar.  Not worth the price."
"First, let me be clear that Amazon has been very helpful in this matter, replacing the product well after they should have been required to. And there is nothing wrong with the basic product, in fact the sound is so much better than my previous Audio Technica phones (which I replaced only because they are high impedance, and not appropriate for the small portable cd player I now use) that I am bitter about the apparent need to switch back. So what's the beef? I, like millions of other Americans, am hearing impaired. I have a great pair of hearing aids that completely remedy my disability. Good thing, as music is my greatest joy in life. The only conceivable hitch is that I have to wear over-the-ear headphones, as my ear canal is already occupied. My hearing aids even have a special setting for listening to music (it doesn't filter out high frequencies, as the regular setting does). As soon as I started to use these Sony headphones, however, I noticed an obvious background noise in one ear, sort of like wind howling, or like the sound of blowing across the top of a Coke bottle. When the music is present, the sound is drowned out, but between cuts (or during unusually quiet sections of music) it becomes evident, and pretty much destroys the listening experience. This is where things get weird, because the earphones don't even have to be plugged in for this sound to be clearly audible. I've driven Orticon, the hearing aid manufacturer, nuts trying to fix it; they have even completely replaced the affected hearing aid (we're talking half of a $3,000. piece of medical equipment here, folks. No dice, although weeks went by while I pursued this avenue. So I switched to Sony, hoping they might be aware of some sort of interference phenomena. The first tech guy I spoke with was pleasant, but baffled. He spent at least half and hour searching, but could find nothing in any of their support databases indicating this had ever happened before. He indicated there must be something defective about that particular set of headphones. So over to Amazon, and to my surprise, they were willing to replace the item even though 5-6 weeks had passed. Only two days later it arrived, but my hopes were quickly dashed. I didn't even have to plug the earphones in to hear the noise. I even had my daughter (reluctantly) put my hearing aid on and then the headphones, and she could hear it clearly (still not plugged in). My second (and last) call to Sony did not go nearly as well. The enormously disinterested fellow I reached this time petulantly announced that there was no support for that product, and I was welcome to send it in for repair. I explained that there was not necessarily anything wrong with the item, but that I felt they should make some sort of notation of the issue in case it came up again. We don't do that, he replied. Go away, his attitude loudly suggested. I'm sure Amazon will help me select a different product, but I thought the customer community might want to be aware of just how unconcerned Sony is with issues involving a hearing disability, and a product that has turned out to be a tremendous waste of several professional people's time."
"May 30, 2024 -- I recently purchased, via Amazon, a new pair of these Sony MDR7506 headphones. I've been a fan of these headphones since the late 1990's and this is the 5th pair that I've owned. They wear out, I get it. That's fine. I've had soundmen solder broken wires, and I've replaced earpads.....  and none of that ever bothered me... but now things have changed. The coiled cable is kinked up (out of the shape of the coil) in 4 places, and constantly gets tangled. I'm not doing anything different, and this has never been a problem before.Seems like every business, sooner or later, has to cheap-out with quality. If they'll change the quality of a simple thing like a headphone cable, what else will they change? I'm not planning to purchase any more products made by SONY."
"Previously, I was a big fan of Sony's line of mixing headphones which are beloved by audio professionals.  When this pair of headphones arrived, I noticed that it was a slightly different model than my old AMAZING pair that lasted me for years - even though I took terrible care of them and was often dumb enough as a kid to sleep in them.  The ear covers of this model were smaller and flimsier than it appeared in the photos, but it still sounded decent enough that I didn't return it - even if it wasn't as good as I remembered.  I treated these headphones VERY WELL, but within only like 2months, the internal wiring broke right next to the jack like a pair of 10 dollar headphones you expect to replace every month of heavy use.  Literally, it broke faster than one of those old Iphone chargers which are literally designed to break at that exact spot so you buy it again.  The left speaker doesn't work unless I move the wire around and get it to stay in a sweet spot.  These were a little cheaper than my last model, but even at the lower price they are horrible. A 15 dollar pair of skullcandy earbuds would have lasted longer and had around the same audio quality for all practical purposes."
"I’ve owned this model of headphones for about 15 years. They are (were) great monitoring headphones. They used to be sturdily built with rich sound, a high quality carrying case and plush comfortable speaker covers that felt great on the ears and wore themselves in over years of use. Like a leather glove. Just spectacular. The frequency response is relatively flat which is what you want for monitoring. Not the greatest bass but enough to hear the higher end of the bass frequencies. What I loved about these was I got very used to how relationships between sounds translated from the headphones to monitors, to large live rigs.Not so much with this latest pair.The construction of them is some cheaply made plastic. Even the carrying case has been downgraded to nylon. Can’t believe how cheaply made these feel. To be honest I think it’s rather misleading to market this as the same headphones. This is a huge disappointment and I’ll just be going back to my old pair (left them in the office and really needed a pair for quick monitoring for a project)To be honest, I would stay away from these now. I’m in complete shock that this is being sold as the same model. It’s down right insane.2 stars because the sound isn’t horribly offensive and they work. But they feel like a $20 pair of cans I bought from Walmart instead of a nice pair of headphones. I don’t expect these to be the “best” but I expect them to feel more premium and this is a complete joke. Returning for full refund asap."
"After my Turtle Beach P11 gaming USB headphones died, I chose these MDR7506's as a replacement because the whole internet, including r/headphones, seems to agree these have:- sturdy build quality- passed the test of time; built the same way for decades; recording studio pros trust them- audiophile-level quality- unusually consistent positive reviewsSo I was surprised how much worse these were to the mid-range Turtle Beach headphones I came from. VERY flat sound. Sheniqua Stevens' review perfectly describes my experience: ""When you put on headphones it should feel like you've been immersed in the audio. Instead, these are the equivalent of taking two desktop speakers and taping them to your ears.""And these are audiophile headphones?Am I missing something?I checked my audio drivers -- up to date. I checked my 3.5mm jacks with other headphones -- they're fine. I tried both the front and back headphone jacks on my PC -- these headphones sounded just as flat on both.I just can't get over how music, TV, and games sounded richer, more dynamic, more layered, and clearer on my USB gaming headphones than these supposed audiophile, studio grade MDR7506's.If you had blindfolded me, I would've thought these were $30 headphones. Like, the sound quality is clearly more high-definition than my ancient $10 headphones; every audio layer is clearer and cleaner. And yet the overall sound is so flat that...well, Sheniqua worded it perfectly: it's like taping two desktop speakers to your ears. It sounds faraway."
"Heard about these from a Wirecutter review. They are intended for persons who record audiobook narration in a studio. What I wanted was a set of high-quality, over-the-ear, wired headphones with large cushions. What I got is a set of cheap, flimsy, hard-wired headphones with an absurdly long cable. Maybe a long cable is useful if you are narrating audiobooks, but it is a Bad Idea for use with a computer. Problem could be easily solved using modular plugs and different lengths of cable, but they don’t provide that option. Sound seems OK, but my hearing is not great. I bought the headphones mostly for increased volume. Overall, I’d say you can do better. I’ll keep using mine until they break or I figure out a way to install a shorter cable. A 10-foot cable? C’mon man!Update 3/18/2023: I looked into splicing the cable to shorten it, but the cost of the gear necessary to perform the splice exceeded the cost of a new set of headphones. The cord created so much clutter around my desk that it had to go. I replaced these headphones with a lesser pair of Sennheiser headphones that feature a detachable 3' cable. So much easier. In the end, two big strikes against the Sony headphones: (1) the cable is not detachable from the headphones and thus cannot be swapped out or replaced; and (2) the cable is 10' long. Accordingly, I have reduced my rating from three to two stars."
No complaints in the sound department. But the build quality is terrible. Sony has done nothing in all of these years to make small improvements/refinements. The ear pads have got to go PERIOD. These monitors can also pull your hair if you're not careful. I wouldn't keep giving Sony money for this product. Get the beyerdynamic DT 770 M instead. Better build quality and better audio quality for just a bit more in price.
The sound is indeed neutral. But neutral kinda socks. Would rather use my hyper x 2s for music production tbh
"2019 update on original review below (dropped to three stars): These Sony MDR7506 are not durable. I've dropped them from my desk about 1.5 feet a couple of times and now big bass sounds are torn and distorted. Also if I stand up while wearing them and put any strain on the cord, my ear gets shocked by what must be a loose connector.Two years later, the ear phone liner is peeling off almost completely. Also the cord winds up on itself *daily* for me which is a huge hassle, and loses half its length from this.Original review: I was stunned how these headphones revealed quality and depth in music I thought I had been listening to for years. I felt pretty stupid for cheating myself out of the pleasures of good music all this time. They also feel comfortable to me after a few hours and I'm a tall person with a fairly large noggin. The fancy packaging makes me feel like I bought $500 headphones and gave me that quick passing feeling of being a wealthy person.I would say in particular my electronic, ambient, classical and choral music benefited the most. That's where I felt the ceiling and floors dropped out to reveal new dimensions. Older stuff like 60s rock certainly sounded better than before but I could also detect more flaws. If your MP3 collection is 128 bit rate prepare to be upset how bad they sound in good headphones.It goes without saying that if you're going to spend $80 on good headphones for computer use, your computer should have a good sound card. Onboard sound cards typically have noise interference. I'm using an old SoundBlaster Live! 24-Bit External USB and cannot hear any noise or hiss whatsoever when these headphones are plugged in."
Bass is pathetic.  Covering of foam is pealing away.  I wouldn't buy these again.  I'm disappointed.
"These cans have freq boost's at 2-3 places in the spectrum that are annoying, pita to compensate for. ive had 10-12 sets of headphones and i miss AKG's that were actually made in Austria!The cheap old folding little sony MDR's from the 90's were much better!!How these could get a good review is beyond me! the only reason for the 2.5 is they seem built well.comfort 2 stars, sound 1.5-2 stars, build 2.5 stars, price 2 stars."
"I really enjoyed these headphones. I’ve owned two pair to this date and I enjoyed both. They provide a really nice sound, they’re comfortable, and they’re very portable because they collapse into themselves.PACKAGING:The headphones come in a beautiful packaging. They com in a box with really nice gold trim on the inside and a carrying pouch as well.COSTRUCTION:Overall, I’d say the headphones are constructed very nicely. Real leather wrapped band, aluminum cups. The pads on the cups are made of a pleather like material and I ended up replacing them with some Beyerdynamic EDT250V pads. WONDERFUL set up!Something I don’t like about the construction however, is the 3.5mm jack. It is VERY easy to bend. I’m talking crazy easy. It’s why both pairs of my headphones broke. They still play sound, but only out of one side. Another thing I don’t like is that the band can warp if you store them in a backpack or something. It is pretty much impossible to bend it back to it’s original shape as the second you put them back on, they feel weird.SOUND:The sound is pretty good. Good enough to do some vocal tracking and listen to music. I wouldn’t recommend mixing with these though as the sound isn’t really neutral. It’s slightly colored and accentuates the highs and dulls the lows. I have a pair of Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pros that I use for mixing and recording and I find them to be much more true to sound when it comes to instruments.Overall, I think these headphones are a good buy for those looking to have a nice pair of headphones to listen to music with and record vocals with but I would not recommend mixing songs with them."
"The MDR 7506’s actually loose a lot of high frequency information in different spots on the frequency spectrum. When A/B-ing them it was night and day noticeable that information was being lost between 1kHz and 20kHz. It wasn’t like a shelf was dampening the high end, but instead multiple sharp bell curves cutting out frequencies. The instruments were there and present, but Vocals sounded muffled, cymbals were no longer crisp, and there was no air to lift the track.My issue is that I want to be able to swap between headphones and my speakers without any alteration in tonality. And I want the low end to kick like a sub while being flat. I already have Audio Technica ATH M50’s, which are way too bright! So much so it overshadows the low end, but they are super clear. I have JBL LSR2325’s and a Genelec Sub which are phenomenal speakers especially with my treated room and they are tuned properly.I bought both competing popular headphones, the Sony MDR 7506’s and the Sennheiser HD 280 Pro’s. Dude…the HD 280 Pro’s are FLAT, CLEAR, and the low end kicks like a sub! (somehow for headphones). When I swap between the HD 280’s and my rig it literally sounds damn near the same! The HD 280 Pro’s just squeeze your head too tight, fold in a stupid manner, don’t come with a case/bag, and make you look dumb. Lolz. But the HD 280 Pro’s are the best choice for budget professional headphones!"
Thought for sure these would sound good as many on youtube say they do. To me they were the worse headphones i have ever owned including all my ear buds. Had to send them back.
They work. Saw them used on great musicians doing the Playing for Change tributes. Like most things sony these days not built to last. Pricey for the build quality.
"- It might be too bright on the treble, to the point that I had to equalize it. Not good for music listening.- Bass response might be a little weak.- Builds up heat in about 8-10 mins of wearing it- The coil wire is heavy, I prefer the straight wire"
"I purchased three different headphones during 2021:  a Monoprice Monolith, Audio-Technica ATH-M40x, and these.  The Monoprice were nice, but I kicked the cable and destroyed one of the input jacks (which I haven't got around to repairing).  My second favorite with respect to sound were the Sony Studio Monitors, and last were the Audio-Technicas.  But the Audio-Technicas lasted the longest, since the Monoprice phones which have had very little use, are starting to degrade like the Sonys and also suffer from the ""sticky plastic fatigue"" in the headset, which is somewhat indicative of the polymer quality.  The Sonys have excellent sound fidelity, are comfortable to wear and a good buy, but don't expect them to last."
"First, the seller was great. Quick and accurate shipping.To the headset. First, the good: sound quality is pretty good. Good highs, good mids, it’s not overly bassy but the bass is *slightly* muddy with a little echo. Nothing crazy but it’s there.The bad: pretty much everything else. The cups. Well, there are none really. The cups consist essentially of some very cheap feeling foam cousins glued directly to the driver housing. Can’t really comment more on the ear cups since there really isn’t any.The headband. I don’t think I’ve ever encountered a headband so cheaply made on a headset until you get to the $30 price point. The mounts to the drivers are really plasticy and overly enthusiastic about folding up. The headband itself consists of some really thin steel bands which appear to just be stamped given the rough edges. The head cushion atop the band offers little in the way of comfort, pretty instantly forming a rather uncomfortable pressure point at the top of my head (I have short hair so if you’ve got a lot of hair this may be less of an issue but still). The build quality does not warrant its $90 price tag. Although that’s not a lot for a “studio” headset, it’s far too much for these. They should be more in the $45 range.If you’re considering this headset, please allow me to offer an alternative.For usually less money than these you can pick up a set of Takstar Pro 80’s. They have better drivers imo and the build quality of the headset is, without exaggeration, about 30x better. Has actual cups formed from aluminum with great (and interchangeable) ear cushions and the headband is sturdy, offering comfortable clamping force that seals without being over bearing. Second to those in that price is the Takstar Pro 82’s. The Pro 80’s have been discontinued (so when stock runs out the 82’s are the alternative) the pro 80’s live on as the HyperX Cloud II headset, difference being it incorporated a Mic. Which you may or may not want depending if a four pole connector will be an issue or not (won’t be an issue for phones, computers, consoles etc).For the price, these are bottom of the barrel imo. Buy the Takstars instead, and be happy."
It's an expensive headphone so I treat it with care. It has never left my office once yet somehow over the course of 8 months the headphone jack wound up getting bent. I'm assuming its a manufacturing defect because otherwise you would need to heat the metal up and exert a decent amount of force to bend it.I tried contacting Sony's support because I should be in the warranty window but Sony told me they only cover software issues with your warranty and that I could PAY to get the item fixed.Don't buy this. The sound quality wasn't even good anyways.
"I've worked in the audio production industry for over 15 years (been doing audio work for 22 years), and I have always sworn by the MD-7506 headphones for regular, rugged use. This is my 14th pair and I must say, I'm not impressed with this pair. There is a buzzing in the right ear cup that is really getting on my nerves (I have pairs that are many years old, that have their vinyl covering completely gone from the ear cups due to use) that have better crispness and absolutely no buzzing.I will certainly never buy from Amazon LLC ever again when ordering pro audio stuff, I'll have to buy from smaller companies that stand behind their name (I imagine that Amazon LLC has some sort of deal on slight defects and sells them as new). Luckily, I do know how to service these headphones, so I will keep them and make them right myself (I should not have to do that).I'll probably buy another pair from a more reputable dealer (or directly from Sony) and just keep this pair as a backup (when in a pinch).It's only $100, but yeah, I really wish these were as consistent as the other 13 units that I've had over the years (this is the very first pair that I've ever had an issue with at all; spanning many years).Amazon is a fantastic venue for buying a great many things at a great value, but when it comes to audio equipment, beware (when buying audio equipment for your work, you can go to the roadside outlet store and expect the same value). That is essentially what Amazon *is* when they're dealing directly with distributors: you end up getting the original distributor's ""slightly defective"" stuff.I bought these from Amazon at the same price that I can get them directly from Sony.I know that many of you will say something along the lines of, ""write a review of the product, not the experience with the provider"", etc. I understand that, but in this case it was provided by Amazon LLC. I will stand by these headphones any day of the week, they're a great product (industry standard). However, I won't stand by Amazon LLC selling me a shoddy version of the product itself.I expected the same consistency that I've had for many years, it took Amazon to break that continuity. I won't ever buy these from Amazon ever again, that is for sure."
"After very little total use I am looking for my third pair of pads in three years at a cost of $25 a set ($75 and counting). My old Sennheiser headphones/pads (that I still have) lasted 25 years! I only use them for watching Blu-Ray movies when the wife is asleep. They stay in a cabinet in a velvet bag. Pads started flaking off... I will (god only knows) maybe have to buy 10 more pairs in the future? Rrrrr... notice on Amazon replacement pads are bought really OFTEN... crazy.  Sony products are beautiful, but have a two year life span due to poor durability. If you are a fan of Sony products then fine, I was too. But two close friends who bought these on my recommendation have had the exact problem. Both also walked around work with black specks stuck to their faces not knowing what the source was...***UPDATE*** Please read the review of this Sony products' earcups at the following competitors' earcup replacements have been used by a dozen other owners (a suitable replacement there) at Beyerdynamic EDT 200 ear cushions. They state the problem better then I can... these Sony cups will disintegrate within a year's time (or two etc.). I bought a set of those new velour ones and am VERY happy almost two years now. Thanks folks for the kind update (those of you have expressed discontent at other forum members bringing up a valid and established issue are way off base! ... please just let the 'easy fix' be published instead of comment on your 'feelings' on hundred dollar headphones needing almost immediate replacement)  ... take care all you wonderful other Amazon update people who have helped and assisted with this issue!UPDATE June/2014 ... The left channel went out on these earphones long ago, binned. I have since purchased Grado, have not looked back once. I have disabled ALL Amazon alerts, so to those of you sane persons... best of luck with your purchase. To any of those who would state that their feelings about a product are superior to others, my wife says: these men were abused as children, are still children, have never truly experienced love... we should pray for them... and be thankful someone else has to wipe up all the venomous spittle. *whew*"
"The headphones are good and are just as advertised. However, I purchased these as an upgrade from my Sony MDRZX110NC (on the ear, noise canceling ones, a very common headset) and I gotta say, the sound quality is basically the exact same, if not worse in some certain (mostly complex) tracks I listen to.They get about the same in terms of volume and quality, however the MDR7506 is like when the MDRZX110NC has its noise cancellation on, so you get the performance without having to go through AAA batteries.For $100 for these, you can get a near same sound experience for $40 with the MDRZX110NC. All you're paying twice more for is over the ear cups, a better cord, and not having to use AAA batteries for the performance. If you want louder or more sound depth, you might have to look else where if you're coming from a similar headset like I am."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It looks good, it’s light weight and for the price point the ear cushion and sound isolation is acceptable.However, on my 3rd time using I realized the right side stopped working. I did notice also that from the start that the output volume was relatively low, so to me this is not the best fit for loud stage environments."
I bought this to upgrade my $50 Yamaha headphones expecting higher resolution sound. It just didn’t work out for Yamaha digital piano. The sound was muffled and metallic. It maybe a great headphone for a studio use though.
"I got this pair of headphones to go with an Amp/DAC and the sound quality is honestly really good with those, but I'd give it a hard pass without external assistance. At the very least you'd need an Amp for these to sound good, and without it my 30 dollar headphones sound better.As for the issue, fresh out of the box these headphones have a squeaky left earmuff so whenever I turn or adjust my head I have to deal with hearing a squeak. This was passable at the start but it's grown really annoying with time and I honestly wish I could try to return these for a different pair to see if I just got a faulty one. Due to this combined with my Amp comment above, I'd HIGHLY recommend against purchasing these unless you know full well what you're doing and have a proper setup to utilize them to their fullest. The comfort is there, the cable is nice, and the sound quality is wonderful if you have a proper setup to attach them to."
"These things sound like they have static in the background, and they generally sound pretty flat. I dug out my old Grado SR60 headphones, and they sounded amazing in comparison. Too bad I need a closed-back headphone to keep out noise at work, or I would just use my old Grados."
These things are okayyyyy. I had high hopes for these. But they didn't meet standards. I've heard better on much cheaper headphones. The bass is okay. The quality is okay Atwell. Sound is average. So I would not advise you to buy it because you can find better trust me
"I used these maybe once per week for two years and they've mostly disintegrated (see attached photo). Several months back the covering to the earphone part started peeling and now it is pretty much totally gone. They really weren't used much (not an everyday thing, but rather used when doing some guitar recording on weekends).At the end of the day, I suppose they aren't that expensive, and they were comfortable with decent sound quality while they lasted. So, I guess just part of our disposable products culture that seems prevalent nowadays. But since I only used them less than 100 times, they ended up costing about a $1 per use..."
I was very impressed by how good these were until suddenly They started making high pitched static noise which you can’t get rid of even if you’d unplug - plug again. The static goes off whenever static feels like it. To be fair this could be the one piece that I got. It’s so unfair to judge them as bad because they are phenomenal when they do work. The inconvenience of returning them is another factor in why I rate it low and now I am not comfortable to give them another try.
"There was a time when Sony could use the power of their brand name to gouge consumers (they were the Beats of the 80s), but those days are long gone. Sony is still hovering around the top of the heap in quality-control, but they no longer command a premium pricing structure, and as a result their pro-grade headphones represent a great mix of quality and affordability. These headphones are both comfortable and solidly made. I personally hate the extra loops of speaker-wire extruding from the intersection of the headband and earpieces, but that's unfortunately not uncommon with monitor headphones.As for sound quality, MDRs represent a step up from anything else in the price bracket. Keep in mind that these are not intended to be used for everyday listening at the gym etc. If you want a pair of consumer headphones that will bump up the bass and scoop the mids, grab a pair of Beats (if you're made of money) or stick with Shure/Bose. But if you need to have access to all the sonic colors in a mix--a flat EQ with plenty of character and warmth--these are going to fit the bill.One star deducted for those ugly, clumsy loops of wire.Edit: an additional star deducted for the terrible creaking noise where the cord attaches to the left can. It wasn’t particularly noticeable when I was mixing music, but it’s intolerable during any spoken-word recording or a podcast."
"Great headphones, but clamping forces were too high for me after 30-45 minutes. Most importantly, I rarely return purchases, but this return has been the worst…three weeks and crickets."
"I'm not generally someone with a lot of audio experience. I decided to buy a pair of these headphones because I started a podcast and I needed recording headphones to go with my Blue Yeti. They do work for this purpose-- they isolate sound. However, there is a sort of electronic buzzing that almost always seems to be there when I'm recording, when I'm listening to music, even when they're just plugged into my computer. I bought the first pair refurbished and I thought that the fact that they were refurbished was the problem, so I sent them back and brought a new pair. I tried plugging them into my laptop, and they're much better, but unfortunately they still have a little bit of white noise that you can hear when listening to music or audiobooks..I'm not exactly sure what the issue is. I know these are supposed to be high quality recording headphones. I'm happy to get advice from those who know what they're doing because I'd love to love these headphones.Otherwise, the headphones do ok as recording headphones. They fit nicely and are comfortable-- I have a small head so I find a lot of headphones to be uncomfortable. So if you're a podcaster, they'll work for their intended purpose, but you may need something else to listen to music."
"I've spent about 6 hours testing these out today on arrival, but had to use them on and off.Overall, the sound quality is great, but keep in mind these are production headphones and some of the noise levels you'd expect in standard headphones will come out flatter due to the non-emphasis on bass.My main issues with the headphones so far are :1) They're extremely tight and cause pain on my ears. I'm working on stretching them out at the moment and will update my review if it gets better over the next few days.2) The standard ear pads run very hot and cannot breath at all. Just be aware if you buy these, you'll definitely be looking for a replacement set very soon. Luckily, they're a long produced headphone and there are tons of options out there for this.3) The cord is a bit long and I'll likely be shortening it a bit soon. Thankfully, there's a product manual that includes all of the components and again, plenty of guides out there to do things like this. The cable is NOT detachable, so if you want to shorten or replace, it will take some additional effort."
"I bought these in the latter part of 2019. In 2022 the covering for the cup on one ear had completely pulled away from its inner seam, showing the foam inside and the other cup was showing tears. Most of my usage has been around my house while using my computer. A couple of times I used the headphones outside while walking. Sound quality was always good. I think the cord is way too long, but if that's what you're into...well, there you go."
"Extremely uncomfortable, way too tight, not well padded, and designed for very small ears. Sound quality is adequate at best, but headphones are impossible for me to wear for more than 20-30 minutes. Just too painful."
"I got these because my fancy Sennheiser studio headphones went bad and I wanted a solid replacement that didn’t cost a lot.I don’t use them to listen to music or anything so I’m not being picky.I got these because I HAVE used them in a studio before and I knew they usually last a long time if you take care of them and sound does come out of them when it is supposed to. The sound quality is less than stellar. You shouldn’t expect rich tones from these things. Plus they feel kind of flimsy and if you have a big head and ears like I do, they may be a bit uncomfortable over time.Can you do better? Yes. But you’ll pay more and I wasn’t willing to do that. I just wanted sound to hit my ears and these do that well enough."
"Disappointing :( I do not know why these headphones have such amazing reviews. I am coming from a pair of (entry level) Sennheiser HD 205. The HD205's are not bad, but I had listed to some other great headphones and wanted something ""next level"" for Christmas. What I really wanted were the Sennheiser Momentum but I could not afford those. Based on reviews, these seemed the best in the sub $100 range and they were on for a good price on Amazon.TL;DR: These are good earphones but not great. Everybody carries on about how they are as good as a pair of $200 cans but in my experience they are in the same league as my DH205's and only ever so slighly better. I vastly prefer some more high end cans.PROS: Clear sound. Not muddied at all. Very good noise isolation.CONS: Treble is way too hissy and sibbilant. I need to turn volume down on high treble tracks. Uncomfortable ear cups (maybe because I have big ears? After 20 mintues I really wish I could move these things or take them off).In the end they are actually quite good. I mean the sound is good. But it is ""just"" good, not great. Maybe with a proper amplified driver or high end Hi-Fi system they would be as amazing as people say (I am just using my phone) but I can't help but feel let down based on all the stellar reviews."
"I've had these headphones for several months now.  The sound quality is good, but the headphones themselves are extremely uncomfortable to wear.  I was not expecting to have this problem, as I have a fairly small head.  These headphones are very tight, however (in fact, my sister's three-year-old tried them on, and they seemed to fit him just fine).  There is almost no padding on the top, and the headphones are heavy, so they put a lot of weight on the top of the head.  The sides also compress the ears quite a bit, and -- at least for me -- this becomes painful in a fairly short time.For the record, these headphones also offer almost no sound cancellation whatsoever.  I was aware that they were not sound-cancelling headphones, but was hoping that the closed headphones would block out some amount of sound.  I have not found this to be the case.I've continued using the headphones because they do offer good sound quality, and because I can't, at present, afford to buy a better pair.  But if I had it to do over, I would certainly not buy these."
They squish my head so I can't wear them for long periods of time.
"Not professional.Overall an excellence experience for movies and music but there is a distortion for lower pitched talking .Not a good professional choice because for listening videographers, listening for accuracy with lower to mid voices there is distortion when the person projects their voice, so you can't tell if the distortion is the headphones or from the source. I did contact Sony and they had me send back the 1st pair then gave me another pair but still same problem."
"I've owned these headphones for about 2 or 3 years and honestly I've regretted purchasing them since day 1. But I spent 100 bucks on them so i guess I'll still run them until they die.For some reason these have a very low output volume. I have to set my computer's volume to about 40 percent to hear anything at a decent level, especially trying to game (which these I would definitely not recommend for as these have an extremely flat sound profile). On other headphones I had only needed to bring my computer's volume to about 14 percent which created a very reasonable listening volume.I also don't enjoy these for listening to music or using them for video editing because they just aren't dynamic at all. I just can't find a decent use for these headphones. When you put on headphones it should feel like you've been immersed in the audio. Instead, these are the equivalent of taking two desktop speakers and taping them to your ears.Edit:I forgot to also add that these headphones WILL give you a fair amount of pain after about 40 minutes if you have slightly larger ears than average.Also disappointed that the cable does not disconnect from the headphone. I thought that would be an industry standard for a studio headphone even at this price range.I am absolutely stumped by all these 5 star reviews because typically I am not a picky person and I can usually find a use for about any product so it almost leads me to believe I received a less than optimal version of these headphones."
"I purchased it because of the great reviews at Amazon and YouTube. I was convinced that this is a ""must have"" headphone. The sound quality is good. I can really appreciate what it means by ""non-EQ affected"" sound. Very pleasant sound quality. However, I have to turn the volume to around 90 % to hear decent sound. And I am using DAC amplifier. Definitely worse than my under $30 earphones. Most importantly, it hurt my ear/head after 30 min. I'm so surprised all the reviews said people can wear it whole day in studio editing music with this. Did the manufacturer changed the structure/design, or I just get a bad one? Anyway, just plain hurtful to wear it. No way I can keep it, unfortunately. I really want to love it. But I just can't."
"Overall, a somewhat decent headphone (Sony MDR-7506) but didn't do anything phenomenal in my opinion - surely didn't live up to the expectations from all the sterling reviews I've read.  I look for a well balanced sound with tight and low bass, and tend to prefer a warmer midrange with crisp but not overbearing treble.  The trebles were OK, but not as crisp as the Audio Technica M50x. Bass was decent with these cans. These had an awful lot of upper mids, starting around 4kHz. It was slightly harsh to listen to without EQing 4kHz down a few decibels - so listening through the iPhone wasn't ideal because there is no EQ. When I put my Klipsch Reference on ears on after these, the warmth of those headphones were welcome to my ears. Another annoying feature was that the 1/8"" jack was too thick to cleanly fit into the iPhone jack with a phone cover on - the threads for the 1/4"" adapter got in the way - making it difficult to plug this into an iPhone with a cover on it. On the plus side, they were comfortable and seemed to be built with good durability."
"I already had a pair of sony mdrv6's for a yamaha digital piano.  Those are discontinued, and I wanted a 2nd pair of headphones for an e-drum kit.  On the piano, the mdr7506 made the lower notes louder, but distorted.  I had to return them.  I later found reviews that said studios still use the mdr7506 not because they sound good or have a flat response, but because it emphasizes bad mid-frequencies that need to be taken out of the mix."
"First off, the sound quality of these is fantastic. Can’t go wrong there at all. But even though the amazing sound quality, the reason why I’m giving this 3 stars is because of the comfort. Maybe it’s just my ears but I can’t wear these headphones for more than 2 hours without having to take them off and having to massage my ears because they feel like they’re bleeding. I DJ as a hobby and like to watch sets of DJ’s constantly so I’m wearing these headphones AT LEAST 2-3 hours a day. I wish I could actually return them they make my ears hurt so much it’s actually unbearable. But c’est la vie. Again, everything else other than comfort are great so just keep that in mind."
"Pros-Light-Rarely get ear fatigue-Compared to the Bose QC35, the mrd7506’s sound more forward and clear (Sounds your infront of the sound with the mdr7506 instead of close to it with the qc35s)-Sound is very clear-The metal plug in is quality-The cord is anti yank proofCons-Slightly heavy cord-Rarely get moments when I hear loud static (goes away on its own. Lasts for 1-5 minutes every time. Is very annoying when it happens).-The ear pads make a crackly sound and are not that comfortable (buying a different ear pad is recommended)-Very difficult to put on new ear pads.-Not enough bass-The ear pieces flip and rotate the opposite way and because of the good clamp that it has, it is a bit difficult to flip it back to the way it should be.-Having it around your neck is not comfortable (even with pulling both sides as far down as possible).-You can get a better deal elsewhere. When I look at these headphones and my experience with them, $60 comes to mind, not $80."
"Sound - FantasticPutting them on and off - AnnoyingPrice - Right (for the sound quality)These are nice sounding, and light on your head.  A little to ""Warm"" for my ears though, my head loves to sweat for some reason with these on, and I'm in house that stays at 72 degrees.  The folding part however is NOT fun.  I guess if you absolutely had to have them fold for space, then Okay.  Otherwise, this ""Feature"" kinda makes me dislike them and want something else."
"I  wanted to really like these headphones for mixing. Really bad, in fact. Because I couldn’t afford much I had “upgraded” from a pair of 50$ Odio studio headphones that had gone the gauntlet with me and came out super glued together in about 5 places (but still sounded good). It’s about month 3 with truly minimal strain and no travel and guess what? The cord is causing that cut out, go quiet issue, and the pads are already starting to deteriorate in my hands.Given my finances right now, this was a no go so I contacted Amazon and explained the situation. They were nice enough to extend my warranty return window with them so I packed them off to my fulfillment center so I can purchase one of the MANY affordable studio cans available on Amazon that have detachable cables, and better pads. Seriously. The options aren’t limited anymore to whatever garbage one of a handful of companies deem to make available to the unwashed masses.They sounded ok. UntilThey started cutting out and sounding terrible unless I wiggled the cord or held it like an old school bunny antenna with one foot raised like a stork and the other touching my cats head who has to wear an aluminum crown for most optimal audiophile sound performance. I felt there was coloring on the higher end but maybe that’s my cats natural feline tone cross contaminating the sound waves.My cat asked me to write this review and get some new cans. For the queen of foil, I do submit."
"Overall, I can tell these headphones are high-quality. I had a few complaints that ended up being significant enough that I returned these, however. First of all, I was surprised to read the reviews about how comfortable these are... perhaps it is the size or shape of my head but they were incredibly uncomfortable for me. The head band sat directly on top of the crown of my head and didn't provide enough cushion to keep from having a constant awareness it was pressing firmly on a specific spot. Maybe I have a pointy head. I am a women so maybe my head is smaller than the average user's. Either way, I wanted so badly to dismiss this, but after wearing them for an extended period, I just couldn't.My other complaint was what seemed to be unbalanced levels. Treble was really hot and forward while bass seemed never to be forward enough. The brightness began to fatigue my ears after an hour or so. For certain kinds of editing/monitoring maybe this is what you want, but if you also want to rotate these as casual listening headphones too, I would steer elsewhere."
"I was looking for a moderately priced set of earphones to replace my previous Sony earphones, which I was thrilled with, btw.  Based on the glowing reviews, especially one lengthy detailed review, I went with these.  I received them on time, but that was the only highlight with this experience.  The carrying case is an absurdly cheap vinyl/leatherette pouch that's barely big enough and looks like crap, so I tossed it in a drawer right away.  The compact/folding design and overall look isn't bad, but it certainly isn't a tenth as impressive as my friend's Beats headphones (admittedly, the Beats are much more expensive).  The big bold print on the top of the crosspiece is tacky looking.  I immediately used them on two cross-country trips (4 long flights in all), and the experience was very disappointing.  The comfort and feel is okay, but nothing special.  My biggest complaint is that the sound is ""shallow"" with these headphones.  I have to crank the volume all the way to 10 on my iPad in order to hear music or movies at a reasonable level.  My previous Sony headphones (which were cheaper) had excellent bass, midrange, and treble, and the overall volume was outstanding, not shallow at all.  They work, so I can't return them, but I have to share my experience that this pair of headphones is shallow and disappointing."
"If you're looking for headphones for movies and music then these are not for you. I had them for a week and wasn't really impressed with the sound. The treble is sharp and the bass is weak. Listening to music was really harsh experience that made my ears ring something fierce. After seeing all the gaga reviews about these I thought maybe I just didn't possess the ability to appreciate good headphones. I was going to keep them to see if they grew on me but unfortunately the right side started buzzing at certain frequencies so I chose to return them. I looked around for a pair of headphones that would be more suitable for music and movies and ended up buying a pair of Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO's and I was blown away! They're very pleasant sounding, the bass is nice and not over bearing, and they're VERY comfortable. If you're willing to spend about $50 more or so (I got mine new for $130, hold out for a deal!) then I really recommend the DT 770's as an alternative choice to these Sony's. If that's a little out of your price range I have friends who swear by the Grado SR80i, which go for about $99. Good luck!"
"Not as well made as my 10 year old version of the headsets. They are more flimsy, less substantial in their build. The muffs are less comfortable and allow sound to be heard by others. Sound quality is a bit thin, definitely not much bass, so I would definitely not recommend for music. But for video production they are fine. I'm hoping that they will get better as they are used. If that happens I'll update my review"
"I'm not an audiophile but I think they sound great, with better bass and generally clearer sound compared to my Akai ATH-M30x, and they are comfortable to wear for hours at a time. But their fatal flaw is that the thin vinyl (?) ear pad covering started to crack and fall apart after a couple years of use, and after four years it has completely disintegrated so that I'm finding little bits of it on the floor or stuck to my feet. And now the foam looks like it's starting to come apart too, so it won't be long before these headphones are unusable. I'll keep using them until I can't, because they do sounds good, but it's pretty disappointing that a product that costs almost a hundred bucks falls apart after just a few years of light use. I don't like the coiled cable very much, it gets tangled or caught on things more often than a straight cable."
"Title. The covering is peeling off piece by piece and sticks to my neck, also leaving stuff on my floor. They serve their purpose but after a few years you can really use them"
"Those were always a go to Sony model for any basic operations, whether you need to DJ on the go, setup a stage, or connect them to a Radio Transceiver in the field. This, however, is a disappointment. They still work and probably will, but the ear muffs deteriorated within the first year.Overall my suggestion look at XXX series, like 600-700 or even 900 series."
"Despite the great sound quality especially for this price point, the headphone itself is juncomfortable to wear if you have gotten used to true over ear headphones.. Although it advertises itself as over ear headphones this feels much more like on ear headphones and thats saying a lot considering I have smaller ears. The audio pad inside the headphones are pressed straight up against my ears all the time leading to a very uncomfortable listening experience for me after I've gotten used to true over ear headphones.If you don't mind the fact it's more on ear though, these headphones have great sound quality for the price (bass is a little weaker than the headphones I was using prior, but my old one was much more expensive. This is still very good).Tl;dr Headphone itself is on-ear which can be uncomfortable. But if you don't mind on-ear headphones the audio quality is very good for the price."
"I needed to replace my AKG K240s that inexplicably died on me, and I wanted to stay in the same price range, these came with a professional pedigree of their own and a ton of great reviews. I am very pleased I bought these. The design is superb in that they collapse when not in use, the carry pouch is cool, the sound is most important to me though, and I can't add anything in that respect that so many haven't already offered, and probably in much better detail than I could anyway. Suffice to say that I wish I had bought these sooner. Out of all the headphones I own, these are easily the best for critical listening and mixing when not using monitors.***Update***It is now Jan.2, 2016 and just like my AKGs before them, my Sony's have bit the dust. Sound inexplicably dropped out on the left side. I'm not sure if this is planned obsolescence or just shoddy workmanship, but it's as if we cannot count on any product standing the test of time anymore. It will probably cost more than I paid for them to have them repaired. I really need to learn to repair the connections myself to avoid this in the future."
"I'm trying to remember if they've always sounded this low quality, but these headphones sound tinny, low on bass, and loud volume is easily distorted.Also, the design is so crappy. The headphones flail wildly around and bang into its own parts until you can position them the right way to put on your head. They're decently comfortable, but they still make my ears hot and sweaty.I've had my Sennheisers that I bought for $50 five years ago that still work and sound amazing. I probably won't buy Sony headphones ever again."
"Love these phones, for audio quality they are absolute bangers.  You can hear the full range of audio.  I'm not an audiophile or picky, but these are of noticable quality in terms of sound.Physically, they're clearly very fragile.  Treat them as fragile, quality equipment, carefully.  They are not made to handle abuse.  If you want something that takes some abuse, these are not the headphones for you."
"These are comfortable to wear, and of good quality construction.  The sound is great! I do have a complaint, however, and that is the hinge where the ear pieces meet the headband that is designed so you can fold the set up smaller.1) I don't need to fold my headset up that small.2) It frequently folds itself up when I pick the set up and I have to fiddle around to get the ear pieces straightened back out. The earpieces often get turned backwards as they fold up.3) AND worst of all, when trying to unfold the earpieces, I keep getting the soft part of my finger pinched in the hinge at that spot, and it really pinches HARD! And when you get your finger in there, it's kind of hard to figure out which way to move the earpiece around to get yourself out of the pinch.  I would prefer to buy a set like this WITHOUT that hinge above the ear pieces.  I have a bruise on my finger right now from the most recent pinch.  OUCH!"
Otherwise very good. They sell replacement ear pad covers on Amazon. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MUHRW62  But I hear they're difficult to install. I use mine without the covers and with the exposed foam rubber and I don't mind. Hard to find such a high rated headphone at this price. I hear these are also very good https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ENMK1DW
"OMG I had to send these back.  Even after 100+ hours break-in the high frequencies were, to me, unbearably shrill, screechy and harsh.  And the midrange was hollow sounding and thin. Not want you want when recording large choruses and orchestras.  I can’t believe this has been a recording industry standard for over three decades.  No wonder so many commercial recordings sound bad!  The bass was pretty awesome though…. I replaced them with the new Rode NTH-100 headphones and, for not much more money, a whole lot better in every way.  Especially the sound, comfort, and build quality."
"I bought these for recording music and practicing on my bass (via plugging them into my amp).  All the reviews I read were said they were great and even a friend at a music store said they were the best on the market.Got them today and the first test was listening to some music on my stereo.  They sounded very good and may have been worth the price right there.  Recording was very good with them, all the instruments came out sounding clear.  The deal breaker was when I plugged them into my amp; they produced a horrible feedback that was simply too much to get past.  When I plugged in my old headphone kit (a 5$ pair of Panasonics with a 2$ jack adapter) I noticed that there was NO FEED BACK AT ALL.  Sure the tones did not come out as rich as on the Sony's but that didn't matter when the rich tone was covered up by a great deal of feedback and buzzing.At that point, I immediately decided to send the back for a refund.  They are great headphones but, for 99$, I don't want my 5$ headphones beating them in any areas.  Also, the design seemed a little cheap on them; the wires that connect the ear pieces together are left very much exposed and are just begging to be pulled out.  Again, I have a 30$ pair of Koss that sound like crap but the design is much more stable then these."
Sound quality same as airplane free headset. Nothing fancy as I expected. Returned the product and have not Recieved my refund 3 weeks later. Don’t try to buy this as you will get stuck with subpar quality. Add a little in budget and get better known brands.
"The headphones were ear pads are uneven.  This means when you place the headphones on our head, the right ear pad is shorter than the left ear pad.  This defect makes you wonder what kind of Quality Assurance and Quality Control Sony and/or the Seller use before selling and shipping the ""cans"".I use the ""cans"" to mix and master music and somethings they are used to record vocals.  I cannot use them because they are uneven on my head.  Should you review the picture that is posted on this website, pease pay strict attention to the earpads,  You will see in the picture, they are even when pushed together.  I have a $400 pair of headphones (Sennheiser-HD-650) and the earpads are even...  I own Beyerdynamic DT 880 PRO headphones and the earpads are even... I previously owned a set of Beyerdynamic DT 1990 Pro Open-Back Studio Reference Headphones.  Should you understand my point, which is I have a superior definition of what a decent set of ""cans"" should physically look like and the Sony MDR-7506 are not it.  I would like an exchange for a corrected pair and/or a full refund."
"Going from Sennheiser 380 Pros to these, they feel like a step down.  They are listed as ""over the ear"" headphones but they barely fit over my ears and I have a small head.  Because of this, these pinched my ears more compared to my 380 Pros which are nearly twice as roomy and never touch my ears.  So I would not recommend them for long listening times. I  wish I would have seen these in person before I bought them because they are a lot smaller than I expected.Sound quality wise then are a step down from my 380 Pros which feel more roomy.  But for nearly half the price I paid for the 380 Pros its not a bad deal.  The reason I got these is because after nearly 3 years of use my 380s started to lose fidelity and the ear pads became shredded.  The bass is definitely more pronounced compared to the latter but everything else just seems more flat.  I will keep them though just to have a backup pair but will probably buy Sennheisers again the next time they are on sale."
"SONY is a long trusted brand in home and professional audio.I have been hard on headphones. As a music maker I needed good fidelity on a tight budget. Other brands, otherwise well known names in studio recording, proved to be flimsy with frequent handling, mostly due to having cheap plastic headbands that would break right at the joint. Unfixable. So I was specifically looking for a metal headband. At the same time, they are lighter and more comfortable. A very good value if you are not looking for ""high end audiophile"" quality."
"I wanted to love these headphones. I had been using an old pair of cheap AKG's that I got as a free bonus with a purchase a decade ago and wanted to upgrade to a better pair of headphones for recording vocals. I got these based on the reviews. I absolutely love their construction and how they are put together. Nice strong feeling hinges, comfortable and they fold up really nicely. I just didn't like the frequency curve on them. The mids and mid-highs seemed too pronounced for me. I used a couple of different sources to make sure that wasn't the issue. Walked away and came back later to try again to make sure I wasn't just hearing things weird. Nope, just didn't like their sound. Please remember that sound is totally subjective and they just didn't suit me. You may feel otherwise. If I can find a pair of headphone built like these but with a sound curve that suits me better that would be perfect!"
"These are reasonably comfortable and sound pretty good for the price. However, after a very minimal amount of use, maybe six months daily, where the thin wires go into the speaker casings they are pulling out and exposing bare copper wire. What, Sony couldn't attach the wires to the inside of the speaker casings? I improvised with packaging tape to keep them from pulling out completely but come on... I don't expect these to last very long.Update Early 2020: These are still working. My tape fix is holding. But I've discovered another design flaw. The same wires get trapped between the casings and the rotating brackets that support them. So a great way to get the wires pinched and damaged. Every time you want to put on the headphones you have to pull the wires out of the way to keep them from getting pinched."
"I had a pair of Sony MDR V6 headphones from years ago. Great headphones. The ear pads wore out so I ordered a set of new official Sony replacement pads. And would you believe it, they were too small.So a few months go by and I decided I'd just get a new pair, the new pair being the Sony MDR 7506. Great. They arrived...opened up the package, there they are like an old friend, and there's the bag! Cool. I fought and fought to stuff the folded up headphones into the bag. They ****barely**** fit. You could easily destroy your headphones trying to wedge them into this bag. So...Just like the official Sony replacement ear pads, the official Sony headphones bag is ... too small. What is it with Sony? What, focused too much on the camera product lines? C'mon."
"I was disappointed with this product. I used to love Sony earphones but never owned a set of headphones and got very excited and purchased this item.I also own a set of Bose AE2 and love it, but the Sony MDR7506 appeared to me beefier and would be more secure around my big head when I workout. Unfortunately, I was wrong. First, the cable is extremely robust. This is great, if you're video/audio editing as it stretches to an impressive distance. The cable really cannot be tucked into your shirt due to its size and really get in the way as they hang down to the floor that loops back up into your shorts (I'm 5 7).I compared the sound quality against my Bose AE2 through my Yamaha VX375 and the Sony definitely has better bass. However, the Bose is so much lighter and more comfortable to wear (3 years old). The Sony was half the price of the Bose, and I understand that they are marketed to very distinct clients, but I can't help but be displeased given my excitement."
"DISAPPOINTED - i tried these against other headphones, such as the  Audio-Technica ATH-M50x, V-MODA Crossfade M-100, and the Sennheiser HD 380 Pro, all of which are very nice headphones.  To be fair, the sound is very nice, and balanced throughout the bass, mid range, and the high notes.  At the risk of using a lay-person's terminology, the sound seemed to have a hollowness to it, not as full as the ATH-50.  It was more dynamically correct than the V-Moda, and about on par with the Sennheiser HD 380.To add perspective, I love trio music, such as Bill Evans, and it was a very good test of the headphones, challenging that the bass not be overly forward, and with sparkling highs that let the piano show through.Perhaps if I had not been hearing the great sound of nearly all of these headphones, it would have been more satisfying.  It does have a broad frequency response, not too much bass, nothing overly forward, but that being said, it seemed like nothing really came forward and sounded outstanding.I loved the V-Modas, the size, the technology, but the bass was too over powering for the piano."
"I had no issues with the sound quality.  However, after about 5 years the fabric on the ear cushions began to flake off and the inner foam eventually crumbled as well.  They were in the trash bin after that."
"These sound great, but:1. The cups peel over time, so often that aftermarket cups are sold to replace them2. The jack's outer sleeve becomes loose, so that the inner shaft is partially covered and doesn't always make adequate contact3. I've recently noticed mine to have some staticky artifacts when using synthesizers4. Cord is best suited for standing and playing a guitar with the unit plugged into an amp on a table or the floor: it's long and heavy, which makes it really annoying to use for personal devices.5. 1/4"" adapter stopped working after a few yearsWon't buy again. You'd think this old design would be mastered by now, but either they have been cutting corners or i just got a defective unit. I like Sony products but this one is just not worth the money."
my headphones arrived today and i must say i have a weird feeling with these....it has very dead high frequencies...good bass and midrange....but in the high frequencies it falls short and it's not something i expected from sony ...Someone else happens?
"Pros- Decent sound- Easily compacted. Great for traveling on the airplane, it compacts upwards, and comes with a little bag to store it in.- Long cord. I don't like wireless and the cord extends out for long distances which is useful.- Adjustable. Can be adjusted.Cons- Uncomfortable. I literally had to make these max size to take pressure off of my head, and I have a small head.- Sound doesn't reflect the price. There are much better headphones in the 100$ max price range compared to these guys.- Gets warm on ears pretty quickly.Personally, I wanted to return them, but I was traveling for longer than a month and surpassed the time to return them. I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
"The Soundcore by Anker Space Q45 Adaptive Active Noise Cancelling Headphones have a lot going for them, but unfortunately, they weren’t the perfect fit for me.What I Liked: • Noise Cancelling: The ANC is excellent—it does an impressive job of blocking out background noise, whether it’s a busy office or a noisy commute. • Sound Quality: The sound is decent, with good clarity and balance. It’s not the best I’ve heard, but for the price, it’s solid.What Didn’t Work: • Fit: This was the dealbreaker for me. The headphones didn’t sit comfortably for long periods, which made extended use difficult. Everyone’s fit preferences vary, so this might not be an issue for others, but it was for me.Final Thoughts:If comfort isn’t a concern for you, these headphones are a great choice, especially for their noise-cancelling capabilities. They’re high-quality and deliver good value for the price, but I’d recommend trying them on first to ensure the fit works for you.  *Keep in mind, I shave my head daily."
"I really want to give this headset a 5 star, but I can't.The noise cancelling changed my daily life in a great way, letting me escape the noise of some pretty bad neighbors and apartment living. The battery life is terrific, I don't feel panicked half way through my day that I will be exposed to chaos soon with thr need for charging.They are comfortable and lightweight, which I am really sensitive to. However, the band is pretty large in width and length. It's pretty constantly slipping off my head or the ear cups are being held up by my ears. Because they're light, it isn't painful but it's so annoying and they don't seem to have a version with a tighter or smaller band. They're just way too big. My neice who I also bought a pair for has a much larger skull and fits her perfectly.Love these so much, but non-large heads will struggle."
"When looking for headphones on the internet (especially wireless) you are bound to hear about how great these are. these ""professional"" reviewers on sites such as YouTube and even RTINGS boast about how great these are, even comparing them to headphones triple the price, even here on the amazon reviews all you read is positive reviews. From the looks of it these headphones are the best headphones, but are they? Today that is what we are going to find out!After reading all of the great things about these headphones I wanted to purchase a pair for traveling and listening to music when I'm not at my desk. My daily driver headphones are the Audio Technica M40x they are a great pair of headphones with fantastic sound quality but I thought the Q45s would be great for plane flights and things of that sort since the ATH M40x have a long cable(1 Meter long) which makes them difficult and cumbersome to use on-the-go. So I placed an order for the glorious Q45s and eagerly awaited them to grace my household with their (alleged) glory.A little less than a week after I ordered them, they finally arrived. I excitedly open them, knowing that I was about to experience their glorious ""High-Res Audio WIRELESS"" and ""INCREDIBLE SOUND LOVED BY 20 MILLION+ PEOPLE"". I eagerly bestow them upon my head, connect them to my Android device, download the companion app(which is totally not spy-ware), load my favorite band, ""REDUCE NOISE BY 98%"", and activate the music!The Innovative Double-Layer Diaphragm Drivers have been activated! I then realised my music sounded like it was being played out of a 20$ speaker, and I was being submerged under a Motel 6 pool...okay, this is not ""Hi-Res Audio WIRELESS"", No need to fret! maybe the volume just needs to be increased. I then realize that the volume is already set at maximum. This is just how these sound. NO! This is not what the reviewers promised! They claimed the audio quality is best in class, This is WORST IN CLASS AUDIO!My ATH-M40x which are significantly lower cost then these ""Premium"" pair of headphones have at least triple the volume(loudness) and the sound quality is much better. Why do all the reviewers love the Q45s? The sound quality is TERRIBLE. Though I must concede that the Q45s are very comfortable and the ANC is great! When I activate ""NOISE CANCELLING REDUCE NOISE BY 98%"" the noise does really get reduced by at least 98%, maybe a little more. with the ""NOISE CANCELLING REDUCE NOISE BY 98%"" active I can't hear the rumble of my very loud A/C. I am impressed by everything BUT the sound quality. Even the build quality is decent!Though unfortunately, they fail at their primary function as headphones, that is to produce quality sound. I was not exaggerating earlier when describing the sound. the sound is very muddy but somehow also very echo-y sounding. The Q45s also fail at producing sound at a reasonable volume. The volume of the Q45s is less than 20% of my ATH M40x. To be fair to Anker, I do use an amplifier when operating my M40x, But on the contrary the amplifier I use is not powerful at all. Maybe very low volumes is normal with wireless headphones(?) this is my first pair of wireless headphones so I am not entirely sure. But that's besides the point.It is due time I provide a conclusion to this mess... I do not recommend the Q45s. They, as stated earlier fail at their primary function of producing quality sound, however Anker has done a good job on all other aspects of this headphone. Comfortable ear-pads, decent build quality, Fantastic ANC implementation, creative design, though they do look strange when worn but I appreciate the creativity of the unusual design. These are quite a strange headphone, its like Anker spent their effort on everything but the sound quality. I do wonder why they decided to go down this route when designing them? I think Anker should just stick to making cables, they make quality cables!As for me I will attempt to return them to hopefully get my money back. I hope my review provided you with an alternative perspective on these consumer headphones. I wish you luck on your search for headphones! Before you go, I suggest considering purchasing the ATH-M40x or any other pair of wired headphones instead of these. Just beware that you may need to get an amplifier to get the full sound out of them(Don't worry, There is a lot of amplifiers to choose from here on amazon)."
"I live in NYC and work in a noisy environment so I like to block out as much as I can. I have JBL in ear noise cancelling that do exactly what I need but the magnetic charging doesn’t always connect to the one ear so I’m left only using one which defeats the purpose, hence why I was looking to find a new solution. I prefer an over ear for the comfort and the battery life is typically better. I did a lot of research trying to find a good NC headphone at a good price and this one kept coming up and reviews seems pretty consistent. I don’t think I have a small head but these only fit in the smallest adjustment so I think therein lies my issue. Because they don’t quite fit my head the headphones don’t fit snug on my ears I now that the sound is escaping from the back. When I use the app to adjust the NC from 1 to 5 it’s a minimal difference. I could still very much hear people talking and playing instruments in the distance and this was with music playing at 50% volume! I tried trouble shooting but don’t think these are for me. Maybe I got a weird pair or my girl head is too small. Otherwise they come with a good charge and seem to hold the battery life well and connecting to Bluetooth is very easy to connect. The app is nice and easy to use and I enjoyed the app quiz to find the EQ sound you like best.Returning and on the hunt for something else!"
I honestly loved them but I have a small narrow head and the speakers didn’t adjust small enough. The lower part of the headphones were pushing right below my ears into my soft area near my lymph nodes. Again loved them just wish they adjusted smaller for better comfort. :(
"Update: Returned this for and bought a JBL Live 770NC, better sounds and bass, better design fit.First time buying Anker headphone, it sounds good but lack good bass, EQ bass sucks. Built quality is ok, but ears cushions a little big. Ok headphone, but I prefer my Sony extra bass headphone for music, while this one for PC usage."
"Sound was pretty good. Headset was really uncomfortable for me. I have a smallish-medium sized head. I didn't think I'd be bothered by the quality of the materials but it felt like a plastic toy to me, for $130 I was expecting something nicer. I actually prefer the comfort, quality, and fit of an off-brand $45 pair I have. These felt heavy, too loose, and awkward on my head. I don't notice my other pair wearing them multiple hours but was ready to take these off immediately. The foam on the ears is ok but the foam on the top is light with no resistance so it just compresses and the hard plastic is resting against your head and pulled down by the weight of the ear peices. I also don't like the round oversized shape, it is too much extra material for no reason. The noise cancelling worked well for my AC unit but not as good for voices nearby. Call quality was ok just a bit quiet I was told by the person on the other end despite their phone volume being turned up."
Has held up very well the last few years and does a decent job of noise cancelling during those long flights. Also quite comfortable over the ears except maybe this set is a little heavy after a while. 1 major complaint though is that design was very stingy in regards to the LED lights. After powering on or powering off the LED light turns off so it's very hard to tell if the unit is on or not. Just keep the LED ON if the power is ON so we don't have to fumble around with the tiny little buttons that are not clearly marked for which button does what...
"Even an average ANC helps a lot when listing to others during a phone call, or a conference, or watching a video while in a noisy environment.I compared Anker Space Q45 with Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II and Sony WH-1000XM5 headset.I used the steady noise of a running faucet for reference.My perception is that at a 50 dB noise level,  Bose cuts out 98% of the noise,  Q45 cuts out 70%,  Sony XM5 95%.  This type of noise is very low, like an AC vent, but can be a distraction when one has to focus briefly. I highly recommend using an ANC on long flights since it reduces fatigue.Fun fact:  I tried wearing Sony headset on top of the Bose earbuds.  It is uncomfortable but it can silence 60 dB.  Flushing of a toilet, 75 dB, sounds like a gentle murmur ;-)Things to consider:Q45 is 2-3 times cheaper than Sony XM5.  Q45 can't remove a steady low volume noise of AC vent.  Q45 ANC is marginally better than a Jabber's headset.I would caution to consider the quality of the microphone in a noisy environment.  Most reviews demonstrate that Sony XM5 is the best.  I found that the microphone in the Bose earbuds perform poorly in a very noisy environment.  I didn't test Q45 microphone.Bose usability/connectivity is beyond horrible, but when it works, it has the best noise cancellation.It is possible to sleep with the earbuds.Wearing any earbuds for many hours every day can cause ear skin irritation.Wearing any headset for more than 1 hour causes ears to get too hot."
So I bought these in Oct 23 and now nearly a year later (writing this Sept 24) while the audio is still solid (hence the three stars) I've run into some very irritating issues for one the power button can be finicky causing me to need to hold it for an extended time to get it to turn on rather than a quick button press like you'd expect. Now my main issue is the plastic area where you adjust the fit both sides have significant cracks now (one side cracked a few months back with the second being more recent) with one side unable to fully retract making the fit very awkward. The fact that they have broken this much in less than a year is super disappointing I've used soundcore products for years but with these breaking so quick it might be time to switch brands.
"Background:  I'm looking for a replacement for Bluedio Victory headphones which I've had for years, but have experienced some issues with.  I also have Soundcore Liberty Pro 3, Spirit X2's, and on my PC a FiiO K3 DAC with FiiO FH5 and Sennheiser HD599s.My biggest complaints with headphones that I've had is either build quality and comfort (headbands not having padding, clamping force is too strong).  The Q45's have neither of those problems.  Yes, they have a lot of plastic, but they don't feel cheap.  Yes, the headband padding is maybe less than others, but it still feels cushy enough.  The clamping force is strong and firm, like on ATH's M50X, but that makes them uncomfortable over long periods for me.  I find the Sennhesier HD599's to be hands down more comfortable, but the Q45 is still solidly ""good.""The ANC on the Q45 is also pretty good, I'd put in on par with the Liberty 3 Pros I have.  They seal against your head pretty well and that also contributes to the isolation.Unfortunately, the sound quality I can only describe as mediocre.  I'd put them on par with my Soundcore Spirit X2's, they just sound flat and not in a good way.  Bass is poor, which I found surprising.  I'm not a fan of too much bass, but for me even the Q45s are very weak in this area.For some reason, snare drums sound very sharp and a bit unpleasant to my ears.  I'd say this is accurate to real life and the sound is very clear, but it's also not an issue I've had with any other headphones.  Additonally, the sound stage sounds distant.  Plugging them in by cable to a FiiO K3 DAC does little to resolve the sound issues.To be fair, the sound quality is not horrible, it's just very average.  I can tolerate that on my Soundcore Spirit X2's because I mostly use them outside walking, listening to podcasts.  When I put on headphones I am usually planning on listening to music, and want a very full sound.  The Q45's don't deliver that, and I'll probably stick with my Bluedio Victory's until something better comes along.A couple other pros I want to point out on the Q45:  uses a standard 3.5mm cable on both ends, which is great in case the battery dies and you ever lose your cable.  Controls are easy to find and use.  They're pretty lightweight.  The band is covered well and prevents hairs from getting snagged easily.  If it wasn't for the ""meh"" sound quality, these would be absolutely outstanding headphones."
"Let's start with sound: The drivers/speakers are just not the quality they should be for this price range. They sound OK overall but the high-end response is awful and tinny. Whenever you hear cymbals or anything like that, it will sound like nails on a chalkboard. The only way to counteract this is to go into the EQ and completely cut the treble. The active noise canceling is pretty good but the transparency mode is a joke, you can't clearly hear yourself speak in transparency mode, and anything quieter than a running sink won't be heard.The comfort and design is pretty good overall, with a few caveats: if you have Active Noise Canceling on and move your head around, you will hear a noticeable ""whoosh"" sound. These are very comfortable but clearly meant to be used when sitting still or walking gently.My final complaint has to be the control buttons, which are terrible. For starters, I don't see the benefit of putting half the buttons on one ear and half on the other. It makes one-handed operation of all the functions impossible. Say I'm out in public and holding shopping bags, why would I need to switch hands for volume control, then switch hands again to adjust noise canceling? The buttons are so tiny relative to the ear cups, and most other brands have all the controls on one side, or mirrored controls on both sides.Also, the control to skip or reverse tracks is to press and hold on the VOLUME buttons. Probably the most questionable design aspect of these headphones. I've never personally experienced a device that used volume buttons to track songs... what is the benefit of going against the grain on this? 99% of devices I'm familiar with use double-tap on Play to advance to the next song and triple-tap to back up. It's simple and intuitive and FAST, whereas taking 2-3 seconds to hold on the volume buttons takes a lot more time and just slows down finding the right song. It also means you can't just press and hold to adjust volume up and down, you have to repeatedly tap tap tap. I hope and pray this gets patched out with software updates.Overall these are a decent set of headphones but for $20-40 more you can get something with better frequency response and more intuitive controls. For $100 these would be great but it's hard to justify spending $150 on these when Sony WH-CH720N are the same exact price."
"I bought these headphones mid-October and less than 2 months later, they were broken. I have issues with becoming overwhelmed by loud noises, and I wanted a long battery life. The battery life and noise cancellation features are great. I had purchased other models of Soundcore headphones, and knew that the sound quality and noise cancellation were excellent. I decided I wanted to upgrade to a longer battery.I am thankful I purchased these at the $99.99 USD, instead of the $149.99 USD, during Prime Day. In a short time frame, I bought 2 different pairs of headphones, these & the Soundcore Space One headphones. Even though these are more expensive, the Space Ones have held up better. Within 7 weeks of purchasing these headphones, they were broken. I’m not sure how they broke, but the sliding mechanism, to adjust the size, somehow cracked or broke. When I tried to contact Soundcore, to get a replacement under their warranty, they didn’t respond. I am on a fixed income, because of medical issues that leave me unable to work, and $100 is a lot of money from my budget. However, I will spend more money, if the product will help me with an issue, and I though these would help with longer battery life, and better noise cancellation, to prevent noise related issues, from my auditory processing issues. I want to warn others about these issues, so that no one else spends extra for an easily breakable product, which the manufacturer advertises a warranty, but doesn’t honor or even answer warranty claims. I don’t want to send a broken item back, because I don’t think it’s a Amazon’s responsibility to deal with a broken product. I am stuck, and it seems that only way I can do anything is to leave a bad review. In a perfect world, there would be a different solution, that would leave me, as the customer, feeling seen, heard, and the warranty honored. However, at this point I don’t think Soundcore is going to do that. I have purchased several other Anker items, including a few other headphones through the years, and other products. This is the first issue I’ve had, where I wasn’t wowed. Historically, if there was a problem, Anker’s customer service had been very helpful, and that’s why I have kept supporting Anker. After this incident, my trust for Anker has been shaken, and that’s making me question more of their quality. I would like to exchange the broken item with a replacement, have my faith in Anker & Soundcore renewed, and continue loving an affordable company, that usually had great products. I am willing to change this review, if my issues are properly resolved."
"To be completely transparent I’m no audiophile,  that being said I felt bamboozled by these headphones.  Before I purchased I researched many different headphones and came across these, I needed something for work with transparency mode.  The transparency mode does work but only if you have the volume of music very low, I was hoping it would allow me to listen to music at a higher volume and have peoples voices still come through.  It does not do that, doesn’t even come close.The ANC mode does work well,  it’s definitely not perfect but it will knock out car noises and planes flying overhead.  But it would allow for quieter noises to come through,  a bit odd. I’d still say this is a good feature for the price.The biggest bummer for me is the actual audio, it’s really bad.  Bass is not punchy at all,  even when messing with the EQ,  doesn’t seem to change much at all.  They sounded flat right out of the box and even with some tweaking they still just don’t have it.  The volume doesn’t even seem to go that high compared to older headphones I’ve owned.  Maybe I got a dud but they are very lackluster when it comes to the audio. Overall I’d give them a 5/10.Update: I decided to keep these because they are comfortable but now I am having an issue where the left can goes in and out at times.  I do think I may have got a bad set because most reviews are positive.Another update: Amazon sent me a new pair and they are working better than my first pair.  Bass still lacks but phone calls and work meetings work great with these.  Noise cancellation works very well, especially at this price point. Really the only downfall for me personally is the transparency mode,  just wish it had automatic volume control instead of having to listen at very low volumes for voices to come through.  Overall headphones 7/10, customer support 10/10."
"OK. Let me set the scene here.I have 5 pairs of Beats Studio 2.0 Wireless headphones and 2 pairs of Beats Studio 3.0 Wireless headphones.Why so many you ask? Well, I know that headphones have a finite life cycle and I know that Beats headphones might not last. However, all 7 are working fine. I use them all for slightly different purposes. They are different in colours and I use each one sparingly. This is why the oldest set are just as good new even though they are 7 years old now.I don't like earbuds. But I bought a pair of Soundcore P20i earbuds for a specific use for when I don't want the bulky Beats on me. I was absolutely blown away by the sound quality of these earbuds. They only cost me $32 (inclduing shipping to England) and they sounded nearly as good as my Beats headphones. Considering that each of my Beats cost up to ten times the price of the P20i's I find this outstanding. The P20i's go loud, have clear bass, mids and trebles and plenty of separation so that I can hear each instrument.Which brings me to the Q45's here. I bought the Q45's based on the great reviews and the great experience I had with the P20i's. I wanted them to use them on the plane journey to New York in September for the noise cancelling functionality.What a disappointment. The Q45's sound like I am listening to the headphones with a piece of carpet stuck in each ear. The bass is muddy and gets distorted when the Bass Up setting is used on the signature setting. The treble struggles and is not crisp. The mids get lost in the rest of the noise. I have spent a few hours playing with the settings on the app and my phone and I have got the Q45's to sound better but not as good as I expected. I tried LDAC on and off, various EQ settings in the app, various ANC settings, boost settings on my Samsung S23+ and I also turned off all settings to default to see whether that would make a difference. It is just poor.I connected the headphones directly to my Sony NW A45 mp3 player with the 3.5 mm cable supplied and that is how I got the best sound out of the Q45's. Used the eq settings on this player and turned it up louder than I could with either of my phones. So I would say that the best use case for these headphones is via a 3.5 mm cable connection to a decent MP3 player.So it seems that there is a decent pair of headphones in there somewhere which is thwarted by not so good electronics. Bluetooth, ANC, EQ settings all seem to contribute to strangling the performance of these physical headphones. Plug them directly into a MP3 player and they improve ten fold.2 stars for styling, ANC and improvement when connected via a 3.5mm cable. Sound quality is a miss via Bluetooth.I'll be taking 2 pairs of Beats and the P20i's to the states. Q45's are going to be sold at auction..."
"Bought these specifically for noise cancellation because i have adhd and i need quiet to focus on my school work…I’ve tried the Sony headphones, and they work a lotttt better. Even when u adjust the noise cancellation to a 5, it’s still awful. The only way these work for me is if i play red noise (like white noise but less sharp) while they’re on. Then i get the noise cancelling I’m looking for. May return these and get the Sony headphones instead."
"I really liked this headphones since they packed great specs like decent sound, great battery life, great Bluetooth connection and everything at a great price compared to the competition. I was very happy with my purchase. Fast forward 18 months and 20 days later and the plastic headband of my headphones are falling apart (see pictures) as it happened to many other people that bought Q45s. I contacted the Anker Soundcore helpdesk to discover that they wouldn't replace them under warranty since the 18 moths warranty expired 20 days before I contacted them. They offered me 25% discount for my next Soundcore purchase but I declined it since I won't  buy any of their products in the future.Do yourself a favor and invest a little more money in headphones from Sony or another brands that have better build quality products that will last a lot longer.UPDATE 11/22/2024: Added another star since the Anker Soundcore costumer service is very responsive. After a few emails back and forth they decided to send me a refurbished replacement for my headphones. I will provide a new update as I get my replacement headphones."
"$150 headphones should not feel as flimsy and cheap as these do. They're ever so slightly too large for me, but that wouldn't be a problem if the headband cushioning had any actual support to it. The cushioning is non-existent so these slide down and rest on top of my ears.The noise canceling seems fine, so if that's all you care about then I guess these would work for you. But honestly these headphones feel like the ear cups are going to snap off if I move the wrong way. Performance-wise maybe these are fine and the value for money is worth it, but they feel flimsy enough that I can't justify keeping them.I'm a big Anker fan but I'm starting to feel like their headphones are poorly thought out and only exist to preserve some market presence. This is the second pair I've bought - the Q45s were meant to replace a different Soundcore pair that died on me. I'm incredibly disappointed. Six years ago I bought headphones for a quarter of the price with comparable build quality, so what on earth is Anker doing?"
"I bought these headphones since I needed knew one, but these headphones seriously let me down.First a list of Cons:--They keep turning off every 60 min even when I am watching something or in a call with someone. I have to every time I turn them on go into the app and disable it.--They don't really create a full seal around the ears.--I can barely tell if the noise cancelation even works at this point. I can hear the little noise it makes but the difference between on and off ear is not that drastic.--The sound quality is not that good. It can be loud but that doesn't mean it has good audio. It feels like it suppresses all the audio down whether in call or not. Then in call it just makes it worse. I like Bluetooth headphone but it does get annoying that they have 2 mode that activate depending on weather you in call or not. I will say when not in a call (or something that activates your mic) the sound is good but I really hate the call feature especially since I tend to play games while either in discord or live on twitch so most time its in that call mode and its just depressing.--The play/pause and fast forward/rewind buttons don't really work. The play/pause button sometimes just doesn't work, I don't know what causes it to not work just that it either works or don't. I have yet to get the fast forward/rewind buttons work.List of pros:--The buttons feel nice at least and its not a side panel. The side panel headphone get annoying be you cant really lay with them but these make it easy to lay down in bed or in a chair no problems.--The price is not $300+ I mean what else is there to say.--The material used is very sturdy and supportive. It not made of that cheap plastic or other material and feel very sturdy like it will last.--It can connect to 2 device, though it will be cool if I could have two audios playing through them at once but they just switch between the devices when one has audio and 1 does not.--Mics does a good job with capturing audio."
"I want to start by saying that these are a great pair of headphones! The sound quality and anc/transparency mode work great. Multipoint connection works. They are default tuned nicely and the app has an equalizer for more specific needs. The battery life is superb!HOWEVER, they are absolutely huge and clunky. Anyone with an average to small sized head would not be able to wear these. I found them sliding if I looked down or up. This might be due to their weight and light head clamp. The ear cups are massive and don't fully rest on my head. This reduced the effectiveness of the noise cancellation because there was a gap. These headphones also stick out pretty far from the head. I've heard other reviewers refer to it as the ear cups having their own ear cups. I have placed them here next to the latest Bose Quietcomfort for size comparison.As much as I was hoping these would be a nice dupe for the Bose or Sony headphones, the size of these are too big and I ended up keeping the Bose"
"I've had the Soundcore Q35's for about a year now, and I remember that WOW! factor when I first put them on and firing up Amazon Unlimited music with the upgraded HD Amazon music service. When you combine Amazon's HD upgraded streaming with the Q35's and using LDAC (high res streaming service both headphones are capable of) its a winning combination.What really impresses me so much about the Q35's are the punchy, well-defined bass combined with very clean mids and highs. Oh, and they get plenty loud enough though one should use common sense and keep loudness in a safe zone as to not damage one's ears.Okay, so on to the new Soundcore Q45's. For me, no wow factor. The bass, even with my phone tuned to LDAC codec is just flat. Even after custom tuning the equalizer to my liked settings, just not enough bass. Now, that's not all. If you go on YouTube, you'll find a lot of influencers who review the Q45's as having a ""more balanced sound"" with a ""natural bass response"". Well for me, that translates to boring.The Q45 sound quality, overall, just sounds a bit more muddy to me. I was really surprised, thinking they'd be at least a modest sound upgrade. I was not expecting anything substantial being that the Q35's and 45's have the same size drivers, but I did hope for a modest upgrade. Also, they just don't seem to get quite loud enough even with tweaking my smartphone to allow louder sound.What I will say positive about the Q45's is the earcups seem a little bit larger and the ear cushions just a bit softer.Sadly though, after a few hours of tinkering with all the settings and equalizer, I finally decided I'm going back to my awesome Q35's. I'll be returning the Q45's for the main reason as actually inferior sound to the Q35's.Final thoughts are if you already have the Q35's and sound is the most important thing, I'd stick to your Q35's. If you purchase the Q45's never having any of their previous headphones, you might be quite happy with them. I just feel you can actually spend less (purchasing the Q35's) and get superior sound vs. the Q45's which cost more and get inferior sound.These are just my thoughts."
"I recently got the Soundcore Q20 and the Soundcore Q45.I immediately noticed the ""L"" and ""R"" printed on the ear pads were very hard to see on the Q45.  It was hard for me to tell which pad goes on the left ear and the right ear.  I was disappointed because the cheaper Q20 did a good job of making this clear.(See Picture)I called support and ask if I could get replacement pads to fix the problem and was told NO.  I took the trouble to explain that the very large letters ""R"" and ""L"" were printed black on black impossible to see even with good viewing light.I had the blue model so I asked if the white or black model might be better in this regard and was again told NO.The support person showed no sympathy for my problem.It is too bad because it otherwise seems to be a fairly decent product. The noise cancelation was better than the Q20, but not perfect.  It can be adjusted in various ways but we wanted something for my wife to be able to block out the sound of me practicing the violin, repeating fast technical passages that distract her.  It certainly helped some, but was not as good as it was at canceling other ambient sounds that it was designed for.I downloaded the LDAC firmware enhancement for better sound and I was very pleased with the result.  My wife really enjoyed using the Q45 to listen to the great-sounding piano music she loves so much.I'm not sure if I will send it back or not, but I feel that it may be a mistake to keep it when the support person showed no interest in a situation that was clearly an avoidable flaw. It would have taken little effort to do it right in the first place with a very small effort of careful design.Indifference by Support in a situation like this is likely to be a red flag about the product and the company."
"My priority in buying these was noise cancellation to wear at home when it is noisy and while flying.  I wasn't so concerned about the sound because I have Sennheiser earbuds that sound great but don't have particularly good noise cancellation.  Of course over the ear works better for noise.  The noise cancellation on these is very, very good.  Not quite as good as Bose, which I think is the best, but less than half the price, almost the same quality.  For me Bose has an uncomfortable pressure sensation in my ear.  These did not have that, even at max NC, although these was a bit of a hiss.  Value wise, for noise cancellation, these are a winner.  However, the headband is not well padded.  They were uncomfortable right out of the box and so I couldn't imagine wearing them for a few hours, for example, on a flight.  Cheap seeming, very mushy padding.  I tried adjusting the headphones but no matter what I did, they were uncomfortable.  Sound wise, they present an OK sound at first.  But they are a bit muddled in the mids and highs, a bit shrill at times.  Not terrible but unable to retrieve detail very well.  At this price point this is actually reasonable.  I don't like the sound of the Bose either, and I don't think these headphones are much worse than the top ranking Bose.  So, if they are comfortable for you, they might be a good deal.  If you want audiophile sound, high level detail retrieval and resolution, dynamics - then these are definitely not for you, but at this price point, you aren't going to get that anyway.  But excellent noise cancellation and average sound at this price point is reasonable, hence 3 stars overall.  I don't think better padding would cost so much.  It would certainly make the headphones much more comfortable."
"O bought these headphones a little over a year ago, after some through use and testing these arw my hones findingsThe good:these headphones do have an amazing sound quality especially when it comes to noice cancelation, ive used these several times inside datacenters or crowded flights and is really difficult to hear any external noise. The app has these cute features for relaxation, similar to asmr clips but this is more of a custom sound efect you can listen to in order to relax, theres a custom equalizer that you can set up for different music or videos through the app, and they do get pretty loud if you have the volume completely maxed out, battery life is awesome, i can use it for days without having to recharge it, and it does lets you know when the battery is medium or low with an audible cue.The bad: ive own two of these headphones, not because theyre exelent and i wanted another pair, but because the matherial quality lacks when it comes to the assembly, specially on the side rails where you extend the headphones to fit your head size, cracks after 5 months of constant use. Both of my q45's have had the same issue with cracking on the sides, but recently my replacement headphones decided not to charge anymore for any given reason just before boarding a 6h flight and this is the headphones i got one year after getting a replacement directly from soundcore.Conclusion:Yes these are exelent headphones, audio is amazing, features are exelent, matherial used lack by a long shot. If you decide on getting these headphones, please get an extended warranty, that way you dont have to deal with the issues ive had with my past two q45's because theyre not meant to last you. or get a pair of overpriced bose headphones, they at least have lifetime warranty on all their products"
"+Great value for features-Painful to wear for long periodsI've used my Sennheiser PXC 550 noise cancelling headphones almost daily for over four years and they're still going strong, but I wanted to upgrade to USB-C and get better battery life out of my headphones. After checking specs, I tried the Anker Space Q45 and the Sony WH-1000XM4.GOOD:The noise cancelling is impressive for headphones in this price range. They performed better than the PXC 550 (though in fairness, the PXC 550 came out in 2016), and almost as well as the XM4 (which usually costs more than twice as much). Fans, air conditioners, and city traffic are muted to a whisper, since the headphones are great at cancelling out low-frequency noise.After updating the firmware, I was able to use HearID in the Soundcore app. HearID administers a hearing test and adjusts the headphones' EQ based on the results. Listening to music, the headphones sounded great.Bluetooth was fast and easy to connect.BAD:These headphones are quite large. Even with the headband at its most constricted, they felt huge. That wouldn't be a deal killer, but the earpads squeezed my head tightly and unevenly, resulting in pain after around one hour of use. I tried adjusting the earpads and headband so they would apply pressure evenly while still maintaining a seal, but they would always apply pressure in a single spot, either on the temple, on the jaw, or behind the ear. I also tried using a headband cover that allows you to add padding to the headband, but that did not help.Although I liked the Q45 and all its features, they are painful for me to wear. They're not for me, but if they fit you, they're probably the best bang-for-buck in noise cancelling headphones."
"I wish the noise cancellation was better, I can still hear a lot of everything around me.The mics are great and these are the most comfortable headphones I ever had. So I'll keep themAfter a few months of use, updating from 4 stars to 3. The Bluetooth pairing stops working as it should, every time I turn them on these are found by my device but can’t hear a thing. So I have to pair them again. It is not ideal. The sound quality is still decent and the battery has still long life.Two or three times I had connectivity problems, like if I would be distancing from the device while I still have them in my hands. So the Bluetooth honestly sucks :)I used it in flights and it could cancel the noise better.These is not my favorite purchase:("
"HUGE PRO:does NOT activate anti-ANC when a phone call is receivedexplanation:Nearly all ANC headsets have both an ANC mode (minimize external noise) and an anti-ANC mode (amplify external noise). This ""anti-ANC"" / amplify mode has a different name for each company. HearThrough with Jabra, Aware Mode with Bose, Transparency with Anker, etc. MOST COMPANIES SET THEIR HEADSETS TO AUtOMATICALLY SWITCH TO AMPLIFY MODE WHEN YOU GET A CALL. MOST COMPANIES THAT DO THIS DO NOT LET YOU DISABLE THIS.HUGE CON:the ANC is middling at best, even at maximum settingRESULT:I ended up returning it. The ANC is too weak. A true case of you get what you pay for. This is a huge step up from your $25-$50 headsets, and cannot compare to $300 headsets much less $500 headsets. My hunt for a good headset that doesn't switch its mode when a call comes in continues!"
"The whole point of buying these headphones was for noise cancellation. I was aware that these wouldn’t be the very best on the market but I expected them to work pretty well, especially considering all of the reviews I saw saying the ANC was fantastic. With these headphones on in different environments, I could hear people talking in a completely different room even with the ANC at max and music playing. Sure, the sound is a little muffled, but I would say noise is decreased by at most 50%. My normal SoundCore earbuds with no form of noise cancellation block out more sound than these headphones do.I haven’t tried other noise canceling headphones so maybe I had unrealistic expectations going into this purchase, but I was incredibly disappointed and will be returning them after a few hours of use."
Really nice and loud
"I do not describe myself as an audiophile, however I will state that I am quite picky about the ranges of frequencies in my headphones. For the pricepoint, these are excellent headphones and pretty comfortable. I own many products from Anker/soundcore and am usually more than just  pleased with their products. In this instance, I’m looking for a really solid rich and articulate sound experience from my headphones with the comfort of over the ear instead of on the ear which is what the Beats Solo headphones are that I’m leaving behind.I like the controls on these headphones, they feel well constructed, and they seal/fit well over the ears. My critiques, the case is kinda “meh” with a cheap plastic shell on the interior. And for me in this instance the audio range is just kinda flat, and the low end isn’t really low, but just feels/sounds like lower mids. Overall they just fell short of what I’m looking for at this time. I do like the usb c charging interface, that’s a plus over micro."
"Cheap fragile plastic hinges can't support the earcups' weight and break easily making your $150 completely useless.This is the second time I bought this product for the same reason, thinking being more careful would work... wrong. The plastic hinge broke with very minimal and gentle use. I've been so much more careful this time being aware of how fragile the plastic hinge is, but even with light use, they didn't last 4 full months. I'm writing this review late because I've been so frustrated about it that writing this review feels like a chore. And it took me months of shopping around to get these headphones.How did they break? I usually leave them hanging on my monitor's arm and I grabbed them from the arm when they broke. Yeah, just like that! It felt like the hinge crumbled with a very normal motion. You can tell the plastic hinge is way lighter than the rest of the headphones, becoming just a thin hollow joint. This is the headphone's pain point since everything else is a 10/10It's a shame because its sound quality and features, even in the app are 10/10. Noise Cancelling is better than the Sony which I tried before. Everything about them is good except the fragile plastic hinge that ruins the $140 investment. This is the 2nd pair being almost $300 in just a year and a half. The first pair lasted exactly a year before the hinge broke.Also, I contacted Anker through their website and they say they can't help me with the warranty because even though I got them from Amazon, it wasn't from the Anker Amazon store (little did I know). Funny enough, when I go to my orders and I click on this item, the store has changed to Anker. So I don't know if the 3rd party seller will take care of the warranty.The seller is or was: NIMEX GROUP INCI guess I'll go back to the Sony  WH-CH720N. I love Space Q45 ANC, I think they're better than Sony, I go to cafes a lot and compared them once.But hey, I rather go with the devil I know. Spend $135+ for the Space Q45 but they will break on you sooner than you think. They are overpriced for the build quality. They're designed to break, and you can tell by holding the earcups being held by the fragile plastic hinge."
"The headphones sound amazing and the noise-canceling is also amazing, but that would really be the only factors considered if I had made this review a few months ago but sadly these do have one fatal flaw. I beg you if you buy these treat them extremely delicately and if you have a big head you may experience failure around the band. My pair now have a gaping hole in it which started as a hairline crack and developed as every time I put on the headphones the plastic got a little bit weaker and the crack grew a little larger. so these are an amazing piece of tech just lack durability which means longevity may not be what you get out of these headphones.For the record, they still function as headphones perfectly in their current state but the noise cancellation is practically useless due to the seal being very loose around the ear with the massive crack making the ear cup not properly cup my ear."
"These are a good pair of wireless headphones especially for the price. The noise cancelling is near non-existent but the headphone cans themselves will cut out low level noises. The battery life is very good and it charges quickly. If you're generally good about charging your devices these headphones will never be an issue. The construction is quite good. I wipe them down with an alcohol wipe from time to time and I'm always amazed that it still looks almost brand new. Microphone audio quality for calls is quite poor, so I wouldn't buy them for calls especially not video conferences. Pairing with iOS and macOS is very easy. If you're switching devices a lot, maybe once every three months it'll get confused and you need to re-pair the headphones, but that's fairly common with bluetooth. Regarding comfort, I can wear these all day with no ear or head fatigue. The only issue is if you're in super hot environments, but that's to be expected with any pair of headphones."
"I'm super disappointed. I had the Soundcore by Anker Life Q35 ANC Headphones. I liked them. ANC was great. and while stock they were a little bass boomy, they EQed out just fine. The only issue I had was at the 1-year point, the plastic it was made out of started falling apart. I had 3 pieces of the headset started chipping until it finally broke enough that I couldn't wear them. I tried supergluing them, but they weren't really stable on my head. Still sounded good though.Since I liked the Q35s so much, I decided to get the Q45s. I agonized over the Q45 vs the cheaper space One, but decided to get the Q45s when they were on sale and the Ones were not. When I got them they seemed like they were made better, so I would just be careful using them. Then I listened to them.The Q45s tweeters hurt my ears. I tried EQing the treble down and it just sounds muffled. I switched to the Q35s thinking I was just imagining things and the treble didn’t hurt at all. I tried turning the treble up and while it sounded like there was too much treble, it still didn’t hurt my ears. I couldn't even use the Q45s. I returned them."
"These are a great option if you just want comfy headphones that drown out the noise when you’re traveling. The sound is decent but a little thin. You can play around in the app to adjust the EQ and level of noise cancellation so that was a nice. I personally care a lot about the sound it self and these headphones are nothing close to Sony, Bose, or Sonos over ear headphones. If you’re used to AirPods or any of the higher end brands sound quality you will most likely be disappointed.I ended up getting the Sony - WHCH720N instead as they’re in the same price range and you can tell the sound quality difference immediately. Again, if you don’t care that much about the sound quality these are a steal!"
"I purchased the Space Q45 headphones. I need them for work. I have both an iPhone XR and a Mac Mini. These headphones will not connect via Bluetooth with either. I got on Soundcore's website and tried using their chat feature for help. That was useless. It's a bot who simply gave me a link to the instruction manual that I already read. I asked to be connected to a real person, but that bot was incapable of doing that as well.So then I attempted to send Soundcore an email using their customer service link. That was useless as well. The site calls for the serial number of the specific headphones that I purchased. Seems simple enough, but there is no place obvious. I could barely make out teeny tiny black lettering on an arm of these headphones. Even with oblique lighting the wording was impossible to read.If you're unable to locate the serial number (guess they fully expected that), they said you could send in a photo of the entire product. Unfortunately, they forgot to install an upload buttonI then searched the FAQs and other areas of this website. Nothing. By now, I'm convinced Soundcore does not link to iPhones or Macs and their customer service is non-existent.Added to that, as with every other company out there, the headphones are made for much bigger people. They will not compact down for those of us with smaller heads or other body parts. I can't tell you how aggravating this is."
"I bought these back in February to replace my old set of earphones. I did a lot of research on different sets of headphones on YouTube, Amazon and other stores/sites. After months of searching, found these.At first, They were lovely. It became one of my favorite headphones I ever bought.I'm not an Audiophile so idk the technological/spec side of things, but these headphones sound GOOD.The Noise cancelling isn't bad,but could be a bit betterPhone calls were smooth on it and the battery life is solid; hard to top that much juiceYou're probably asking yourself; ""If they sound so good, then why give it only 3 stars?""That's due to the durability...The cushion on both the headband and earcups started peeling sometime in Late July/Early August (likely due to the hot weather).The worst part:The cracks that started to form around the adjustable part of the headphones. In one of the photos, you can see I tried using gorilla glue on one side, which worked, for a while, but more cracks just started to show up on the other side.Bottom Line: I wish I could recommend them, but I can't because for how I use my headphones, the durability did not meet my expectations."
"I’m not sure if I received a couple of bad pairs or if the overall quality of the brand has gone down, but I am very disappointed in these headphones. I wear headphones constantly during waking hours due to sound sensitivities. I have owned 5 pairs of Soundcore headphones, from the Q20s, all the way to 2 pairs of the Q45s. My first pair of Q45s stopped working within a year, but otherwise performed as expected. This pair is different. 1) SQUEAKING- for some reason, the headphones squeak every time I move my head. As someone with sound sensitivities, this is a dealbreaker. 2) battery life- one of the main reasons I love this brand is due to the incredible battery life of their products. That is not the case with this set of headphones. They last about a day, which is less than half the time other Soundcore headphones last. The sound quality is what I’ve come to expect from the brand (good) but, overall, I am disappointed. I don’t know that I will buy another pair of SoundCores to replace this one, and it’ll be the first time in 5 years that I’ve used a different brand."
"Ugh. I’m a big Anker fan. I absolutely love my Liberty 3 pros and q30s. I wanted to love these, however no matter what I did I couldn’t get enough bass. My q30s blew these away as far as the bass goes. My Sony XM4s were also much fuller on the bottom end as well. In order to use the bass boost in the app you have to use the Soundcore Signature sound. On these headphones it is not my favorite and sounds almost flat. Unfortunately,  there was no way to boost bass much more using the custom Eq.  I just couldn’t get these to sound how I wanted. I have listened to the q35s and they sounded fuller and had more bass. I actually prefer the q35s  over these.  Having said that, if you are not a bass head these sound wonderful in the mid and high ranges. If they had bass they would be  just as good as the XM4s (if not better as their mids and highs were clearer) for me they also really hurt my head within 5 minutes of wearing them. (I have a small to medium head) the headband didn’t have enough padding for me and then and is narrower than the q30s. For my head shape this didn’t work and was quite painful.  The ear-cups had generous padding. The noise cancelling was not quite as good at the XM4s, but much better than the q30s.  If the bass can be fixed with a firmware update I think they would be amazing for the price as long as they would be comfortable on your head."
"So first off, the sound is great, the anc is great, and I found them plenty comfortable. I'm returning them still. The problem seems to be what I describe as a ""fluttering"". Anytime they shift even slightly on your head the anc noticeably tries to compensate which sounds like the EQ rapidly shifting before settling back to the proper sound profile. That wouldn't be a huge deal once in awhile but it happens all the time. Every step you take, eating lunch, turning your head quickly, like literally any movement. The only way for this not to happen is either sit perfectly still, or to turn off anc which defeats the purpose of having anc headphones.This one problem is why I'm returning them and its bad enough that all the good things I said off the bat are worthless. Sound, comfort, anc, even build quality doesn't matter if the sound is constantly shifting around."
"I bought these to get me by while my Apple AirPods Max headset is being repaired.  This review is for Apple users who are accustomed to high-performance products.The ANC is on par with the Apple AirPods Max.  However, by comparison, the microphone input over Bluetooth is terrible.  It almost sounds like I'm gargling water while talking--well not that bad, but it is poor by comparison to Apple's signature ANC product in this regard.  One of the features that works surprisingly well is the multipoint connection, which allows this headset to automatically switch between my Mac, iPhone, and iPad.  If you're an Apple user and don't mind not having the convenience of the volume/push button crown, and a high-quality microphone for making phone calls, then this is a great economical backup to have in case your AirPods Max goes down.  The sound quality is amazing, but it lacks the dynamic spatial audio you would be accustomed to as a user of Apple audio products."
"I love these and use them regularly, especially on flights. However, the plastic started chipping right after warranty ended and of course the manufacturer is not obligated to support after.So 18 months max."
"Im gonna go straight to the pointFormer Q30 user. The Q45 suck in comparison.-They don't have NFC-The bass is completely messed up-It hates 256Kb/s or lower quality music, most songs that sounded quite well on the Q30s, now sound like youre hearing from a loudspeaker.But if you have exclusively high quality songs in your play list, then, they sound magnificent, the volume levels are good, and the finde details in the music are there.This is my advice if you upgraded from Q30s:-From the Soundcore app, leave the EQ in signature mode, otherwise you won't be able to turn on ""Bass Up""-To toggle ""bass Up"", go to ""controls"" in the app and enable it in the "" touch two times"".-Use your personal player equalizer to tame the bass if it is too punchy, I use AIMP since it has curve equalizer built-in. Lower the lowest frequencies a bit, and the highest fequencies a bit higher. Just a bit, or the music will be loud as hell-Use 320Mbs Mp3s or FLAC files. That means that Spotify users are screwed. Use Deezer instead, or get your files from other sources. Lower quality songs will just sound bad.-Save your money and get the Q30s or Q35s instead. Tese headphones require a lot of tuning out of the box, if you don't want to scratch your head, you better don't bother-"
"I previously purchased a Soundcore Q30 in 2021 and it' worked fantastic, although it's falling apart now after 3 years of use.  I was excited to get the Q45, but, on arrival and testing the sound quality was less than expected, worse than a 3yr-old falling apart Q30, and, there was a slight scratchy static sound on occasion on the right side.All in all, as far as design goes, it's fairly similar to the Q30, and that's good.  The headphone pads seemed less squishy, and more firm than the ""protein"" pads from 2021 and that's perhaps good if that translates to better durability, also, I can't speak much to that since I've returned this Q45.I expect I simply got a lemon/defective, and have returned the order.  Once refund is processed, I'll likely try another Soundcore Q45, although I'm open to others if something else come alongs more tempting without much difference in price."
"UPDATE: I felt like this review may have been too harsh, as I wrote it when I was clearly frustrated. I decided to try them again and my god what a mistake. I was far too kind the first time. Today, the headphones showed connected to my macbook and my cellphone, would provide sound for neither, and had no method of troubleshooting apart from disconnecting/reconnecting which didn't help. I had to forget the headphones from both devices and reconnect to get sound. Then I switched from Spotify to Instagram on my phone and the whole thing started over; no sound, no way to fix apart from forgetting and reconnecting. Ridiculous.I took a chance on these, as my Sony XM2 headsets have aged and gotten lots of hard use. I liked the pricepoint, design, and perceived value. They were okay for 30 days. I would have given a four star review up until a couple of days ago.As soon as I was out of the product return range, it's like a switch was flipped; they're suddenly garbage. They cut out CONSTANTLY (several times per minute). I read it's because the multipoint on these headphones are sub par; it would be more accurate to say it just doesn't exist. If you are connected to more than one device, it is essentially guaranteed that you won't be able to hear anything that you want to hear. Either the connection will be locked to one device or the other with no way to switch between them, or the sound is cutting out so frequently that you'd be significantly better off listening to nothing at all.I thought SURELY this is something I'm doing. I updated every driver on my macbook and on my phone. I made sure all the firmware was up to date. I did everything I possibly could. I put on Pull Harder The Strings of Your Martyr by Trivium and, after the 7th time the song cut out, I checked the track; it was 1:43 seconds in. So there was a about a 2 second drop on an average of ever 12-13 seconds.I turned them off and back on and did the same with the bluetooth adapters on my macbook and my phone. Turn it on and off again, right? Wrong. Spotify is showing that it's playing on my headphones and it's just pure silence.I started a new track and I told myself if I completed this entire review without the music cutting out once, I wouldn't leave it. Well the music didn't cut out a single time, but it also never played to begin with. Spotify has gone through seven (7) songs and says that it is playing on soundcore Space Q45.It's not. Complete silence.I should have bought XM-5's."
"Purchased these Space Q45 headphones mostly to use during outdoor exercise for wind noise reduction.  They did a pretty good job at that and the sound quality was also pretty good.  But...They do not stay put if moving around, so not very useful for my purposes.  I exchanged them for the Space One phones, which will likely go back too.  Space One does stay put a little better, but still not snug enough for much movement.  And I noticed the sound quality and noise reduction are not as good as the Q45."
"I purchased this to help with lawn care, so I would not hear lawn mowing. In testing it prior to that, I noticed the noise cancellation seems rather poor. Whatever is on in the background - music, TV, talking - I can still hear it - just not as well - unless it is on very quietly. In reading about this, I thought it would cancel 98% of noise. I would estimate that perhaps it cancels 50 or 60% of noise, but is ineffective against anything that is ""louder.""If there is something playing in another room in the house, I might barely hear it with the noise cancellation. However, if I am in the same room, it just makes it not as loud, and that is why I say it's only cancels 50 or 60%. In this situation, it probably is more like only 40% is canceled. If I mow the lawn, I am only cancelling about 40%. I realize that this is a subjective measure of perception - but it is nowhere near 98% - unless, again, you are talking about sound that is distant or very faint.When I listen on noise cancellation mode (which I tried at all levels, including most powerful), and I compare it to ""normal"" or ""transparent"" - there is certainly a difference, and the noise cancellation is readily apparent. It's just nowhere near 98%. Perhaps an ear bud might be more effective at noise cancellation?I will keep this, because I like listening to high quality audio, but the reason I purchased it for - to achieve noise cancellation with every loud work, such as mowing the lawn  - cannot be satisfied in any way by this. If you are thinking about buying this to be able to cancel loud noise, don't bother with this. I may end up buying something cheaper, with less high quality audio, but is more better suited to that type of noise cancellation. It is really a shame that the creators of this headphone felt the need to be deceptive and make false claims about the degree to which this can achieve noise cancellation. That lack of integrity cost me $150+ and that is why I give this 2 stars, even though the audio quality is good. I also think it is very comfortable as well, just ill-suited for its intended purpose."
"The q45 were a big disappointment, I recently bought them during the Amazon spring sale and I ended up returning them after 4 days. These are extremely overhyped by reviewers on YouTube so take their word with a big grain of salt.They sound like crap out of the box, it sounds hollow like playing music through a tunnel, the soundstage and bass are weak and the treble is harsh. You have to EQ them to make them sound decent and even then it won’t do much because the original tuning is so bad to begin with.The ANC doesn’t actually block out most of the background noise but rather it blocks low frequency noises like cars passing by or bus engine sounds, everything else you will hear, a little muffled but audible. I might be biased because I’m used to the ANC from AirPods and Sony wh-1000s but you can’t really expect that level of ANC at this price point so for me it wasn’t a big deal.The actual build does feel premium-ish, it’s all plastic frame but they feel study and got some weight to it, if you got a big head they will fit just fine. But the clamping force is a little too much, it just presses into my jaw and feels uncomfortable after a while, I found myself needing breaks.TL;DR: terrible audio quality out of the box (needs EQ but still sounds bad), ANC blocks low frequency noises at best, build quality feels premium-ish but clamping force can be a too much depending on the the size of your head."
"BIGGER THAN EXPECTED: The headphones are too big for me. I have pretty big head but still it look bigger and bulky.SOUND QUALITY: It sound great but users have to remain seated when using these. I observed that, when we move the pressure around the ear changes and this results in weired sounding. I am afraid this headphones are not for gym due to this reason. In addition, the sound quality changes as we switch from ANC to Normal mode.BUILT QUALITY:It definitely feels cheap. The buttons are loosely  positioned and rattles when pressed.I had a high hope that this headphones would meet my expectations due to hype seen recently but I decided to return. I am thinking of going for Sony or Sennheiser headphones of similar price range as these brands are already established."
"I purchased these in April 2024 for an international trip taken in August. I used them while cutting grass for a few months leading up to the trip.Pros:The sound quality is good and noise canceling works well.  They fit comfortably around my ears and over my head. The battery life is excellent.Cons:Build quality is awful. The plastic bars around the headphone connection to the support band that goes over your head began breaking almost as soon as I started using them. This has led to a loosening fit around the ears, reducing the quality of the ANC.  It's only a matter of time until they fail completely at these connections.  Disappointing as they otherwise are very nice.I've been buying Anker products for years and this is the first build quality issue I've encountered."
"On smallest setting, still too big for my head. Slides around while I work outside, if I tilt my head down, or when I have a hood up. Also, if you get warm at all, they trap moisture. Not great if you plan to work out or do yardwork.The noise settings are really only helpful for indoor settings. The noise canceling is fine for low-grade rumblings, but sharp, unexpected noises aren't filtered well. Plus there all these grades and settings on the phone app that are just fluff. Would be nice if were simpler but each function be better.The button controls are confusing and I struggle to skip songs or control volume with the headset alone.Battery life is great. But rarely wear bec of size and inconvenience."
"Spent two entire workdays trying to keep these freakin' headphones connected to both my cell & computer. One would work, would try to switch over (as advertised I should be able to!) and would either hear no sound, have to reconnect, or hear garbled/staticky garbage. They'd probably be nice if you were just using them for music/entertainment purposes (albeit they are quite large and even all the way tightened fell off my head when leaning forward) but I needed them for work and have had to embarrassingly decline multiple calls or have no one hear me when trying to answer, so they're being sent right the heck back where they came from. 2 stars because they are pretty to look at and when I used them to listen to music on my phone they weren't bad."
"These are so close to being great but ultimately I cannot recommend them. I am constantly flying and wanted a reasonably priced pair of ANC headphones to bring with me. I have used them the last few months for a few hours every week.The ANC does a great job canceling noise on an aircraft. They are so close to being very comfortable. The problem is they have literally no bass. If you’re listening to podcasts or playing a game where there isn't much bass, it isn’t too noticeable. The moment you start listening to music or watching a movie with more bass heavy scenes, they fall completely flat. I’m not even the type that normally turns the bass up, I just need SOME bass.The second issue I have with these is that the headband is too big. I’m 6’2” / 230lbs and my head is proportional to my body. I have the strap set to the SMALLEST setting and it is TOO big. They slide down the side of my head making the headset rest on top of my ears instead of on top of my head, making them uncomfortable for long periods of wear. Besides that, the ear cups are soft and flexible. They would be incredibly comfortable if the strap held them in the right location.Pros: Excellent noise cancellation  Could be very comfortable if you have a  gigantic head  Great battery life  Folds up to be fairly compact  App works wellCons: NO BASS, making them useless for music  Head strap is too big, making them slide down  your headI would have returned them, but Anker (which makes soundcore) usually makes fantastic products. So I was hoping that a future update would have fixed them. But they never did."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It was my worst purchase:After more than a week of use for at least 4 hours a day, this is what I can conclude.Uncomfortable: To begin with, the weight of the headphones is a little high. Wearing them all day is a pain.The force exerted by the pads on the head is uncomfortable. It's supposed to be homogeneous, but no. In the video and the penultimate image you can see that there is a force exerted on the bottom of the pads. I did not feel comfortable for a single day.Ugly: I didn't expect them to be small, but the rounded design where the buttons are located is horrendous. It makes it look so wide, I see why they don't put images in front. Well, this may not be important to some.Sound: The only good point, but just barely. The bass is good, but only with the brand's signature. The mids and highs are just good, normal.BUT, the VOLUME. This is the WORST part of all. The volume is low so I always had to be at full volume to be able to enjoy my music at least the full range of sound.OF all the headphones I have, I turned them up to a maximum of 60 to 75% to enjoy it as if I were at a concert. With this one, I couldn't enjoy it even with all the volume or equalizer.I see how they promise 50 hours.Conditions: I used it on the street with traffic. My only sound quality references are a Sennheiser Momentum version 1 and a Phillips SHP9500."
The sound on theses headphones are great and the amount of variety and options on the app for sound options are also amazing. The active noise cancellation is great and also the transparency feature. Unfortunately it’s all plagued with the issue of the headphones just not turning on sometimes and after looking around online it seems to be a common issue(even when fully charged). Only thing I found to get them to turn on is plugging it into the charger for a few seconds to almsot jumpstart them. Recently they haven’t given me that issue because I’ve been using them everyday but it seems like if you don’t touch them for a day or two the issue comes back.
"This time last year I was a big fan of Soundcore audio. Originally purchased the Q30 headphones. Still love those.  Based on the sound I decided to try their ear buds so I bought the Life A1's and the Liberty Airs. Sounded great. In July I decided to upgrade and also decided to purchase a pair for my daughter for her birthday. Loved them for about 5 months. Suddenly both pairs started randomly unpairing or just powering down seemingly without any cause or reason. Seemed to start having similar problems with both sets of ear buds.  Contacted customer support about these Q45's and they were great about swapping out the two pairs but I also gave them all the data concerning all the problems I was suddenly having.  The replaced Q45's are now having the same issues less than two weeks. My daughter loved the sound so much that she purchased a pair of Q20's for her friend's birthday gift and THEY are now having the same issues.  Soundcore doesn't know what is wrong and tried to tie the problem to issues with external devices but other headsets I have from other companies have no issues. They issued a partial refund as a gesture of good will but I now have multiple unreliable listening devices. Sound fine until they decide to stop working.  Did all the work with firmware, resets, troubleshooting my phone and computer but in my opinion and also the Geek Squad, it's some sort of a a manufacturing defect. Buyer beware......"
"... I love my old Soundcore LifeTunes, so I was hoping to like these too. They aren't as good as the ones half their price.They are too big. I have a large head and these barely fit on the smallest adjustment. Not sure if it's partly because of the loose fit, but the noise canceling isn't as good. Even the sound just isn't as nice. Not as smooth??The voice isolation on transparency mode works alright, so there's that..."
"After using the Liberty 4 NC, I had high expectations for their bigger brother, I was disappointed. These headphones definitely perform well in many aspects except for the primary purpose, sound. For one, the volume on these headphones is very low, and I mean low as in the lowest sounding headphones I have ever owned. You have to tweak your device’s sound and music settings to get the best performance from them. Noise canceling is good, transparency mode though, leaves a lot to be desired as you can probably hear better by simply leaving them on “normal” mode. I have tried to get them to at least sound louder but they simply can’t. I guarantee most of your music will be heard at it’s highest volume or close to it most of the time. They are comfortable, cover my big ears well, did not cause too much pressure on my ears despite using them with my glasses on. That being said, they are just $140, and you get what you pay for when compared to other similar headphones at a much higher price."
"I bought these headphones in November of 2022, impressed with the price and quality, as well as features. Fantastic sound quality, really great noise canceling, and comfortable on my large head. The noise canceling is so good that my wife has to come in my office and tap my shoulder to get my attention.However, after 7 months of daily use, the plastic around the top of the headphones has begun to crack, see photos. I bought these headphones because I am a big man, and I have a large head. These are extremely comfortable, and quite large. I have had this problem with headphones in the past, and I'm disappointed to see this happening on these headphones as well. It's basically a pressure crack that occurs when you take the headphones off, and the earpieces are pulled apart slightly, putting pressure on the plastic pieces connecting the headphones to the top rail. There's not really a fix for it, I could put some tape around it but it would be unsightly. I won't be buying another pair of headphones from this company. However I do have two pairs of earbuds and I love them."
"I bought these headphones for three reasons. One: I really love the increased depth and presence LDAC brings to Bluetooth; Two: I needed multipoint headphones so I could listen to my TV through the LDAC capable Bluetooth transmitter I purchased, and Three: I needed the noise cancelation capability. As it turns out, multipoint connectivity doesn't work in LDAC mode. I suppose two out of three ain't bad but I could have paid less to get headphones without LDAC that had noise canceling and multipoint capability."
"I love these headphones! The Q45s have crisp audio quality and resonant bass, and the noise canceling is great. I use them for every aspect of my daily life at work and home. However...... After a few months, the arms have begun creaking whenever I turn my head. At first, they were minimal, but they are really bothering me now. Even if I look up from my desk, there's an audible popping in the earphones.I've never had this issue with prior SoundCore headphones. I'm disappointed because they're the best headphones I've bought, other than the constant creaking.Please let me know if there's a solution to this problem! I would love to fix it."
"I use this product every single day for hours. I hardly ever charge them. They can go for hours on a very short charge. I will say that I was very disappointed in the noise canceling. I can hear people talking from across the room, even with NC turned to the max. This was the main reason for my purchase. Other than that, the audio is great and the app is easy to use! I would recommend this if you are not looking for nc headphones."
I have sensory issues and this was too heavy the top was pressing against my head. The anc is great almost as Good as the quiet comfort. It’s 10 oz I can only handle 8 oz anything more makes me uncomfortable. The sound and customization is the so good I want to cry because I’m returning it due to the weight and top part not having enough cushion and hurting my head 🥲😭. I love the sound ngl.Another major con is the sound leak pretty loud not discreet.
"These headphones sound great, have effective noise cancelling, and have been very comfortable to use. Unfortunately, after about 3 months of use, the plastic parts of the headband started to crack. They're still usable now, but probably not for much longer. Disappointing to get less than 6 months of use out of these."
"The noise canceling is okay at best and the head band is too big for my head. I feel like I have a normal sized head and I have it set to the smallest setting, but it still hangs low on my ears."
"These headphones are comfortable and lightweight. I really like that the can be paired to 2 devices at the same time without having to re-pair every time I switch between my phone and tablet. The transparent mode is awesome too. I am no audiophile, but the sound quality, while clear, sounds pretty flat to me. I’m not a bass head, but in such a small speaker I find that a little bass adds warmth to the music. The volume isn’t very loud, which is fine if you are just listening to music. When I listen to podcasts or YouTube videos I find myself constantly trying to increase the volume, even when it is maxed out. My pair may be defective. It they seem much looser on my head than any other headphone I have owned.  I also own a pair of Soundcore Life Q20 that don’t have the extra features like transparent mode or mobile app, but they do sound slightly better to me than the Q45. $145 is a little high for these. I wish I had tried other Bluetooth headphones in this price range before buying these."
"I've had these for 9 months and I'm not happy with the quality when used for taking phone calls.  Everyone complains of static and cutting out.  I actually contacted Anker to figure this out, and they couldn't hear me when I called them so it took little convincing to get them to replace under warranty.  We'll the issue we is still there. The phone quality is just not there.If you want these solely for listening to music then go for it!  These are definitely great in that department. I love how I can listen for hours without recharging and how loud they can get. Makes it so hard for me to give these a negative review because I have other Anker products that I love but these really don't meet my expectations."
"In my opinion, I wouldn’t say this headphone is the worst or the best and why? Because I feel like the head phone could’ve been a little bit louder and ontop of that you’ll have to download an App for it just to customize the hearing etc which I think it doesn’t much do anything. Noise Cancellation is eh… okay I mean I can still hear a little bit through with NC on. I just wish it was a bit on a louder side. If you pair this with IOS phone it works but volumes is a bit low. It doesn’t have a heavy Bass just subtle.I wouldn’t work out with these on because it will slide off unless you have a big head Lol. Unfortunately I had to give it to my bf because he wear a cap and he could put it on his cap while skating and it seem to work for him. I’m a ribbon dancer with doing lots of movement… I think I will stick back with my airpod pro…I would say it’s not really worth to be up to $160 with taxes and shipping…"
"I ordered these and found that the noise cancelling function worked extremely well, however music on these headphones sounded terrible (in every mode). For podcasts/audio books, these headphones would be perfect, but if you are expecting a decent music experience look somewhere else.  Music sounded weak and muddled, and not engaging at all. I considered keeping them, they are pretty nice headphones but I just could not get over the very disappointing music sound. (Iphone 14 Pro w/ Spotify)The battery life was amazing, I returned them before I could test exactly how long they would last, but I would not be surprised if they hit the claimed 50hrs.Construction wise, the headphones felt very well built, but the case needs some work.  The case was well made, but the flimsy plastic insert just falls out, and I could see that it would break/degrade easy over time. I would recommend SoundCore update the plastic insert JUST A LITTLE and glue it into the case. It would cost almost nothing and deliver a much more premium experience."
"The Q45 lasted only 9 months before it stopped working. It turns on, says ""battery high"", and immediately turns back off. I understand that electronics don't like moisture, and I do get quite sweaty at the gym. But the Q20 (that was a third the price) I got 4 years ago is still going strong. The only reason I replaced it with the Q45 was that the headband foam was deteriorating and, as a result, starting to smell.If you're going to be using your headphones in a moist environment, save yourself some money."
These are decent for the price.
"A great first experience with these as a step up from the Space NC headphones I had to have, but now as I've used them more, they are starting to randomly turn off, which is a serious concern. At first, it was sporadic, but it's increased in frequency over time. Other people mention this is related to some Bluetooth-related issues if you have more than one device paired, but considering the other device it syncs to has its Bluetooth turned off, it makes no sense to me. I'd understand them fighting for control, but turning off?Seems they have some bugs to work out, but such a glaring issue is a disappointment from a generally reliable brand. I definitely will be moving to another brand after this experience. I need my headphones to be reliable, and given the frequency of others reporting this issue, I don't really care to chance a replacement that'll do the same weeks later."
"I ordered two but ended up returning the same day. They are Okay for the price if you only care to listen to music. But the call quality isn’t good. But what I was most frustrated with is Amazon and UPS couldn’t get their acts together. I returned them on 7th September and even after 7 days they haven’t initiated refund because for past 4 days, the UPS tracking shows delayed. Literally they were going 5 hrs from my home. Absolutely worst service from Amazon this time."
"Although sound is great the headphones are heavy and don’t fit my head — they slide around on my head with even the smallest activity ( ie, walking my 12 year old dog).  I’m a female of small stature.  They’ll probably be fine for a larger person.  I’ll be returning them."
"Why I returned them was because skipping songs was annoying. You have to press and hold button for 3 to 5 seconds. On the app, you cant change this. Another reason, I felt they were too bulky on your head. Chewing gum also made the sound weird (hard to explain) but for the price not bad if you are sitting at your desk."
"All  I can say is don't buy this product.  There are better headphones on the market at the same or less price point.  I Purchased these headphones primarily for when I am on an airplane.  I have used them maybe 10 times.  Two months ago I noticed that they would not turn on and when i pressed the on button i could here a voice recording saying ""Battery Hot""  then it would turn off.  I did every trouble shooting known on the web and the company's website.  Eventaully i spoke through email and phone with support.  One individual said it is most likely a software problem.  They verified my purchase but then said well we only offer a 18 month warranty (it had been like 19 months) so they told me they will not take them back and replace.  The problem is they know this is an issue they have and will not support it like an honorable company should.  There are better more dependable headphones no need to buy this off brand name.  My recomendation is do not buy this product.  RLM"
"I first put on this headset and became instantly impressed. The sound quality seemed crystal clear and I was hearing sounds from music I’ve never heard before.Over time, I began to see some negative qualities about the headset that I’ll list here:-The headset became warm very quickly. I’ve never had an issue with previous headsets, but this one became almost unbearably warm after a 20-minute period.-The pressure when the noise cancelling was turned on was too much. I lack the words to explain it adequately, but it seemed like the sound became slightly muffled and it felt like a pressure was squeezing your head… which I’ve never experienced before.-The Bluetooth would sometimes disconnect and I’d have to forget the device and re-add it, which is annoying to say the least.Overall, I’d say it’s a decent headset. It’s not perfect, but if you’re simply in need of some good quality noise-cancellation, I would definitely recommend these."
"These started pretty great, although I could hear conversations a little through them - they were super muffled by the noise cancelling so that was good.A year or so out and the audio quality is fine but the noise cancelling feature is basically useless. It can handle a quiet AC humming, but no further office noise (conversations, traffic outside my window, keyboards, etc) that all used to get canceled.Im going to have to buy something else."
"I like that they don't have a bright flashing light. But I'd like to get at least a year out of a pair of headphones. I didn't do anything to them. They just fell apart.What else matters? They could sound amazing, but I can't use them."
"The sound itself was little better than a $45 pair of Cowin E7's, and noise-cancelling was far inferior. The fit was atrocious and so loose that it didn't even seal snugly around the ears. I am baffled at sheer amount of positive reviews. The headphone set looks and feels lightweight and chintzy, just like the carrying case it arrives in. You can have the same sound quality, better noise-cancelling & better fit for 1/3 of the price."
"Can’t use while charging, transparency mode is bad, ear cushion material pulling away after 6 months."
"I got these for work and they work great for noise cancelling, sound quality, etc.  The issue i have with them is bluetooth connectivity.  Everytime i boot my PC  and turn on the headphones they do not automatically connect.  I have to go into bluetooth and the device is there and I have to click connect (not pair again, just connect a previous device).  Sounds simple enough but it is very annoying when all of my past headsets this extra step was not needed.  Yes i have tried to pair the device, clear it out, etc.  Once connected and before it goes into sleep mode its fine.  Very annoying when im getting a teams call and i dont have bluetooth up to hurry up and try and connect the device then answer the call before the caller disconnects....."
"These sound great, however bass is lacking and they don't get loud enough. I like my hard rock and metal but like a little more bass than most. Exaggerated V curve, which these are supposed to have. App is great and setting up was a breeze. But, they are going back. I'll keep borrowing my wife OG crushers!"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Update (Good customer care):I had connectivity issue, tried all the diagnosis steps to resolve issuebut it is still happening.Then share same with customer care, upon few emails back and forthtoday got new replacement device.so adding one more star for great customer service-----Sound and noise cancelling are good (not great). Looks durable but won't last long. It has week spots where craks could be formed over usage. I think for mine , it took a year to form those craks."
"I did a lot of research to try and find a more budget friendly pair of over ear Bluetooth noise canceling headphones to replace an old pair of Bose corded over ear headphones, and after reading lots of reviews and recommendations, landed on these.I had high hopes for these since I had done so much research but ended up being extremely disappointed in the sound quality right away. Music sounded flat and the volume just doesn’t turn up loud enough to get the full depth when in a loud environment, such as a plane.In terms of fit, the way these sit on my ears is just not very comfortable for long periods of time. The cushions around the ears don’t have very much give, so when turning my head from side to side the seal breaks and let’s in outside noise, in turn, defeating the purpose of the noise canceling feature. This is quite annoying when in loud environments, such as a plane, which is the main reason I purchased these. The headband is also quite ridged, making these not very comfortable to wear for longer than a couple hours and giving me a headache.For a budget option, these are not the worst, but considering the poor sound quality and issue with fit, I feel these should be a lot lower priced. Definitely worth spending your money on higher quality if you’re looking for good sound quality and comfort for long term wear."
"To my ears, these sound muddy and muffled. The biggest reason I am returning them is because if I tilt my head, they start to slide off. I believe I have a reasonably average sized head, but these don't have the clamping power for me to trust them. Pretty unimpressed based on all of the glowing reviews here. Guess the real audio gurus were correct. Average at best. Would do 2.5 stars if it was an option."
"Got these based on reviews which stated the mic was decent, with functional background noise reduction/cancellation.  Charged them and paired them, and then tested them using my work call software--and my supe could hear the folks near me talking.  So I checked the help, and it had some worthless steps (repairing, really?  has that ever helped this issue?), then to check for firmware updates.  So I did, and there was one.  Installed the new firmware, which was nice and easy to do.  We then retested, and it was WORSE.  The mic was picking up people all around the room, and other background noises too!The ANC was impressive though.  My supe has the high end sony ANC headphones, and he said these weren't as good--but they were closer than any other he'd tried on.  So these may be great for music listening (didn't test it), especially in noisier environments, but they were terrible for calls."
They look ridiculous as they stick out so far. I dont want to be caught dead wearing these in public.... and I have a huge head. Wear XL motorcycle helmet and baseball caps for reference. These would look even more ridiculous on smaller heads.sounds i couldnt get a setting after hours of tweaking I was happy with. it feels like quality but is noticably bigger and heavier and with less padding than the Bose and Sonys. I know the price and value is amazing and have tons of Anker products and smart home products.these would be fine if you plan to just use them in private but theyre not comfortable enough to travel with imo. which is why I wanted anc headphones. btw anc is probably better than the Bose and Sony imo. so if thats your main focus go for it.but personally the headphones arent comfortable and lacking punch and volume doesnt get as loud as i would want in a headset.3/5 imo and I wanted to love these so much and love Anker products.
"First off, for the price, you can't get any better sound quality, battery life, and user friendly app. The downsides are the fit and the case. The fit is my biggest issue. I have maybe a slightly below average head size, but it's pretty normal and these headphones are WAY too loose. Even fully retracted they can move around on my ears. Unless you have an average or larger head I would not recommend buying, they also will not fit on kids. Then, the case is just bad. It holds the headphones and you can stuff the aux and charging cables in but it takes some force to get it all to fit and it's just a flimsy bare minimum design. In the end you might not care about these things and it's worth it for you. For me, I regret the purchase, though I love my other soundcore products."
"I recently purchased the Anker Premium Headphones with high hopes, given my positive experiences with other Anker products. However, I have been left thoroughly disappointed with these headphones, and I feel compelled to share my experience.Sound Quality: The biggest disappointment for me is the sound quality. There's something very off in the midrange that I just can't seem to rectify with the EQ settings. This issue becomes even more pronounced when using the noise cancellation mode. It feels like the headphones are doing a lot of notching on various frequencies, resulting in an unnatural and unpleasing audio experience. While some may enjoy the boosted treble and bass, it doesn't solve the underlying problem. For a premium-priced product like this, I expected a basic, decent sound quality.Comparison to Other Headphones: To put it into perspective, I've compared these headphones to my Bose QC 35II, AirPod Pros, and Audio-Technica M50, and sadly, the Anker Premium Headphones fall short in terms of sound quality.Positive Aspects: I must acknowledge that there are some positives to these headphones. The accompanying app is user-friendly, and the headphones have an impressive range when paired with a Bluetooth 5.3 adapter. They are reasonably comfortable, and the battery life is a significant advantage.Conclusion: Despite these benefits, I find myself unable to use these headphones even for video calls at work due to the problematic sound quality. Considering the price tag of $150, I had expected much better in terms of sound performance. Regrettably, I will be returning these headphones.In summary, the Anker Premium Headphones may have some appealing features, but they ultimately fall short where it matters most - sound quality. For audiophiles or anyone seeking a premium audio experience, I would advise looking elsewhere."
"I never leave reviews but I thought I might incase anyone else is looking for what I was. I saved up money to buy these after owning the Q20s for 3 years and those have been great so I thought it would be an upgrade but it has been a downgrade. The ear cups are massive and leave room for the sound to get distorted. They also fit on my head weird, they squeeze too tight around the sides of my ears and give me a headache while somehow also being too loose on the top and moving around even at the smallest setting(which causes more distortion of noise). The noise canceling isn't any better than the Q20s, you can only slightly tell when the noise canceling is on VS being off. For being one of the main selling points for the product being noise canceling, I'm very disappointed.I made a point to stay with the soundcore brand because of happy I am with the sound quality but these just aren't it. The highs are too high and the bass isn't very strong even on the bass boost setting. For those reviews saying they can compete with beats or other $300 headphones, I truly don't understand. I've tried going through all the settings and adjusting the equalization to my taste but the sound quality just isn't there like there older products. Pretty disappointed and I will be returning and buying a new pair of Q20s"
"This is my second pair of headphones i've gotten from soundcore and while both have surpassed my expectatives in sound quality for their respective price points they dissapoint when it comes to their built quality which would be more understandable if the price difference wasnt so huge, the Q20s go for around 50 bucks and this ones for 150, granted i got them with a discount price but the point stands, i've this headphones for a year and a half, the ear cups peeled a few months ago and the plastic of the headband cracked until it broke, such a shame because they are still good sounding headphones, ive taken good care of them, using them mostly during my commute and them placing them on their hard case, i expected them to last at least 3 years or so, wasnt expecting to upgrade so soon, but for sure my next pair wont be from soundcore."
"I bought these hoping to replace my Bose QC35 II's because I was getting tired of the microUSB charging and the ANC shows its age compared to newer models and competition, but I really don't agree with other reviews I've seen of these headphones in regard to their sound quality. Out of the box, the bass sounds blown out and muddy and treble sounds overly tinny and almost sibilant, and the other presets in the Soundcore app only do so much to mitigate it. The options in the app also don't account for the wired mode which won't keep those settings unless you keep the headphones turned on. I would either pony up the money for more expensive offerings from Bose and Sony, or go for a cheaper model if you're looking to save a buck because being in this middle ground just isn't really good enough to justify the cost."
"I bought a pair of Q30s in March that I use at work. I decided to get another pair for home with hopefully better noise cancelling. I thought a newer version of headphones would have better results. These do not. In my opinion, the NC was only slightly better than having them set on “normal.”These are also supposed to connect to 2 devices and switch instantly. I had to close the Soundcore app and disconnect the headphones from Bluetooth before my other device could even recognize them.There are features on the Q30s that these either don’t have or aren’t as easy to access like various white noise sounds and turning transparency mode on.The final, and easiest, decision maker was that these became uncomfortable to wear in under an hour. Even when I first got them out of the case I thought they felt heavy."
"So after spending way too much time research noise cancelling headphones, I thought these would be right - good quality, not outrageously expensive. I needed them for both long distance air travel when I like both noise cancellation and binge-watching movies, and to cancel miserable noise from the aircon in my new office. After fiddling around getting used to the buttons etc. I found that normal and noise cancelling had the same amount of ""noise."" At some point I actually pressed the phones against my head, and voila, the noise actually was cancelled! Then I saw the reviews that mentioned loose fit. OK, rather than going to the bother of returning them, I looked for headbands that could perhaps hold the headphones closer to my ears - am waiting for those to arrive. Meantime some noise cancellation is better than no noise cancellation, so i have been wearing them in the office. Now I have a headache. I think from the weight of the headphones pressing on the top of my head. Well we shall see of the headband might help with that. So as I said, disappointed.After further research, I have decided to return the headphones and try another. Research led to the phrase ""clamping force"" as a relevant variable, and some discussions of which headphones are better for smaller heads. So will see how the next one goes."
"I really want to keep these headphones… good price, nice build quality, nice case, good sound but it feels like the “low” volume is still too high when using with my iPhone. I also use these with my PC for work and there they seem to work well (volume was initially too loud but it seems I’ve managed to get it just right on PC).Another annoying thing is the white noise. They have a pass through feature so you can hear those around you but to me it just sounds likesomeone turned on static noise at a higher volume. .. this feature sounds good but you can just remove headphones if you really need to talk to someone.I might keep these as my work headset and use something else (like AirPods) for music. Overall, I’m not finding them comfortable for listening most of the day."
"I’m a budget audiophile. I originally tried the Q30, and they fell off my head too often but I liked the sound of them for the money. Got the Q20+ attest reading that the fit was more snug and found AMAZING value for the money. The sound of them wasn’t high-end, but it was enough that I really enjoyed using them and most of the time didn’t feel like I was missing out.At over twice the price, these don’t offer better sound. Maybe all the other features are better, but those features don’t matter to me. Also the fit isn’t as secure on my head, as it’s more similar to the Q30. If you have a small head, don’t care about the battery lasting a whole week or having the best possible noise cancellation, save $60 and get the Q20+. The build of the older model feels more durable also.The space Q45s are too bright, and not any more detailed in the mids than my old Q20+. I was looking for a sound quality upgrade so I’m going with the Shure Aonic 50 instead which is $100 more but a significant upgrade from my Q20+."
I bought these headphones in February of 2024. The sound is great and the app has cool features to customize the equalizer.Fast forward to August 2024 and the headphones themselves are as fragile as an old woman with osteoporosis. Both sides of the headphones that allow you to adjust the head size have broken. They barely stayed on my head to begin with. Now they're held together with duct tape like a 1970s Winnebago.You'd think for the cost that they'd have more structural integrity than the Enterprise while fighting the Borg.
"I purchased these headphones six years ago and they had the best audio quality out of a half dozen models I tried. Now this model's audio quality has deteriorated (gotten cheaper). These are tinny (poor dynamic range at the low frequency end) compared to the last pair of six years ago. Cheaper parts, same price? No thanks. Find some other sucker. I returned these. They are now inadequate for my higher end purpose (electronic keyboard (piano) monitoring)."
"The headphones are light and come with a very long cord that you can loop to shorten, but the ear padding is to small.  After two days of using for 3-4 hours per use my ears are now sensitive to the pads.  More padding or ability to adjust inward pressure might help.  Perhaps, the problem is related to a circular ear pad vis-a-vis an oval ear pad.  I'm afraid I just might have to purchase an even more expensive headphone to get proper sizing."
"I bought a pair of Sennheiser HD 200 Pro headphones about 5 years ago, and have been using them on my computer for music, drums, and sound in general.  I happened to plug in my Bose NC700's in and the sound was a lot better - not surprising as they cost 5 times as much.  Still, I wanted to see if there was something much better in the same price range as the HD 200.  So after a little research, I tried these.  They weren't terrible, but I thought they didn't sound as good as the Sennheiser, which is priced about the same.  In particular, I thought the bass was loud and thumpy - you heard a big sound from a bass drum, but none of the definition you hear on a great pair of headphones.  So I sent these back.  You get what you pay for, but if you want to stay in this price range, the HD 200 Pro (and perhaps others) are a bit better."
"They sound great for the price. But your ears get hot, and kind of hurts over any long period of time. Recommend to just get the next model up, this one is quite the deal but for $50-75 more you'll enjoy much more."
"If you're going to be wearing these for 3+ hours, they start to irritate your ears, and make you want to re-adjust them every 3 minutes. Good quality though."
I’m looking for ear comfort- comparable to my Bose WX noise canceling Bluetooth headphones- but need wired for latency reasons. These are just too painful to wear. I’ll keep looking.
"While I was keen to hear Audio-Technica's offering in a low-cost studio monitor, the ATH-M30x unfortunately does not deliver. While the sound isolation is good, the audio quality leaves much to be desired. Specifically the bass response is so overwhelming in comparison to the mid and high ranges that it completely overwhelms and muddles the sound. If you have multiple sources of bass interacting, it loses all distinction of what is what and leaves only a pounding deep in your head. This is fine for normal every-day listening, but for studio monitors that demand a flat response, it is useless.All in all a disappointment. I went with the standard Sony MDR7506 instead, a little higher priced at $96, but with a reliable flat response."
"Bought these for Black Friday. Overall, they would have been excellent value for the sale price. Unfortunately the right headphone started giving out within 15-20 minutes of use. Tried them on several devices, same issue. So I guess defective.Pros: Really good sound! I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, while they worked. Bass has a mild thump, treble was mostly clean. Sound range (irl) is ok. The headset is very light weight. They can be turned up LOUD, so be careful! You get a nice carry pouch, 3.5mm jack with a screw-on adapter.Cons: The ear cups are small-ish and shallow, the padding inner dimensions are about 2.25"" by 1.56"", 0.68"" deep. It takes a few seconds to get them to fit 'just right' on your head, but even then I had mild pressure discomfort on my ears after only about 15 minutes of use. A review video mentioned the head band was not very tensioned, but the pair I got were very tight. Maybe that's why they caused discomfort. Also, the cable is ridiculously long and fixed, which is mentioned in the description.edit: *3.5mm jack with a screw on adapter."
"I don't know if these are the way they are because they are ""monitors"" and not usual headphones, but while sound quality is overall great, the suck at bass. Now, I'm not listening to crazy bass-heavy music, I just appreciate the full frequency of sound, and while these excel at mid-to-high frequencies, and the sound clarity is great, these drivers cannot handle decent bass and I will be returning them. I bought these because I need wired headphones for creating time lapse videos of my art, and without good bass the experience just isn't as all-encompassing. I ended up downloading an EQ plug-in for my laptop to increase bass, but then the sound distorts when I do so. I thought I had read a review that these headphones were the ""beats killer."" Whoever said that must be smoking crack, because I've owned beats headphones before, and they were significantly better. So, I'll be returning these, and buying those again to replace them."
"I was looking for a nice $50-$100 set of earcup headphones as my old pair recently broke. I chose these based on the reviews and price.So far- the good. Very lightweight-my last pair was much heavier, its easily portable, decent noise cancelling, although i actually prefer less noise cancelling - those of you who want to hear no external sound may want to look elsewhere. The range is good, lot of mid, not very bassy- nice clear sound.The bad- well for starters, I prefer headphones with a female jack so you can use your own male/male cord. I find that the cord attachment on either side is the weak point of any headset, so being able to replace the cord is a huge plus to me, but this one is permanent. Thats going to kill the lifespan of the set if, like me, you haul your headphones everywhere. Also, the cord coming to the earcup from the headband is just hanging out in the open where it passes the adjustment point, its not set in to the adjustment mechanism or protected in any way. My BF used them, and when I went to resize them to the smallest size, the free hanging cord got pinched in a loop, which you can actually see on the stock image.Thats another durability issue. Also, they grip your head very tightly. This is nice so you can look up without them falling off, but if you wear glasses, prepare to have achy ears after a while.But, i needed a decent <$100 headphones quickly and these fit the bill. They arent great, and I dont expect them to last as long as my old pair, but theyre decent, they were on sale for $40 when I got them. I think I'd be more unhappy if I paid full price."
"Sound quality is great, but if you so much as look at the plastic mold the wrong way it snaps instantly"
"I did a fair bit of research prior to this purchase and had it narrowed down to the ATH30's or a popular pair from Sony. Originally I was looking at the more popular retail models from Beats, Monster, Bose, etc but just can't see paying that kind of money for headphones. In the end I chose the ATH 30's over the sony because of the other reviews. Then I chose the 30x because it was the newer model with a few more features.You can read about the differences on your own so I won't recap it here to save time.The bottom line is that these headphones do what they say they will do BUT they did not really exceed my expectations. I was NOT blown away by the sound when I put them on. I wasn't even overly impressed. I just said 'ok, that's it?""I tried them on multiple different settings with multiple different devices and with/without amp to ensure i was giving a fair shake - no major differences.THe headphones are good but not great. I am not an audiophile, just an avg guy who likes to listen to all diff types of music. These headphones will help.I realize ATH has different models; perhaps the higher prices models would provide a more impressive sound.I like the straight cord - it's easy to use and doesn't get tangled. the 9 feet are not as bad as I feared and I can still travel with it. These do fold up for easier travel as well.I'm going to make the best of it and I'm sure these will do the job.Overall - had I 2 do it over again I would have listened to them in a store first if possible and likely would have saved the $69 here to put that money towards a more expensive/better pair."
"EDIT: Okay, I tried. I really, really tried. These things aren't terrible! Honest! Problem is... they are literally some of the most over-hyped product I have ever used.Bear with me-The build quality is great, just like I said before. Really; not a bit of flimsiness at all. They fold up nicely, the cord is good and sturdy... or so it seems- I rarely took these things out of the house; mainly I used them at my workstation as what they were intended to be used for- monitoring. One day, I sat down in my chair, grabbed my 'phones, plugged them in... and one of the audio channels was nearly-dead. It would fade in and out, so I tried messing with the fade... and nothing. I jiggled the cord- Bingo. Here's the thing... I also had to do that with a 40-plus-year-old Koss set before it kicked the bucket... which is literally the reason I wanted to try the ATs.On top of this, when they DO work, the bass is little more than a deep, disorienting rumbling in the cans- no discernible notes. The high-end is absolutely PIERCING. If that's your thing, get these. I swear, there are parts of 'Please Please Me' that I didn't even know existed before I used these. That doesn't mean it sounded good, mind you.Also, these headphones are not... too comfortable. I mean, they're fine for sitting down for a few minutes while mixing a single song, but... only that: a few minutes. Anything longer- say, a car-ride or a bit of R&R, well, it becomes taxing on the noggin... if that makes sense. They give the ol' auricle a bit of a squeeze. It isn't comfortable at all after about five minutes.Are they good? Sure. Technically, they're great. Not my cup of tea, however.I still stand my the original title of my post- It's still great for old stereos, just not for... much else._________Old review..._________The build quality and presentation of these headphones is really nice. They fold easily for storage, and it comes with a nifty bag to put it all in. Like many others, I had to use the wire-tie to shorten the cable from the headphones, but that doesn't bother me very much. What does bother me, however, is my apparent misunderstanding of the term 'flat frequency-response'. I took this as meaning that all frequencies would be equal- and I still understand it as such- however the high-end on these phones overpowers the mid- and low-range frequencies, to the point of being disorientating. I've attempted to use every EQ setting on my devices to try and quell this effect, to no avail. Are they bad headphones? Not at all. In fact, when used with a stereo receiver and the Audio-Technica AT-LP120 (through an equalizer) the sound was incredible.In the meantime, I'm going to do a bit more research on frequency-response. And possibly try and build a portable external EQ for my tablet."
The higher end version of this headphone from AT is quite superior but also alot more money this pair has good enough sound to satisfy general listeners but not for studio or critical use.
"I've had these for a year now. The sound is super good and clear. The plastic is great and overall for the price they're pretty comfy. ALL day edits will probably have your ears hurting, but for a normal work day it's pretty chill. That being said, I've had to rate this a 3 start because as you can see, the padding is cracking a lot with a year of use. With a known company like Audio Technica I'd expect them to last for a LEAST 2 years."
"So I do wish I could rate this 2.5 stars. It falls in the middle for performance. The lows are decent, the mids are excellent and the highs sound a slightly tinney. I use these mostly for mixing and recording so I do appreciate the exceptional mids. The biggest complaint I have is with the volume. They are not loud.at.all. So much so that I nearly returned them. I wouldn't use these for headphones to use with a cell phone if you like to crank it up. I ended up keeping them though for studio work."
"This product was originally phenomenal.  It was my first ""proper"" headset purchase, and it has functioned splendidly over the 3 years I've had it.  The sound quality is great, very comfortable over ears for long periods of time (listening for a full day at a time), and it feels like a solid product......that is, until I lost sound in the right ear the other day.  After some internet sleuthing, turns out that there's a known design flaw with this headset, in the right joint where the headset folds in: over time it wears down the cable in that little nook, until it causes a break and then no more music flowing into your right ear.I'm a year out of the warranty range (2 year warranty), and the cost to send it out to them and back for a fix would be close to the cost of the actual headsets themselves.  I'm going to try and MacGuyver it, but have already resigned myself to the fact that I'll need to be a new set of headphones, which is a bummer.Really disappointed, because they've been really solid up until now, and I expected more from the company.Note: not sure why volume control is something to be rated, this model (ATH-M30x) does not have a volume control as part of the wiring system."
"I mean they're nice, sure, but they aren't worth the price. Wire does not coil well and the sound is okay at best.Right ear was broken when I received it."
"These headphones have virtually no noise cancellation and they want to slam shut when you take them off.I bought these headphones because they have a longer cord than the headphones I was using with my guitar amp. However, these headphones do not cancel any of the outside noise."
"Well, sad to say that the headphones didn't last very long. These headphones produced great sound and I actually used them to mix my songs. They were perfect but one side stopped working. You have to take them off every so often as they make your ears hurt after a while of wearing them. They are not the best but they got the job done. I feel like I kind of wasted my money on these.Quick Update: I am assuming the right side has a short or the whole entire headphone cable has a short. It now works sometimes then sometimes it makes a crackling sound. I checked connections and made sure everything is connected properly. I wanted to also say that I am very gentle and cautious with these headphones. So just hope and pray you don't get a bad pair I guess."
"Since many others have already posted detailed reviews which I mostly agree with, I'll highlight one issue that made me rate this headphone as 3 stars.  It's absolutely a pain to wear for more than 2 hours.  I've used all sorts of headphones, and always preferred over-ear style because of my extended listening sessions.  I once listened to Hybrid - Finished Symphony on repeat for 8 hours on Sennheiser HD570 without any fatigue.  I've had a wide range of headphones, and this M30x is by far the most uncomfortable headphone I've ever used. If your ears are very flat and close to your head, it probably isn't an issue.  For me with average ears (no, I don't have elf ears), I can't sit through a 2 hour movie because the tips of my ears become so painful that I'm constantly trying to find odd ways of wearing it on my head just so I can finish the movie.  Even the cheap HD 429 were far more comfortable than the M30x, as were the on-ear Beats Mixr.  Now, that's saying a lot.The sound quality is great for the price, especially when you can find it for under $40 from Amazon Warehouse for ""like new"" condition, as I did.  I bought these cans because it's closed design and I needed something cheap to wear on my long flights to/from Asia. It obviously did not meet my needs, and will be selling these.On last note, the sound quality is much, much better with even a cheap headphone amp.  Depending on the device, the M30x can sound muddy, with boomy bass overpowering the mids (even on my Alienware M14x R2 with Sound Blaster).  I'm currently listening to Pendulum as I write this review, driven by a USB DAC + Headphone amp which literally makes the headphone sound like a completely different model."
"Really??? Not so BRAND NEW as the price I paid for them. I just watched an unboxing video on YouTube for clarity and simply to make sure I wasn't tripping but thank God they work! I literally just opened them, plugged them into my bass amp and gave them a quick listen. I can already tell that I like them and they sound great but yeah...I'm just upset that they're not BRAND NEW as promoted. Hate to sound like a cheapskate but I could've saved a few bucks for some that were already used lol. Times are hard now and days but nevertheless, they're a good buy for the price"
"this headset would be good for the price point if it did not hurt my ears and head with no relief no matter the adjustment. I instantly started hearing vibrations within the headset with people even simply talking, and within 10 months only the left side works. Cheap but ineffective."
"The headphones are comfortable to wear. They also do a good job in cancelling the outside noise to a degree; you will still hear what's going on around you, but you won't hear the AC or the heater or the hums in the background once you put them on. I am using this to study in cafes, but I have to put mid-volume music on in order to completely block people's voices. I am also using it to edit my the audio tracks of my videos for a class: Video I. They are good for that job also. However, I don't think I needed this level of professionalism to edit my audios because it is only a beginner class. If you are only buying because you want to do beginner level editing, you can find cheaper options, but if you want to continue editing these headphones are good for that. Although I found the LONG cord pretty annoying, that is me neglecting the description though. But I still recommend wireless headphones, no tangling, no trying to get the cord under the chair, no need to worry about the long thing that keeps hitting your arm when you want to just walking around with your headphones on at the park, just pay extra 10 dollars and get the wireless option, it'll be worth it."
"When I bought this I was hoping it would be more comfortable than the OneOdio headphones I had previous. I wanted just as good if not better sound as well as comfort. I was very disappointed in comfort. the cup is smaller than my ear by just enough to make my head and ears hurt after 1 hour of usage. after 6 hours I had to take them, after I took them off and I was sensitive to the touch on my ears and head. I questioned if I just had big ears or a big head so I let my 7 year old son wear them and after 1 hour of gaming he complained about same thing. I fixed it by taking the pads off of my corsair headset and made them fit (hot glue) and now I can wear them all day with no pain. Fix those pads, they are bad. TBH the sound was just as good as OneOdio though if not slightly less bass but the build quality is much better with these. I will not be buying more of these, but I am actively looking"
"The Headphone look nice, but it’s definitely cheaply made also auto wise it’s just too low. It’s not loud and there’s not even a mic. These Headphones aren’t worth the money or time."
"I have had these headphones for a year, using them to listen to music on my iPad and iPhone as well as on my computer and also plugged into my stereo receiver. My music tastes are those of a 62 year old eclectic, from classic rock to classical.  First, what I like: solid, clear, sound, fairly deep bass response for the price/quality, long cord, and the comfort as they fit over my ears. They are quite decent headphones, but...After extended use there are several things I don't care for. The folding earcups are awkward every time I unfold them! They are made so they collapse into an 8""X8"" carrying bag, but that means they need to have several hinges, and there lies the frustration. They don't unfold and fall into place naturally or consistently; I have to fiddle with them every time. This second objection is purely personal, but if I were to buy headphones again, I would get open rather than closed back cans. These get hot on my ears and I have to take them off after about an hour's listening. If you don't have hot ears, maybe you won't mind this issue, but for me it is a problem after using them for awhile."
"I bought these in early July 2015. At first, I was pretty excited and they worked pretty well for the price.Pros:-great sound for price-very comfortable-durable-long chord-compatibleCons:-the sound now cuts out if the chord isn't in the perfect position-mids get kind of drowned out sometimes-get pretty hot if you wear them for a long time (4+ hours)-just a tad bulkyOverall, a great pair of headphones for sixty bucks. I didn't think that I would need it then, but I should've also gotten a metal coil to protect the base of the chord. If I could, I would return them and get the 40x or 50x but I guess I'm kind of stuck with these until I have enough money. If I were you, I would spend a little extra money on the 50x. They sound a lot clearer and are worth the price. Plus, you probably won't feel the need to replace them for a long time. My brother has had his for a good three years and they're a bit torn up on account of not keeping them protected but they still sound amazing and are very comfortable (and they look cooler).Hope I helped!"
"I bought these because I needed some comfortable headphones that go AROUND the ear, rather than on top of it. These fit the bill on that front. They're extremely comfortable, so I was bummed that the sound quality was so inconsistent. I attend a lot of remote meetings and had been using some wireless earbuds, which aren't very comfortable after long hours in a warmish room and on ear headphones cause a lot of pain for me at the tip of my ears. I got these last night and swapped out my earbuds for these in between meetings. I could barely hear half of the people and ended up having to switch back to my previous earbuds. I also bought these under the impression that they were closed back and would therefore prevent some external noise from seeping in. That was not the case for me and this was just in my home office.Again, they're extremely comfortable. I like that they are so lightweight and fold up nicely. The cord seems nice and heavy duty. I think as long as you know what you're buying for (ie NOT a situation like what I just described), they may work better for you."
"Overall they are just headphones. Nothing to write home about.  I will note that they are not comfortable to wear. Ear cups are not soft as other brands I own.  Also, the collapsible design makes putting them on annoying because you have to adjust the ear cups each time you put them on.  Sound quality is flat."
"Unfortunately, these headphones get extremely uncomfortable to the point where they're physically painful and unwearable.I'd imagine it's a bit different for each individual's ear shape, but for me it's unbearable after around 3 hours of use (and I need to wear them for up to 6 hours at a time for my job). Before this point the headphones are actually very comfortable. It's just that the pain gradually increases over time.The issue is the circle of foam is too shallow to have the inner part hover over your ear, so it ends up pressing against your cartilage (the specific part is where you'll find pain is known as the ""antihelix"").I don't know much about sound quality but it seemed pretty great. The noise cancellation was awesome as well.I'd only recommend these headphones if you're wearing them for a shorter amount of time.If you'll only use these headphones for less than 2 hours or so I'd recommend buying these, otherwise go find headphones that are comfortable enough to wear longer."
had these for like 2 weeks and they already breaking :( sound great tho
"I bought these and the  Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone        at the same time to face off as my first good, headphone purchase.  (I tried the  Monoprice 108323 Premium Hi-Fi DJ Style Over-the-Ear Pro Headphone, Black        a few months back, but the lack of headband padding gave me a headache.)  I compared the M30x and the 7506s to my cheap headphones that I've been using for 3 1/2 years,  Philips Rich Bass Neckband Headphones SHS5200/28 (Replaces SHS5200)        .While the M30x's were comfortable and had a good range of sound, the sound profile wasn't great.  The uppers were a bit tinny at times and the low-mids were muddy.  I actually thought, even though I couldn't hear as much range, that the Philips had a much better overall sound profile.The M30x's build quality is good, but--due to a lot of plastic--don't seem like they'd last as long as the 7506s.Needless to say, I'm keeping the Sony MDR-7506 headphones and I returned these.  Spend a bit more and get a bit better headphones.  It is totally worth it."
"CHEAP CHINESE CRAP , NO LOWS .I HAVE A METAL DETECTOR HEADPHONES THAT BLOW THESE AWAY"
disappointed.. sound not clear
"I was happy with them while they lasted, but they didn't last long."
"These things sound great, they are extremely comfortable, but it not handled with extreme care will break. The plastic construction is rather brittle, with mine breaking within a few weeks. They slid off my desk, landed about 2-3 feet down on carpet and broke. In comparison I have a pair of Beyer Dynamics with a metal band that have served me well for over 10 years now. These fantastic headphones are only let down by poor material choices and construction."
Purchased this set a few years ago and did a repurchase assuming I would be getting the same headphones. The mic is gone. The volume slider control is gone. They are acompletely different style now. My older headphones were a bit bulkier which wasnt as good but im sad at the loss of features. $70 is not worth it for these now. Id pay $70 if i had a mic and volume slider again.
"I'm on my 3rd pair of these because they randomly tend to just stop working for some reason. Maybe the external cable is easily damaged? Or it isn't meant to use while sweating (making it useless for drum recording)? Either way, they're incredibly effective studio monitoring headphones (when they work), more than decent for mixing (when they work) and easy to get used to. I've used dozens of different headphones in the studio and keep buying these for everyday sessions because they're inexpensive yet still sound and fit better than a lot of the pricier headphones.Hey Audio-Technica...anybody want to explain why they might randomly stop working? I love using them and would be thrilled if I can fix the ones that don't work anymore."
"These headphones sounds amazing. I will never be able to wear another pair of earbuds or headphones again. However, after about a month of use the aux cord would not stay in any plug I tried. Not an Xbox controller, not my pc, not my phone. It would wiggle so slightly that it wasn't even noticeable, but the sound would cut out and I would have to go back to spotify and press play again. But as soon as I laid a finger on the device, the sound would cut out again. This made the headphones absolutely unusable. I would expect far greater quality from this brand, but perhaps I am wrong. I suppose it's possible that I just got a bad unit, but If I had, It would've been noticeable immediately."
Great for games and home theater. Too much mid scoop for production purposes. High frequency is a bit harsh. Bass is clean and big. Ear fatigue is possible vs the 40 series which is easier on your ears.
"Just thought I would add my voice to the complaints of those who had their headphones just stop working one day.  It looks like there was no protection for the cord in the crease where the ear pieces bend up into the headband for storage.Mine broke after two years of use... which isn't good for lightly used headphones which i never packed.  I imagine just the bouncing around eventually caused the failure in the cord to the earpiece which ended their life (the cord is clearly severed in the bend).Until they died they were great crisp flat sound for the price, but I won't be buying Audio-Technica again after this issue."
"For the price, I have been pleased with these headphones. After just 18 months of only occasional use, I was less than pleased to find that one of the earpad cushions has developed a crack over an inch long. A pair of replacement OEM cushions, or 3rd party units of like quality, cost in the $25 range, more than 1/3 the price of the headphones. For now, I'll live with the cracked cushion until it gets significantly worse."
The sound is just ok for music but they do well for movies. Less than 2 weeks the ear cup fell off. I do not recommend these and think you can do better.
I used these for listening to music. And plugged them into my Focusrite 2i2 for studio work. I was using a seperate adapter and then started using the one that came with the headphones because of the screw on advantage. The adapter was bent inside and broke my headphones. Dissapointed.
"I used to have a pair of ATH-MX50's before and a piece of the right ear cup broke eventually and the headphones wouldn't stay on my head.I bought these ATH-MX30's in hopes of them lasting a few years at least. Well, just over a year after I bought them, they don't fully function anymore. The right ear provides no sound at all now- I'm guessing it might be due to a severed or weak wire somewhere, but I'm not a professional. Could it be cheap wiring? I'm not sure. While I did use these almost every day, I never really handled these roughly or threw them around carelessly. Regardless, I don't think I'd purchase this brand again- it's not worth the risk to me.The headphones are quite comfortable if you can pick up alternate ear cups, which I did, and would recommend. But if the headphones don't work, what's the point?"
"I bought these headphones back in 2016. I'd rank the audio quality as good to excellent. The bass was tight and deep without sounding artificially boomy or muddy. The mid-range was rich and well-defined, with vocals coming through clearly. The highs sparkled without sounding harsh or sibilant. I listen to a lot of acoustic jazz and classical, and these headphones made the experience enjoyable.So why the one star rating? These headphones have a fatal design flaw that will eventually render one or both drivers inoperable if the earcups are collapsed for storage. When the earcups are folded up into the headband, the cords leading to the drivers are bent at an extremely sharp angle at the elbow. There is no slack in the cords to accommodate the flexing, and over time, with repeated collapsing and extending, they eventually fracture. The right driver of my unit failed first when its cord broke at the elbow; the cord leading to the left driver was starting to give, but had not yet completely separated.Audio Technica's two year warranty was useless as the headphones failed just outside the two year window, and they wanted me to pay for any costs associated with repairing them. I didn't think it was worth paying for the repair as the cords would eventually fracture again due to the inherent design flaw. I just tossed the unit into the trash. A shame, as they sounded good when they worked."
"When used at medium to high volume on my piano, you can notice a crackling on the left side speaker.. will never buy these again.. go for higher quality items"
"This is my first pair of actually nice headphones and while I can say that they do sound good, the cable length and discomfort these headphones have keep them from being amazing. The cable is way too big for anyone wanting to use these on the go so you better have some cable ties to bundle up a ton of cable awkwardly. Also for me, these hurt like heck after only an hour since the cushions are shallow and mashes your ears against the drivers. I also was hoping these would cancel noise since my roommates can be loud and these do barely any of the such, meaning that I have to crank up my audio crazy loud to drown out the surrounding noise."
The good: Sounds fine but I've had some hearing loss so I can no longer accurately judge that. They are comfortable. The cord is long enough. They do a fair job of blocking outside sounds.The bad: It takes two hands to put them on. The ear muffs flop around backwards and also up towards the headband when you pick them up and begin to spread them . It takes too much fiddlin' with to reorient them into the correct position for wearing before you put them on.
"Wanted to purchase the m50s but couldn't afford to. All and all I would suggest saving for a better model than this.  These sound decent and are a good entry headphone but do not really do the job for me. These have nice highs and OK mids but the lows are muddy and lack power. Headphones themselves are fairly well made but always fold up when you don't want them to and will eventually give a headache because they are far to tight. All and all I wished I saved my money and bought the 50s, I have used them before and find them fair more comfortable than these. For the price I got these for I can't complain a whole lot just would have wanted more."
"what on earth is that rattle? solo that shaker track again. yeah, there it is! wait, solo the piano track. there it is again. wha? i'm trying to edit this song, but i keep...  ohhh, it happens when i move my head. ohh, there's something shaking around in the headphones. ohh, it's been more than 30 days; returning not an option. well, this is highly distracting, so where's the mini philips screwdriver?oh, this little axle piece has a cotter pin-type piece to keep it from sliding out. oh, it's rattling around. on both sides. oh, that's poorly designed. superglue to the rescue.these sound really good for general editing and recording. bass-heavy, yes. but use real studio monitor phones for mixing/mastering. these are otherwise comfy and reliable. just order some superglue too."
So these headphones are not even a year old yet and the ear pads are already cracked. I have had way cheaper headphones last much longer. I guess i will try to get them fixed under warranty.
"So I bought these to spin some vinyl and they kinda disappointed but maybe it’s cause I love bass and my record player reads the vinyl unlike processed music on Spotify or ITunes, etc.I plan to use them for video editing and audio engineering class in college so I’ll update if I change my mind. They’re not horrible just not what I expected."
"The sound quality is outstanding and the headband doesn't exert too much pressure. However, the ear cups are very shallow. I don't think I have larger than average ears (maybe I do!?) and they don't fit comfortably within the ear cups. After a while it becomes clear that at my ears are being pushed down and I need to take them off to keep them from getting too painful. It looks like these are getting ebayed (I think I've waited too long, trying to work it out with them) and I'm going to look for some headphones with similar sound quality that don't hurt to wear.I guess 4.5 stars for sound quality 2 stars for comfort (for me."
"Studio or monitoring headphones tend to be a flatter sound and ideal for monitoring or mixing music yourself. Regular headphones have a better bass & treble range, hence a more pronounced sound highs & lows. There is nothing wrong with these, as quite a few pros have given them a high mark. If you're looking for a more complete sound, then get headphones that are not studio or monitoring Sony enhanced bass phones are a great choice."
"All in all,  these are pretty nice headphones. But if you are using them for professional sound editing/recording, they aren’t as good as they used to be. I got a pair about five years ago that sound hundreds of times better when I listened side-by-side with these new M 30 that I just ordered. So sad… They think we won’t notice? Why?!  They were so excellent before… Now the high frequencies seem thin and the base muffles the subtle details… Bummer."
"In the beginning it was pretty tight on my head and gave me a headache so I placed it on a box for a couple days to stretch it and now it's getting a bit better. The audio quality is pretty mediocre leaning towards poor. The vocals are far from clear and are kind of weak, there is little to no bass and the volume isn't very high. I bought this pretty much because all the more advanced expensive AT headphones don't deliver to my country and wasn't expecting anything special for this price but for a company like AT this is very low quality in my opinion. I don't know what to do with them but I just don't see myself adapting to this audio quality. I just can't enjoy my music with these and I feel very confused on whether or not to buy something else especially online. I'm lowkey pissed because the only thing I thought I'd have a problem with is the long cable which I was already aware of and ready to deal with. Wouldn't recommend for anybody planning to use them for music."
"There are better quality headphones in this price range, keep looking. I bought these to replace a set of AKG K619s I've been wearing for nearly 4 years. I travel extensively, and my AKGs finally craked along the case just above where the earpiece is. Outline of issues with these Audio-Technicas: - Sound quality sucks compared to my AKGs. It was noticeable the second I pressed play on my phone. Very canny, tinny sound. Adjusting EQ on my phone did not help. - Cheaply made. My AKGs are mostly aluminum, with some plastic. These Audio-Technicas are ALL plastic, with exception to the spring steel used to keep them tight on your head (cased in plastic). - While they fold a little, they don't fold enough to be what I would consider portable. These would take up half my briefcase. - The cable is laughably long. Why do I need four feet of cable? My phone typically is in my pocket while I listen to music. I'm not sitting across a room. I'd strangle myself or someone else trying to board a plane with this much cable dangling about.I literally temporarily fixed my AKGs with electrical tape, and returned these Audio-Technicas. We'll see how long the tape holds, but I'd rather wear my janky taped together AKGs than use the Audio Technica cans."
These are very good headphones for the price.I really wanted to give 3 1/2 stars but no such thing.An improvement I would make is to have more soft padding in the ear pads.I also would like a tension adjustment for the spring pressing the ear pads against my head.I work all day with earphones at work and at home I don't need a high degree of pressure.I really don't want to risk torquing the spring or breaking them to make the pressure less.The sound quality is very good for the price.
"These are pretty awesome.Pros:-Excellent base response. You get all the lows.-Excellent treble.-Very Comfortable.-Good noise canceling.Cons:-The bass is good but there is too much bass. It's similar to Beats headphones. For some this may be a ""pro"" but for me its not as this is just not an accurate reproduction of the sound. Also, I don't think that is good for your hearing.-The biggest con for me was that the mid range sounded off. The vocal range seemed a bit distant. Like the mid range was turned down. The snares also seemed a bit light. The lower range of the snares and vocals was missing."
"I am not a professional audiophile, that being said, I am disappointed in these headphones. Cnet gave them the highest rating for the price range, but I don't know what makes them so good.The good: Seem to be made of high quality materials, especially the cord.  The headphones themselves look amazing!!The bad:  Bass.  There's no bass.  The mid-range, and treble sound pretty nice.  However, when it comes to bass, these headphones sound cheap.  I am comparing these to Sennheiser HD 202.Overall, I am disappointed because of the sound quality.  I wish I could return them, but I threw the box away."
"Bought one pair, the headphones ended up snapping in one joint spot and I figured it might have been because I hadn't been handling them well and I had them for some months so I bought another pair since I liked how they felt and sounded. My second pair just snapped in the SAME EXACT SPOT! THE SAME JOINT! It's the cheap plastic. On the left headphone, there is a joint right above the headphone that is only connected by a small amount of non-durable, non-bendable plastic, so because of that the headphones can snap at that joint after a bit of wear. I only had the second pair for four months. DO NOT BUY IF YOU WILL BE USING THEM A LOT. THEY ARE NOT DURABLE. THEY ARE HELD TOGETHER BY CHEAP PLASTIC.Research this if you want. Look up the M30x and the M40x. They both have this problem. I circled the hinge for you in my image. If you see any Audio-Technica headphones with this hinge DO NOT BUY THEM!"
"I bought this bundle to use for PC gaming and sound-wise they are great. Music sounded good and sounds in the game were also very good, and the mic that came with it also worked well (much better than expected actually). Sadly I am returning these though because they became extremely uncomfortable. I had these for about 3 days and was hoping that it just took some getting used to but the ear cups are so shallow that my ears actually touch the drivers, and because they are closed headphones and push more against my head, it makes my ears hurt (and really hot) after only 30 minutes of use."
"Upgraded to these from Sony MDR-ZX310, both build quality and audio quality were much improved. Sound is clear and crisp, though tended to emphasize mid-frequencies at the expense of bass and treble. Can get pretty warm around the ears within an hour or so of sustained use. I would give this product 4 stars, if not for its unexpected and premature failing. After about 6 months of daily use, the sound abruptly went dead in the left earcup. Was disappointing, considering its numerous favorable reviews and professional studio monitor moniker."
"These sound amazing for the price.  I like how you don’t get much sound leak coming in when you’re wearing them. I’ve been using them regularly for about 15 month and I have some complaints. The fake leather surrounds are already cracking and falling apart, which I’m not sure how easy those will be to replace. And the cable is pretty cheap. It gets horribly tangled in itself and twisted  after unrolling it. Holds that shape and constantly gets in your way. Honestly was expecting more."
"The sound quality is great, definitely noise cancelling but they've just been sitting in corner and I've barely used them because the cord is just so so so long. I wanted good quality headphones with a cord that I could use for DJing as well as everyday listening. I've had them for 3 months now but have used them about 3 times, wish I returned them when I could. I finally just ended up braiding the cord today but it's pretty cumbersome. Not very functional for everyday use being out and about."
"Okay sound quality.  Bass is adequate and treble is fine, volume gets very loud also.  Long listening sessions will KILL your ears. These ear cups, although are ""over the ear"", lay very close to the ear itself and press down very hard. Space between the cushion and the driver is pretty poor.  If you are looking for a budget set of headphones they are good for the price but just keep the other factors in mind"
"The sound was good, the equipment solid however the headphones became uncomfortable within less than 1/2 hour and I opted for the JVC HARX500 which when tested side-by-side didn't sound any different to me and the comfort was vastly better. Since I wear these to block out sound as well as to hear the TV while others watch or listen to something else, it's imperative that they be comfortable for long hours. These didn't do the job for me but were genuinely quality headphones for someone else with other needs. The have a heavier cord than the JVC's however that can be either a boon or a drag. I sent these back."
"very VERY overhyped... they are good for the price but it's basically ""you get what you pay for"". i compared them to my brother's pair of beats and we both agreed the beats sounded better. They have about as much bass as a pair of $20 headphones + the highs are a bit low... so if you want more of that look for something else.  I know bass isn't everything and I've produced music for over 6 years and left slightly disappointed. if you can afford it try buying something better"
"having owned these for almost 6 months, i'm confident that i can leave a well informed review. the reason i give a 2 star rather than a 1 star is because they do work as intended. they are indeed headphones you can hear music from. and they seem to be of solid construction. however, the quality of the music is another thing all together.i have a 20 dollars pair of creative earbuds i bought around 4 or 5 years ago that sound much better. as a mid level audiophile, i like hearing all the ranges of my music. lows, mids, and highs. the earbuds outperform these headphones on every level. bottom line. save yourself some money and buy some 20$ Creative EP-630 Earphones. i can't speak for how they're made now, but my old pair sound amazing."
"These headphones are a mixed bag for me. The sound is good and I like the naturally flat mix that Audio Technica provides but the ear cups don't fit comfortably over my ears. I don't think I would be able to wear them for over an hour. Also, the soud isolation is lackluster compared to other headphones I've had."
"These headphones are not worth the price. They’re very good if you want to listen to mids, but the highs and bass is not loud at all. Noise cancellation is okay, but overall I wasn’t impressed. They become very uncomfortable in about 2 hours of wearing them and the frame doesn’t feel sturdy and efficient."
"The earphones didn't work at all. unfortunately, I tried it just few months after receiving so refund wasn't available. Don't know what the problem was till now"
"Granted, I have a gargantuan melon head. But the tightness of these headphones combined with the closed back style made for unwanted pressure on my ear drums while listening. Not to mention, since they are so tight, when taking them off your head you must use two hands or risk each ear cup snapping into each other. Sound quality is great, but I will be returning them :("
"I got these for my son. He is fairly gentle with his belongings. Despite that, these headphones broke, and he had to tape them back together to keep them on his head. Eventually, they were unusable. Very disappointing. Poor quality materials."
"Did not last more than a year without the headphone cushions cracking, very clunky design. I've bought cheap Chinese bluetooth headphones with similar or even better audio quality that have lasted longer."
I had heard good things about these and compared specs and on paper they should sound alot better than my g433 headset and they don't even come close. I did all the EQ and settings in windows and different youtube setups that I could and still bleh. Everything sounds flat and the only thing that I don't have available is to try at this point is with an amp but you shouldn't need one with these which is why I got them over the m50x. Oh well.
"Not impressed. I keep wanting the sound quality to be better coming out of these headphones and it just is not. They also get uncomfortable for me after about 10-15 minutes. Maybe this is the best you can do in this price range but I don't think so. The sound to me is dull and flat, almost to the point of it being annoying to listen to music through these. They have not broken yet, so that is why I gave them three stars..."
The sound is ok... nothing real special.  My only gripe is the cord is so damn long.  Thankfully I just use these in my bedroom at night to watch TV / movies.  If I had to use these out in the wild the cord would seriously drive me bonkers.  It would always be in the way and wrapping it up only makes it very heavy if you are standing and it's not tucked into your pocket or something.
"I'm sad to say, these headphones are actually worse than the iPhone earbuds for the midrange frequencies i.e. for listening to human voices.The reason is simply that while the M30X have excellent high-frequency clarity, only fading out at 13.5kHz, the mid-range frequencies are not only weak but they are muddled and muffled.You could even say the midrange is distorted a bit.So if you're going to be listening to humans singing, they're no good.If you're going to listen to birds singing, they're fine.But this level of quality doesn't justify the price.Regarding the problem of the sound cutting out momentarily, as other reviewers have mentioned, I did experience that once too."
"I’ve stuck by this brand since 2016. Bought a new pair in 2017 and then again in January of 2019.As of today, December 3rd, 2019...that pair just up and decided to stop working.  I do AM Drive on a local radio station and they survived that shift, but under 4 hours later when I went to record some copy, they just stopped. Nothing seems damaged and I’m am annoyingly meticulous with my gear and they’re in fine shape. Less than a year of owning them and I’m in the market for another pair.I love them, but Audio-Technica...you guys are testing my loyalty limits."
They are so uncomfortable in my opinion they have a extremely tight grip and have hardcore leather earpads that have no breathing room. I used these headphoned for a solid 5 days and every day I have thinking about how uncomfortable they were.
"I've had these about 3 days and I am not impressed.  To start, these aren't that comfortable with a grip on the head that is best described as vise like.  A studio professional that is taking these on and off frequently will not mind, but someone trying to listen for lengthy period, like an album or two or a movie might find the pressure too much.  Yet the biggest problem is the sound quality particularly in the low end.  The bass tends to be rather muddy and overly emphasized somewhere near 500hz.  The mids and highs are acceptably clean.  A professional trying to do a mix should definitely not use these, and anyone else will need to keep the low end in mind and adjust the EQ accordingly."
"Not enough bass, for games like battelfield where their audio engine is one of the top features- these feel like they dont deliver. Unless they have software i have yet to install, but out of the box, the base just isnt there."
"Mix on these are rather low, and not studio quality"
"These headphones feel a bit cheap, but you get what you pay for. They serve their purpose."
great headphones.you dont even need to wear them if u have some kind of amplifier.that is what these headphones are made for.So if u dont think they are loud it is because these headphones are STUDIO HEADPHONES.There is a little bit of rattle in my left headphone when i shake my head.These headphones should be called headphones/monitors.5 out of 5.UPDATE: After 6 months the right side ear is not working.I really dont like the wires. I think that is why the right side stopped working.It might be the exposed wires on the headphones.3 out of 5 after 6 months
"I am a writer and use these for sourcing audio.  The second time I used them, they stopped working.  The wires appear to be loose inside where the cord meets the pin.  There is not any visible damage from the outside.  But if the cord gets bumped or moved, the sound stops working until you move it around again and establish a connection for 2 seconds.  I have tried twice through amazon to contact their customer service and they don't answer their phone.  It's a lot of money to spend on a one time use product.  Please save your money and buy another brand.  All i wanted to do was exchange for a working pair.  Refurbished would have been fine as I suspect they must have a lot of those with this level of defects.  Walk away and buy a different brand.  Manufacturers that don't stand behind their products don't deserve repeat business."
"Not for studio recording. Not for Music Production. Not a bad pair of headphones to use when making music on the go but the word ""Professional"" should most definitely be left out of the title. I purchased these because I compared specs to Koss and Sony, they appeared to be very similar. Went with Audio-Technica brand because my turntable is Audio-Technica and it's awesome."
Great sound for just listening to portable tv and dvd player...one cord from ear rather than 2 is great...less knots...carrying case bag is great protection while traveling...can't think of a negative. ..update...my husband used these headphones at dialysis 3xweek...heavy usage...the connector eventually bent and only one ear received sound...i thought he was just too rough and ordered a pair for myself for airplane use...they worked fine until the second trip...the person next to me got up and brushed past my connector and bent it...i straightened it out but again only one ear received sound...i will be looking for a different headphone set for my next airplane trip...the connector just does not seem heavy duty at all...
I was really excited to get this item but was disappointed when it came in without a box and smelling like cigarettes. Sound quality is pretty good but it’s not so good to know my “NEW” item has been open and possibly used.
These headphones have fine sound but just a few notes:-This wire is exceptionally long and not for commuters/moving around at all. the wire on this model is not replaceable.-These headphones do fit very tightly around my head and give me a headache after 1.5 hrs+ of listening.-The sound seems good but i am not an audiophile.
"Purchased this version of ATH-M30x ""deluxe bundle"" because I commute regularly and was anticipating that they come with the hard carrying case that is advertised in the product picture, but not advertised in the normal ATH-M30x listing. The product picture is misleading and DOES NOT INCLUDE THE CARRYING CASE PICTURED, but rather the soft carrying case included in the pictures of the basic listing. The mic advertised is not in-line, but rather a separate product that requires another jack to plug into. The picture is false advertising, in my opinion. Save yourself 10 dollars unless you really need the mic, but make sure you have a separate jack to plug into, and be prepared for two wires.The headphone sound quality is good."
"Sound quality is nice, but they aren't very loud. I would have maybe rated them higher, but the 3.5mm jack does not fit into my S7 while it is in a phone case due to the grooves for the larger jack piece that twists off. Granted, these are studio headphones therefore I should have checked into that prior to purchasing. They are rather comfortable though."
"Seems like a good model, but after 2nd year of use  started to produce squeaks when you record (move your mouth) with them, which can be heard on your recording. I think it's pricy for this quality. They look good though, but it's worthless now because of these squeaks."
"I like design and fit. However the Volume is not very powerful . So if that's what you are looking for,don't buy. For general listening they are good.Just average sound,cheap quality speakers. Nothing like high end headphones."
"For a set of ""wired"" headphones the sound is fine. Nothing special in my opinion though. Standard grade wire(it will go bad eventually). Construction feels a little cheap and flimsy. I wouldn't get too rough with them. I feel ""Professional"" should be taken out of the name."
"There was a weird feedback on the line when I plugged this into my PC that would cause it to echo ambient noise over my speakers, as if it had a built in microphone when it doesn't.Also, odd behavior when I plug it into a mobile phone, as this feedback causes the phone to treat it like a headset rather than headphones. The electrical impulses received over the headphone jack would cause erratic behavior on the phone like arbitrary key presses and commands to apps and the OS.Finally, if you sweat AT ALL while wearing these expect them to smell really bad within a month or two. There's really no way to clean the pads other than wiping them off, and the cloth that covers the speakers are this hyper absorbent foam that is just a haven for bacteria. These are 100% not to be used as workout headphones."
Terrible headphones! No volume control on them and they do not put out music at a good sound level. Had .y volume maxed out and was nowhere near loud enough. Maybe a 1/4 of the sound coming out. I am returning immediately
"I needed a portable headset to replace my old Creative Labs WP 350 Bluetooth headset that I'd been using for years. I liked the WP 350; it was small, light, and had surprisingly good bass. But the fabric had started wearing off and the connection point where the right speaker was broken and so that side would swivel freely. I hated to let it go but it was time. Because the headset would be traveling back and forth to work and home, it needed to be portable and needed to be decent for online meetings. I was not as concerned about music sound quality. And knowing this set would take heavy use I didn't want to risk going too expensive.Pros- Sound is decent to good. Not great, but more than sufficient.- The FM tuner is a bonus. It works fine for me, though a lot depends on the quality of the signal and where you're sitting. It is handy if I want to listen to the radio.- The set folds up and comes with a carrying case. It's not as compact when stowed as I wanted, but it's smaller than my Cowin E8 set.- Bluetooth performance is fine, it paired without issue.- The included case and lanyard are handy.- All necessary cables are included.- Build is of sufficient quality. It's not going to handle mistreatment well, but normal use should be fine.- Although this is not meant to be a noise-canceling set, the speakers fit snugly around your ear and do reduce a little of the ambient noise. Unfortunately I could still hear some voices and louder noises.Cons- I don't care for the controls. It's four buttons and a power switch. One button controls the mode (FM, Bluetooth) and that's fine. I don't like that the volume buttons double as radio station scan buttons. You have to short hold to advance or reverse the radio seek, and long hold to change the volume. It's very hard to get precise volume control this way. In addition, the four buttons feel identical to the touch, which makes it harder to navigate them when worn as you can't see the buttons. Not a great design.- The microphone works but the microphone aperture is tiny so I have to speak loudly to communicate in online meetings. I may see if I can open it up a bit with some careful application of a hobby knife. If your main use is for communicating in meetings, I would actually suggest a set with a better mic placement.If your needs are modest, and your budget even more modest, you can do all right with this headset."
I bought them for an elderly lady who wanted to listen to music without bluetooth. So I bought her these and they work. But they are sensitive and the sound is low and the bluetooth makes it sound lower. The mic doesn’t pick up sound as well as I’d like but they are for music. The cord does not support 3 prong mic ports just the two prong sound only so the mic only works on bluetooth. The battery lasts at least a 3 hour plane ride. Hinges are not very durable so putting them away too often will eventually break the hinges. The rose color she loved it and made her smile. Not bad not great but worth it the only complaint is the file type. I had to rip off cds into mp3 and use old windows media player to make a playlist that would play in sequence otherwise it was random.
Could not connect to mobile phone. Could not connect them to tv by Blue tooth.  Have not been able to use them yet. Hope they work with the airplanes entertainment systems for the 4 long flights we have booked for next year.
"I went through 3 brands (this was the 2nd) before finding the right pair of headphones for my needs. For me, the headphones have one purpose only, which is to play music during my workouts. Therefore, I cannot comment on the phone features for this product. I have gone from in ear to over ear due to the poor selection of choices for wireless mp3 players. For my purposes, I needed to have a pair with an SD card slot, because I am rather particular about my music, and do not have my phone with me during workouts... because I am there to work out! I've searched... and searched, none of the higher end headphones offer this feature.So, the comfort was decent. The sound quality was good. It is a dramatic difference going from an in-ear device to over the ear, even with cheaper models. Also, these come with a hard-shell travel case, which is also nice. Overall, I really cannot complain too much for the cost. I used these for 1 workout at a moderate volume. What was the problem? This pair of headphones literally felt like they were going to fall apart from the strain of very light use. I would not have been surprised if the unit was in pieces when I removed it. However, this is a better choice than the PowerLocus brand, which is essentially the same thing, but with the added problem of having buttons that are so close together, it is impossible to tell what you are pressing without taking them off and looking at it. That was the first brand I purchased. I ended up with the Bluedio T2, which has all the same features, including the SD card, of course. It looks and feels much more comfortable and higher quality. The Bluedio is a bit more expensive, and you must buy the travel case separately, but in my opinion it is well worth the extra, and it looks better too."
The headphones are good  for listening yo music but when you get a call it’s hard for the person to hear you and it’s hard to hear the person.
Doesn’t drop Bluetooth signal and has great sound. The mic is the only reason I gave it 3 stars. People can barely hear me and say I sound very muffled.
"I’ve had these headphones in pink and were great, I got them in purple and there’s issues all the sudden. Sometimes they won’t connect, sometimes they won’t stay connected. The charging cable is really short and most of the time it won’t charge beyond 90%."
It was great while it worked but a few months in and the right side completely went out. Battery life was good and lasted a long time.
"While other aspects are good, there is not really any added noice cancellation, besides having physical thing over your ear"
"I bought these thinking that they would be to good to be true. They are ok headphones. Their cushions are to small for my ears so they sit on my ears which is not really comfortable after  sometime. They also feel like toy plastic, you know the kind what makes you think if i drop this it'll break.Here are the good things that I like about it. Easy connection, they look nice, the case is great, Music sounds good, not great like a $200 dollar pair but good. The buttons are easy and understandable. Good enough for my kids to enjoy."
"It’s alright. However, they are quite big. I wouldn’t wear them out personally because I look like a alien with them since they’re so big LOL. But they are good in sound, not the best but it’s alright. They also make a weird beeping sound when there’s no music playing."
"I bought these exact headphones a little over a year ago, as them a lot just reminded me, same color combo and everything. What I didn't like about them then, and why I will not buy them again, is that they are fragile in my opinion. They lasted almost a year, but not one full year apparently. Because I did not have them in January of this year, 2023. So if I bought them in May 2022, according to Amazon not me, what that tell you?NOTE these are ""foldable."" Personally I do not understand why headphones need to be or even should be foldable. But I'm sure someone else with a different opinion can explain that. But I think it's the fold ability that is the point that makes them so fragile. Because they fell apart at exactly the joint where they fold, they literally split in half in my hands at the folding joint. This is why I will not buy foldable headphones again. Other than that they did have very good sound, again in my opinion, and they were easy to operate. They also held the charge for a surprisingly long time. Other than durability, ease of operation, and ability to hold the charge, are the most important characteristics to me. I got in the habit of charging them once per week, sometimes whether they needed it or not. Because I never wanted them to die while I was using them. They only died in use 3 times and more than 6 months by the way. But again, ""durability"" is an extremely important characteristic to me. My headphones should be able take reasonably rough daily use. And, I should be able to have them for more than a year even if they are pretty inexpensive. Or maybe year is all I should expect from headphones under $50, I don't know. Maybe someone can tell me?"
Sound quality is not as good as some reviews would have you believe but for no more than they cost I suppose it could be that my standards were higher than they should've been.
I love the color and the compact case but I was looking for noise canceling and these headphones are not. The sound quality is ok. I would not purchase again.
"My Best Friend in Florida she’s about eighty Something . Unfortunately, they seem to have a flaw that occurs in all of them after a certain amount of time they crack and she’s very careful putting them on and off. Well, it’s happened once again . I am going to order for the third time !She is on limited  income never mind the fact that I am tooIs there anything I can tell her to do so that this does not happen again?.Sincerely, Kathryn."
"I really wanted to love these headphones. They were so pretty, and the carrying case was awesome. The headphones were superior for listening, so if you just want just for that, then these are great.But I needed this for work, so the microphone was important, and unfortunately the mic sucks. It was muffled, and during a zoom call, my voice wasn't clear and would at times not start when I started talking, so the others listening would only get my voice when i was like three of four words in.With a heavy heart, I returned these."
"Hello, I'll say the positives that are my opinion before I speak about the negatives. I love how big the headphones are and it actually covers your ear. It does a pretty decent job to cancel out the noise. I wear these almost all day while I'm at work listening to my books, music, and videos so it's pretty important that the headphones I wear are actually comfortable. Luckily, these headphones are cushioned nicely and my ears don't hurt at the end of the day. Another plus that I like is that most headphones and earbuds give me headaches and I have NOT had a headache that was caused by these headphones.Now on to the negatives. I really really dislike that I cannot talk through the headphones! Before I answer a call that is coming through, I have to turn the headphones off because for some reason I can't switch to my phone. There will be a weird silence in between after I turn the headphones off to answers the call and I can't talk or hear for about 20 to 30 seconds. Another thing that I dislike a great deal is that if you silence a call coming through, the headphones will continue to make the ringing noise instead of going back to what you were listening to or watching. When you silence a call on most headphones or earbuds you are able to continue listening to music or watching videos. These do not do that."
"Initially went with these due to them being more affordable, figured they wouldn't last me long but they lasted about a year. The folding in and out part broke and despite the sound still coming through, I can't wear them anymore.  Also when I got them the left ear had something in there that wasn't secured. It would rattle when I'd tilt or turn. So if you're looking for cheap headphones that won't last long but will serve their purpose these are good. But don't invest if you want them for the long run."
"First impression, looks awesome. Was impressed with the description of all that it can do. Does in fact have a SD card slot and comes with an optional wired cable. I did not test the wired cable, thought it would work fine. Purchased to be wireless, so that my senior parents could walk around the house doing things without the cable getting in the way while listening to music or their favorite podcasts.The buttons on the headset are too low and you can not feel whether you are touching the volume up or down button. Too many times touched the wrong button and had to remove the headset to figure out how to set it up all over again.We weren't able to test the full capabilities of this headset, because it is too frustrating trying to use it properly. We have big hands, little patience, and possibly not enough computer literacy to use this headset. We have several Bluetooth headsets that are easier to use and set up that only have half the capabilities that this headset has, no problems using those. We were hoping to be able to have a less expensive backup headset that was more versatile with newer technology than the more expensive brand. But our fat fingers had big troubler using these controls. It was hard to use, and hard to decipher which control was which. The expensive brand has controls on the wire so you can see what you are pressing and a toggle switch on the headphones, so that you know you have physically selected a specific action. These buttons on the headphones are hard to tell what you are pushing. The buttons are positioned too low. They don't stick up high enough, they are easy to miss, and just feeling them with your finger, can not tell which one is which."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I bought this product twice, the first one the adjuster piece on one of the sides broke off after about 3 weeks of usage which i was ruff with the headphones so that’s entirely my fault. Although I will say that the headphones look great, I did notice that wit both sets I couldn’t control the volume of my music at all. The pause/call/ play button only pauses and plays the music.The worst problem I found with these headphones was the noise cancellation white noise thingy, which might I add is vary loud, and I don’t think Any body could actually sleep with it on.With my first set the noise cancellation sometimes went on even when I hadn’t pressed the button, and with both sets I noticed the only way to turn it off is to turn of the headphones and back again, which also disconnects them from Bluetooth. Pressing the button that puts on the sound only pauses it.The next thing I noticed is extremely weird, although it is the reason I’m not going to get a new pair of these headphones. I do think that this could be a result of water damage in the headphones, so please take this information with a grain of salt, for it might be just because of water inside of the headphones.After a while whenever the cancellation would randomly turn on instead of playeing the sound it would play the audio to some men talking, that I had never in my life heard before.Little bit creeepy. And each time the headphones turned it on again, there would be different men speaking.Every time it has always been men, and the creepyish part, they were always talking about religion, I don’t know which but not what I expected to come from these headphones, hence I had never in my whole life listened to those men or even heard them in my entire life until now.The first time i realized that was when I was playing the headphones to play music while I slept, somehow the cancellation went of and I heard these men talking about religion in my ears.Made me think these headphones were possessed but that wouldn’t be a great title for this review.Overall besides those problems, the sound was infinitely better in my first set then the second.I do think that wired earbuds surpassed the sound for my second set. They fit pretty well then most headphones I’ve ever bought, although I have taken them on runs and they sometimes get lose and or fall off.They clarity is not the best for these headphones I would say, just because I can pick up parts of the music better in wired earbuds, my first set was infinitely better although, I got the purple the first time, and repurchased the rose gold for the second time, both pretty colors!"
"Pros: the battery life is pretty long they’ll last me up to 2 weeks but I’d only use them for the gym, and they charge fastThey’re comfortable if you’re doing simple stuff like cleaning or walkingCons: They’re kind of flimsy I have a big head and they feel like they’re going to fall off when I’m working outThe sound is absolutely butt, even on the fullest volume they’re quiet and I can still hear everything around me.They LEAK SOUND LIKE CRAZY, I couldn’t even wear these in public because the sound leaks so bad I might as well be playing music on my phone or a speaker for everyone else to hear aswellOverall for the price they’ll do the job, but if you’re a gym rat looking for something to keep you pumped or just want something with bass or privacy these are not it."
"That annoying battery low sound is at it again and I had to write a review. This thing needs to be charged every day. This is my fourth pair of over-the-head headphones and I have never needed to charge a pair so many times.It does not work well with Zoom. Nobody heard me and I could barely hear the call.There are 4 buttons with multiples functions. You have to feel your way to get to the right button or take them off, pause, lower the volume, put them back on, rewind a little, then press play again. Other brands have a much better interface that takes very little time to get used to.These headphones are huge. Like huge huge. I can't imagine anyone under 5'5"" being comfortable with them. But they are comfy so there's that.Just, no. There is a three-letter brand that starts with a J that is so much better except for the one pair that was too tight. Great battery life, like a whole week without recharging. Skip this."
"It does play the radio without connecting or anything. But it still is really static-y. I was watching videos with the cord, and it just turned to static or music. The volume buttons, you have to hold to be turn the volume up or down. I held it for a bit and it worked. But changed back to the radio. I am very pleased with the fit though. They fit perfectly and comfortably. They are very lightweight, and they fit wondrously in the travel container they gave. Since they did not work for me its a waste of money, if they did, i would say its a great value of money. I am also pleased with the color, it looks exactly like the picture."
"Better than earbuds to listen to a movie or music in a plane or heavily populated area, but DO NOT noise-cancel very well."
I was trying to look for a pair of bluetooth headphones that I had bought a while back and apparently they weren't available anymore. These are suggested to be a replacement. The design is nice the color is nice and they feel good around the ear but not the same as my old ones. So I gave it a three-star rating only because the sound quality isn't bad and the price wasn't bad. The issues that I have is the battery life does not last anywhere near as long as my old ones and I've been told that the microphone part of the headphones sound like I'm in a box. I'm keeping them because they do work for my media and it's not worth returning for the price that I paid for. Next time I'll just look for a better pair hopefully they're out there somewhere.
Headset worked wonderful for about 8 months & then the quality declined rapidly. Slow to connect via Bluetooth & sound quality greatly decreases if I step 2-3 feet away from laptop. I have a global position that requires 6-8 hours usage most of a work week. Any suggestions for improvement would be greatly appreciated. Maybe I have gotten my use & it’s time to upgrade?
"The device is somehow larger than I expected, but not a real issue.The tiny control buttons have black on black letters, very difficult to use unless you have already memorized their purpose.Instruction sheet is better than the quick start guide which is really more of  a puzzle.I had hoped that the ability to have a wired or a wireless connection would somehow be advantageous if travelling. Not sure why, but that remains to be seen.Perhaps when I get used to it, its performance will win me over. Seems like a lot of others have been happy."
"With all the positive reviews, I was hoping these headphones could be an exception to ""you get what you pay for"". Unfortunately, it lived up to that adage perfectly. I'll give it some pros as it deserves, but the cons are too great for me to give these a good rating.Pros:-Foldable, adjustable-Comfortable-neat, functional case with matching accessories-Pairs quickly and easily-Lots of functionsCons:-Noise cancellation is practically nonexistent for me. The heads don't swivel much so it was a poor fit, and there was a huge gap letting sound in.-Consistent, quiet buzzing and hissing noise even if no sound playing, both wired and wireless. I might not have been so upset about this if it was at least a consistent buzz, but it seems to change pitches and speeds constantly.-Sound quality was a big letdown. When I ran the headphone test from online and listened to some music, it performed relatively poorly, with the muffled and distorted sound much more evident at higher volumes. Reminds me of the quality you'd get from free handout earbuds they give on airplanes or events.-Button controls are non-intuitive; I wish tapping would change the volume and long press would switch tracks, not vice versa like these headphones are.Overall, if you aren't looking for a clean, crisp sound and just need a cheap pair to watch movies or listen to music with, these could probably work ok. At the very least, they do connect and produce sound. But I would not recommend these, and I will be returning mine."
The headphones work fine.  The destination female user found them too tight around the ears.
"For the price you get what you get. The sound is nice just not as loud as some others but like I said for the price it's soild. The quality of sound is definitely suprising for what I was expecting.  The fit is comfy, the ear cups don't bug my ears. The battery life has been really nice, charges moderately fast. I would recommend not running with them as I always hear a shaking noise like something is rattling inside the headphone's. They stay on great though."
I wish I would’ve not procrastinated and returned these when I could. It has audio quality  of a fm radio… Also sound cuts off when I put my cell in my jacket pocket. So much for commuting with these in the winter with my cell in my coat. Battery runs out fast. My old s-rhythms lasted forever. So mad I lost them..
"I got these for the gym as my other headphones that sit on my neck kept falling over and shifting while running. Huge pain to keep readjusting over and over. These are not the absolute best. Here are the pros and cons I have come across so far. Pros: Super easy and fast connection to phone. I have a smaller head and was concerned they weren't going to fit but they actually do and don't feel like they are going to slip, even bending over or leaning. Very pleased with that. Sound quality is as good as any other. Cons: The type of matte finish on them makes sweat and finger prints really show up so that's a little off putting. While running, there is a faint ""tick"" noise in my ear I could hear between songs or in breaks. I think its the buttons on the one side hitting the edge of their respective slots and I can hear it. It's only while running, and only when it's quiet. 95% of the time I can't hear it. The skip and volume buttons are in between the play/pause and mode. So to use them I had to very carefully count where my finger was before pressing. I fixed this by adding some nail gems to make them faster to identify.So, this set works for me and I like them, HUGE improvement from my other annoying set, but next time I will probably shop around and see if there is an option I like better before choosing these again.UPDATE: I have investigated the ticking noise and it's not the buttons, it's in the actual ear piece. So, there is no way to fix it. I'm probably going start shopping for something else because it is now annoying me more and more. I would not recommend for running."
If you put your phone in your back pocket the signal glitches and loses strength and if you’re trying to listen at night in the dark there’s a blinking light that’s very disturbing… but these are good for the price.
"It was wonderful WHILE it worked. I got them Sept 23, 2024, it is Dec 3rd, 2024, and they won't connect to my Bluetooth any more. It was wonderful while they did.. They are great Headphones.. good thing they have the ability to use tethered connection, so they are still useable, but I wanted them for the Freedom to walk about the house with them on.So, Listen to the other reviews.. these DO STOP WORKING.. generally 3 months in.. which is what other people found as well.I gave them 2 stars because, I can still use them with the Audio Plug at least so not a total loss."
Headphones are just like the picture great color. But of no use. Just look at the length of that wire how is my child supposed to use these at school. Be prepared to buy a longer wire. Other than that they look great feel great. Not to loud for kids.
"UPDATE: Day 3. These headphones are also making the ennnn sound intermittently during a phone call. This is a HUGE minus because my last pair took approximately 6 months before the issue started. Not happy. I had to subtract stars for this.I bought these to replace a similar headset that now makes a loud ennnnnn sound periodically while on a call. I've only had these one day, so I'll break down what I know so far.Pros:1. Compact carrying case.  I love the package that it comes in because it is easy to carry the extra cords and the headset in a compact case.2. Sound quality is sometimes great. While listening to the radio, the sound was crisp and clear. However, while listening to an audiobook, the sound is somewhat muffled. I changed the audio settings on my phone and that helped a bit.3. When charging, a small red light comes on. The manual said a blue light should come on once it is completely charged, but there wasn't; the red light simply went off. Either way, the amount of time that the headset holds a charge is excellent. I used it for approximately 4 hours yesterday, and approximately 3 hours so far today without it needing to be recharged.4. The bluetooth carries a great distance. It is longer than my previous bluetooth headsets. For example, I had my phone in the living room and went outside. The bluetooth carried approximately 17 feet away from the phone and through 2 walls.5. While a tad bit heavy, these are very comfortable. They fit over my ears nicely and if they weren't a tad heavy, I wouldn't even know that I was wearing them.Cons1. The noise cancellation isn't as good as I had hoped. Sitting approximately 25 feet from the road, I can still hear cars passing.2. You cannot use a micro SD card for the tf card slot. I tried and was very disappointed when it wouldn't play. I've purchased a tf card, but it hasn't arrived yet.3. Others can hear what you are listening to. It is loud enough that those around you will be able to hear your music and possibly phone calls.4. Trying to stop the FM radio from running through the channels is a bit difficult because it cycles through channels too fast. You barely get an idea of what you're hearing before it quickly moves on to the next channel. I need to play with it a bit more to find a better way to go through the channels. The instructions aren't very clear on how to stop at the channel you want or how to go through them manually.All in all, this is an excellent set of headphones for the price. I would definitely buy them again if I need to - despite the cons. As I've said, I've only had these one day. I'll update if anything changes."
I was looking to plug into my iPhone and not use as Bluetooth and this one wouldn’t work.  Had to return.  Quality and product looked nice for price just description didn’t read anywhere that I noticed only iPhone with Bluetooth.
"I bought these because I thought they might help me when I cut my grass, but there was very little noise canceling actually. But the range was good when I got away from my listening source"
below average
"These headphones are just ok, sound quality is a 6 out of 10 sounds like a stereo from the early 2000s bluethooth is instant, quality is cheap plastic. Mine had some scratches on the side where the extender adjustment is so to me that means these were used previously and I ordered new! It took 1 month to get to me first order was lost in transit then 2nd one took 2 more weeks! I would say spend an extra 30-40 bucks and get a better quality pair of headphones like JBL Sony Bose l."
"I bought a pair and found - relatively quickly, that the only play sequence from a MicroSD card was random.  I listen to classical music.  If I want to listen to a symphony, I'd like to hear it in sequence - each movement following the last one - and NOT by some quirky random playback.  I wrote the company and they sent me a replacement, but included this ""information"":---------------------------------------------Dear，Thank u for ur reply. U can try again with it:1. rename and re-sort the music as you want.2. The program defaults to sequential playback, but long-pressing “play” will sequentially cut: Sequence - Single - Folder Play - Random Play Cycle.Best regards,---------------------------------I don't wish to sound impolite, but what the hell does that mean?  I had already tried all manner of button sequencing, but the only result - ALWAYS - was random play.  And if I had more than one folder on the MicroSD, it would only play - randomly - from ONE folder, and would never advance to the next folder.As for ""reordering"" or renumbering the files?  They're already numbered - IN order, and no matter how many times I've cleared the card, re-loaded a new file or two, it only plays from one folder.  RANDOMLY.Just entirely useless for my needs - and above all else?  The volume, even at its highest - is just a tad too low for nearly all music.  If I want to hear the second bassoon in a full-orchestral tutti texture, I WANT to hear the second bassoon.  But with this thing?  Nope.  If you care at all about music - AND SEQUENTIAL PLAY - pass on this thing."
It's ok.
"The only reason why these get two stars is because they're pretty and they come with a case and it has the ability to use Bluetooth or the wired part. As far as sound, they are not worth a dime. I'm glad I tested these out before I got on the plane. These suck. I tested it and watched a video on my phone using these headphones and the sound and the video did not sync up. I had to pause it and it would sync for maybe 30 seconds and then it would become unsynced, over and over again, and yes this is with them being at full charge. I took those off and put in my J-Lab Go Air Pop earbuds and didn't have any lagging issue after that. So clearly there is some sort of lag between the sound and the picture that you get on a video while using these headphones. They sound like those cheap earphones you can get at Five Below or Dollar General. Don't waste your time or your money ordering these. I have no idea why other people gave these five stars and said that they sound good. Maybe they've just never had earphones or earbuds that gave any kind of good sound before because these are by far some pretty terrible sounding earphones. Seriously, if you enjoy good sound, don't waste your money on these. I will be returning them. Very, very disappointed."
"I've been buying these headphones for a good bit now, around 2ish years if I recall correctly, they're extremely durable and last a long time if taken care of. However I've noticed that the recent pairs I've bought have a significantly lower audio quality to where it feels like I'm straining my own ears to listen to music sometimes, and this never happened before. They did however change the low battery sound from happening at 30% to 10% which is a plus from me."
"I was looking for over the ear Bluetooth headphones and I received that. The sound is mediocre, nothing stellar but for the price these headphones are ok. In the description it says ""specifically developed software and noise reduction technology designed to prevent you from hearing ambient noises"" and then under customer Q&A the question is asked ""are these passive or active noise canceling"" to which ZIHNIC answers ""passive noise canceling, it is through the soft ear muff to reduce the noise."" The soft ear muff is not ""specifically developed software"" and additionally every headphone has ear muffs. I live on a corner with a lot of traffic and I can attest to virtually zero noise reduction. Don't be misled. It is also stated the ear muffs are soft, they are but nothing special or out of the ordinary. Bluetooth pairing was easy, I tried the radio and reception was passable but moving around messes with it. I tried the 3.5mm cable and it works but I'm not sure what the point is, most phones no longer have 3.5mm jacks. I haven't fully tested the battery life, I hope it's good. In all this purchase was ok, I purchased what I was looking for, inexpensive Bluetooth headphones. Would I recommend them, not for sound quality or noise reduction, only for inexpensive and Bluetooth"
"I had this product for almost 6 months. I think the sound quality is up to standard for the price. The cushion is comfortable around the ears. However, now that I had it for 6 months, I noticed a frequent problem with my headphones is the Bluetooth connection. The first time I paired with my computer there were no issues, but after a while, the connection wasn't able to. The headphones were still on my computer system. It would try ""pairing"". When I removed the devices from the computer, it was harder to Bluetooth connect the headphones back to the computer because it didn't even show up on my screen it would take about 10-20 minutes to reconnect it.It comes with a case and inside has two cords, one is the charger and the second one is the headphone jack, which doesn't work.  Overall its sound is great and noise cancellation is good too, if you can overcome Bluetooth hurdles it is not bad. It is just unnecessary and annoying when it happens."
These are great to use when there is nothing going on around you.  Didn't block out background noise very well and had to turn up the volume to actually hear.  Almost worthless on the airplane with just the normal jet engines seven rows back.  They would best be used in an office setting where not much was going on around.
I bought these for my kids to use at Christmas in 2023 and by March one side of the headphones stopped working on two of them. I rebought them and three months later one did it again and two months after that the other one did it. Only one of the five pairs I bought have continued to work. They are really not worth the price when they keep failing to work.
"You get what you pay for with these. The biggest plus is that they are super lightweight compared to premium higher quality headphones like Beats. They are not uncomfortable, but the ear cups are not nearly as comfortable as with premium headphones. Other than the on and off button, all other buttons are absolutely anything but intuitive; horribly designed buttons. I gave up trying remember which of the 4 lined up buttons was for what. Sound was just okay. The case is a nice touch; it provides for a bit of protection and oddly some slightly more expensive headphones don’t provide a case. And after 5-6 weeks of use they haven’t broken.  Overall, if you can’t or don’t want to pay at least $30 more for a slightly better brand (or $100-$200 more for the best), then these will do for $22. However,  this was a waste of money for me because they weren’t terrible so I wasn’t pressed to promptly return them … and now the return window is closed. Again, you get what you pay for with these.  They’re not worst for sure, and definitely not the best."
"These headphones worked very well for a month. The problem I'm having is they won't charge. I have tried many different power sources and tried a different charging cable. I've had it plugged in overnight and they still did not charge. Unfortunately, the battery did not run out until after 30 days so I did not try to refund. Maybe I just got very unlucky with a bad set. Everything else was great And I love the carrying case. Radio worked well and headphones were comfortable. They had good sound too. They just don't do me any good now that I am unable to charge them."
"I bought these for my wife to replace the JBL set that she has completely worn out.  Now these head phones are not bad, if you are only going to listen to music or maybe watch a movie and don't want to disturb someone else in the room, they give decent sound and at the price point I wasn't expecting Sony or Polk Audio quality, but they are very nice.If you are going to use these to talk on your smart phone then you may want to look at another pair.  My wife took them out and charged and them.  They connected to her phone flawlessly.  She put them on and made a test call to her sister who instantly said she couldn't understand her.  My wife then called me and said she wanted to test them with me and I found that she sounded like she was in a tunnel and her voice was kind of muffled and it was difficult to understand her.  With the amount of time she is on the phone that could get very irritating to the person on the other line.  She also complained that they were kinda tight on her head and she didn't like the fact that there was no padding on top of the headset.  So needless to say I ended up doing what I should have done in the first place and buying her another set of JBLs which she received yesterday from Amazon and she is once again a happy camper.So it really depends on what you are going to use these for, if you are going to use these as Bluetooth phone headset and make calls then you may want to look for another pair but if you want a low cost nice looking headset to listen to music and watch movies on your smartphone then these may be the ones for you."
"I used the sleep mask for the first time last night and I am a little disappointed. First, I found The speakers a little annoying to adjust because you have to adjust, put the mask back on, and repeat until you get it right. Second, the sound itself is pretty quiet. Maybe for most people it would be okay, but I am hearing impaired in one ear and had to crank it up to max volume to hear well. Third, I didn’t find it to stay in place. If you toss and turn, it’ll probably slide off like it did to me. I will say it blocks light out well if you get it to sit right. I do find the nose bridge to be a bit uncomfortable."
"They are functional and have decent sound. They have no noise canceling functions, which is great when taking a walk but not great on mass transit or where there’s a lot of ambient noise.  I’ve taken them on one flight and they were fine."
The color is pretty and i appreciate the warranty but theres no charging cord as advertised in the quick start guide… its also not a regular android charging port so i cant actually use them until i figure out what the charging port is.
One ear side broke/popped off
they are less comfortable than noted.
"For the cheap price, these headphones are great! I love that they have both a wired and bluetooth option (but I haven't used them wired yet.) The audio quality isn't the best that I've gotten from other headphones, but it's not noticeably bad, just not quite as clear as my airpods. After a few minutes you don't really notice it. Can't speak to the battery duration since I've only had them a few days and don't use them at work, but so far they are very satisfactory for the price. I do feel a bit cautious when folding them as they do feel slightly fragile, but the case keeps them safe when I'm not using them. I do also feel like they get a bit uncomfortable and press on my head if I wear them longer than an hour, but this will likely depend on your anatomy."
"The quality is fine for cheap headphones but I can’t wear them for more than an hour. For that reason alone I would suggest buying a different pair of headphones. Range is ok, not great. Battery life seems pretty good. But I had to spend money on another pair due to the discomfort so kind of a waste."
"It's all good if you want to listen.  BT paired very easily.  The small microphone mounted on the side of one earphone of the headset was not adequate for me.  Multiple attempts on Teams calls, my colleagues reported that the sound was muffled and bad when I spoke.  When I removed the headset, used computer speakers and spoke directly into the microphone, it was fine.  No thanks; imagine the stupidity of speaking into a foam covered earphone piece during a Teams Call.  Return commencing in 3,2,1..."
"Too much trouble to set up on the computer and change out from regular speakers, then go back and reset everything else to go to the headphones. Probably won't use them very much."
These are comfortable. I bought them to listen to audiobooks and they work great for that. I had accidentally pressed a button and turned on the radio. Decided to try to find a station for the times I want to use it for that. Only 2 stations kinda came in and neither were music. Then today the case was bumped into while it was in its hanging spot and the loop that the handle clips to just exploded into pieces (see pick). This part makes me feel disappointed because I loved the case.
"The good: sound quality is good, comfort is good, and they fold and fit in a smallish carrying case. The not so good: about every 2 weeks I lose the pairing and have to redo that, the music always cuts out maybe 5-6 times every time I use the headphones, occasionally I have to reset the volume level. At first I was blaming my mp3 player for these problems, but no, it's the headphones. It's too late to return them (4 months), but I will have to consider buying a different brand."
"I was hoping to use these for traveling, and I like the versatility of wireless and corded, when folded, they take up as much space as other headphones."
I owned a pair of these headphones that worked great for over 4 years. When they broke I ordered a replacement since they worked so well. However I am having serious connectivity issues even though it worked perfectly with the previous one (same device). It says it's connected and then proceeds to not connect any audio or voice. I have to constantly turn it on and off to hope it works. Do not buy. I do not know what they did to the newer one but it's worse
I bought these headphones because my boyfriend had a pair and I liked them I liked them a lot so I decided to buy me a pair what got me the most was the FM radio because sometimes I don't have signal enough to listen to my downloaded music. Although upon receiving these I found they have  good sound good quality however the FM radio doesn't work well it gets stations but it doesn't get the stations I want I want like hip hop soft radio the whole bit all it gets is talk show and gospel and I can't get it to go any further than that and I cannot get it to find any other stations.  so I'm thinking about returning these I'm not sure cuz the whole point of me buying them was for the FM radioUpdate.Very very poor customer service they said that they would make it right and they didn't yes I can return the headphones however they didn't ask if I wanted different ones they didn't want to ask if I wanted to just exchange your message to me said that they would make it right or they said they would figure out how to make me happy. There was no compassion there was no niceness I was treated as a number not a person not a customer won't be buying from them again ever!
Was very satisfied with the audio. Bluetooth worked fine. Left headphone started  shorting out after minimal usage and then broke and started rattling inside making it unusable. Very dissatisfied with the lack of craftsmanship. Would not want to purchase again. Hope the manufacturer sees this.
"You get what you pay for, or do you? Now, we are charged 2 to 3 times more for items, so when I tried out these headphones, I was pleasantly surprised. For the money, it beats spending $200 on Beats. However, I only use it for my phone, podcasts, and music while exercising and out and about. I wish it had better volume control and noise cancellation. Otherwise, I am happy."
Bought this because I thought with it covering my son's ears it would be clearer then the cheap earpods he had been using that ended up only working in one ear.  They are sitting on my desk as they don't work well and aren't clear.
"These suck if you walk outside in an area that tends to be windy. The open holes for the jack and charge allow wind inside the device causing a horrible sound. At the wrong angle it amplifies the sound of wind by 1000%, which is deafening. When the wind is under 8MPH these are nice. Where I live it tends to always (4-5 days a week) be 10-20+MPH."
"This product was that of nice and all. Though, it was defiantly loose on my head, and if I walked around these headphones would defiantly slip off. Which was obviously something I didn't like, as I had intends that involved a lot of movement, like running. And its not noise cancelling, I can completely hear everything still going on around me. And there was another issue that I didn't completely like, as even if you put your headphones at volume 1 (with phone/device) you can definetly hear the music or whatever sound if someone where to stand right next to you. So that's definetly an embarassing factor, as I ride the bus and also wanted to use this for that. But I definetly don't want someone next to me to hear the music I'm listening to, it just feels judgy.But aside from those factors, the product is  easy on the eyes, and overall maintains a nice look!"
"These worked beautifully for a little over a year (warranty limit) and now the sound is VERY distorted and patchy on the left side, cutting in and out, sounding tinny or robotic, or dropping out completely. I'm really disappointed, as I've recommended these to other people. It's a decent price, but the longevity is NOT there.Can't recommend these anymore, and on the lookout for a better and more reliable set."
"I only really use these headphones for the gym. If you want something for gaming, music or any other activity that benefits from headphones I would not recommend these.The noise canceling feature Is pretty poor, though the audio Is clear and sounds good enough for the gym or working out. I do really like the microphone and buttons. The microphone works well for most phone calls, I'm a bit soft spoken so I usually have to raise my voice a bit.The buttons are a really neat touch. You can raise and lower the volume of the headphones themselves by holding two buttons, those same buttons pushed can switch between next and previous tracks. I've tried using those buttons on youtube playlists and they don't work, maybe on spotify, I think the headphones also support SD cards, I haven't used this feature personally. The main button I use Is one that starts/pauses videos and also answers calls.They're comfortable enough but I have another set of headphones that are much more comfortable and have significantly better noise cancelling and audio quality for my computer.These headphones are definitely not as good as my other pair, but they work well for what I want them for. They're also very affordable, you can definitely find a higher quality pair, but that will undoubtedly also be higher in price too. These are more than sufficient for someone who wants a basic pair of headphones for the gym, walks, or just laying on your bed listening to music or videos."
The sound quality of this headset was very poor. A waste of good money.
I have had these less than a year (November to June) I have used them for about 3 months. . I don't wear them lying down. The fold part broke for seemingly no reason. i don't see a pin that popped or anything. I did put it over my afro so beware if you have big hair.
"There isn't full noise cancellation, but I'm ok with that. That feature wasn't something I was looking for in headphones. I want to be able to hear my surroundings just in case something goes wrong. The sound quality when listening to music or podcasts is good. I wouldn't say it's state of the art, but it's good enough for me. I don't really use the volume control feature because I use it on my phone. The headphones are very easy to connect to Bluetooth. They connect seamlessly every time. The major problems I have with the headphones are two things. One problem is when I answer a phone call, the headphones buzz the whole entire time. I can only hear the sound. The person I am speaking to can't hear it. It is very distracting to me. The other problem is when I place a phone call, the person I am speaking with comes in clear, but I sound muffled to them. I read this same complaint from other people's reviews as well. I am keeping the headphones because I want to use them to listen to music or podcasts while I clean. I would be much happier if I could use them to speak to my friends on the phone while I clean, but I can't. You can't beat the price for what you're getting."
"I wanted a cheap pair of headphones (not in-ear buds) for running so I can hear my environment (i.e. cars behind me) better, and one that won't damage my hearing when I'm listening for long periods of time. This does the job. The music quality is okay, bass is not great, but it's also not too sharp. I also like that it has physical buttons, it makes it easier to press them and play music or adjust the volume while running. The physical power switch is also a plus for me. However, all the buttons are kinda flimsy and feel cheap. Also the white parts of the whole headset looks plastic-y. But very cute rose gold color for the headset though. Again this is a $20 headset... so you get what you pay for. As I use these for running, I am not sure how the pads will hold or last or if they will absorb sweat and be gross after a while (I'm hoping not). I haven't tried the FM radio, nor the SD card slot nor the wired option, but I am really glad that it has the wired option for when the Bluetooth and/or recharging stops working - a lot of rechargeable Bluetooth headphones/earphones just get thrown out at the end of their life because batteries are irreplaceable for headsets. Overall, an okay, decent, inexpensive, and cute pair of headphones, kind of expected downfalls for the price, but I'm really glad that it has a wired option. Hope they don't break in half someday as I try to put them over my head!"
"Sadly, these headphones fell apart within 8 and 10 months of sporadic use. I bought the first pair in February 2023 and the second pair in December 2023.  The side that has the volume and other buttons detached and a small metal pin fell out. They were rarely used and the exact same thing happened to the second pair."
"First of all, I am not an audiophile so anything that remotely plays music will work for me so I can't comment on the audio quality. I bought these to use at work so I could leave my MPOW brand ones at home and Amazon no longer sold the MPOW ones I love. These Zihnic ones are plastic and flimsy by comparison, with no real padding on the headband. Worst of all, they creak, crackle, and rattle with every shift of my head. Recently some part inside them has broken loose and it CLUNKS loudly in my ear when I bend over. They were also faulty right out of the box since the shortcut buttons were all aligned wrong and did not pause or adjust the volume. I don't know how they've gotten so many high reviews- mine were junk from day 1."
"It works well to listen to music on. Holds an SD card, so you can do the music thing for sure and sound quality is par. However, if you hook them up to your phone to talk to someone the sound quality is horrible and both parties sound like they're in a staticky fish bowl. Just doesn't work."
"They were great until the left side just stopped working out of nowhere. I did all the troubleshooting, like checking the volume and cleaning. It just stopped. I hadn’t even used them in a vigorous way so I know I didn’t do something to break them. Otherwise, the sound quality was great prior to the malfunction."
I had ordered a pink pair about 6 months ago & I feel like it was louder .. this one isn’t the same volume . It’ll do though .
"Sound quality is ok.  Delay in volume button response  makes volume control difficult and annoying.  Slightly rigid, making it tight to wear.  Bluetooth pairing was good."
Apparently the connection is loose. I plugged in the charger to the headset and the red light cones on but won’t stay on. It never turns green to indicat full charge.
"I wanted to love these, I really did, but I do not. The quality is absolutely poor. They feel cheap in the hand, as if they will break at any moment. The sound quality is fine, but my $10 ear buds have more bass and more noise reduction than these. And the mic?! Forget it. I've answered several calls with these and everyone has said I sound distant and as if I'm underwater. They do hold a decent charge and are pretty comfy, fitting my head weather I'm standing up, working out, laying out by the pool, etc. So 2 stars for that. However they will be given to my kids and I will be buying something different."
Like the sound but at first I thought it was a little cracklely when your first turn it on. Sounds like you are in a tunnel a bit.
These work well enough. Clear sound without distortion. Very light weight. Materials feel cheap. Like the ability to fold up and use carry case.
"These work pretty well. It feels it a little uncomfy on my ears, doesn’t stay on too well for a jog.Connectivity is alright!"
The sound quality is fine when listening but the microphone when making phone calls is below average. It sounds muffled when I speak.
This is my second pair of headphones that I purchase the exact same ones and this new pair that I just received must have like a loose wire in it because it glitches out while listening to music or watching TV so it's definitely not as good as my first pair my first pair lasted me like 2 years and was amazing but this one is not quite as amazing and I'm having difficulties with it.
"I purchased these because of the ratings and the price, I received them pretty quickly, opened them up and charged them and connected the bluetooth to my computer. I used them the first day after the charge and was impressed at how I even went into the next room and it was pretty clear, great sound, no crackling, no distortions, no interruptions, and no dropping of audio. The next day everything was fine until I'm listening to a song right in front of my computer when it went from clear to muffled and distorted when there was too much bass in the song, that wasn't happening until that moment. I'm hesitant to get a refund or ask for a replacement.Update: My ratings for this product keep going down. It's been a few days now since my first review and it's all gone downhill. The connection keeps dropping, the audio has started to crackle when changing from one audio to another. It has to be restarted every time I change from one video on YouTube to another on the same browser and page. I have decided to return them since it is too much of a hassle to continue to deal with them."
"Writing this with the volume at the highest level, and im still clearly hearing the sound of my three year old student(im a pre k teacher) sucking on, chewing, biting off, and eating his fingernails and I want to claw out my eardrums 👍🏻Received them last night and I’m returning  them today. They’re solid headphones for the price, but not suitable for my needs"
"I hate that I’m writing this review because I absolutely loves these headphones but unfortunately it came to it-I got these headphones and immediately was impressed with the quality of them and the size alone just from the start- the sound and noise cancelling quality was pretty good for the price of the headphones overall.Unfortunately, from day one the audio settings never worked, the volume down button simply did nothing and the volume up button didn’t work regularly and when it did, all it did was hang up on pause my music, at first I assumed I was pressing the wrong button but after experimenting with it I found out that they simply just didn’t work. To add on to that, after a couple of weeks of purchasing them, the Bluetooth simply failed me. They wouldn’t charge after me keeping them on for an entire night and when I tried to power them on they wouldn’t even turn on unless connected to the charger and when they did all it would do is say “Power on… pairing” with a loud buzzing in the background and then cut off and then turn back on and repeat the process about 3 times before turning off completely. I took care of them quite well and kept them in their case whenever I no longer had use for them- unfortunately when this problem occurred my return date had already ran out so it was too late to send them back. After that I just decided that I’d only use them as a computer headset since they came with a backup wire and I have an iPhone but no jack port- that solution lasted about 5 days, the wire is relatively cheap feeling and wore out after about 5 days, now the left side of my headphones won’t even make audible noise unless held at an angle. I can’t imagine anything that I did to cause this so I’m just assuming that they wore out or weren’t held in a hood position. In the ends that leaves me with a useless pair of headphones that didn’t last me a month- I’m writing this review out of defeat since I couldn’t find a better way to fix the problem of my headset on my own."
"The headphones works fine, but as for mic... It seems to go in and out randomly . I use this at work and it just sits on a stand when not in use. It's never been dropped or mishandled, so it is disappointing that the mic has issues."
Definitely comfortable and easy to operate but meh on the sound quality. Not great.
The cord to charge is very shortand not universal. They won’t charge to 100%.Volume very difficult to control.They are comfortable.
Bought these for work Teams meetings. Mic doesn't work. Coworkers couldn't hear me on my call. Sound quality is also very poor. They just fit over my head with braids when fully extended. Probably good for kids but certainly not for work.
"I liked the color and style. The actual ear phones are much larger than in photo, lots of background noise when paired with my tv. Would not pair to my cell samsung 22. Folds easily but too large overall for me."
"The head phones are loud which is good, but your neighbor will be able to hear. Hopefully you’re using these in an already loud space, no one will pay attention. Also, the keychain that attaches the case to your bag ripped off. As if the headphones are just too heavy."
"Volume not the best, I have not yet tried the Bluetooth connection. However the cord connection is very static. If I had had more time I probably would have returned. I had a cheaper set in the past as a gift that worked 10x better. I will try the Bluetooth and see if that makes a difference. The 1 thing I like the most is the comfort. These are comfortable, and the case is nice as well."
"Had these 4 years, but really didn't use them all that much, maybe 30x. Liked everything about them until recently the covering on the ear pieces started to disintegrate. I wouldn't be surprised by this had they been used more. Otherwise these were great headphones."
"Finding a quality pair of closed headphones that I like has been a daunting task.  I wanted portability and isolation, as well as comfort and good sound for $100 or under.  The M40x does most of these things well.First Impressions, Stock Earpads:The first thing I noticed were how small and stiff the pads felt on my head.  While not the end of the world, I couldn't possibly wear these continuously for long periods without a break.  Next is the sound.  Both the bass and the highs were a little too forward for my taste, leading to fatigue only after 10 minutes.  Detail is great though, as is imaging, with soundstage being decent for a closed set.  At this point I decide to try another pair of pads.First Impressions, Brainwavz Angled Pads:All comfort issues are solved, and the phones isolate slightly better now.  The sound signature has also changed quite a bit.  Bass is no longer forward (good thing), the highs are now sharper and louder (bad thing), and the soundstage has widened (good thing).  In the end I'm judging these based on their sound first and foremost, so I def do not like the Brainwavs pads on these as I am sensitive to harsh highs.  Losing hope in my purchase, I decide to let them play some music before I make final judgement.16-hour Impressions, Stock Pads:Sibilance and peaks in the high end seem to be less now.  Bass seems less forward and is smoothing out.  Detail and soundstage are still present.  All very good signs.  Earpads still a little uncomfortable.16-hour Impressions, Brainwavz Angled Pads:My opinion of these pads hasn't changed much since I first tried them.  I now feel that I won't get the sound I want with these, and begin searching for a better match.  I end up ordering the Shure HPAEC840 Earpads as they get some great reviews when matched with this line of headphones.32-hour Impressions, Stock Pads:The sound is certainly improving.  The frequency response seems to be flattening out and the highs and lows are no longer forward.  They are sounding like a great set of headphones at this point.32-hour Impressions, Shure HPAEC840 Earpads:The comfort issue has improved.  These pads are slightly bigger than the stock pads and don't mess with the sound signature as much at the Brainwavz did.  If anything, the frequency response sounds flatter with these, which is a good thing for my tastes.  Soundstage is also wider without loss of detail.  The only thing I don't like about the pads is their isolation; I feel they isolate less than the stock ones.120-hour Impressions:I've been on a roller coaster with these things over the weekend, even took them with me on an airplane.  In the end, i feel ""meh"" about them.  Equal amount of good things and bad things.  Here's what I have to say about them.Stock Earpads:These are the best isolating by far, but are the worst when it comes to comfort around the ears.  They also have a warmer sound signature with a spike in the highs at the 10k frequency.  This peak makes them sound ""artificial"" and ""metallic"" in some ways.  Guides that I've found online outline ways to correct this peak, but it always results in the overall sound character being changed as well.  The best guide I found recommends using the Shure HPAEC940 velour earpads and a small circle of 2mm thick felt placed over the driver under the earpad.  Of course, by using velour, you can kiss any isolation goodbye.  So, if you want bass and/or isolation, use the stock earpads.  The only mod I liked on these was removing the semi-transparent foam pads underneath the earpads, which raises the mids by a bit and makes them sound a touch smoother.Shure HPAEC840 Earpads:I like these a lot less than I did at the start.  Bass disappears, as does isolation, but the 10k peak is lowered by quite a bit as well.  When I say isolation disappears, I mean that its getting really close to being like an open set of headphones.  You want to turn the volume up more with these pads on, but because they are no longer warm, you're stuck with loud mids/highs.  Some may like that, but I like some warmth.  Comfort is a little better - I say a little because while the pressure around your ears disappears, the headband will now feel heavy on your head.  It's a good trade-off, but a trade-off nonetheless.  At this point, I'd rather have the Shure HPAEC940 velour earpads since they measure with more bass and have a flatter frequency response overall.Final Thoughts:I bought these so I could have a set of portable over ear headphones with good isolation.  What I ended up with was a set of headphones that I just couldn't get to sound or feel right.  Fixing one problem exposes another, and this keeps happening until you've gone far enough down the rabbit hole to realize that maybe all this work isn't worth it on under $100 headphones.  In the end, I think it may be better to get a nice pair of IEM's and pick up some comply isolation tips."
"A little background for context on this review, so please bear with me: I opened my commercial recording studio in 1980 and recorded outside clients up until about 2005. At that point I switched to select clients—whom I continue to record up until present.In the early days of my studio, I used mostly Sony MDR-7506 headphones for my clients. However, after having had to replace a dozen or more transducers on these headphone due to clients cranking them up to 11, I decided to find a good CHEAP alternative; so that every time a client trashed a set of headphones, it wouldn't cost me $100 (actually, the clients always ended up paying for the phones they'd destroyed as I'd always factor the cost of the transducers into their bills.)So, I searched for a relatively-good headphone that would work for my clients. And after a lot of experimenting with various ""cheaper"" headphones, I found the perfect cans: Sennheiser HD 202 II at $21/each. (In fact I personally liked the sound of these better than the Sonys.) And interestingly, none of these inexpensive, Sennheiser headphones were ever blown by my ""rock star"" clients.Unfortunately, Sennheiser quit making the HD 202 II. So, I was on the search again for a relatively inexpensive headphone for studio use. Finally about a year ago, I ran across the OneOdio Pro-10 (for $31) that sounded great and even had a detachable cord.I've been using this headphone for a little over a year, and it checks all the boxes. However, I got to reading some of the reviews on the ATH-M40x; and they piqued my curiosity. So, I ordered a set. With high expectations, I ran an A/B test against the OneOdio Pro-10; and in one word, I was ""Disappointed.""* The sound of the ATH-M40x is actually pretty good, but it lacks the openness and detail that I hear with the OneOdio Pro-10. Both have a nice bottom end; however with the OneOdio Pro-10, you have much better definition.* The fit of the ATH-M40x is decidedly snugger than the OneOdio Pro-10—to the point that the Audio-Technica phones might possibly become a bit distracting during sessions lasting over an hour.* The design of the locking coiled cord that comes with the ATH-M40x (actually two cords come with the phones, this coiled one and a long straight one) causes the cord to ""dangle"" and ""swing"" over my computer keyboard—very distracting, as the headphone jack on my audio interface is right beyond my keyboard. On the other hand, the design of the coiled OneOdio Pro-10 cord is: straight > coiled > straight, so that there is some straight cord coming directly out of my audio interface before turning into the coiled portion. This is just an idiosyncrasy peculiar to my specific set up, so this cord design may not be a minus in your particular situation.* The cost of the ATH-M40x is more than twice that of the OneOdio Pro-10. And as stated above, the sound of the OneOdio Pro-10 is slightly better; and not to mention, the comfort level of the OneOdio Pro-10 is decidedly superior.* Both these headphones have a bit of a ""cheap/plastic-y"" feel compared to the cans I've used over the years, such as the Sony MDR-7506s, the Sennheiser HD 202 IIs and a couple of the higher-end AKG models that I used to use.* I'm not a shill for the company that makes the OneOdio Pro-10; in fact I'd never even heard of this brand until my purchase a year ago based on reviews. I'm simply leveling with you and telling you my experience.I will keep the ATH-M40X phones; because, in all fairness, I've only had them a couple of days (and you can never have too many headphones, right?) But I thought I'd share with you my first impressions of the ATH-M40X."
"They have good Sound not going to lie.  Good Sub, Good Mids. I actually think these may be brighter than my 990s.  But these headphones are described as monitoring headphones.  you know for tracking vocals?  They do not stop headphone bleed that well at all they are about the same as my 990s bleed which are open back headphones and that should logically have way more bleed...  also, there's a weird feeling when these are resting on my ears, I think it's a mix of the pads making my ears hot and the clamping pressure.So yep.  -1 star for bad bleed prevention and another -1 star for not being comfortable3stars for good sound"
"The sound quality is pretty good, however not much better than my box store headset, I wear these for hours when streaming and the box store brand doesn't hurt my ears.  After an hour of wearing these my ears hurt.  So yes the sound is nice, but don't wear them too long."
Pictures speaks for themselves. Headphones have questionable longevity.  Mostly sat in a closet or bin for years and then used about 3 dozen times (<30 min each time) over the past 2 years.  Wear and tear are not the culprit of the peeling.  Great sound but for the price I would recommend spending a bit more to get something that lasts.  I am reaching out to product support to see if there is pad replacements as I'd hate to have to throw them away.
I have bought a couple of these because I love the sound quality and the feel for the price. The only complaint I have is the hinges are way too flimsy. You could say that I'm being too rough with my headphones. But you could also say that using brittle plastic for a structural piece of your product is at best a bad idea and at worst another example of cost-saving at the expense of the consumer.Recommended if you are vigilant about keeping your headphones safe from errant bumps and pulls.
"I have been using M40s for half a decade, and they have rarely disappointed me. The audio quality is noticeable, whether you're an audiophile or not. The pads will inevitably have flaking occur on the outside fabric-- as they will on many headsets-- however, the issue is more cosmetic than anything, and they can be easily replaced. Today, though, I was disappointed; I have just lost my second set of M40x headphones to the same flaw as my first pair. If you are looking for a weak link in these highly recommended and praised headphones, I can only point to one: The swiveling earcups.After a year or two of regular use, you may notice a small crack begin to form along the swivel joint housing (right below the size adjuster for the headband). This crack will slowly get larger and larger as it is used. If you do not take preventative action-- and do it properly-- it will completely fracture the swivel, and voila, your headphones have been murdered. The earcup now dangles freely off to the side if not jerry-rigged into place.The set that just broke on me was one I bought in late March of 2020. I had to replace my pads earlier than you would expect, in 2021. And today, they sadly passed onto the next plane of existence for non-sentient objects. In total, they lasted approximately three years and nine months. Whether that's a low or high lifespan, that's your call. If I had given it some attention and love, it may have lasted longer. I can't promise anything on that front, though. I've never tried fixes.Here's the takeaway: If you need a high-quality audio experience for cheap, these are your best friends. I can't tell you how much I love the way they sound. It's comfortable, too. The trade-off is durability; while the overall build quality may be high, a critical flaw will kill it within a few years after purchase. If that doesn't matter to you, guess what? These are your new favorites. I've been burned too many times though, so I'm moving on to (hopefully) greener pastures in M50-World, where they traded one design flaw for a seemingly less horrible one. Wish me luck!"
"The Good:-Good sound quality. Personally the highs can be a bit too strong for me, but that’s likely due to some of the music I listen to being mixed poorly. Other than that, they sound great.-Coiled cable is durable, I’m honestly impressed. I have not used the straight one much, but I would assume as much.-Good for all tasks: audio monitoring, media playback, gaming.-Decent adjustability on headbands and swivel. Could be better but it’s totally fine.The Bad:-Lasted a little longer than 2 years until hinges broke. Apparently common based on other reviews I’ve read.-The plastic on the ear cups started flaking about a year after buying it. Not only do these flakes get everywhere, are hard to get off due to it sticking easily and often come off in very small pieces (worryingly so, it makes me wonder how much plastic I may have accidentally ingested and inhaled), but the sound quality seemed to change once enough plastic came off, not just in frequencies, but sound isolation. If not due to some internal changes, then the effective durability of these cans was about 1 and a half years on my end. The change over time was so subtle that it’s possible that I’m underestimating the change in sound. Worse still is that the ear pad replacements are overpriced in my opinion. The headband will also flake but much slower.-For the first week or two, the clamping force was pretty rough on my head, which I consider fairly average for a guy. But they eventually became comfortable enough to spend a few hours straight with them on. Even so, some days they’ll feel a bit too tight for me so I’d have to take breaks. It does not help that the ear pads are not very cushiony, and I refuse to buy third party ear pads. They’re also slightly heavy. Not a major issue for me, however.-Ear cups will get pretty humid and warm, which I do not mind much, however they will require some cleaning once in a while. The problem is mostly that cleaning it might accelerate the flaking process, so be careful with that.Overall:I’d give this product 4 stars if they were durable for at least 5 years. If they vastly improved hinge durability, made flaking a non issue on the headbands, made the flaking process slower on the ear pads (about 2 years of heavy use) with the flakes falling off in larger chunks (at least a cm in diameter) rather than small pieces that stick to everything, with ear pad replacements being significantly cheaper ($15 at most), I’d recommend these to anyone. I could tolerate some of the discomfort after wearing these for a while. A few breaks are entirely fine and ultimately healthy to get a stretch. But the durability is the primary issue on these cans, if they significantly improve it I’d, be willing to pay $120 for them. Other than that, they nailed everything else for the price.Buy if you are willing to replace these every 2 years, willing to replace the ear pads each year, and if you can deal with some discomfort after the first week or two of extreme discomfort (if your head is big enough). Other than that, I cannot fully recommend these until durability improves significantly."
Sound quality is exceptional for the price but the the earpads fell apart after several years of moderate usage
"After some use with these headphones I'm revising my review.**Sound Quality**The sound on these is great if you're used to Beats By Dre. If you think Beats are wonderful, you'll likely be more than happy with these. If you like Beats and don't get why high-end audio nuts hate them, these will be great for you.The sound quality isn't bad - it's not, really. The bass is very thumpy but this comes at the expense of being muddy with poor separation or clarity. Watch reviews on YouTube from InnerFidelity or Z Reviews for the M40x/M50x to see what people say who are used to hearing better sound from equally priced cans. The M50x is more or less the M40x with heavier bass.That said, the mids and highs are certainly listenable and enjoyable. Once I used my EQ to lower the lower frequencies they mellowed out and weren't too bad for this price range. You can find better headphones for this range, but these aren't bad and better than Beats that cost 2/3 times as much.**Build & Style**The build quality is great. It's plastic, but it's a sturdy plastic that doesn't make you go ""Hmm will these snap if I wear them on my large head or toss in my backpack?"" They can take a bit of tossing around. I don't treat my stuff harshly, but these are plenty sturdy.Style wise they're pretty cool. Certainly something you can wear on the street and the Audio-Technica name is one that most people will at least recognize as being a good brand.**The Bad Stuff**There are a few things that prompted me to give these away:- One: The clamping is way too hard. After about a half hour of these things I was sporting a nice headache from the clamping pressure. I'm not one of these guys that will just about destroy something to make it fit better, so going to town trying to bend the headband was right out. Considering that the Custom One Pro from Beyer Dynamic sounds much, much better for just a bit more money (or buy them second hand - second hand headphones are fine if you get them from someone you trust) and the poor clarity these offer, I parted with them easily.- Two: Muddy bass. I wasn't expecting a soundstage - these are closed cans and can't be judged for lacking something they simply cannot by design have. However, the clarity on these things was on the good side of mediocre. Many reviewers on YouTube state this headphone is great for reference or mixing - believe me, having worked in audio production, they're simply not a headphone you can use for reference work. They sound good for most teens and Beats lovers but they are not in the same league as a reference headphone and the clarity in the frequency response simply isn't at a high enough grade to be useful. It's that dang bass that sort of ruins really enjoying the other stuff.- Three: They have small earcups. Like, these things brush my ears on the top, back, and bottom and I have regular sized ears. They feel more like large on-ear headphones than circumaural (over-ear) ones. Every time I put them on I had to take a few seconds positioning them around my ears to get them comfortable enough to enjoy the music. You can buy replacement pads that may resolve this, I can't testify to those since I didn't bother, but after-market earpads may affect sound, isolation, and comfort so be mindful if you go that route.Overall, these headphones are not bad, but they don't live up to the hype that seems to have popped up around them. You can certainly do worse, and if you buy them as a gift for your nephew of something they will likely be very pleased with them. But for adults who want good sound and good comfort, you need to look elsewhere."
"Bottom line: These aren't bad headphones but they're not outstanding; they sound very good when you consider the under-$100 price tag. While they claim to be ""flat"" for studio work, I found them a bit dull and bass heavy. I wouldn’t mix with them. They distort (especially on loud piano) and tend to run instruments together rather than keeping them separate and well defined in various areas of the soundstage. The bass is a bit muddy. If you mostly listen to rock and EDM, these might be just the headphones you’re looking for. There probably aren’t many headphones that can beat them for around $77. I burned mine in for about 15 hours before I returned them and they kept sounding better and better.The cups on the M40x turn 90 degrees, but also flop up and down and all around and are sometimes just a big squirrely mess. They are made to push up a little into the open space of the headband for storage, but that just makes them act like a runaway slinky sometimes. Their plastic mounts provide no tension whatsoever to keep them in place—your head has to do that. If your head is not in between them, they sometimes flop around like a couple of fish. Quirky!Presentation: They come in a nice box that contains a soft carrying case, two twist-in proprietary cords (one shorter and one longer coiled cord, both of which terminate in a 3.5mm plug, which can be coupled with the included screw-in 1/4 inch adapter if needed)—making the headphone-to-music-source connection secure. The band that goes from ear cup to ear cup is metal, allowing for adjustments without fear of breaking. The ear pads are covered in a soft faux leather material.Enhancements recommended: Adding a headphone amp does wonders for these headphones. For instance, after using them for a week plugged directly into the jack of my Macbook Air (early 2014), I added to the mix the Fiio E10K (Olympus 2) Digital/Analogue Converter Amplifier ($76 from Amazon) and found it greatly extended the volume and range. Even though these are low-impedance headphones (they will play quite well while being driven by your smart phone or a computer), they are not nearly as loud as my Sennheiser HD 598Cs (which are really re-branded HD 569s).Comparisons: 1. I own a pair of Koss Porta-Pros that I can wear for 12 hours straight without head fatigue. They’re incredibly light and amazing headphones for the price ($40 from Amazon), yet maybe a step down in audio quality from the Audio Technica M40x headphones, which are twice as expensive. The M40x are not as comfortable to wear; I have to rest every hour or so. If you stretch the headband (it’s metal so it can handle a lot of adjustment) to reduce the pressure on your head from the ear cups, you flatten out the top band and put more pressure on the top of your head. 2. I also own a pair of Sennheiser HD 598Cs. The Sennheisers produce less distortion and yield better separation between instruments, meaning that they sound truer, and better overall. In an A/B comparison, the Sennheisers sound a little mid-rangy (but the Fiio amp comes with a bass-boost lever that gives you an extra 3db of bass). The ATH-M40x and the Sennheiser HD 598Cs are about equal for comfort; their closed design means they have to put pressure on your head to seal properly. I need to rest my head about every hour.Returned: After about a week of use, I noticed a subtle rattle in the left earphone. Rattle is not quite the right word, but an audible sound that should not be there . . . a bit like the sound you’d get off a snare drum that’s sitting too close to the bass speaker—way over in the corner and almost unnoticeable, but there on every song, nonetheless. This was a bit disappointing, because I was getting to like these floppy, quirky earphones."
The sound quality is amazing - very clean.  My last headphones were the M-30's and these do sound much better.  The build quality makes no sense.  The earpads fell to pieces after 4 days.  I already have to fix them and only got them 5 days ago.  They look terrible but sound great.
"I don't know quite how to write this review.  It really depends on how sensitive you are about audiophile quality.  I, unfortunately, am completely sensitive and obsessed with flat and true sound; accuracy, to a fault..  I want to hear music, not speaker deficiencies.These are VERY good for the money.  I would imagine that most people won't hear the deficiencies.  I am pretty much OCD about this type of thing.  It took me three years and $4,000 to build a flat system in my car (old school Eclipse, Boston Acoustics C6 with 400 Watts of MB Quart driving the fronts alone, JL in the rear, dual 12"" etc etc.blah blah (over 1000W RMS with very VERY low impedance)  I am obsessed with accurate audio.  I repeat, I don't want to hear speakers, I want to hear correct imaging with a flat EQ (no deficiencies in how the sound is represented.)All of that being said, I purchased the ATH-M40x for my headphone computer and portable needs, primarily based on specs and reviews of comfort compared to the ATH-M50x (I want the detachable cables and I wear glasses.)  I really think I would prefer the extra 5mm on the driver of the 50x.  I am trying to replace my Sennheiser 380HD Pro's that got stolen.  There simply is no comparison on the accuracy and the smoothness and depth of the highs and lows of the Sennheisers (yes, I broke the 40's in properly.)  Absolutely no comparison.If you value audiophile quality, the Sennheiser 380's are the way to go.  You give up cable options even though the Senns have a detachable cable like the AT 50x or 40x.The Audio Technica ATH-M40x's are VERY comfortable and light, but seriously, go  Sennheiser 380's if you can handle a tighter fit on your head in exchange for phenomenally accurate sound.Do you want ""good"" with really good comfort, or mostly comfortable with audiophile quality?  If the latter is your choice, go with the 380's. They  are outstanding.  If you don't have a freakishly sensitive ear, the ATH-M40X is a great buy. I may try the 50x, but the Sennheiser cans are proven outstanding to me already.  They are bliss.As for the the 40x:Pros:Very comfortable and lightweightPassable sound for mostCons:Sound leakage90 degree rotation instead of 180 degree (and the 90 degree is in the wrong direction, going outward instead of toward the chest)Weak bass response without an ampSlight distortion at reasonable listening volumeI will be reordering the Sennheiser 380HD Pro's for only $30 more.  No comparison on sound quality. ATH-M50X may be good, but many complaints about comfort.  Read the reviews.Darn these proprietary cables..."
"With reading some favorable review that I bought this headphone for using with computers. After couple weeks of using it, I found it to be a so so headphone and not as good as many of other reviews indicated. I need a good pair of headphones for home usage and share with the kids who fights over with a old pair of $55 Sony MDR XB500 most of the time. ATH-M40X looks great and seems to be better design and built compared to the MDR XB500, and it is more stylish also. However, the ATH-M40X has some of major draw backs, ear cushions are relative hard and caused uncomfortable for me in an hour or so, and the kids complained the same thing. Perhaps this is because that I have an extra large head so it is relatively tight even with the widest adjustment, but the kids feels it the same way even though they don't even pull the adjustment. The Sony ear cushion is probably then time softer and feels much better but the ATH-M40X isolate and reduce the noise much better than the Sony.  Another major drawback is the complexity of the swivel design. Every time I take it off and try to put it on again, I have to align the two ear cup before put it on my head because it always flip 180 degree downward constantly into the opposite position. Kids find it very awkward to use and I loath this design feature.The sound quality is very good but nothing to brag about. The bass is not as good nor strong as my Sony but I feel it is fine with general use as you can simply adjust the bass with computer control. I love the long cords which given me lots of room for movement, and the removable connection on the left ear cup is a great feature nevertheless. Many review praise the ATH-M50X as one of the great headphone and some of reviews indicated the sound quality is similar to the ATH-50X. If that is true, than the ATH-M50X is definitely not worth the extra $60 as the design and function is almost identical to the ATH-M40X. But then again, I have not try the ATH-M50X. However, the mechanical design of the ATH-M50X ear cups flipping would be expected as they share the same mechanism.Overall I rate it as a good pair of headphone but I would suggest people buying it should go to audio stores to test many headphones out before deciding on it. If the company can use softer ear cushions, design the swivel with a resistance locking function, which may increase the cost by only a few dollars, it would be a much user friendly headphone. Perhaps even increase the sound quality a little, than it would be a great pair of headphones."
"I've had these headphones for five years and have never been that fond of the sound quality, even less fond of how the earpad areas collapse and swivel for DJs (must be a lot of DJs and wannabes in the world because all Audio-technicas seem to do the same).First off, I wasn't expecting a hi-fi headphone at this price level, however I was expecting something bordering that with the rave reviews I read on Amazon and elsewhere.I put the headphones on and wasn't impressed, but new they had to be burned in (yes, burn-in is a very real thing and varies between headphone models). So I burned them in, and sound improved quite a bit, but I still wasn't impressed and would only use the headphones occasionally.I pulled them out again to give them a listen, but I still am not impressed in the least. Unlike most people, I find these headphones to be fairly muddy. They aren't the worst, but they are no where as clear as people claim. These are fairly bass-heavy, if that's important too you, but the bass isn't as clear and defined as I would expect.Sound separation isn't that great. I also find the highs to be fairly piercing, yet not musical at all.Overall, I give these a 3 out of 5. Sound is 3.5. The annoying way the earpieces fold and twist, and sometimes how difficult and annoying it can be to get both in the correct position to put on your head, well I give that a 2.Clamp force is also very high on these and I find I can't wear them very long with any comfort (Two hours max and I'm done). I'd give that a 2."
"I had a pair of M30x for about 10 years before the sliding connection point above one of the ear cups broke. I had this pair of M40x for 11 months before that same piece broke. By adding the extra pivot point of the cups being able to swivel around adds extra stress to the joint.Anyways, wicked disappointed that the limited warranty doesn't cover bad design, only defects. Bye bye $100.Audio quality is good. I like that it shipped with a straight and a coiled cable. The cushions feel nice. But now they're unusable, and it's not an easy home fix."
"We really love these headphones.  I looked back over our order history to see where we had purchased 5 of these since 2012.  We have to replace them about every 2 years (or sooner) due to the ear piece breaking off right where the swivel is located. All it takes is a twist in the wrong direction and they snap right at the point that makes them unusable after that.  Searching for a better design, especially for teens or young adults."
"I love Audio-Technica headphones. Been using them for the past 8 years. I have tried the ATHM30x and ATHM50x and when the bands on my 50x got too worn, I decided to give the 40x ones a try. Right off the bat, the headphones are heavier than the 30x but a lot stiffer than both the 30x and the 50x. I prefer the fit of the 30x and the quality of the 50x but I thought I'd give it a try nonetheless. Sound quality is good as to be expected. I'm no audiophile so I can't give an in depth critique of the sound quality but it sounds good to me. The highs are there, the bass sounds great - Audio Technica headphones checked the three simple boxes I needed, which was to be comfortable, sound good, and be durable. Everything was peachy...that is, until the 1 year mark.Some background: I've treated all my headphones (excluding the cheap earphones for travel) very preciously, wiped them whenever I could to prevent oils, put them on and took them off somewhat gingerly to make sure I don't accidentally snap anything, and hung them at a dedicated corner where it won't be accidentally knocked off or anything. By all accounts, the headphones should've lasted at least another year or two without any issues.One day, all of a sudden, I put them on and heard a snap sound. Not good. The left cup was left dangling from the band, with the joint/swivel cap connecting the cup to the band completely shattered into pieces. The headphones still worked except I couldn't actually put them on. I was shocked since AT headphones are known for their quality. I didn't treat them roughly or put them on in a hurry or anything. I've tried contacting them to see if the 2 year warranty applies so I can maybe get a replacement since repair seems unlikely and put this behind me. Until then, I guess I should rethink trying out the classic Sony MDRs or finally try the openbacked Grados I've heard about. I gave a 3 star since it did work great for a year and didn't cause any problems until just recently. I'll update if they reach out and offer a response but I just feel disappointed knowing my absolute faith in AT headphones' durability shattered. Maybe I just got unlucky but since these 40x are stiffer than the others, keep that in mind when buying these if you tend to be a bit (or a lot) rough with your headphones.Edit: Updated from 3 stars to 1. They just replied with the most insincere, cookie cutter response and gave me a link to their website to get a repair. Not only is the service policy outdated and makes repairs practically worthless unless you bought a super expensive pair and/or had only used it for a few months and didn't get much value out of them yet. Since the swivel broke so randomly, I don't want to have to go through the trouble of getting it repaired if it might not even be included in the warranty (you have to pay for the repair estimate if they decide not to fix it) or break again in a short while. All in all, massively disappointed in AT. Guess I'll need to do more research into what headphones I need to buy next to replace the m40x.Tldr; The M40x honestly isn't worth it. Spend the extra dozens to get the 50x which is massively popular and is time-tested to be good, maybe buy the cheaper 30x if you have a tight budget or just get some other brands. The swivel on this one seems to be much weaker than the other ones and will easily break even if you don't put much stress on it. You do not want to have to deal with their repair service because it's garbage."
"Perhaps it was a match not meant to be.  I picked these up as a replacement to a pair of 20 year old Sony monitors that had seen better days, and wound up keeping the Sony's despite the M40x's being objectively better.I have little to complain about the build quality, design, or features of the M40x.  They feel substantial and durable, and I have no doubt they would last a very long time if treated well.  Included cords are great.  Swivel joints are tight and beefy.  They clamp extremely tight, making them uncomfortable after less than an hour of wearing them.  No doubt they will loosen over time, as other reviewers have noted and improvements after spending a night stretched over a box suggests, so I won't count that against them.  The pads are a bit hard and narrow, which concentrates pressure over a smaller surface area, contributing to their discomfort.  It's often recommended to buy more comfortable 3rd party replacements, but for nearly half the cost of M40x I find this is an unreasonable expense.Most importantly, however, the sound is, shall we say, not compatible with me.  They have excellent clarity: I can pick out recording artifacts and background sounds from familiar songs I never noticed with the old Sony's.  Cymbals drop off in a brilliant shimmer.  Bass isn't pronounced but is not lacking when pushed either via song or EQ.  Vocals, especially females, are a bit diminished, but some EQ finagling fixed most of that.  They are definitely interesting to listen to and, to my ear, reproduces recordings faithfully.  The M40x excels at analyzing every detail of the sound, but to my annoyance that's all they're good at for me.These headphones put me squarely as an observer to the music: very much outside the music looking in, listening but not experiencing.  I found it impossible to lose myself in the records I love to immerse myself in.  Instead i'm pushed into a small room to study the sounds, denied the ability to be part of the musical experience.  Many have commented on the M40x's tiny soundstage, and I completely agree.  I found it suffocating.  I found zero joy during the 24+ hours I tested these.  I didn't notice any ""burn in"" improvement over that time.  Some say breaking these in takes patience -- dozens of hours -- but without progress I quickly soured on the idea.  I wasn't enjoying my time with them anyway so I gave up and returned them.I suppose the fault is mine.  These are very much what they're designed and marketed to be: highly technical studio mixing/mastering headphones.  I thought that's what I wanted as I enjoy learning more about a song each time I hear it.  In my opinion their strengths make them ill-suited for simply enjoying music.Here are some example albums I auditioned with the M40x, if anyone is curious what I tried these with: Dark Side of the Moon and A Momentary Lapse of Reason by Pink Floyd, Time Out by Dave Brubeck Quartet, Heligoland by Massive Attack, Play by Moby, Perceptions of Pacha by Goldfish, Far by Regina Spektor, Gorillaz eponymous album, Come Away With Me by Norah Jones, Sehnsucht by Rammstein.  Didn't amp these headphones as I don't have one and didn't plan to get one.  Played on a full size PC, laptop, and smartphone without differing results."
"Typically I tend to get 2-4 years out of any given pair of headphones, these didn't last 1 before one of the plastic joints broke in way that leaves them inoperable, these rarely left my desk, or bed, settings I would not consider as high strain environments. Otherwise decent sound, and comfort. It's a shame."
"I've had my set of M40x's for about a year and a half.I'll be up front- I'm not an audiophile. I can't tell you all the intricate in's and out's of the bass, trebble, etc. This is a layman's perspective- I work from a home studio and also game, so I wanted a high quality headset I could keep on my head for prolonged periods while delivering rich quality sound. I can happily say these delivered well on that end. The sound is superb and all encompassing, and the bass is strong, which is good cause I like bass.Up until recently I would have also told you the construction and quality was superb. As it stands, I gotta talk about the swivel joints.Unlike the 20x and 30x headphones, the M40x's have collapsible cups. When not in use, you can basically fold them in to be compact or lay them on the desk. It's neat, but in practice the swivel joints that make this all possible are a royal pain- the headset finds a way to be ""tangled"", where after pulling it off your head you'll need to spend a couple moments trying to get it all properly aligned. The joints are all very loose, and spin and clack about if you don't handle it by the cups. I did handle them very carefully- these things were above and beyond the quality of my actual PC speakers and were precious to me. They only ever stayed at my desk where I worked or played games, never leaving that 4 foot radius. That didn't stop the swivel joints on one cup from shattering anyways. There was no accident, abuse or gross mishandling- one morning I got up, prepared to put them on and idly noticed how one of them was just dangling all over a sudden.Look at the photos I included- the little joint that lets the cups swivel and fold just cracked apart into several pieces and suddenly all that connected the cup to the rest of the headset were the vulnerable wires.The Audio Technica service is nothing to write home about, either. Shortly after this happened, I took the pictures, gathered up my proof of purchase from Amazon and sent them an email detailing the situation, the damage, the photos, the proof of purchase, etc- and got a boilerplate response notifying me while they would accept repairs, I'd have to do this all over again but on a sheet, and I'd be covering the shipping to send the broken product to them. Due to the nature of their warranty, what constitutes product failure is vaguely worded and if your return is deemed outside of warranty, you'll be fronting the bill for any repairs. On top of that, if they decide they don't like your repair estimate, they'll send it back to you without repair and fine you 30$ for the trouble.So basically you're at the mercy of whether or not they even want to fix your product, potentially paying upward of 30$+ shipping expenses for nothing but a refusal of service. At this point I'd almost rather I just bought a new set and guarantee that money goes towards a replacement which is frankly what they're banking on anyway, but the price has increased, too! I bought these a year and a half ago for 80$- now they're 100$.In short, the ATH-M40x is a fantastic set of headphones up until they suddenly break. At which point, you're on your own. I'm not sure if that's worth the trouble of paying 100$ for another set that will break again in a year or two. Perhaps I'm just unlucky, but I'm not going to gamble on these again.P.S The cup pads in my photos are white because I swapped out the stock ones for some noise insulating pair."
"I paid $99 for these headphones and was impressed with the sound quality for that price.Unfortunately, the build quality and durability of the headphones does not meet my expectations for this price range. The headphone construction is entirely brittle plastic, including all of the parts of the mechanism that allow the ear cups to pivot and rotate, except for a thin metal band that runs through the headband. You can see in the attached picture that after 3 years of use, the brittle plastic of the rotating mechanism finally failed and broke apart. They were never dropped, traveled with, packed in a bag, or handled roughly; they were only used at my desk and handled with care, so I think this is a good reference for the length of time that these plastic headphones can stay intact.I specifically chose to purchase the more expensive ATH-M40x instead of the cheaper ATH-M30x because of the detachable headphone cable feature. I thought that being able to replace the cable would extend the life of these headphones, however all this meant was that the cable will now outlive the plastic headphones and continue to be used with my next pair of headphones (V-MODA Crossfade LP2)"
"The sound is pretty balanced after 200hz but they have no low end, which is sadly an issue with most monitoring headphones. I also hate headphones that flip upside down. They are comfortable but if your ears are even slightly bigger than usual, they will not fit well. Lastly, it doesn't prevent outside sound from getting in very well."
"I have a pair of the original Audio Technica Ath M30 headphones I bought more than 10 years ago from Amazon for $29. Well, recently I got a bug up my nose and decided it was time to replace them with the new M40x. Z gave a big thumbs up to them over at histube claiming they were everything the M50x's were claimed to be. Detachable cables. Foldable like yogamama. Wider frequency range than Mama's Cass. More neutral than a Russian Spy. Z is quite the talker.  I bit!Well, First thing I noticed was the build quality. I had figured that because the price had went from $29 to the current $99 for the upscale M40x's that they would be at least equal in build quality to my M30's. Buzzer Sound!!! Not even close. In comparison, the new M40x is a toy. Nothing professional about it. Sound? The Bass is bloated. The Mids are hiding under a blanket. The highs are sibilant. Nothing neutral about the M40x. Cheesy cables that make my old but like new M30 Cable... OFC/Spring loaded Litz Wire look like a high-end exotic cable for my Sennheiser HD580 Jubilees. I think I will wander on over to Eastbay and pick up a used pair of M30's for spare parts.  Gotta go.... Found a very clean used set of ATH M40FS headphones for $30. Somebody at Audio Technica should be ashamed of themselves. Their entry level headphones used to be a lot better than they are now. Surely they could have kept them to a high standard by tripling their price as they did. Greed is a fickle bitch. Perhaps the ATH MSR7 is what the Dr. ordered at 10 times the price of what I paid for my ATH M30's. I am beginning to think the Global Economy Sucks."
"The audio quality is pretty good, but as others have mentioned, the hinges aren't very durable and break after about two years, making the headphones unwearable."
"I ordered these as a gift for my wife. She wanted some headphones like mine (ath-m50) with removable cord, and a mic. I saw that the m40x's had better reviews than the m50x's so I got them and a vmoda boom mic. The problem is that the connector to the headphones essentially nullifies all the benefits of a removable cable. It's not a standard 3.5mm cable, it's a 2.5mm jack with a special locking lug that prevents you from using a standard cable. So don't lose it, damage it, or forget it at home, or you're not going to be able to use these. No picking up an aux cord at the gas station. Even if you find a 2.5mm to 3.5mm cord or adapter, the locking lug prevents it from fitting properly in the jack.Also, the jack isn't fully seated unless locked, so if you're thinking of getting these because you're afraid of breaking a cable because you forget you're wearing headphones and stand up, forget about these. You have to lock the cable to use them, so you don't get the quick-release safety.The good news is that if you're good with diy, there's a great video on YouTube for converting the jack over to a 3.5mm jack with very minor (and reversible) modification, and it only requires a $5 part you can get here on Amazon.As they don't currently work for our purposes, we haven't tested the sound quality yet, so that's not reviewed here. I trust they'll sound great like most reviews say, but if not I'll be reversing the conversion and returning them."
"These are comfortable to wear and provide great sound reproduction and isolation.  The problem with these is that the ear phones were designed to swivel, flip and fold (to be compact).  Those are really nice features if you travel a lot and need them to be compact.  But, for a home studio they're a pain in the butt every time you go to grab them and they're flipped and folded every which way.  But, great sound and isolation!"
"I bought these headphones for use as a DJ to replace my old pair from another company. I've been using them for just over a week and decided it's time for a review. I'm impressed with the build quality. My old pair of headphones are a little larger than these so to me these are fairly compact and sleek for over ear headphones. The headband is metal and maybe a little stiff giving a firm clamp force that was a little achy to wear at first but now I don't notice it.  The headband and ear pads are soft and cushy but feel durable. I don't anticipate the material to flake off like my old headphones.  The ear cups and the yokes connecting them to the headband are plastic.  The yokes may be an issue, only time will tell.I'm sorry to say there are two things I don't like about these headphones. First, I'm not a fan of swiveling ear cups.  It's nice that you can hang the headphones around your neck with the cups swiveled out away from your chin but putting them back on your head can be difficult because they can fold into weird positions if you're not careful.  Second, the sound quality is lacking in detail/treble. These are my first pair of ""flat"" headphones. The bass and mid range are well represented but the high frequency is subdued.  As a result the sound is muddy, lacking detail. This can be corrected with a graphic EQ program on my laptop but not on most stand alone devices like my DJ mixer.These are OK and I can make use of them but I'm continuing my search for headphones more suited to my needs."
"When looking for new headphones I was hesitant on getting one with hinges but friends advised me this pair should last a long time. It in fact, did not last a long time. They're very high quality headphones and the best ones I've ever had but now they won't stay on my head because less than a year after purchase the hinge broke from me simply leaning my head on the wall.These are very high quality headphones for how they sound, but this pair is way too delicate and breaking in less than a year for a $100 pair is really bad."
"Super overhyped headphones, really disappointed.  It's reverse of audiophile headphones where people notice more in their music.  When comparing them to my other current headphones, the m40x loses the clarity and you hear less.If you want straight up better sounding, more comfortable headphones for $40 instead, try the JVC HARX700.  They're super ugly, but sound great for price.For vastly improved sound, same $99 price range, try the Sennheiser HD 559 Open Back (Sounds amazing with any music/games too and more comfortable)  Head and shoulders above these headphones in all regards (except sound isolation of course)Or for real cheap, Monoprice Premium Hi-Fi Dj headphones are pretty much on par with these (but those are super uncomfortable and you'll end up having to macgyver them for comfort.I would give these 2 stars, but it's overhyped and need to balance out the ratings with 1 star.  I think these people are so determined to believe these sound good after paying 100 that they rave about how good is sounds.  These are super unimpressive.  I've used neutral, studio monitors.  These are really just lifeless, muddy, unclear.  I haven't burned these in yet so they also strobe in and out with bass too.  If they improve with burn in, I can't imagine it's more than 2-3 stars at best.  They're OK at best with or without my AudioEngine AMP/DAC.Comfort:Mediocre 3 stars.  Super light, but still put pressure on the top of your head.  Mostly forget about the pressure after a while, but notice the pressure after a couple hours.  Pads should be replaced with something thicker and more comfortable, alleviates some of the pressure on top.Sound:Mediocre at best 3, 2 star for this price range.  Muddy, lacking clarity.  Slightly scooped sounding mids,bass not crisp yet and a little distorted, the highs are not really clean or bright- it's a bit dull even for neutral.  These are a step back from testing against my JVC or 3 steps back from sound quality and comfort of my Sennheisers.Sound Isolation:5 stars- this is the only thing is has going for it compared to my current headphones.  They actually have better isolation and passive noise cancellation than the ANC headphones I tried, which is why I'm hanging onto them still.I'll update in a week after putting a good 80 hours in on them."
"Decided to upgrade from the M20x.  The M40x lasted about two years, shedding the covering of the headphone pads all over the place.  Then the hinge broke after simply picking them up.  I'm always obsessively careful with my headphones.I gave them the benefit of the doubt and bought a second set (I was in the middle of testing several audio plugins I was developing and didn't want what I was hearing to change by much).  This is when I realized the first set massively lost its audio quality over time (possibly due to the shedding pads?), listening through the new headphones absolutely blew me away with how much bass I was suddenly hearing and I recognized that as how the first set sounded when I first got it.But, as it turns out, this new set is a defect.  There's an incredibly deep notch in the frequency spectrum in *only* the right ear at around 350 Hz.  Because of this, all 100% mono audio that has content nearby 350 Hz is now stereo, with that part sounding like it is panned sharply to the left (~-50%).  It's infuriating to be a full-time plugin developer who now can't even tell when a sound is mono because all mono sounds are now stereo.I'm also living in a situation where returning them isn't an option, so I'll be stuck with these for the next couple years.  Or less, if the hinge decides to break before then."
"These headphones sound absolutely amazing. Better than anything I've ever heard. Supposedly, they are the best closed back headphones you can get at this price range. And I am inclined to believe that. They come with a leather (possibly real) carrying bag, a comically long straight cord, and an annoyingly sized spiral cord. The spiral cord went down to my knees with my music player in my pocket, making it not ideal for commuting. I purchased a much shorter cord for my commute for around $10. Very impressed overall.However, these broke on me after 3 and a half months of use. I took them off and SNAP, a piece of the hinge on my left side snapped, leaving wires exposed and the headphones unwearable (they still work). Throughout my ownership of these cans, whenever I moved the ear cups, there was a cracking sound, like the plastic was screaming for help. I thought that this was just an odd feature, but I now believe it to be a design or manufacturing flaw. I am unsure if Audio Technica and/or Amazon would cover this under a warranty or not. I do not have the budget to pay them to fix it, buy new headphones, or waste money shipping the headphones back and forth to possibly get a free repair done. So, I will probably have to do a crappy epoxy or tape job to fix these, as I absolutely cannot stand to listen to dollar store ear buds anymore.I bought these headphones not only because of the sound, but because I was led to believe that these were extremely durable headphones that would last me years to come. That is perfect, because I used these on my daily commute, brought them camping, took them halfway across the US with me, and I used them for practicing my instruments. But alas, they did not last, so I cannot recommend these headphones with their current build quality, unless you are to only use them at your desk. And at that point, you might as well buy more expensive, better sounding headphones (not that these sound bad, because they don't). I am impressed, but at the same time thoroughly disappointed in this product. I cannot recommend these to your average consumer. Consume at your own risk."
"Recently, my old headphones broke and I was in the market for a new pair.  After doing a good deal of research, I decided that these headphones, combined with some $20 Brainwavz earpads, was a good bang for my buck for an under $200 headphone setup and had the highest probability of satisfying my desired use cases.Within 4 hours of using them, I discovered that I was wrong.The sound quality of the headphones is fine.  I think these are very capable in terms of sound stage and frequency profile and brightness and bass.  For under $100, these headphones provide phenomenal sound quality and they're what save this from a 1 star review.  The build quality also feels fine.  I wouldn't expect these to break any time soon because the material used is all high quality and shows no signs of instability or lack of structural integrity.However, the main drawback of these headphones is their comfort level, and this is such a severe drawback that it completely kills my desire to use them.  I can't have these on my head for longer than an hour without developing a headache.  The clamp force is absolutely ridiculous, and the pads press against my glasses which makes my temples incredibly sore.  They're a little bit more comfortable when I don't have my glasses on, but then I can't see anything, so that's not really an option for me.My hope was that the replacement earpads that I got would make these headphones wearable for a reasonable amount of time.  And they definitely make the headphones more comfortable, but that isn't saying much.  They didn't alleviate the clamp force, they didn't make the headaches go away, and as a result they didn't make the headphones usable.Bottom line: if comfort is a priority for you, and if you wear glasses, stay away from these headphones.  No replacement earpads will remedy the vice grip that it has on your head.  These were very disappointing, and I cannot recommend them to anyone who wants their headphones to feel good."
"Like many others, I enjoyed these headphones for a couple of years until the plastic hinge broke. Now they're useless.Unlike some others, I will not be purchasing these headphones again, or any like them from Audio-Technica. If I were conspiratorially minded, I'd think it was planned obsolescence.Either way, it's a critical design flaw. If you are looking for headphones that will last, look elsewhere."
"I've been using these for like a year now. Honestly, the only reason to give them a 3 star review over a single star is because they are durable as all gosh darn heck, which is worth a lot.However, they're lacking in a lot of ways. The comfort level is extremely low. Wearing these for multiple hours will cause the weight of the phones themselves to pull the top bar down on your head. It gets pretty painful after a bit, and this isn't just a problem that I have. There's just no buffer or cushion there. It's plastic / metal wrapped in pleather.In addition, the cable they come with is extremely heavy and will get super in the way if you plan to do any gaming with them. Not to mention, it's bound to the left side so unless your PC is there you're gonna have to run a cable either around your desk, across the floor under your chair, or over your lap. But putting it in your lap is hard because the length of the cable is weird and it's all curly and heavy in the middle, meaning it will usually just slide off.We won't even talk about the sound much. They sound god awful for the price, but if you're here you probably don't care.Just don't bother. Do a little more research and get something you'll actually be happy with in the long run dude. Audio Technica is not a good brand. You're paying for a name."
"I bought these ATH-M40x Pro headphones to use for my computer audio when gaming, and paired them with the FiiO E10K USB DAC and Headphone Amplifier, so that the pc's audio is processed outside of the pc, and I have liked them - at the least, they sound better than the cheap phones found at all general stores. I have never compared these phones to more expensive (presumably higher quality) headphones. I also realize that the sound quality which I hear is based on the quality of the sound audio that the Fiio DAC is receiving from the pc. I am enjoying the hearing the lowest freq. tones in rock and music from video games, and that they are not muddled. High frequencies sound crisp and nicely defined too. I'm also glad that I bought these on sale for $69 last year during the T-giving sales, as I would be disappointed if I paid full price last year.Cons: After a year of daily and easy use, the surface of the ear pads are now starting to crumble forward of the tragus lobes of the ear lobes. Also, the head pads do not surround the ear; they press against the entire ear lobe and as a result my ear lobes get tired of the pressure after about an hour. I will not buy these again, but I'm not going to replace them either. These will continue to be my daily-use headphones for my pc. I'm disappointed that I now have to buy replacement ear pads after 10 months of light/easy use."
"PRO's - For the price, this is the best sound quality. Not base heavy but that is a plus for me. It has a great sound balance and as a DJ, that is what I was looking for. I really like how they fold up and that they are reversible so you can listen without putting them on.CON's - They are a tight fit, but I would prefer that to the opposite. I imagine they are going to lose their tension with use. Just like shoes, they need to be broken in.The biggest fail is the audio connector of the headphones themselves. From the pictures, I thought it took a 1/4 inch connector. Instead it takes a 3.5mm connector but has a proprietary locking function. Because of this you can only use Audio-Technica cables. I was planning on using a small direct plug bluetooth adapter to turn them into a wireless headset. I understand the purpose of the connector and I like the idea. I would have hoped they would include an adapter that would allow you to use any standard cable. After a short search I found an adapter for an additional $35. That is a huge addition to the cost. A+ on the idea, F on the execution.If using their cables is not an issue for you, I recommend them. If you want to do anything outside of the norm, unfortuntely, I would look elsewhere. I would have given it 2.5 stars if I was able."
"My old Sennheiser HD 280s were finally becoming unusable after 10 years, so I wanted to get something new for about the same price. I went with these Audio-Technica headphones because they had such good reviews. I don't really understand why. They don't sound like true studio monitors, and they aren't designed in such a way that you can wear them for several hours without getting a headache.When comparing them to my old Sennheiser headphones, I noticed that these seemed to really emphasize frequencies below 30Hz and above 12kHz.  They don't make for a pleasant listening experience or, I feel, a very accurate monitor.Unfortunately, I'm overseas, so returning these is not a possibility."
"These headphones sound great and everyone knows it. You won't have any issues with that.The build quality is the total opposite.I've had two pairs break in the same spot: the plastic connector between one of the driver housings and the headband. A part that's supposed to move freely and be adjustable, and is essential to the structural integrity of the headphones.Breaking aside, the experience of using these headphones is affected by the cheap plastic parts.If you move around a lot you'll hear cracking/creaking as the headphones adjust and the plastic parts rub against each other. I thought this issue would go away with time, but after a year it was still happening.Avoid these headphones if you work in a large studio, and you're constantly turning in your chair or getting up and moving around. Headphones are connected by a wire, so it only takes one forgetful moment to accidentally knock them to the floor, where they'll probably break and be unusable.As a longtime Audio-Technica user, I'll be replacing mine with something else."
"Love them, they're honestly too good at inactive noise cancellation for my liking, but if that's what you're after then hopefully you'll enjoy it. unfortunately my pair when connected via 3.5mm, whenever sound starts, emits a sudden high frequency sound from the left earphone, where the wire connects. I've troubleshot the issue and can't crack it, really holds them back and will be resold early because of it."
"Purchased these in July of 2017. I'm not an audiophile, but I am a choir director that does have to mix audio on a semi-regular basis. Audio quality was sufficient for my use. I used these as my everyday headphones for 4 years. (Used them for video games as well.) The coating on the ear cups started to fail just after a year, but was a cosmetic problem only. The ligament that connects the headphones to the band failed just recently rendering them unusable. Don't really feel any of those failures should result in losing a star. They did their job for a long time. In fact I'm buying another pair.EDIT: This is approximately one year after the purchase of my second pair. The same ligament/connector failure has occurred on this pair. Pretty disappointing, but for the sake of this review I've bought another pair. Downgraded to 3 stars, but if this pair makes it a similar distance to the first pair I will change to 4 stars. I really do like them aside from this longevity issue."
"Ok, so I've had these for a while now, and I feel like I can do a proper review of these. All I can say is that they have enough bass, I am not a bass head so these are good. Also, for the sound quality not impressed, people praise these like if they were the best headphones. But I don't hear that, they say that they have great sound quality so that you can hear things that you never heard on your music, well I have them hooked up to my rig at the moment and I can hear as much detail in these as I can hear on my tv. So don't be impressed when you get these and you still hear the same instruments that you heard in the first place. Also, they are as clear as my tv and have as good sound quality as my tv.When I put these on I literarily thought that they were fake because they sound as good as my $60 turtle beaches (x12), and they might be a little more neutral than these(ath-mx40).So overall, don't be impressed when you get these, they are as good as any other headphones, and I have tried many. One more thing, the wire for the earcups is exposed, I feel like I had to note that because I haven't seen other people point that out."
"I’ll be the first to admit I’m rough on headsets, but this was the best treated and shortest lived headset I’ve had. Thankfully not the most expensive. So if you are gentle with it it should be ok.."
"The sound quality is fine and flat-tuned, and out of the box they have decent noise isolation. Beyond that they have awful design. Each can is attached to a hinge that both swivels and bends, making them annoying to put on and off, and making them very prone to physically breaking, especially since the hinge casing is brittle plastic. Both sides individually broke into several pieces a few weeks apart after a few months of use. Duct tape fixed both the broken hinges and the obnoxious swivel, but without thread to pull the two sides of the duct taped portion together they now pressed hard against my temples, causing headaches, and even after binding them so the hinges remain bent inward, they no longer have good noise isolation at all. The detachable cord was a selling point for me, since cords are the most common point of failure on headphones, but I should have done more research. The cord jack is proprietary and has a high premium, diminishing the benefit of having a replaceable cord to begin with."
"I love a good pair of headphones and I had some but they were too loose and there was a problem of them falling off. I bought these off the recommendation of a friend and after seeing some reviews on these I bought them when I could find them on sale. After trying them out they have an extremely good noise cancelling seal on it, even with my glasses, however I noticed that as I wore them longer than about 3 hours straight my ears and my head felt as if they were being crushed by these headphones. I would have to take them off for a while (about 15-30 minutes) for the pain to go away and to ensure another 3 hours of listening. Now my friend who does not wear glasses even told me about how these headphones will feel as if they are crushing your head, and I thought no way he must be over exaggerating, he said that this happened for about a month and he had got used to it (he would wear his headphones for 10+ hours everyday). It took me almost 3 months before I noticed the pain is substantially lesser than when first bought. Even now nearly 8 months later with extended wear  I have to take the headphones off occasionally."
"Disclaimer: I am not an audiophile nor do I pretend to be one. I'm just an average guy looking for great sounding headphones.Reading the other reviews about this product you'd think putting these headphones on your ears is the same experience as going from a crappy CRT TV to a 1080P LED TV. In my experience that couldn't be further from the truth. I tried high quality music sources but that had no effect. People on audiophile forums said I'd need buy an amp/dac to REALLY get the full experience. Others said that people tend to hype headphones like these too much which distorts people's expectations. I could definitely see the latter happening. This brings me to the annoying part of buying high quality headphones. It seems like there's always just one more thing you need to buy before you can really experience it in its true glory.Like I said, I'm not an audiophile, I just want great sounding headphones without much fuss. It's too much investment for me to spend a premium on the headphones, then have to purchase accessories like amps, and subscribe to high quality music services on top of that. Nonetheless, without making those additional investments I didn't notice anything mind blowing. It sounded better than stock iPhone earbuds but that's a really low bar.The disappointing sound quality wasn't even the worst part of these headphones. These headphones are extremely uncomfortable. I'm not sure what kind of pain threshold one has to wear these for eight straight hours as some other reviewers claimed to do. These clamped super tight on my ears and were too painful to wear for more than 30 minutes to an hour. No amount of positioning or adjusting could alleviate that for me.So, even with realistic expectations going in I still wouldn't recommend these to anyone. The comfort issue is a deal breaker."
"You read that title right. The collapsing function on this model is WAY too finicky and will likely deploy without you intending to do so, usually when your fingers or hands will receive a nice, sharp pinch to let you know your dumb self should have sprung for the M50X instead.  I'm convinced AT made these to punish people that didn't buy the more expensive set."
"I have only had these headphones for about a year and a half, and they unfortunately broke in such a way that they are no longer usable. (See picture.) Additionally the padding on the over-ear portion has been cracking and flaking for a few months. I didn't buy the protection plan because I wasn't sure I would be keeping them, and as far as I know it's not possible to buy the protection plan after the headphones have been received.Important note: even when brand new, if the aux cord crosses over itself, it produces a staticy clicking noise in the headphones, which means the wire isn't properly insulted.These have turned out to be poor quality that didn't last even 2 years, but so far they're the only headphones I've found that don't irritate my cartilage piercings. I guess I have some more looking to do."
"Sound quality is good, to my untrained ears.Sound isolation very good, you won't hear people talking, or even most household appliances. Low bass cuts right through it, though.Build quality is absolutely fantastic. It's a joy to hold and behold, it's incredibly sturdy, and it has a plethora of precision articulation points that don't creak, snap, or flex. Subtle clicks all around.It comes with plenty of cables for all audio situations.I love everything about these headphones, except for a single dealbreaker: they are not comfortable.The earcups are too small for my ears, and the headset clamps my head like it has a grudge.Wearing these causes discomfort after half an hour, and they gotta go after an hour.They are no good for work/all-day headphones, but they are useful as a temporary reprieve from loud situations.As a side note, it's difficult to talk with these on, as your own voice resonates loudly in your ears. Maybe it's the closed back, maybe it's a tight clamping, but regardless it makes voice chat an exercise in DIY headaches."
"I have tried to like these headphones, but I just don't. They have pretty good responsiveness, accuracy, and balance, but the design just makes he hate to use them. They are large, heavy, uncomfortable, and they fold up in a way that will frequently leave you with bleeding fingers after they get pinched in the hinges. The hinges also seem to have a tendency to align themselves backward so that you have to keep fiddling with them to orient them so you can use them. And what's the point of those hinges, anyway? It seems like they were trying to make them look ""portable"", but they are anything but. Large and heavy. They remind me of my brother's Koss headphones from the '60s.If I were reviewing just the sound, I'd give 4 stars, but the design of the hinges alone loses one star. On the plus side, the sound is good for the price range, and I do appreciate that the overly long and heavy cord is socketed on the headphones so if it breaks where connected to the headphones you will be able to replace the cable. But I'll never use these enough to wear out the cable because they are just not comfortable."
"The sound these headphones put out is phenomenal, particularly for a 40mm driver.  In studio applications they're capable of reproducing a surprisingly wide range of frequencies without any painful peaks in the higher range.  And in terms of comfort, I bought an aftermarket set of cushy foam ear cups because I'm like that, but even the stock pads are fine for regular use.  The headpiece could be a little less squeezy, but honestly I have a pretty giant cranium so chances are it's less of an issue.  Another feature I really appreciated was the detachable cable because it made the headphones more portable and cat-proof.With all that said, here's why I will never buy any headphones from this series ever again: the hinges.  There's a two-axis hinge assembly on each earpiece that enables the headphones to both fit properly and fold up.  This means that the hinges are under nearly constant strain, particularly when they're being worn, handled, or folded.  It's the kind of use case that calls for something durable like metal, or at the very least a solid piece of some sort of sturdy plastic.  Audio-Technica, however, chose to make the hinges entirely from thin plastic that becomes brittle rather quickly, meaning that they're basically living on borrowed time from the moment they leave the factory.  And because the wires run through the hinge itself, it's nearly impossible to fix without risking breaking them too.If Audio-Technica replaced the plastic hinges with metal ones, these would be some of the best headphones ever made.  As it stands though, you'd be better off looking elsewhere."
"Purchased 100 + items over the past 10 years and never did a product review until now. The Audio-Technica ATH-M40x Professional headphones are 100% overrated on Amazon and the reviews on YouTube. The sound quality I would give 4 stars and comfort 2 stars. That's why I give these headphones 3 stars. Returned after 1 day of use for a few hours. Guitar Center has all the studio quality headphones on display to test. That's where I should of started before buying. The ATH-M50x are no better in comfort. It wasn't even close. By far Sennheiser HD280PRO Headphones are the most comfortable, easy 5 stars and the sound quality 4/5 stars. These are the headphones used on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. These podcasts can be 3 hours long and Rogan some days does them back to back. Go to a Best Buy or Guitar Center or other retailer that have headphones you can try on, test for comfort and sound quality. In my opinion there are no better headphones in the $100-$200 range than the Sennheiser HD280PRO. Don't buy into the hype on YouTube or Amazon on any product review. In 3 months I will do a review update under the HD280PRO thread."
"Sound signature is great, with forward vocals, and some body in the bass. However, the highs are bothersome. I sense a peak in the highs somewhere which can be irritating after a while. For a closed headphone, these are great for gaming. However the stock pads are shallow and will press against your ears and fatigue will begin to settle in. So if you're looking for a gaming closed back headphone, I'd recommend something else. I prefer the Beyerdynamic DT250-80ohm for this instance. But lack the bass and body of the M40x.Hip hop, edm, house, ect all sound amazing on these. Movies are great as well. But for long gaming sessions, the pads are a deal breaker. After reading on pad upgrades, many have mentioned a loss in bass. Which I love the bass where it's at on stock form and don't want to lose any.The swiveling of the ear cups are terrible. When you take them off your head, they like to swing around and trying to put them back on from a bathroom break in a hurry can be a bit of a nuisance trying to get the ear cups to fold back in the correct position to place back onto your head."
"Two things, which are related, make these headphones not worth it.1: They are over-articulated. They flop around and get twisted up because there are too many ways the ear cups can rotate or hinge. This puts undue stress on the hinges and adjustment points. It also seems like some of the articulation is there just so they can say it is, not because it's useful at all.2: The head band adjustment points break, because they have a very small piece of plastic that holds them together.  This piece is put under a whole lot of pointless stress all the time when the cups flop all over the place.Otherwise, they are a nice sounding flat response. Too bad I can't use them anymore for work (I do live sound) because they broke..."
"I have purchased these headphones multiple times. EVERY SINGLE TIME within a year the plastic piece on the headphone swivel breaks, and you cannot use the headphones anymore as they won't stay on your head. I've reported this to Audio Technica and THEY DON'T CARE. Other brands have always offered a replacement. AT DOES NOT CARE. They know this is an issue, it has been known for years.DO NOT BUY!!!"
"These headphones were fine but the hinges are a real annoyance and major failure point. The ear pads and everything else basically look brand new but the internal plastic hinge sheared in half and now the left ear is only held on by the cable. Could technically be repaired under warranty, but you'll be paying shipping both ways."
"The sound is good but frankly, my hearing isn't great anymore so I can't judge too much.What I bought these phones for was the detachable cord. I wear headphones, plugged into my laptop, while in my recliner.  My other phones have long cords which are a nuisance when I only need 18 inches.  I was very disappointed to find out the cord that plugs into the phones is a smaller 2.5mm and ALSO has a specially shaped plug body which locks into the phone's socket.  So even though they supply 2 (long) cords neither one is what I was looking forward to using.Another slight negative is the size of the hardware that connects the headband to the earpiece. Leaning back in my recliner I have to keep facing directly forward.  If I rotate my head more than a few degrees that hardware hits the recliner.  My Sony's allow a lot more head rotation so I guess I'll keep using them.  I gave the Audio-Technica phones to my wife who is starting to go deaf and is only interested in their volume."
"I have a large head and I use all of my headphones extended to their largest setting. I have no problem with my other headphones as they are comfortable, but these headphones are small even at the outer most setting and any extended wearing makes them hurt.I'm using them primarily during  my guitar learning/practicing, so in small bouts they'll do their job, but I wouldn't want to wear them longer than 30 mins at most.My daily headphones is a set of Anker SoundCore that can be worn all day comfortably with no pain or anything!"
"Since these are studio reference headphones, they are very clear but be aware that the bass is almost non-existent. The biggest problem I have with them is how tight they clamp on too my head. I wish there was a way to adjust that. The only adjustment is how low do you want the phones compared to the head ""strap."""
"I'll start out by saying that the sound on these headphones are great. I have no complaints on the way the sound at all. But rather on how long they last. I used them for a little over half a year, and a month ago I started to have problems with the right ear where the sound would be quieter then the left ear. Then the sound would just disappear, if you didn't fold the headphones or mess around with them they would work fine but if you do what i just listed the sound would disappear and sometimes it would work again and then disappear again. I sent the headphones in for repair which cost me $30(Shipping) and they sent it back with a summary saying it was replaced. So a few days ago, The same issue started happening again! I don't know what the hell they did but these headphones aren't exactly fixed. I very unhappy with the fact the I have to put up with this .FYI I don't abuse my headphones, I use my Bluetooth earbuds more often so they lay unused at times."
"Previously gotten the Sony MDR-7506 after having read good reviews on Wirecutter for headphones under $100. The MDR was disappointing in the way that it had much less bass than your average Apple earphones and the attached cable was wayyyyyy too big for comfort. I feel that's best for your audio engineers slaving away in a studio somewhere.Anyway, these Audio Technicas though, these are superior to your 7506 and maybe the best over-ear headphones you can get for under $100. Clean, crisp sound with just the right amount of bass (still much less than your Beats) and better yet for me, detachable cables. Only problem is, I had to order an extra detachable cable 1.2m ($20 bucks man you kidding me?! 1/4 the price for the actual headphones guys, what are you doing?!) for these since these do not come with your regular length cables so they're a pain that way. Another downside is the fact that the earcups, they can be rotated 90 degrees (for ""easy,on ear-monitoring"") but they are not sturdy at all, so they almost always just stay lopsided or become that way on the slightest touch. Overall, I'd say, get these. Pretty cool."
I've bought these twice in the last 2 years thanks to the protection plan. Both times these headphones broke when there was even the slightest amount of pressure applied to the swivel bits right above the ear.  The plastic cover cracks and then the whole ear falls out and it's near impossible to put back in. I enjoyed the sound and the comfort but I will not be repurchasing.
"Audio sounds great, but the plastic and engineering on the hinge is absolutely terrible. I've had two pairs of these headphones and both times they've broken at the hinge within 2 years. Through Google searches it also seems to be THE most common cause of failure."
"Needed a replacement for the m30. M40 has less space so it feels a little ""tight"" around the head even when it's extended all of the way out. The worst past is that the top has no cushion support so what i feel is a piece of hard plastic touching my head at all times.When I put on the m40, and then the m30 afterwards, the difference in space is very noticeable.I would have to guess that the m40 has roughly 10-20% less space than the m30 has when they are both extended out all of the way out.On a different note, the ear cups are almost the same size as the ones on the m30. They are just a little bit smaller so it will feel a little more ""snug"""
"There is a small plastic piece that controls the movement of the headphones individually. That piece snapped off for me after about 6 months of daily use. They are currently ducttaped, as the warranty site isn't working. While I do like the headphones, I'm disappointed with their durability and the difficulty at getting them replaced."
"Nice sounding, neutral headphones.  Decent bass response, as well.  I like the sound just fine, but can't get beyond the discomfort of wearing them.  There is something just ""wrong"" with the design of the headband (note that it's little brother the 30X, which I also own, does not have the same problem).  It sits hard on top of my head, in a single small spot.  Every other set of headphones I've had (and that is currently in the house) sit ""around"" my head (i.e., all the weight isn't in a single, small spot on top of my head).  This wouldn't be a deal-breaker if there was enough padding in the headband, but there is very little padding, so unfortunately, I have to send them back.  The ear pads are okay, but become warm and a bit uncomfortable after a while, but even this wouldn't be enough to send them back.I hate to send them back, but they just feel wrong, and uncomfortable, on my head.  If they were comfortable, I'd give them 5 stars."
"The sound quality is good, but this is my second pair and they broke in the same place. The swivel where the ear piece attaches to the band that fits around your head is just really weak. It breaks extremely easily. This is my second pair, and this one only lasted 8 months. There's nothing else wrong with them, but now they're unusable because of a small piece of plastic."
"I wish I would have found ONE review saying what I'm about to say. Alright, so the sound is great on these cans, and the build quality and features are great. I'll let you find other reviews to read about those things. What I want to add is that if you do not need all of the articulation in the ear cups, then it can be quite annoying. I got a pair of these to try out as studio cans expecting to like them and buy a few more for musicians to use. I put the my test pair to use with an artist and immediately saw her fiddling with getting them right (this was after I had already had to take time figuring them out). Then she'd take them off and it'd start all over again. I think if the articulation was a little more stiff, but it all moves so easily. Which is nice if that's what you need. But it can definitely be distracting when trying to put them on if you're not used to them."
"Used these daily for over a year.  These headphones provide excellent sound quality, but there is a design ""feature"" which became a serious annoyance over time, and that is the 90 degree swivel on each earpiece, combined with the upside-down flip of each earpiece -- just about every time I picked the headphones up to use them, one or both earpieces would have swiveled in the backwards, out-facing direction, and have swiveled upside down, so they appear ready to put on, but the earpieces are actually upside-down and backwards.  Sometimes, it becomes like a puzzle, trying to get the earpieces to simply be in the correct-facing direction, before you can put them on.  The fact that they swivel and flip so freely and loosely into the backward, upside-down position I find not to be a feature, but an annoying design flaw.  Going back to my other brand of pro headphones, which will always be in the correct position when I put them on!"
"around 2017 i picked up my first pair of ATH m40x, and they were working pretty well for me, until one day the clamp piece that allows free motion of the left driver shattered, which made it so you couldn't even put it in your head anymore.I enjoyed the audio ( and more importantly to me, comfort ) experience and figured it was just user error.I bought another one in January of 2020. Last night 10/2021 the exact same thing happened in the exact same spot.I bought a 3rd pair because right now I am on a time crunch and can''t waste time shopping around for some other brand, but I would recommend anyone reading this review chooses anything else.This is especially true if you anticipate during your use of the headphones that you will have frequent interruptions or distractions in which you need to lift one driver from one ear in order to take a phone call or speak with some one. The repetitive strain of the simple motion of taking it on and off wears down the most fragile piece and once it breaks, you have useless headphones."
"I have had these about two years. The sound is okay for my casual listening purposes. I am surprised, though, that months ago the ear pads started to peel. I was finding little black bits of it all over the place. I have three other over-ear headphones of different price ranges/quality, and none of them have the ear pads peeling like this. Finally got fed up and replaced them with some Brainwaves pads, which fit but seem noticeably bigger to me. I will see how long those pads last."
"I bought my ATH-M40X headphones about 3 months ago from amazon.com. The sound of the headphones is clear and very good but somehow not quite loud (I did the break-in over 50 hours and have used them for 3 months since). Comparing with my cheaper headphones JVC HA S160 and Sony MDR-ZX300, I have to turn up about 15% higher volume for M40X to equal the loudness of the other headphones. Not sure if this is normal for M40X, but it seems to me it's a quality issue here.The other problem I have is that the two 9.8' cables came with the headphones are way too long and clumsy for portable use. Ordinary users who want to use M40X conveniently still have to place another order to buy the short cable after buying the headphone set. $24 (sale price $20) for just one short cable is not cheap either. I believe most of the M40X users are not studio technicians and need one short cable, not two extra long cables. I hope Audio Technical will make it more user friendly and solve these problems."
"Nice overall quality.  I'm not a sound coniseur, but I was happy, and it sound quality seemed solid.  But found myself uncomfortable after wearing for near an hour. I found pressure on head quite unpleasant, yet insufficient for max isolation from external sound . Fine for short listen, and quite possibly more accurate than some more comfy & cheaper headphones I tend to use more.FYI: I'm average to largish 5' 11"" male of average northern euro portions."
"Beats by Dre WHAT?!?!?!?!?!??!?! The reviews from the more technical will do a better job at explaining how great these headphones are. I owned some Logitech UE2000's which i snapped before ordering these. Great price, great quality. One thing thats annoying about these are the cans flip and turn, but this actually assist in preventing me from breaking them like my last pair!!! Its a very small annoyance, but I think its worth mentioning.I'm very happy with these headphones, I'm a mobile DJ and these have been used inside, outside, and beyond and have worked as they should.UPDATE 10/19/16:Went from 5 stars to now 3 stars. So after a little over a years use, either the cord or where the cord connects to ear piece, has shorted. I'm able to still use these but will have to replace due to this. I was very pleased with these till this happen. Maybe I should try getting a replacement cord before purchasing another pair of headphones?"
I bought these to replace a 12-year old set of Sennheiser HD80 headphones and so far I am very happy with my purchase.  These headphones are well built and produce great sound with total sound isolation!  I also love the fact that the cord can be replaced.  Hopefully they last a long time.UPDATE:  I've now been using these headphones daily for almost 2 months and while I think the sound quality is great I feel that the Sennheiser HD80 are much more comfortable to wear. These seem to fit a little tighter than the Senns and they cause the area around my ears to get sore after a few hours of use.UPDATE #2:  I've now been using these headphones almost daily for the past 6 months and the headphones have not loosened up at all.  They still feel tight and uncomfortable on my head causing my ears to get sore within 10-15 minutes.  I really wished I bought the Sennheisers instead.
"Overall, these headphones are very comfortable, and have a very nice sound quality for the price. However, for $100, the hinges are remarkably fragile and will crumble the moment you look at them funny.Do not buy these if you intend to carry them around frequently. Other than this glaring flaw, though, they are very solid headphones. I wish I could rate them higher, but I've had two pairs, one didn't even last a year, and the other lasted 2 years with gentle use."
Bought in april 2024 swivel on left earpiece broke in december 2024. Dissapointed
"They're not bad, but they're not great either, which most of these Amazon reviews led me to believe. One star off for no soundstage and one star off for lack of comfort. I compared them to a pair of Sennheiser HD558's which were more comfortable, more detailed across the frequency spectrum and much more dimensional- they're greatest virtue. The 40x's have a one dimensional soundstage that kind of just sucks the life out of music (tho these are monitors, granted), and they are uncomfortable, but they did have better deep bass and more extended highs, and that's why I kept them. The Sennheiser's lack of deep bass couldn't make up for their admittedly outstanding midrange, which is lush, seductive and conveys a sense of dimensional realism the 40x's can't touch, but I'm a drummer and gotta have an accurate reproduction of bass under ~ 60hz. In retrospect I should have sent them back and saved up for better cans, but I'm impatient, so live and learn."
Sound quality is excellent but the ear pads are quite small and firm. They don't fit over the ears but rather on top of the ear and this isn't quite as comfortable as an over the ear design.
"I wanted a nice pair of headphones during cyber monday, and even though I could tell from the pictures these were small, I still listened to the reviews which raved about how comfortable these are. These are probably some of the most uncomfortable headphones I've ever worn. Will be returning these, the worst part is now the deals are over and I have no other options to pick from except to wait another year. Thanks Audio-Technica!"
"It's in the headline. These 'phones sound just as good or better than my Sennheiser HD 558's, but they are not nearly as comfortable. I can't wear them for longer than 30 minutes without noticeable discomfort. I will be returning these and buying a different set of closed-back 'phones, but definitely not for lack of sound quality.I think the discomfort is rooted in the 'phones tendency to collapse on itself (ear-cup to ear-cup). The tendency helps for space saving and transport, but I definitely feel the squeeze on my ears. Furthermore, the headband lacks padding. As you pull the 'phones over your head, the headband doesn't give as much room as you'd think. That results in higher tension right on the top of your head, instead of well rounded contact along the top of your head.If you have a medium or small sized cranium, these may be the affordable, quality, closed-back 'phones you've been looking for."
"I really like these headphones. The sound is clear as a bell and with them I have noticed the subtlest sounds in my music that previously I couldn't hear at all! For the sound quality alone I would give them 4 stars.Unfortunately, the build quality is where they fail. Like others have said, they feel a bit delicate around the joints for the ear pieces, but in the two years I've had them I haven't had any issues with breakage. However, I was shocked to discover a week ago that the cover material for the ear pieces is now rotting away!  They're only two years old and they're already rotting?!While the sound is totally worth it, I'm disappointed that such expensive pair of headphones is already falling apart! Perhaps I'll look into replacement covers...."
"I bought these about a year and a half ago for PC gaming.  The sound quality was great.  I thoroughly enjoyed them.  I have a fairly big head and I found these to be comfortable.  Even after 18+ hour sessions.The swivel on the ear pieces were a bit confusing at first.  I don't think this feature is necessary for gaming and I think ultimately this feature was the demise for my headphones.  One of the ear pices broke clean off at the swivel and severed the line to the other ear piece.  To be fair, I'm hard on my equipment.  So that probably doesn't help.  Their warrantee does not cover normal wear.So in closing, these have great sound quality but the plastic swivels can break.  Unless you need the swivel feature, I'd look else where.  If not, be gentle with these headphones."
"Upon first opening and listening with these headphones, I was astonished. The audio was crisp and wonderful. It is probably the best pair of headphones audio-wise that I've bought! The fact that they are closed-back headphones reduced outside noise significantly, and when paired to listening to audio, it is almost impossible to hear what's going on around you.Although these are great sounding headphones, it comes with the price of your comfort. You can only wear these headphones for 15-30 minutes before you start to feel the force of them crushing your skull. It physically hurt my ears after an hour and I realized that soon after I was back to unplugging them and listening via my speakers that it was time to return them. I thought time would loosen them up, but after trying them for two weeks, it still didn't get any better. I returned these headphones (although I REALLY wanted to keep them and enjoy them) just for the sake of comfort.Don't plan on wearing these for hours on end. I thought since my head wasn't very large that it wouldn't be an issue- but heed the advice of others here and maybe invest in some custom earpads if you purchase this product."
"As someone who spends a lot of time gaming and use headsets practically all day the Audio-Technica ATH-M40x has been the worst experience for how pricey it is.On first impressions what stood out was the nice audio quality, although it is on the quieter side and the cord is soft and sits comfortably. Other headset cords I've found feel quite rough or have a sound controller sit at an awkward place.In terms of the bad, there's a lot unfortunately. It pulled out hair on several occasions, never had this issue with any other headset and this is due to how wobbly the headset is- It always falls apart and does not sit nicely, honestly hated this it is so annoying. Even the smallest band adjustment feels too big for me and pinches the ears frequently causing headaches, these are not comfortable to wear at all.Having owned these for 8 months and after only a few months the ear cups started to tear (attached image).  The one thing I did like- the cord- has started to bunch up in twists, though not surprising since all headsets end up doing this after prolonged use.Even the lower end, most affordable headsets would have been a better option than this and have lasted about 2 years on average without looking for a replacement. Ended up wanting to replace this after 3 months."
"I purchased these to replace my ATH-M40fs headphones that lasted me almost five years and I must say I am rather disappointed by these headphones.  First off the collapsible mechanism is extremely annoying and you have to be careful when opening them not to break anything.  The sound is frankly muddy and doesn’t have the high end clearness (or even the defined bass) that the M40fs had.  They are also rather painful to wear and I sort of blame them for flaring up (or even causing) my TMJ.  As for the good things about them … well I do like the changeable cords, and I like that they ditched the foam material they used on the M40fs headphones which tended to flake apart over time and create a mess.  Sound wise, and comfort wise though they are definitely a downgrade."
"For $100, the sound is fantastic. Build quality is solid. They were my first pair of headphones as an introduction into the audiophile world. Unfortunately, they are incredibly uncomfortable. They are pretty tight which may bug some people but that is easily fixed and actually wasn't even an issue for me. I appreciated how snuggly the hugged my head.My issue is with the headband. No matter what I did, after about 20 minutes I would have a headache and where the headband had been resting would be incredibly sore and uncomfortable. I tried everything I could think of or find on the internet short of modifying the headset. The closest I came to fixing the issue was to buy a cushion that wraps around the band but that only extended the time it took me to get a headache by about 20 minutes. Due to the design of the headband, it really only rests on one small point at the very center of the band on the top of your head. The darn things are heavy so I'm assuming the weight distribution was what was causing me so much grief.On a slightly lesser but still unfortunate note, the bottom of the ear cups tended to rest on my upper jaw which would then cause my jaw to be sore."
"UPDATED:Pros:-Sounds incredible.-Light for how they look.-Two cords included.-1/4 inch adapter included.-Good for extended wearing 3+ hours-Proprietary cord 'locks' in and will not fall out unintentionally.-Pairs well with ant lion Mic 4.0.-Looks good on a big head (but read below)Cons:-Headache after wearing them on my big head with glasses.  ..possibly not for people with super large head or wide jaw.  I feel them put pressure below my ear for some reason.  They are wide enough and do not crush my ears.  I added the velour pads, but they hit a pressure spot and rest on my jaw where it gets close to my ear canal causing eventual discomfort.-Proprietary cord fit, will not fit generic cord.-Slightly warm but velour pads felt a bit cooler and are a good fix."
"It has great, neutral signature and nice looks and it seemingly had good durability, but after almost a year, the joint responsible for swiveling the headphone suddenly snapped in half so that I can still wear the headphones but the cup isn't pressed to my ear and obviously there is no isolation because of this. I'm not sure about the quality/convenience of warranties for other audio brands, but I know Sennheiser allowed me to send my proof of purchase and other information online whereas I have to print out and package my invoice with my shipment, which is just a mild inconvenience. Another minor annoyance is I have to create my own shipping label whereas this is automatically done with Sennheiser or selling on e-bay, but again  I'm not sure what is the norm."
"I just love these headphones.  But, they keep breaking.  It's like I have to spend $100 every year or so just because they break.  The hinges /pivots crack loose because of the cheap plastic and totally break, leaving the ear piece dangling by a wire.  Other than that, I get a high quality headphone.  I replace the pads with cowhide super mint cushy pads that I like.  And I replace the cable with a long braided cable.  The experience is mint... until the pivot plastic breaks and leaves the ear piece dangling by a wire."
"the hinge on the left side snapped off then all the plastic in side broke rending the system unusable , for a 150 dollar head set id expect better build quality or at least the foresight to not use hard brittle plastics on a high wear area such as the left cup hingemediocre sound quality i was happy with the head set when it worked a had a proper fit to my head , not blow out the water but not particular experience in this field so all i needed it to do was to work and not degrade structurally  which it has failed it in the course of 4 months of medium usage"
"Great sound but .. i needed headphones to carry around every day, and these are all plastic and too big.  So feels like they would break within a short period of time.  And this is not worth the money"
The pros:They look amazing.Came with a nice carry bag.They have a lot of adjustability for a good fit.The sound was amazing.The cons:The headband started to flake after a year of use. Bought a 3rd party zip wrap thing for it.The original ear pads are terrible. Too thin and not comfortable at all. Bought 3rd party earpads.They use a proprietary connection to the headphone. Modded mine to accept a V-MODA BoomPro Microphone.The right hinge broke a little after 2 years (right after warranty wore off...very convenient).Would I recommend them? Sadly no. The quality of the physical product just isn't there.
"I'd say these are by far my favorite pair of cans I've ever owned. Sound is really nice and balanced, these work really well when in either CS:GO, Minecraft, or Netflix. Doesn't matter, these things delivered for me. The only big gripe I have with them is that the swivel connecting the cans to the band is relatively weak compared to the rest of the build. My left swivel snapped when I was taking them off, then the right one snapped a few months after I sent them in to get repaired (for the left swivel). Unfortunately, the warranty ended 2 months prior to the right swivel snapping. Tough luck I suppose. Besides the swivel strength, very good headphones."
"Update, Aug 2022. The pads have shed; see pix! The top headphones are my 30 year old AKG's. The bottom headphones are these Audio Technica's. What's with that?????Too tight for my head, and a little uncomfortable for the long haul.The ability to fold up for carry means that I'm always twisting and turning the ear cups to get them unfolded. It's an annoyance for me and I never bring them anywhere.I thought my recording partner could use them, but these are still too small for her head.Sound quality seems fine. Nothing that makes them stand out as odd or anything like that. I use them for tracking (recording new tracks against existing tracks) so the fidelity isn't a big factor for me, as long as the sound is comfortable to listen to."
"After a hand full of months of using this headset daily for gaming it has become an issue. Sound is amazing, great quality, and overall a fantastic headset. Although, it has lead to bad pain and discomfort in my entire back of my neck...all the way from the middle/lower part of my neck to the base of my skull from the compression of the headset. It goes away most of the time when I am not on my computer but there is an everlasting discomfort and pain in my neck that will go away after I buy a completely different headset within the next couple weeks. Be wary purchasing this headset based on what its purpose is for you."
"Good sound quality, frequency response is nice and flat. They fold fairy small to fit in the included carrying case. The detachable cable is a nice feature. They were a bit tight on my head at first, but after a while I got used to it and I could wear them for hours with no fatigue.Overall, I like these headphones, but they are a bit fragile. After about 2 years of gentle use they broke without warning as seen in the picture. Seems like kind of a poor design.UPDATE: They broke again. Less than 3 months after I repaired one side, it broke again along with the other side. Disappointed with the build quality of these headphones."
I thought the construction on these was absolutely amazing. I have recommended these headphones to so many people. To this day the integrity of the build actually holds up the metal is staying strong the wiring works the headphones sound pretty good still but a few months ago someone started telling me that i had black flecks by my ears while at work. When i got home i checked and saw that the material used for the headphones was peeling and flecking off of the headphone cups and leaving behind a sticky residue. Man i had loved these headphones... all great things i guess must come to an end... but i didn't expect it.
Headphones work fine but the headphone pads came out the box looking 3 years old already half flaked off
"These were the last headphones I ever purchased from Audio-Technica and I have since avoided the company.  Search hinge breaks and durability before you buy any headset from this company.  It was a widespread issue with this model and others that shared the hinge design.  When I sent them in for repairs (more than once, for the same hinge breaks- within a short window of time) it was clear they were aware it was an issue yet continued to sell the same design......for years and offered zero solutions other than ""fixing"" them until they run out of warranty.  It seemed like they broke even faster after repairs, two more times, after the company replaced the hinge.  They were not mistreated or worn around a watermelon - it is a widespread, well known defect that existed for years.  Look it up and then decide if you want to give this company your money."
"I like how easy it is to use, and the sound is generally pretty good.  It's quite light, but the materials are somewhat low-quality.  There are occasional issues with clicking and sound peaking, which is unusual for headphones at this price point.  I'm glad I got it on a discount, but these headphones are not worth the full price."
"Los audífonos suenan bastante bien, la batería les dura mucho pero desde el inicio la almohadilla del auricular derecho se empezó a dañar y a hoy más de un año después ya la almohadilla esta totalmente despegada. Me hace dudar si los audífonos son originales.The headphones sound pretty good, the battery lasts a long time, but from the beginning the ear pad on the right earphone started to get damaged and today, more than a year later, the ear pad is completely detached. It makes me doubt if the headphones are original."
"Our headphones are good, but it is not suitable for everyone, including me, and since I do not want to wait 30 days for a refund, I did not return the headphones, but before buying headphones, it is better to think about whether it will suit you, and so the sound appearance and quality are at the highest level, although the sound rarely starts to lag"
"I got it oct 3, it’s 15 days in use now and Bluetooth keep going off during streaming TikTok. And I have to reconnect my laptop every time even if I didn’t disable it last time….. keep your box before 30 days of use for return."
"This is just an out of the box day 1 review. Maybe ill come back and re-review later. My first concern is the the material of the headphones. Compared to beats or airpods max these feel VERY cheap. Just feels like cheap pleather and plastic. Im afraid to use these often in fear i will tear or break them. The ear pieces themselves are connected to the headband by the rods as you see in the pics. They dont feel like metal so i can see some design flaws potentially happening with wear and tear. Also the... not sure what its called ...the bushing? That holds the ear cup rods is also plastic. Feels like it can easily break. Even the charge cables and the aux cable they give you feels very very cheap.The headphones themselves are easy to connect. The sound quality itself is.... just sound. Bass is there, nothing amazing. Treble seems ok. The mids sound weird. Almost crackly at times. Something is off. There is some level of sound that doesnt come through  clean. I will say these are absolutely HORRIBLE for anything other than music. With shows or video games these things sound horrendous. Its ONLY good for music audio and it doesnt even do that well.Overall i dont feel these are worth 80 dollars. I feel like the free pair earbuds you use to get from iphones sound better and i feel you could find similar quality in a 20 dollar brand. I would honestly wait till black friday for beats headphones to go on sale for 80 bux. You are getting more of what you pay for with those. Icdont know what im paying for with these because everything feels and sounds cheap. The box it came in felt better quality. Maybe just the marshall brand itself? I dont know."
"Like the other 1 star reviewer mentioned, there seems no way to reset this device (Youtube has non-official videos for ""reset"" but they don't work). I encountered issues only on windows PC, works as expected on both iphone and mac.The issue here is clustered with devices pairing and windows driver. I have 4 different devices to connect with this headphones, works find on all Apple products but it seems like it can only connect to 2 device at the same time. Meaning - I have to turn off my iphone and ipad bluetooth if I want it connect to either mac or PC. And this is when the PC connection starts to act funky.Now my PC can connect to the headphones but either does not recognize it as a output device OR it recognized it but the audio output is not consistent. At the beginning I though it was the PC issue since the headphones work fine on Apple product. But I have 2 other pairs of headphones I could use, they both connect to PC through bluetooth with no problem.So it came to a conclusion that if there is no way to factory reset these headphones, I cannot keep this headphones which is pretty sad since I like its battery life and the way it looks.Well, at least i have to say, the noise cancelling is non-exist with this headphones (no such functionality) but it does a pretty good job cutting out environmental sounds anyways. I have issue with noise cancelling headphones because somehow they give me pretty bad headaches, so I genuinely liked this headphones and I'm pretty sad that it doesn't work."
"I had high expectations for this item due to reviews, but they decide when they want to turn on and work. You cannot use them to talk to someone. I do think mine may be defective bc I cannot skip songs, or I’m doing something wrong? I normally use my AirPod pros, which are way better and same quality with the base. Prob gonna return, bc I don’t think they’re great. I’d rather spend more money for higher quality"
These are too tiny On the ears to be comfortable. I’ve always loved the design of Marshall speakers so when the headphones came out I always wanted a pair.. these were a splurge for me because I already had JBL over the ear headphones I love for the quality but I wanted these for the style. I can honestly say I don’t like them. I’ve used them for a month and my ears hurt when wearing them and you can hear everything going on around you when using them. This was not worth $100 and my JBL’s cost me under $50 and they are well worth it.
"These look stylish and sound good. However it is a ""dumb"" phone, in that it is completely devoid of any modern features. It's a pair-and-play kind of situation, which could be in its favor really. Sony makes you download a 2-hour firmware update before you can use your $500 new headphone, littered with features you don't want. Marshall makes it pure, simple, focused on music enjoyment.Besides bluetooth pairing, it comes with a corded connection that's very handy.In the end though I do miss some of the ""smart"" features of other products, such as auto-pause when taken off, and fancy smart digital EQ that can add excitement to old songs.The Marshall Major are excellent headphones that's simplistic and a bit old fashioned."
"Color: Brown | Size: Standard | Style: HeadphoneI never travel with them. I use them daily at my desk. The insides are already dying.They've lasted from April 22, 2023 to July 2023 before I started noticing sound quality issues as the headphones started to die. As of right now, the headphones have the same sound quality of a worn out VHS tape complete with fizzles, pops and bad sound quality. I'd expect longer usage from Marshall after paying so much for these.PROS+They look cool! The brown color and the Marshall amp logo on them lends a vintage feel to them.+The pads didn't overheat my ears. They were soft and pliable. Headband felt good.+The bluetooth works. I can wander anywhere in the house and they work flawlessly.+I like the brass-like toggle button on them. Very fun, very retro.CONS (before they were dying)- Ear pain due to the cups pressing my ears to my head. I had to bend the metal wire adjusters that the cups are attached to so that the cups didn't apply so much pressure to my head. Even then, I still can't wear them for 2+ hours.- The sound is distant and quiet. Volume all the way up, the sound feels distant like I'm listening to music in the next room. Readjusting the cups to align with my ears better didn't really help.- I never hear the first few seconds of any video or song because the headphones have a Sleep Mode when not in use, no matter how small the time frame. So, scrolling through YouTube Shorts, it will cut off the beginning of every video. Same with music. This quickly grew annoying, and after a few months of missing the beginning of every first sentence, I was already looking for new headphones.- They turn off by themselves to save batteries, which fools me to think a video isn't working or is muted if I get up to fetch something and come back to my PC. Often, I can't really tell if the battery truly needs a recharge or if they're just programmed to enter Battery Saving Mode due to a time limit. This leads me to plug them in almost every day. It displays a white light like everything is fine but they won't wake up on their own. I hate playing this game every day.ConclusionBuy something else. I'm still on the hunt for decent headphones."
"These look great. Awesome quality of construction. Nice retro look. Great detail and soundstage in your music as you listen! What's the problem? Comfort is my first problem. They are heavy for an on-ear headphone and the pressure and heat on my ears drove me crazy. I went 15 minutes and wanted to take them off, sorry that is a deal breaker for me. Second slight problem is these didn't have as much physical bass as I like. EQ'd it up on the low end, helped some, but you just hear the bass, you don't really feel it. I'm returning them due to the comfort."
"They look fantastic and I liked the sound from the first time, but then I realised that the pressure on the head and ears doesn’t allow me to use them longer than 30 minutes. And after using them for a while the sound doesn’t seem that satisfying. So kinda disappointed since now searching for the second pair of headphones.But that’s personal, my friend is using them for hours and she’s cool, so if you are sensitive to pressure than no go."
"Only support SBC, not good for large ears"
"Not gonna lie, the headphones are very good in quality, sound is great and the battery life last a long time. The only problem is, the day after I started using them my right ear started hurting, a lot, I’m not sure if it was the pressure of the headphones on my head or something else but it ended up being external otitis and it lasted 3 months! It stopped for a week and now I wore them again for a day a my ear is hurting again. I had my doubts of them being the reason of my ear infection but every time I wear them the pain comes back, I could’ve stopped the moment i felt the symptoms but they’re not that cheap to just stop wearing them and now I’m worried to resell them and end up giving an infection to another person. I just wanted to share this because I’ve seen in other reviews of people having headaches after wearing them as well."
"Needed a backup pair of headphones so I got some used version of this Marshall ones because someone recommended it to me. I got an “Acceptable” version for half off the price which turned out to be in “Like New” quality so that was a huge steal. Love love love the 80 hours of battery life (have not specifically tested the exact hours but I have not charged it again since getting it almost a month ago). It’s not noise cancelling and the quality is good (can’t beat my Airpods Pro). I used this at the gym and the sweat makes me think if if it’s at all good for the material of the headphones. But what I can’t get over is connectivity… trying to connect it between two devices is time-consuming. I’ve already accepted the fact that it’s not gonna be as seamless as my Airpods to my Apple devices but still, I had to “forget device” and reconnect sometimes before I can get it to connect. Overall, it’s a good backup pair with amazing battery life but terrible connectivity and okay quality. But not gonna be my go-to."
"Not gonna lie, these kinda sucked. Base is fine. Sound is fine. Connection is fine. But they BLEED bad. People can hear what you listen to even at a basic volume. I used these when I work out. But when this summer came and I sweat, the glue basically came off and they fell apart. They still work, but the earmuff part pretty much didn’t survive that. I’ve had Walmart headphones last a million summers. They’re alright, the construction just doesn’t hold up if you want these type of headphones."
Bass not really there. For the price you can do better.
"It's got concert sound and great bass! I love the amazing battery life & quick charging. 2 issues. They don't fit well on the ears, I catch myself readjusting them cause my ears get sore. Not great for work, everyone can hear me blasting away."
"I love how they look, and the fact that they're brown omg I love it. However, the headphones were very uncomfortable for me. My ears would start to hurt after like 15 minutes of hearing them. The battery life is awesome, sound quality could be better. If you're looking for aesthetics these would be it for you, but for comfort not really."
"1. Device keeps a charge for over a day.2. Noice cancelation is not great, I hear a lot of noise when walking or in the car.3. Headphone don't cover the entire ear so they do get uncomfortable after long periods of time.4. Audio quality is average since noise cancelation in average.  In a quiet room I get better sound quality.For the price the headphone worked fine, I purchased them on sell."
I have seen some people using it and looks great so ordered it. But it didn’t fit really well on my ears. Also i worried that during summer with the sweat the synthetic leather would worn off.
"I was excited to get these.  I have a small head and was looking for something that wouldn't fall off my head.  These are great and they fit well but, they hurt my ear after just 30 min or so.  There is no noise cancelling that I can tell.  The button for volume, on and off seems a little flimsy.  We will see.  But the sound is good really crisp.  They are loud too.  If you like a lot of bass then these probably are not for you.  No problems with sound on calls no one can tell I have headphones on.  All in all these are pretty good headphones the price seems a little high for them.  If you want noise cancelling though these are not good for that."
"It's a good pair of headphones, but your paying for the Name, not the quality of it. They're stylish, sleek, and look nice, but they're just an ordinary pair of headphones, with no noise cancelling, made out of black plastic (I think Apples Airpods white plastic is more durable than this), and scratches easily. If you're willing to spend 150$ on these, I'd save the extra 50$ and buy a pair of Beats."
The sound is clear. But it hurts my head after like 30 mins of use. I have a big head so I don’t know. I don’t really use it that much though
"Great headphones. Good noise isolation, great sound, comfortable, seems sturdy... everything about them is great...... except you can't turn them off. Not consistently, at least.Sometimes the golden crown button just ignores the input. Sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes a persistent bluetooth connection is enough to ignore all user-input, forcing you to just keep them on until they naturally turn off from inactivity.Luckily the battery is great, otherwise these headphones would be useless!"
"After wearing for a couple minutes I begin to experience excruciating ear pain. When I turn them on they don’t automatically connect with any of my devices so I have to do that manually and it takes minutes to do so each time, this is for any device I’ve used such as laptops, androids and apple products. Out of nowhere the headphones will stop working and noise just leaks from my phone or laptop instead of going through the headphones. I also received some very dirty and used ones at first. I had to request a replacement and that was such a big deal to do. I do not recommend anyone these headphones, they’re cute but awful."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Aesthetically pleasing, sound is great.. but they KILL my ears. After 15min of wearing them my ears are burning from the pressure. So sad :( Will be returning."
Sound quality is terrible. They are also too small and hurt to have on for more than 30mins.
"We took a leap and splurged on these. They look cool and worked great! Then… they just stopped turning on. The light turns on like they are charging, but they will not turn on. We took care of them and they still look great! Very expensive to only work for 4 months. I would recommend going a different direction all the way around."
"I was excited to try these headphones because of the many reviews talking about the excellent sound quality. But I just don't hear it. To my ears, the sound is very thin and sort of tinny on the high end, like you'd get with a lower-quality pair of headphones. They actually sound very similar to my pair of Skullcandy Uproar headphones, which I got for $25 four or five years ago. The vocals across different songs and genres all sound like the singer is in a large, echoing room. The mid-range lacks richness. They are very treble-forward, but it isn't very good treble.From a build standpoint, they are good-looking headphones, if you dig all the black. The leatherette headband is nice, and I like that the plastic casings for the earpieces have a textured matte finish on the plastic. The headband is very flexible and the earcups are soft, but they still somehow managed to hurt my ears a bit after about 20 minutes.If these headphones were about $50 or so, I'd be on board, but I definitely don't think they are a good deal at $150. (I was able to find a pair of new Beats Solo Pro for that price, and while I wasn't a huge fan of those either—very heavy, hurt my head, a bit dull in the sound profile—they were definitely a step up from these, and with ANC.)"
"These headphones sound amazing, especially if you love some bass with your music. I also loved the knob control on the device, and the cushions are MUCH improved when compared to the mid-ANCs. But there are a few fatal flaws for me.First, the Bluetooth connectivity. Pairing with multiple devices is essentially a no-go since the headphones will play a guitar sound ON A LOOP until you get back in range of a device you left behind (E.g., you left your laptop at home to take a stroll outside with your phone). This forces you to reset your Bluetooth settings while on the go. Second, the Marshall app for iPhone is not functional at all. It doesn't detect the headphones even when I'm playing music from my phone.Honestly, I can live without the app. But I have cheaper Bluetooth headphones that don't have this multi-device connection flaw (e.g., Jabra 45H). Once fixed, I can gladly say these headphones are a 5-star purchase."
I’m pretty disappointed in the sound of these. I would’ve thought it would be better considering Marshall put their name on them. My cheap xyzrc no name brand sound better.
"When my MAJOR III finally went kaput (I turned it on after three years and literally smelled plastic burning?), I was excited to buy the latest model. I waited through all the delays, and then finally it came to my door. Immediately issues started. While the start-up and connection sounds being guitar licks is endearing at first, the sound kept coming at random when I'd listen to music and especially on the phone. It'd make it hard to hear whomever I was speaking with when random guitar licks and plug-in noises would interrupt the conversation. It randomly disconnects to my phone, and when speaking on the phone I'm told I'm hard to hear. I was really looking forward to these, but the quality seems to have gone down considerably. I'm seriously thinking about returning and going back to the earlier model if it's still easy to find."
8/13: It connects to my Samsung S22 Ultra but not my galaxy note 10 plus. The battery lasts several days. The headphones are uncomfortable after a few hours.Headphones will no longer connect to Bluetooth. Difficult to power on since the golden know is not labeled power off/on. So they did work but now they don't. Too expensive just for this to happen.
"These headphones are just okay. Battery-wise they are absolutely amazing and with a month of daily usage for multiple hours a day I only had to charge them 3 times. Sound quality is just okay, I would not recommend them for any audiophiles. However for talking on the phone they were great as well as just casual listening. Sadly, the bluetooth functionality crapped out after just shy of a month. The headphones constantly connect and disconnect to my device, making them unusable. Luckily I am still within my return window! But I will not be replacing these with the same headphones and will try a different pair instead."
"i bought these headphones because i thought they looked cool, and they do. battery life is 100% amazing, have not charged these in months and they still remain at 80% (not kidding). they match my outfits wonderfully no matter what i wear but these are definitely not for the gym, and i often have trouble making them stay on when i look or bend down. these headphones are more for walking around in a city, or completing work in a coffee shop type of situation. would recommend, if you don’t mind the price…!!!!!!!!!!!!"
So I gave them two stars because I've gone through two pair and both have lasted two years.I'm not buying them again. They did sound great and battery life was awesome.The on and off button just stopped working on both.
"Very lightweight, almost to the point of feeling cheap but not quite there. Audio is pretty good between both aux cable and bluetooth on my PC and phone. My only complaint is I cannot listen to anything on my phone using the aux cable without getting loud static blasted into my ears the whole time. Bluetooth works just fine and has no static and oddly enough the static does not occur on my PC. Will probably go with another company next time. My phone is a Motorola G Stylus 5G."
"I was excited about these.  Light, sturdy frame.  Great sound.  Excellent marketing.  I wanted a pair of headphones to head back out into the world, and these had the style and 80 hour battery life that was very impressive.  I took them out of the box and was greeted with a very basic manual, a usb c cable and a spiral 3.5 mm cable.  Then went to test it.Super comfortable, and super light.  Sounded good and I was ready to take it outside for a test.  Charged it on my wireless pad for a few minutes.  20 minutes for a 20 hour charge.  Then drove to the best buy to check out what was on sale.And it didn't play a sound.  I checked the connection and it was connected to my phone, but nothing came out.  Checked the volume and put it on max, the music was playing but no sound was coming out.  Solid white light.  Decided to reset it.  How would I reset it?  I pressed the button and held it for a few seconds.  Nothing.  Held it longer.  Nothing.  Looked for more buttons.  No other buttons aside from the control stick.  Googled how to reset it.  Nothing in the manual.  Nothing on the website.  Went home and plugged in the usb.  Nothing.  Plugged in the audio cable.  Heard my computer audio.  Unplugged it.  Nothing.  The solid white dot not changing.  I was so mad.  I'm not going to buy anything from this brand."
"I've had this for a day. Sound quality: excessive bass response which is distorted and muddy. The highs are washed out. You have to increase the volume to get the highs but the bass drowns out the audio and the sound becomes even more distorted and unpleasant to listen. Not an enjoyable listening experience. Comfort: Earpads are uncomfortable after 5 minutes. The square shape does not match the human anatomy and does not provide a good fit. It starts to chafe the ears after a while. Gets very hot in a few minutes. It will fit a big head like mine but the sides of the headband squeeze the sides of my skull and add another level of discomfort. Build quality doesn't look too bad but it's in the league with better $20 headphones. Designwise the headband looks good, the cans look plasticky and tacky I did not even bother testing the bluetooth features since this is definitely going back. I tried to like this because I had an urgent need for a headphone but did not work out as I had hoped. Conclusion: not recommended."
Doesn't tower off or on properly. Bought before traveling vacation so too late to return. Found it was a common complaint after the fact. Forget this headphone
"I was pretty satisfied with the headphone itself. It is light weight, nice color, good sound quality. But using it into a month, the only button that is on the headphone suddenly stopped working. Upon some research, I found that they sometimes have button malfunctioning. But otherwise great!"
"These are hands down the worst headphones I have ever had as they barely function. They constantly - CONSTANTLY - disconnect from phone and computer for no reason, especially when connected to both. I am constantly turning them off and on and off and on, just to reconnect.They will pause media for no reason, they will turn themselves off for no reason. They can only adjust audio volume on youtube and music apps, and nothing else. If you get a phone call while listening to media, you're going to have to turn them off and on to get the media back. Trying to use them for a conferencing app for work? They will stop working in the middle of the call, reconnect to bluetooth, and then will not transmit anything you're saying.I sincerely regret not returning these as soon as I got them, but I will NEVER purchase another product from this company, as they have shown zero respect for their customers by selling these practically useless headphones."
I ordered these headphones even after reading the reviews about the faulty connectivity. After charging the item I couldn’t connect to the Bluetooth so I didn’t even get to use them.
This is a great headphone!  Unfortunately the button is not the most responsive. It takes quite a bit to turn it on or off.Actually this is my second one. The first one was returned because the button was not working at all.I hope it will work this time.
very mid … makes lana del rey have a weird voice :/
"Very light and comfortable headphones, connection to BT was seamless and the sound (via BT) is outstanding.  However, I will be returning these as the sound is worse than awful when connected through a 3.5mm cable.  I tried 3 different sources and 3 cables and there is a constant significant white noise when connected with a cable via the 3.5mm jack, but the noise disappears when listening through BT.  I am thoroughly disappointed because the headphones are otherwise fantastic."
"In the summer I borrowed the Marshall Bluetooth speaker from my neighbor and was so impressed with the sound quality and volume capacity. So, after reading some reviews online I decided to purchase the Marshall Major IV On-Ear Bluetooth Headphones.  Charged it and connected it to my computer.  I was so disappointed with the sound quality this time around.  The sound was watered down, and the volume was rather low, I tried it connected to Bluetooth and with the wire, but both sounded the same.  Then tried connecting to my phone and encountered the same result.I’ve been using them for a couple of months. Hoping it would grow on me, but it did not.  I guess next time I will look at other brands for Bluetooth headphones.  I so wanted to like it. Oh well, bummer!Happy Holidays!"
"Major IV was good to me for sound quality, size, finish, and battery life. However, battery degraded Marshall brand. After a couple of charging, it never get charged more than 80%. Amazon and Marshall customer service recommendations to solve this issue didn't work at all. So I got replacement once and it happened again after twice of charging. Marshall need to check battery quality or battery management system."
"what a disappointment these headphones are. can't believe they are from marshall, known for LOUD speakers. i can hear my space heater running with these at full blast. waste of $$$.also won't pair with my phone."
"The headphones look great, have an incredible battery that could last for week at a time, the sound is good (nothing noteworthy to be honest) but that goes away when the headphones that goes for over a hundred dollars, stop working in less than a year.First it was the Bluetooth, the drivers began to go crazy completely lowering the volume of whatever device you had them connected to (cellphone, iPad and computer) so they were completely unusable as a wireless pair. With the cable they still worked for like a month until the right side stop producing sound, so now they are unusable as a whole.Do yourself a favor and avoid purchasing the Marshall Major IV, they are not worthed. There are much better alternatives for closely the same price."
"i’ve been using them for a week and idk if i got a faulty batch but it leaks a LOOOT of sound, it takes forever to connect and honestly feels cheap. i will say, they don’t hurt when wearing them they do slide down my head over time though. they compliment an outfit though so there’s that."
"One star is too much for these poorly designed headphones.I got them for the name, Marshall.  I have a lot of Marshall guitar stuff.I have had these headphones for a while now.  I have never been able to satisfactorily...successfully get them to pair with bluetooth.  Very frustrating."
"The 3s has the leather all around where the 4s have a cheap plastic. Also, the 3s felt heavier which i believe usually means better electrical components. Contemplating returning and buying the 3s"
"The 3.5 MM jack simply doesnt work. the bluetooth connection skips and if you have more than one bluetooth object connected the audio will skip every half second. literally unusable in my current setup for anything other than watching youtube. Dont buy this, there are other headphones more worth your money."
"It doesn't work and I am out of the US so not able to return this. Shared my issue details with Amazon, to give me a refund without returning and the don't care at all. Every time I receive an email that they will reply in 6 hours, they are gone for a day. I am not even sure whether the headphone is the original one as nothing in it works, even the type C charger. Complete waste of money. Don't buy from this seller."
"This is my second pair of these Marshall headphones.  Aesthetically, I really like the color and design. They sound ok, noise cancelation is ok. The first pair, I assume, stopped working all together due to possibly too much sweat while doing yard work in sunny Florida... So I bought a second headset and only wore them at the office maybe 6 times - they are just over a month old.  The tiny joystick broke clean off while just being moved around on my desk. Upon examination, this is a very weak fulcrum point with the tiniest amount of plastic actuator used to attach the brass colored plastic finger pad. Naturally I'm a week past the return date on these $150.00 aesthetically please/poorly designed headphones. I am an engineer by trade. I like how they improved the charging jack to USBc though..."
"Has style and quality of material overall not bad for the price. Not too obsessed with sound, can find better quality sounding headphones at same price point but the style is hella unique ill give it that."
Had for less than 2 months and the button fell off. Now it is very difficult to turn them on and off and impossible to change the volume or skip songs. Marshall will not warranty them because although purchased from Amazon they did not come from an “authorized” dealer. $100 for leas than 2 months of normal use and a company that doesn’t stand behind their product is not the Marshall it used to be. Will not be purchasing anymore Marshall products.
"It looks real, but the Marshall Support discovered it is a fake. Counterfeiter.I want to return, but the return window is closed. My left side is not working."
I did a lot of reading reviews online before determining which headphones to purchase in my budget. I was expecting these to be an improvement over my old air pods. I was very disappointed. Music that normally sounded bright in clear when listened with other audio devices sounds muddy and dark in these headphones.  They also are not that adjustable so they fit tight and a bit uncomfortable on the head.  I'm returning them because for the price they fall severely short.
sound is lousy for the money
"I was in love with these headphones; they are stylish, light, and have great sound. However, I woke up one day to find that no audio would come out of the right, even though it worked perfectly fine the day beforehand. I reconnected my device, tried connecting it directly with the cord, but it still didn’t work. The cables on the outside aren’t broken, so I’m assuming it’s an interior issue, which turns out is a common thing that happens with these headphones.I am disappointed that these lasted me for such a short time, but I love the features so much that I would be tempted to buy them again."
I don’t believe how can anyone wear these more than 15 minutes before it gets uncomfortable. I really wanted use these because audio quality is really good for the price but after using it for 1 week I got a headache every day it just pushes into my skull relentlessly and I can’t take it anymore. Returning.
Bluetooth stopped pairing with anything after 6 months
"Honestly, super disappointed and frustrated with this purchase. This is the second time the headphones have stopped working for me. They will not shut off no matter what I do or connect to bluetooth anymore. The only working option is when I plug the jack in, but even then they still won't shut off. I don't feel inclined to buy from this brand again. It was a very bad first impression. Would've bought the warranty if I knew they were only going to make it one month but that's just absurd. Just make better products at that point."
I bought the headphones couple days ago and the bluebooth doesn't connect to ANYTHING. It connected to my iphone for a second and doesn't even show up on the macbook or my other iphone or apple watch....this is legitimately the worst headphones I experienced with. The Marshall customer services rep literally told me this is because it is an Amazon product not Marshall product. I should contact Amazon not Marshall...This is crazy and I will be RETURNING IT IMMEDIATELY. I hope everyone doesn't fall for this scam.
upon receiving the package the box was missing a piece.
"Sound quality is very mediocre, on par with my $30 cheap headset. But the battery life is very good."
They sound good but in 5 minutes my ears start killing me. They are on the ear and boy do they let you know. Sitting in my drawer now. Very disappointed.
"Worked first time with my phone, but then not with transmitter, and then not with my phone. Sent them back."
They look nice. Sound quality is poor. I started feeling serious pain in both of my ears after less than an hour. They apply lots of pressure on your head. They really made me feel sick. I cannot see myself wearing these headphones on a long flight.
Absolutely No Volume….No Loudness what so ever and I have many Marshall Products Very Disappointed
"Headphones look great and knob is cool but sound is absolutely terrible for the price. This is my 2nd replacement and quite sad, I thought this would be amazing. Every 2 seconds sound tends to pause, crackle, scratch like a vinyl (in a bad way), it is driving me crazy. Zero clarity. Headphone department is a no-go. I would not recommend until this fix this problem in future developments."
"There's a buzzing and faint beeping sound that goes on while they're on but nothing is playing and it's incredibly annoying. For the price, this is not the quality I would expect."
"I I am 73 yrs old somewhat computer aware, however products like this are not intended for this age group. Instructions are written for a much younger age group which means ""Try reading the instruction manual""!!The print is so small and the manual was poorly put together! Diagrams and photographs do not match. There should be a label saying "" Old people beware this product was not intended for you""!!"
"Bought in december 2021 and had to return in January 2022 because it had a scratchy sound and the song skips on itself., Returned them and got new ones and boom, even worse, now sounds mono instead of  stereo and keeps scratchy. Maybe this model is broken, because my old ones were a dream, maybe the material was not very cool but hell those were good... my cat ate the cable so there's how they died, the headphones, not the cat.."
"The headphones are great but after a year and 4 months, it wouldn’t charge anymore and the manufacturer refuses to replace. The warranty has expired. I wouldn’t recommend."
Sound quality is amazing - as you would expect from Marshall. But the ear cups are so small I’m not sure they would fit a baby’s ears.
Received a used item and doesn’t come with  charger
"The headphones are tough to turn on and off.  Press the button, and nothing happens."
I use this with my iPhone 12 pro max and my other headphones that I had which was JBL and they sounded better
"I attempted to return, however received no response from seller. Buyer beware."
Will note pair with iPhone 14. Please don’t tell me how to pair. I can read the instructions . Search google for hours no answers except people repeating the instructions to you exactly as they are in the manual. It doesn’t work!
Dislike how it’s difficult to connect
My AirPods are louder than these 🙄 returned these headphones after 5 min of having them.
"Wow! Especially for the price...not loud at all! Better than nothing but that’s about all. Otherwise, seem well made and battery lasts as described."
gave me headaches
I don't see the charging cable and audio cord inside my package. I am really disappointed with the missing parts of the headphone.
Sound is just ok I have better headphones at the 30 40 dollar price point.
"Off late, the device is unable to connect to my iPhone. I tried all the procedures to find the device name. Still unable to connect."
My product came in today and was clearly previously used and does not turn on. Don’t buy.
The sound quality isn’t as amazing as I was led to believe from the reviews but to each their own
"So first i’ll just start off saying these are pretty good headphones that I bought to replace my beats solo 4s that don’t have noise cancellation. So first problem with these headphones is the bass, now don’t get me wrong the bass is AMAZING like out of this world but honestly the bass is only evident when the headphones are pretty much at max volume so that really sucks and the main issue with that is that these headphones have a insane sound leak like it’s close to wearing speakers. Also when it comes to the noise cancellation it’s pretty much none existent unless again you’re close to max volume I played with the headphones to see if I saw a difference between the fully aware mode and the noise cancellation and when I tell you there was absolutely NO change I mean literally nothing changes the noise cancellation doesn’t exist. In comparison to my beat solo 4s that have no noise cancellation feature the noise cancellation of the beats is better in terms of bass the skull candy is better and in terms on volume I would actually say the beats but this is biased because i’m going based off the fact that for skull candy most of the volume is the bass which again is only really present at about max volume and I can hear everything outside of the headphones at half volume even with noise cancellation on this is not the case with my beats these aren’t a terrible headphone but I can say I have more regrets than positive emotion when it comes to my purchase that was for the purpose of finding something better than my beat solo 4’s"
"I got these on prime day and from ALL the reviews on YouTube and online, these came in a case. Even the comments that are auto generated by AI on this site says people appreciate the quality case. Honestly, the case was a bigger deal than thought because....these feel very different than my max pros or my other headphones. I REALLY was wanting the case due to me using these for work/travel specifically.Now, initial thoughts. I think the sound quality is just fine because you know what you are getting into. This is NOT an accurate set of headphones, so don't expect that because these are bass headphones. I personally think that they have met all expectations of sound quality.My son has the evos and I tested those for an evening before I purchased. I ""liked"" them to a point but they gave me a headache on top of my head due to headband pressure. These, do not give that same pressure so these are good for long term.The app is nice. Seems easy enough to work in and through. I ""think""  the app, with the personal hearing setup, has a cleaner ""crusher"" than the evos. The evos were just loud loud and rattled your head. These are loud, and the ""crusher"" works fine, but I do think it is a cleaner. If you are into car audio, these are like JL W series in a car that has been fixed for no rattles. The evos are like digital designs in a civic that hasn't had any rattle preventions: Clean bass vs trunk rattle :)Overall: I bought these cause I like headphones. These are gimmicky - ish, but its what I wanted. Clean enough if you are after a bass experience. Battery is going to be GREAT!!! ANC is ok, works minimally but ehh, you're not buying these really for anc, are you? It works good enough with the audio that comes out. That alone will drown out the world. Quality feel is mixed. It looks clean and nice, materials seem good. It feels very loose and pliable around the ears. This is where my fear is, especially since I did not get a case and I am using these for work and travel.I am VERY disappointed with no case. I understand that this page doesn't say case, but it also doesn't say travel bag. ALL reviews and statements about these (I did about 50) that I researched on all had a travel case. This alone, because it did not meet this expectation, is why its a 3 star for me. I go to any other site with these for sale, they all come with a travel CASE. Also, it doesn't look like it was opened prior, but it was missing a cable, the aux-aux. That is noted on the box as supposed to be in it. If it weren't for that, it'd be on the 5 star side."
"It worked fine for like the first 4 weeks, I go to the gym but one day the scroll wheel stopped working. I suspect maybe it was cause i was sweating but that shouldn’t be enough for it to stop working, i sadly returned these and hope they fix this problem"
"The bass is a cool novelty but once you get bored of it and turn it down you realize that sound quality is really subpar and I'm not an audiophile either, they just sound muddy and don't have a great top end. Great battery life though and they're comfy enough and fit around your ear not over the top of them."
So compared to the predecessor (crusher evo no anc) they just don't hold up especially for the price because the anc isn't good and the bass got worse because the headphones take all the control instead of letting you use the lever. For all the audiophile people out there I would set the EQ while having no bass so I can just add bass with the slider if needed. So essentially mostly high pitch and drop the lows and highered the mids a bit. And the clarity was there just with the slide of a lever... you added more and came out with less of something you aimed for bad anc bad bass and bad controls? Like you got to be kidding me and I think I will return these even though I got them for 130 dollars... so my advice skullcandy choose the bass or anc and let those who what clarity set there own EQ to make up for the heavy bass overall truly disappointing the only redeeming factor is the way they fit on your head a little more snug. Although good sound quality but not when compared to when my evos are set to the best of my ability.
"Was given a travel bag instead of a hard case which is very disappointing, only reason I chose this pair over others was soley for the case"
"They sacrificed everything for the bass. The “crusher” bass will appeal to the people who don’t think it’s good music unless it hurts to stay in the same room as the speaker. These might be good for the person in your life who gets noise complaints against them regularly.The headphones them selves are very comfortable and look quit nice. I could easily wear them for hours. But all the comfort doesn't mean a thing when your music is buried under a mountain of bass filled mud.The app lets you reprogram the buttons giving you some nice customization. It also lets you turn off the “crusher” base. Which is saying something. When the best thing about a companion app is it lets you shut off the main selling point of your product, then you screwed up.Liking bass is fine but you should not sacrifice everything else for it."
The sound is great and it looks good. But the feature I wanted to come through was the ANC and it’s mediocre. I can still hear the subtle sounds around my house that premium headsets filter out.
"The ""crusher"" doesn't give extra bass to the music, it just makes the earcups(which are too small) vibrate to give the effect of more bass! I actually find it annoying so I turn it off. They do have decent sound volume and battery life. Soundwise though, I'm constantly adjusting them over my ears to hear any treble, I know treble is a directional sound but come on"
Please try to make the charge longer.  Good product but I can't use it beyond a couple of hours.  Literally 2 hrs and its DEAD...
"The bass in these headphones is unmatched, love it!!!...My only issues with these headphones are the fit, you really have to get them on your ears perfectly to get a snug feel to lower outside noise, plus the ANC...It definitely needs some work, especially in high intensity mode, it's distorts the music big time, hopefully Skullcandy will address both issues with the next model or a firmware update."
"Things I like…It’s sleek,ANC is good (not the best) theIt’s really good for listening to musicCharges fastThings I dislikeIt’s EXTERELY LOUDThe bass is a bit too muchIt doesn’t have an Auto off button so while it holds charge for a day. It literally runs out if you’re not using it which is extremely annoying. You need to always turn it off if you’re not using it.The voice isolation is SO BAD. It’s hard for others to hear you even when you’re in a quiet room.Way too many buttonsSynopsis: if you just want the to listen to music or audio books it’s ok.Terrible for calls.Will be returning the product."
The bass is absolutely beautiful but the ANC is not so so “beautiful” but overall i’d go with the evo crusher because it’s just the same but cheaper and yeah
"Pros:  1. The sound is good  2. Loud  3. Bass is good  4. Can make a phone call and it’s clearCons:  1. There is No noise cancelling  2. Overpriced since there is no noise cancelling. I’m glad I got these for prime day for $134, cause there is no way I would pay over $200 for them since noise cancelling is what I wanted."
"Compared to other ANC headphones like xm4 and Bose quiet comforts, the sound quality just isn’t there.The bass is way too overpowering, and I had to tone it down.Although, the crusher mode was beneficial ONLY for gaming.You can't turn off the automated voice off that tells you “On/off” and her voice is so loud that it is annoying and hurts your ears if you have good hearing.When in car ride and with ANC on, it only blocked so much sound. I could hear loud bass frequencies of large vehicles, and it was distracting (I did have windows down).After using it for a while, my head started to hurt, too. It might have been because of blue tooth radiation with these specific models.The app is decent, though. It allows you to adjust EQ with five sliders.Overall, I would recommend purchasing another headphone unless you want your skull crushed"
I really like the headphones they sound good and have great bass but after two days they stopped working so I jus ordered another pair hopefully they continue working this time.
