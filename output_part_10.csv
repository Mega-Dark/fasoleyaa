"There are no clues as to how to get started with this laptop. I have started to hook it up 3 hours ago and I still don't know whether I can hook up a mouse to the device.  It advertised Microsoft products all the time, you just have to ignore, to continue on with starting up.  No Dell support on the phone to get you going.  I have had many, multiple computers in my home since 1982.  This is a first for me in purchasing with no support with this laptop computer.  It will most likely be my last DELL, and if I can find a way to avoid Microsoft I will.New Problem now Dell is threating me with 2 step verification.  I have to have it installed, and I have to have an account with Dell.  Two things I try to avoid at all costs.  Now I will check out other new laptops and do the move myself.  Can't get in touch with Dell!  They are the worst Computer Outfit I have encountered. Would not buy again!"
I’m giving this a 3 star because it is advertised as a gaming laptop and to a new buyer it will seem like it can play most games but in reality any newer Games will not run on this computer. I am giving it 3 stars because as a everyday laptop for me school etc it has worked really well and is a good quality
"not everything mentioned in the box arrived, the most important item the computer arrived, but the rest didn't ."
I dislike the fact it's a discotinued model therefore it's an antique.  It replaced me chromebook which had a long and useful life.
I asked if this had a back lit keyboard and was told online that it did. That is the only reason I bought this model. It does not have this feature. Not happy.
"We ordered two laptops. One worked just fine. One was slow, barely loaded games and kept prompting for bitlocker even after image rest. Returned that one."
Just received this computer. Bought it specifically because the specs said a backlit keyboard. It does NOT have this feature. Very frustrating.
Like the title says. The software can’t even make a working restore usb drive. It can’t restore the recovery partition. Definitely not a Thinkpad. But does seem to run Linux well. May return it as a laptop installing updates should not reach above 90 degrees Celsius.
This thing has done nothing but cause problems for months. Randomly shuts completely down when not in use then takes forever to turn on. Yesterday I had to force restart and spend 30 minutes trying to get it turned back on. Today it turned on but won’t allow me to log in. Support is barely being helpful at all and takes their sweet time offering any assistance at all. Really should have been better quality to last more than 3 months without all these issues for the price. Bad quality. Bad value. Bad first experience buying Dell.
"I love Dell products however, this one is not so great after setting everything up and using for a few hours,  I  logged out.  Next morning I  only got a black screen."
"I was so looking forward to a new computer, to have it be blank on the second day... I was disappointed when the screen went blank... the power box was lit, but the cord that went to the computer was dead, no power to the computer."
"Two days out of the box, the computer crashed and had to had a hard reset. Three days out of the box, Windows wouldn't start correctly."
"Not a bad computer when it worked, but suddenly stopped charging after 2 weeks. Returned it, but the return process takes forever, still haven’t gotten a refund."
Paid over 700 for this and stopped working after only 3 weeks !!!
Nothing but issues with this laptop. Never buying electronics from amazon again.
"I had to return the item, the audio was all messed up."
Was suppose to have backlight keyboard. Speaker keys not working. One positive easy set up.
The computer did not work from day one. They charged a restocking fee of $173 to return it. Criminal!
It’s laggy and plain bad. No words.
"The phone stopped working, a prompt keep popping up android stopped working also the battery runs down to 0 after fully charged in one day not being used. I need my money back"
The quality of this phone was very poor. Can not hold connection and when in use there is statics . Had to change to another phone
"It worked for 2 days however, they were very good about taking it back. I thank you for that. They were right on it.I would not buy another one"
"Item quit working after it was charged. I have been requesting a replacement for a week with no response. I received a pop that said I would get new phone after defective one is returned but I have no address to return the item to. Apparently sold by Amazon and they have been of no help at all and I am running out of time to return, I believe this to be intentional."
Not a good phone for the value $ the worst phone I ever bought. Don't waste your money. Recommended just Samsung phones. I tried this Nokia because the review some people posted. I'm very disappointed.
"The device first date available is Oct 17, 2023, and there is no more security update available after Jan 5, 2024. It is less than 3 months. It doesn't meet my expectations. I expect the device will at least have security update for 12 months."
"Ok for a second phone.  Don't like location of the speaker, it muffles laying flat when media use.  Otherwise ok backup phone."
"I bought this phone believing that it would keep my 7-year-old entertained. Unfortunately, it can't. Apps like HULU, Amazon prime, and Netflix just to name a few are not compatible with this phone."
Why pay over $80 for a phone that wouldn't even turn on?
"I bought this device thinking it will work on an African network carrier. It does work, but doesn’t display 4G nor LTE. After some research i found out it doesn’t support 4G nor 3G, while it was advertised as supporting 4G."
Won’t stay connect to WIFI. Horrible phone. Dnt waste your money
The phone was super slow and would freeze when trying to take pictures.
"Within the year of me purchasing this phone, it was not able to be charged. I purchased another phone on February 16, 2024 here it is November 30, 2024 and the second is not able to charge. I will take the phone in to see if it can be repaired. I will update you on the findings."
This is hands down the slowest piece of trash I have ever owned. The performance of this phone is proof that whoever gives it a good raring must have been paid by Nokia. It wouldnt even be worth it if it was free
"My initial review was too complementary.  This phone is a total disaster.  During a recent trip it failed to provide information regarding directions to a destination.  Using Facebook or Messenger, I am unable to provide comments to items I forward, even my own.  I had high hopes this phone would be the answer to an Android or IOS, but it falls very short.  Save your money.The OS is apparently a hybrid of Android and Oxygen.  The OS changes the settings without any notice or rationale.  I rebooted hoping that might resolve it but made it worse.  It deleted many folders I had created. Changed other folders from square to round.  Removed the permanent apps usually found on the home screen task bar.  On the home screen I would swipe right to view news information.  Now it opens a ""My Notes"" app, which I cannot uninstall or even find in the list of apps on the device, to force stop.  I was glad to find a non-Samsung phone, that offered a possible alternative to Android, but am beginning to regret it. Other less concerning issues are:  It will not display/play some videos or images from some news feeds or social apps. One reboot it got hung up in the boot-up process.  For about five minutes it displayed a red dot with two white dots orbiting the red dot.  I was finally able to perform another reboot to get it out of that cycle."
"I think this phone is better than some offerings I've seen and YES this works on some U.S carriers. I tried it on Mint which uses Tmobile and got 315 MBs in Pocatello, Idaho. U.S mobile you can use either Tmobile or Verizon and it worked for me using a sim card. However, if you ask for support in message they will say they don't. I have an activated Verizon-based SIM I use in my Samsung Z-FLIP 4 that I swapped to the 12R to see if it works it does and I get good speeds just not Tmobile speeds so yes it works but you won't have tech support for it not to mention  U.S mobile tech is kinda sketchy anyways. Cricket you can pretty much forget about as they want to sell you proprietary devices as well as the Big Three Verizon, Tmobile, and ATT. I think on the other MVNO's the sim will work without tech support E-sims are out for now.If you go purely by specs and forget about wireless charging it is one of the better phones that has just ok cameras. The one thing I think tech reviewers have ignored but is a major part of a user is ECO-SYSTEM. Gemini makes me scream for Bixby or even Alexa the AI is so biased and untruthful. The messaging sucks.There is no theme store or font, etc. In the photo above you see a copy of a theme from Samsung that it brought over when it copied my phone. This phone has some nice features such as a nice screen I leave it in Vivid mode. Samsung forces you to buy the Ultra to get this type of screen. For me, the fast charging is cool , but seems kind of bull you have to get the 12 at a much higher price to get wireless. The apps run fast and you get three years of OS updates and 4 years of security. I think in three months when this is paid off I'm giving it to my kid and getting myself a Samsung 23 FE."
The battery capabilities are excellent. The battery charges within a half an hour or less with the 80 watt charger and last all day.  The camera quality is poor compared to my Samsung S23 Galaxy. I'm not sure if Galaxy s23 is top of the line but that is my frame of reference when it comes to camera quality. The notes feature are also not compatible with Samsung notes. I'm sure that doesn't matter to most people but for me it does.
First off I got this phone because I like the battery power and it says it has a good battery. But it really isnt that great to me even with the power saver mode. I did a test with this phone and my old phone which was just a 150 dollar pixel 3xl ive had about a year and a half. I put them side by side and put youtube on on both with the screen brightness lal he way up on both and they ended up using almost the same amount of battery. Im like really? I bought this phone in order to have better battery. And then the screen keeps dimming on its own after 15 seconds and every time i change it to 10 minutes it keeps going back to 15 seconds when i put the battery saver mode on. So EVERY single time i put it on power save mode i have to go to settings and change the dim time its very annoying. So its a decent phone but it doesnt do much more than the 150 dollar phone I already have. I wish i would have just spent 200 more and got the pixel 9 with better camera.
How to get it or should I get a refund??
"Good battery, good screen, good camera. Fingerprint - bad, works 1 time and doesn't work 9 times"
"This is beautiful and nice, the only need it is wireless charging"
"Can't understand why does it flash the screen sometimes unless it's stealing screenshot?If it has 16 gb of ram why does it lag and constantly disconnect from the internet. Coming from a pixel phone plagued with similar overheating and internet disconnects, I'm already hating this phone. Why should a phone with such good specs be such a piece of crap that can't even load Pokémon go? I shouldn't have to tell my supposedly ""smart"" phone to not be retarded because it can't do the most basic thing a person wants a smartphone for is to connect to the internet. Hi I'm a oneplus phone and you just wasted your money sucker.. Just another expensive piece of crap that some marketing person called fast. Don't care for interface either. Very unintuitive to find settings."
I have been using OnePlus phones for the last few years (more of the cheaper/affordable models. The last one I had was the OnePlus N30. I loved the phone and could not wait to have a newer model on my hand. So I bought this one. I love the phone but I don't really see a big difference between this phone and OnePlus N30.
Good specs on this one but I regret buying it. It froze less than a week after I got it. The screen sometimes doesnt respond immediately. My lock button is trigger happy. I just need to brush it and ... locked. Maybe I got a defective one. Also it's not built to use intuitively. I still havent figured out how to cascade to see all my open windows. And there is no back arrow at the bottom of the screen. Just at the top. So I have to use two hands to scroll back. I have had Samsung for the last 10+ years and am sorry I tried something different. I've never been this frustrated with my Samsung. Amazing specs for the price but I wish I'd just paid more and gotten the quality I'm use to
Only thing I don't understand why I have to constantly unlock it to have Google call or text. It anyone could help with this id appreciate all the replies.
"OnePlus used to be a great phone for a good price and there slogan was never settle. Now they charge too much and nerf the functions. This phone in particular is very disappointing because they removed the display over usb-c function. You have to load a custom ROM to get that feature back. I needed this feature for working a remote job.Another major flaw is the curved glass. I thought I wouldn't mind it but it makes the edges hard to interact with touch controls. Also, you can't easily get good screen protectors. I used to love OnePlus phones but lately I've been wishing for new competition."
"Since the day I bought this phone, I was impressed! Very fast and reliable! But when on loud speake call, the mic doesn't work as much. People can barely hear me. I thought it was an update issue and even got the latest version of the os but the mic is still a problem. I do not know if I purchased a bad unit or if it is just the flaw of the phone. I wish I could get it replaced but I need this phone for work and stuff. Other than that.... Best phone next to the pixel."
"There was a lot to like about this phone. It was fast, the battery life was pretty good, although not as great as the reviews I read led me to believe. The phone really does charge from 0-100 in 30 minutes. It was amazing. They do give you the option to remove items from your status bar to prevent screen burn or just to customize to your liking, which was helpful.  But there were some things I didn't like. There is no always on display. It just turns on when you move your phone. But it's not ""always on.""  The facial recognition works great, but I could not get it to read my fingerprints properly. It was very frustrating.  I also tried to transfer some photos  to my computer and was unable. The One Plus folder kept freezing on my laptop. I've never had this happen with any other phone. But the deal breaker for me was that one plus does not allow users to customize the Do Not Disturb feature. I turned my notification slider to the silent position and turned on do not disturb and an alarm still went off in the middle of a meeting. I called one plus customer service and was told that they do not allow any alarms to ever be silenced on their phones. You have to go into your alarm app and silence it from there. Even trying to lower the volume to zero is impossible. You can still hear the alarm on the lowest setting. I tried using do not disturb, the notification slider, and the Zen mode app. Nothing worked. This phone isn't super expensive, but it costs enough for me to be able to expect to silence my phone if I want to do so. Returning!! This was my first time trying a OnePlus phone. Until they change that feature, I will not be trying them again."
"I got this phone as a replacement for a OnePlus 10T (that was a solid five star rating) so coming from that phone that I found amazing, the 12r seems to me that the components used are not of the same quality, the overall performance of the phone seems to be sluggish and perhaps OnePlus went with a more budget build frame of mind vs a flagship phone at a budget friendly price point build which is what I had in my previous OnePlus phones. The quality is certainly not the same but the cost to purchase is at the same level, so what happened OnePlus??"
"Some websites shows that this phone has 4500 nits for brightness,but I compared with my nubia Z60 Ultra (1500 nits) and the brightness was not that different.I found out later that the 4500 nit is peak brightness that can happen only in few scenarios (HDR mode, etc).Disappointed."
"If you want a phone that gets it's screen cracked easily, while having a screen protector and a case, this may be the phone for you. Shame, I had the one plus(forget the model name) that lasted me literally 5+ years and got this one to 'upgrade', which, in fairness, the O.S has treated me well, that's why I gave it two stars instead of one. Im pretty good at taking care of my phone so the irritation and disappointment is pretty high. I even returned the first phone (this one I'm reviewing right now) for this same reason. A crack that just starts with a little air bubble, circular on the screen, and wake up one morning to the crackling at full affect."
"Hi. I just set up my phone and it is good for the price. However, I did not receive thw case that was stated in what's in the box section in the description. That is why I am giving 3 stars."
This cell phone is not as good as the one I had . It is too heavy and the system collapses 2-3 times a day.
"A good friend of mine recommended this as they had bought another phone from Amazon. Their first phone was not a brand name and this one is not either. That's why they had no issues with this. Made in China as most of Amazon products are, would not connect nor transfers files from my name brand cell phone to their low quality cell phone. Tried all afternoon and all night will no success. The sad part about it was there were notice or acknowledgements when purchases at a certain price amount, that Amazon doesn't tell customers who want a refund for large amounts of money that it will take months or forever to refund the amount purchased. When a product is returned, Amazon will tell you that as soon as they ""Amazon"" receives the product that you will be refunded. I'll take my changes with a brand name electronic store and get my refund back much more quickly and with less unwritten return/refund products. If you have an auto from China maybe you'll have less/fewer issues since they are both are bottom dwellers."
"If you order this phone in blue, it is a 'different variant' and has known compatibility issues with US Mobile's network. Maybe others. I ordered this exact phone in grey and blue. Grey one works fine but looking at the box, you see the blue one has a newer manufacture date. So it's not the same. Returned it and now just buying another grey one and use two different color cases. I wasted an evening figuring this out."
"i have used this phone a few days now and i am returning it. i am disappointed; i had a oneplus nord n200 a few years ago when i joined t-mobile and i never had an issue with that phone. but concerning this phone i will say that the camera works very well.  the battery seems ok as well. a huge plus for me was the fact i could switch to 4g instead of 5g which saved battery life.  although i found the battery saver icon odd the battery saver and data saver feature also work very well on the phone.  but for me there were a few issues.  I could not disable the lock screen completely, it had some freezing issues,  and firefox did not work properly( trying to read vertically the pages did not fully fit the screen, had to scroll left and right a little to read articles).  i was also a bit disappointed more of the preinstalled useless apps could not be disabled or better yet uninstalled. the issues are even larger since i moved from the sub $200 dollar phone range to try this tier of phones.  i also did not like that i talked to oneplus tech support/customer service and was told all phone have a lock screen that cannot be disabled even though i and others i know have them now or have had them(the nord n200 did not have that issue).  this phone has quite a bit of  potential and i hope oneplus does a better job in the future with is os ecosystem.  but i won't be buying a oneplus anytime in the next few years."
I bought this thinking it would have wireless charging. It does not. They should make this a NOTE in the description.I will be returnng this 12R. So un fortunate.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Great phone but only 1 star. Why?  Because Amazon sells One Plus but does not accept One Plus as a trade in....so I should have bought directly from One Plus website to trade in my One Plus 8. I bought this to replace the OnePlus 8 which OnePlus is no longer supporting with updates.  The battery on this 12R is fantastic.  It lasts a long time. Charging? Cord only but super I mean super fast as it was on the 8. Charge from 20 PC to 80 PC in like 20 minutes. Wow! Curved screen yes like my 8 but you get used to it quick. I use a case with a foldable cover. Screen size is just a tad bigger.  Camera? Much better than the One Plus 8 but the 8 was not bad at times. Use the Pro camera option. Video? Not very good unless you hold it steady.  You have to hold the phone very steadily or your video will go blurry. Speaker? The speaker is not very loud compared to my OP8. Putting a call on speaker is not very loud. That sucks! So, I have a new OP 25612 GB that will be supported with updates for 3 years but I am wondering if I should have stuck with the 8 a bit longer? Samsung and Google updates are longer. Anyway, this is a solid phone overall for the price. It is overall an improvement from the OP 8. I might have been happier with the Pixel 7 pro at the same price? Better video and cameras perhaps? No matter I will stick with this one.  Overall very good. Buy it at the OnePlus website to trade in your older One Plus phone. Cheers."
"I like the phone. I just keep having issues when people call me they can't hear me. I tried getting help but it says ""unexpected error occured"" when I give my number to get tech support."
Erratic PerformanceApps work intermittently.Connectivity on Wifi is unpredictable.Disconnects unpredictably.Requires re-entry of WiFi/ Network to reconnect.Works intermittently at best with car interface.Lots of time spent getting unit to do basic functionsNot a clear way to do a restart on this unit either.Are there any reliable unlocked phone models?
"This is my second phone after initially purchasing the Redmi Note 13 Pro after many hours of phone research. I ended up having to return the Xiaomi because MIUI was so awful. The dealbreaker for me was the inability to use gestures w/ third party launchers.Anyway, as for this phone. The phone is snappy, launching apps and switching between apps is utterly seamless. The camera is solid, and Oxygen OS, unlike MIUI, actually looks like something designed for an adult rather than a child with ADHD. The only SLIGHT downside is the fingerprint reader can fail a bit too often. Maybe it's because I have a cut on my finger and tend to come at it from odd angles. It usually has no issues when you place your finger dead-on. The other slight downside for some would be the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack. I personally avoid wireless headsets because EMF isn't great for you, so this was a bit of a downside for me, however, I simply bought a cheap 3.5mm to USB-C adapter and problem solved.UPDATE 4/2/24: I'm on my 2nd OnePlus 12R after returning the first one due to it randomly crashing and restarting while driving. The replacement is doing the exact same behavior. This is inexcusable and makes the phone unusable. I just can't have a phone that will randomly restart on me without warning. Too dangerous and frustrating. Oneplus dropped the ball big time. The sad part is, this is probably an easy bug fix, but who knows when they'll fix this... No thanks. Will have to go elsewhere."
I will never buy another one. It's so slow loading on 75mb/ps bandwidth Internet. Great screen terrible battery to life. For the price and YouTube videos on this phone I thought it would be better
The smart phone is good.But i don't like curved screen phone!The curved screen distract me
I've had a OnePlus 8 for going on three and a half years the battery was starting to go and I figured I'd buy a new phone really looked at this for a while I'm 12 hour looks like a good price for the hardware and honestly it is however the software upgrades to the 12 are absolutely atrocious I would not recommend getting this phone I think I would rather have something different I miss the ability to change my media output by the volume rocker I could go between Bluetooth and the phone speaker now I have to click three buttons to choose between Bluetooth items and turn the Bluetooth off if I want to use the phone speaker. I also really really really hate the way they've redone a lot of the quick menu pull-down it resembles an iPhone and I really don't like iPhone if I had wanted that I would have bought an iPhone. Frankly I'm just not happy with the software.
"This brand new phone lags, freezes, runs frame by frame frequently, crashes, doesn't save pictures I take 10% of the time. I usually buy refurbished older phones, but I was sick of battery issues with those older phones, so I decided to bite the bullet & buy a brand new phone, the OnePlus 12r. BIG MISTAKE! $500 down the toilet. Never, ever buy a OnePlus product unless you want at least 3 complaints about it's performance each and every day.11/28/2024 update: This is the WORST PHONE EVER MADE! Absolute garbage! Lags, freezes, misses calls, crashes. I want so bad to smash this POS into tiny pieces every time it messes up."
The only significant difference between the Oneplus 12R and my 3 year old Galaxy A42 5G was the fingerprint sensor. Most of my friends could see no difference in the pictures it took or they chose the pics from the Galaxy. No special features with the camera. The curved screen got annoying way faster than I thought it would. It wasn't the upgrade I'd hoped for.
"Got the phone back in May and somehow yesterday, the phone screen cracked underneath the company provided/applied screen protector. I went through the repair request, only to be told that screen cracks, physical damage and water damage will put the phone out of warranty, which is ridiculous. The phone was in my pocket when it happen so I don't even understand how it cracked but to learn that I can't get it repaired without paying for it seems unfair. I would understand it's it been a year plus but as mentioned, the phone is only 4 months old. So please be careful and be aware of their horrible Warranty services."
"I bought this used. Thought it would be a good phone after my research. Had it 4 months and the sound messed up. Now it has a mind of its own. The phone has locked me out. I turn it off and it comes back on, on its own. It’s possessed. Glad I already got another phone but this was a big waste of money. Do not waste your money on used."
"Normally you put your phone in your pocket with the back of it facing outwards.  This piece of crap is glass on the back cover, literally.  Shattered.  What kind of sane person puts glass on a phone where there is not a camera, not a screen, just something to break.  What a waste of $600.  Holy crap.  What a scam. They said I could pay for a new one. Don't waste your money."
No matter what I have tried I cannot get any cellphone carrier to work on this device. I have tried multiple different carriers including Verizon and at&t but none of them work. I have made multiple calls to OnePlus to try and fix this issue but they just tell me it is not an issue on their end and to get a replacement from Amazon. This is absolutely ridiculous and I am beyond annoyed. I will be returning the device and buying a phone from a different company.
"shame too cause I hear nothing but good things about this phone only for my current network to not be able to work with the phone.  Same goes for the Nothing phone 2a+, more companies should work out some kinda deal"
"At first I was upset because this phone works TERRIBLE with Android auto. It will give you a hard time to connect with your car and will work only for a few minutes, often crashing when you need the GPS the most. Then, I had my first accident with the phone. It fell from my hand while I was seated, not from the top of a building, and the screen shattered! It's the most fragile phone I've ever seen. Not worth what you save. Go for the real phones. I'll have to stick with my loss. Unfortunately."
"The screen is cheap and Easily scratches and brakes. My phone barely dropped, and it cracked. Not to mention, I’ve called customer service three different times to send me a return label to get it fixed and they never sent me one. They do not have their screens sent to third-party stores for you to just walk in store to get fixed. You have to send it in But how when they won’t even send me a damn invoice"
My phone came with a blotch of dead black pixels by the camera. I have since returned it and went to Best buy to physically inspect a phone before I buy it. I bought the same phone. It's fine. A good phone for the price. But they sent me a lemon. And if you get a lemon you have to wait a month to get your money back from amazon
Found many other people on Reddit repeating the issue. Phones drops wifi connection at close range to router on wifi 6 networks. No reported fix yet so avoid buying this unless you think they can fix it and it not a hardware issue.
"I am not a super user, just need a basic phone. Gmail freezes and YouTube Music also freezes when using Android Auto. Disappointing that basic features don't work well on any new phone, let alone one at this price point. Just bought a replacement. Phones usually last me 4+ years, this one made it just a few months."
Camara quality is very bad.... not able to capture real colours...even worse than older version of OnePlus
"The One Plus 12R did not work with my AT&T Firstnet Sim, apparently Sim compatibility is a big issue with One Plus phones. I was super disappointed as I was looking forward to some of the unique features offered by the One Plus phone. I ended up going with a pixel 8 pro instead."
Bad photos when it's a sunny day
"I've seen a lot of reviews about this phone, and in all of them the phone comes with it's case. But mine didn't arrive with it"
The WIFI just keeps going in and out. Get ready to browse a bunch of forum posts of people having the same issue.
This phone does not have the battery life as advertised. Only lasts about 10 hours. Also the one plus app keeps locking everything up on it. And Android 14 has numerous problems with causing lockups and reboots also I recommend it not buying this phone.
"Had to buy these twice in less than two weeks, both broke the screen to easily with very little impact. OnePlus used to be a good brand, not anymore."
This is a false advertisement because my phone came with the display broken
This phone ended up not being compatible with Boost Mobile.
There are NO call setiings in the settings
"If you need to use wifi calling, as I do since service is weak at my house, this phone is useless! When I called CS they finally told me that One must have T-Mobile if you ever intend to try to use wifi calling. I returned this phone."
"DO NOT GET THIS PHONE.  IT CONSTANTLY REBOOTS!right out of the box, default apps, it's sitting there on the table and boom.  Reboots.  No reason.  This has been ongoing with Android updates, oxygen OS updates, Google Play store updates.... Nothing fixed it.  Save your money and buy something other than this pretty brick."
Devise get to hot  very quickly  and some time sounds quality  no good. No safe device. Samsung galaxy  have many open options for costemer.
My second one plus..the phones mistouch prevention feature is the worst of any phone...to the point of ordering items off eBay in my pocket I can't return..it's constantly  going off in my pocket changing settings backgrounds making phone calls texting people...but today was the last straw..I reached in my pocket grabbed my phone and noticed it said order placed on the screen..well the items from China won't arrive for 30 days and I can't cancel it...  All because this piece of crap phone can't detect something as simple as being in your pocket..
"Overall, this phone is great. Good performance, charges from 10% to full in ten minutes, and it is a good value. The curved screen is sometimes annoying though when I have games or apps that require something on the edge of the screen be pressed, especially with a case. The phone is heavy, like feels two or three times more than my Galaxy S20FE. And now after one month, the center of my screen has a 2 centimeter scratch from who knows what. Haven't dropped it or anything major, and yet, it's there. Pretty annoying, my S20FE has been thrown to the ground and still shows no damage on the screen. And have fun trying to find a legit 12R screen protector, most Amazon listings list the 12R, but the reviews are for the flat screened phones."
"This phone has UFS 3.1 storage instead 4.0 if this is not important for you, buy it at that price."
"I have owned numerous one plus phones, and nord line, since the first one.  This phone has a no data connection message after a short time on wifi.  checked using other phones and no wifi or internet provider issues.  whether this issue is a software or hardware flaw is up to them to figure out.  they refused to exchange it or credit it towards the regular 12 price.so far, getting them to ship it back for their repair service under warranty has neen a weeks struggle, like pulling teeth.at this point, my nord 20 and 30 phones perform flawlessly compared to this phone. they wrecked oxygen os as soon as varl pei left a d oppo took over.  Extremely disappointed with this so called improved phone."
"I have had constant issues with this phone.  Phone freezes, webpages load excruciatingly slow, back button not working, touches not being recognized, random restarts, etc.  I opened a ticket with the manufacturer and they said I needed to mail the phone to them and they would determine if the phone was defective.  They refuse to send a replacement device and said it will take 7-10 days to determine if I can get a new device.So...if you can live without your phone for 7-10 days, then this is the phone for you.  Specs are great, customer service is non-existent."
Purchased directly from Oneplus USA and delivered over a week ago in the sale. Attached Pic for proof of purchase and ow erahip.Oneus lied to us on their site and specs for this phone. This phone is NOT compatible with US Carriers.  The IMEI is NOT on the white-list for Verizon or other US carriers.  You get invalid IMEI when trying to activate.Called Oneplus support verified these phones cannot be activated in US.  They who have me waiting for 'an email to follow' with no answer from them and cannot escalate.  They keep saying they are looking into the issue!Bottom line....it may work sometime in the future but DOES NOT NOW bmc Oneplus did not work with the US carriers properly.  Especially Verizon.  You are warned...
I didn't receive the case with my phone
"I'm upgrading from a 2020 Moto G Power, a phone I loved for it's battery life and hated  every time I tried to use it outside.  The display had to be set to 100% to use inside and was almost unusable in bright light. The 32 gig of memory was also limiting so being otherwise satisfied with the Moto g series of budget phones I shopped for a replacement.I liked the price of the Moto G Stylus and the specs suggested an improved display over the Power, 90hz vs 60hz ,Max Vision Full HD+ vs HD, and has the same 5000mAh battery. Didn't care one way or the other about the stylus just considered it a bonus.After purchase and setup of the Stylus ,I was immediately disappointed with the display.  There was absolutely no difference when I compared the Stylus side by side with the Power.  No improvement whatsoever. Again very dim display that needed 90% brightness to be usable indoors and the difficult outside view was the same.If the display were ANY better at all I would have given this phone 5 stars.  Everything else is very good for a budget phone, and the retractable stylus and associated software are easy to use . I'll never use it for more than jotting notes but I like having it.  This is a budget phone and being familiar with the Moto G line I don't think I'm being too rough when I say the glaring flaw of this phone is the display.Update:I thought the display was the major flaw but now I have to add that battery life is horrible.  Doesn't get me through one day much less the two days claimed by Motorola.  I would not recommend this phone!"
"I like the Moto g pwer 2021,  but this Moto g stylus 2022 phone didn't seemed as good nor better than the older phone for the following reasons:*The two day battery life did not seem to last two days, even with battery saver on.*Taking notes with the stylus are illegible no matter how I tried, which was the primary thing I was excited about for the stylus feature. While yes, there are other uses for the stylus and paintng with the stylus is fun, it just wasn't going to be useful enough to me without functional writing. It's like writing with a very bad credit card signature machine no matter how I tried! I also tried to look up if there were ways to refine it, but was unsucessful with that.*The size of the phone is just a little taller than the moto g pwer 2021 and 2022, yet I found it to be just a little too big and awkward.The features I liked about the phone were:The sound quality using speaker phone was really good, (especially compared to the moto g power 2022, which is bad in that respect).It wasn't very slow, was reasonably fast, faster than some though not great!Overall its a bummer this newer model (2022) moto phones are not just 'not' better, but worse than the year before Moto g power (2021) when it comes to basic features they're bragging about and designed for (ie the processing or operating system being slow, and the stylus feature not workng well for writing notes!)"
"I've had this phone for over a year and I used to be able to hear normally on it but now the music or news volume is too low to hear comfortably. Also have tried to use the smart audio but you can't use it unless you wear a headset, then it reverts back to being unadjustable when you don't have headphones in. Well, I like to listen to music when I'm in the shower and I can't even hear this over the water anymore. I could when I first bought it, although it wasn't as good as my previous moto G Power. I cannot recommend this phone for anyone middle aged or older who may be suffering hearing loss. I don't think my hearing has changed that much over the course of one year, but you never know. If it is me, this is not a good phone. However, I think it's the phone."
"Took the phone to TMobile and they couldn't setup, said the phone was not ""unlocked"". Told me to try another cell provider. Very disappointed."
"I looked at the comparison chart  way below where it shows the various models.  The comparison chart shows that the Moto Stylus 2022 has 5 G.  But this model they sent me does not.  I will admit they don't say it is, but if you use the chart below to compare the different  models, it says Moto Stylus 2022 has 5 G, which is darn confusing.  I had my phone for a month in and half before I figured out why 5 g was not working.  I understand they won't accept my return.  So you can learn from my mistake. If you want a 5 G phone, don't order this one."
"I've had a few Motorola phones, not all have been great. I like the phone and don't have a lot of trouble with it, but at times it gets so slow it is like it got stuck and overall is a slow connection to the Internet. I get seldom 3 or 4 bars, mostly 1 or 2. Have contacted my service provider I don't know how many times with no results. I don't actually know if it's the service or my phone? But it is a 5G phone and have never picked up 5g? Always days 4G LTE."
"There are a couple design flaws.  First, the speaker is at the bottom of the phone. I tended to rest it on my chest while talking on speaker phone and the speaker was muffled by my shirt.  It also had pointy edges along the part where the speaker opening is at the bottom. It was uncomfortable and bulky to hold while trying to talk or watch videos. The part that was most annoying is that it kept disconnecting from the wifi and without knowing that it had, I ended up using up all of my 5g of data for the month in one day.  Every time I would reconnect to wifi, it would drop again. After a week I just had enough and returned the phone.  With the case I bought it was also too heavy for the magnetic phone holder and would just slide off.  The fingerprint reader was also not easy to access, especially with the case on. Overall, just poorly designed and non ergonomic. One of my worst experiences with a new phone."
"So I've has the 2020, 2021 and now 2022 model of this phone. It seems like it trades out features each year. This phone would be perfect if it had the 2020 sound 2021 camera and the 2022 processor.I've had the 2022 for 3 months now.I upgraded after having 2 of the 2021 over heat and lose signal.The 2022 is my last ditch attempt after loving the 2020 version but it being a little laggy.I like the speed of the 2022 and being able to keep open multiple apps and go through with ease. I play Pokemon Go and Pikman Bloom. This phone allows me to go back and forth without it reloading each time. Phone calls are crystal clear.The bad with this is the camera quality it's subpar from the 2020 and 2021. Sound is decent for music but the 2020 is better. This is my last Moto Stylus I'll be looking into the Pixel line next.Also this new stylus is a lot weaker mine broke inside the slot, of course I can take it to get it out but not worth the effort"
"Started restarting itself at around a year. One day it started to do the same thing but just kept acting like it was turning off until it died.Charge it, does the same thing. 🤷"
"Grandma new unlocked phone. Transferred everything over, started using it people can hear every other few words that I say. Im def going to return. Its a 5g phone, thats not what I needed or thought I order since the same place I ordered my previous phone from a couple of years ago with no problem."
"2.5 stars. I had the galaxy S8 for years and replaced it with this phone.  I hated the galaxy, and I really wanted to like this phone.  I do like it, but it is glitchy.  First off, the good.  The battery is awesome.  I sometimes will get a full two days from a charge and that is with fairly heavy use.  I listen to pod casts pretty much all day while working.  The camera is very good.  I love the big screen.  Volume is better than the galaxy.  There are other features that I also like, a few not as good as the galaxy, but no big deal on those.  The price was a major plus as well.  The two major things that really bug me about this phone is that is can be glitchy - sometimes it will freeze for a few seconds, or just randomly close apps... Things like that.  The ONE major showstopper though is that it often loses wifi and data connection.  It will sometimes randomly disconnect from my home wifi and cannot reconnect when others around me are on with no problems.  Sometimes I will have no phone service when others do who are on my same Verizon family plan.  Sometimes I will be places that I never had a problem with service before and will have no service.  *Sometimes* restarting the phone will temporarily fix the issue, but it doesn't last.  I run businesses so this isn't acceptable.  At this point I am considering other options.  Disappointed."
"At first it worked perfectly, but the battery didn't last long, and I don't see any difference in the camera than any others,"
"I've owned several Moto phones over the years and been happy with their performance. This phone puts an end to that run of good luck.There are many problems with this phone:-It takes forever to boot, and doesn't always boot properly, needing to be restarted again.-The touchscreen often does not respond.-The screen sometimes develops white lines that will disappear when rebooted.These are off the top of my head. There are other strange, oddball glitches that occur on a regular basis.I'm giving the phone three stars only because of it's affordability. I'll try to make this phone work for me as long as possible, and when I purchase my next phone, sadly, it won't be a Moto."
"Mine is probably a lemon. Intermittent data proven to be in an area with a strong signal , drops the password for Wifii after asking if I want to save, ""yes"", then a week or two later it asks for the password again. It switches to one of my sales emails from a game or searching the internet. The spell check changes to words way outside the word misspelled. I've not checked the text closely and have written some idiotic sentences. The touch screen is too sensitive. The help within the phone is useless. I have yet to know how to change the screens sensitivity.It's DATA that bothers me the most. I cannot count on this phone. Off and on.I wanted to really be sure this phone was defective before I returned this for a refund, but they only allow 30 days. I am just under 60 days and screwed. I believe I will melt this phone down to a Motorola pendant and wear it.My advice, don't buy a phone online. I want to see the person selling it and I want to be able to go in and talk with someone personally. Oh, and both my provider help desk and the Motorolla help desk were no help after several hours of speaking to a foreigner.I guess I'll send it in and then get a glowing report on how well it works on their bench. I'll play that game until I give up.... I am not hopeful.I always apologize if I am wrong, so look for me in about two months. I'll update."
"Very disappointed with this phone.  It's much too big for my taste.  I didn't see much improvement over the previous version.  Wi-Fi calling isn't great, often struggles to activate the Wi-Fi calls (I NEED this where I live).  Overall I just would choose this phone.  I had to get one pronto cuz my other phone meet is demise.  It due take great macro photos.  Battery is OK.  Rather heavy."
"I purchased this phone in January 2023 and have had nothing but problems with it.  I have been in communication with my provider on several occasions, trying to fix what I thought were problems on their end, but nothing has worked.  I did the suggestions to fix the problems that Moto suggests, but again to no avail.  I've been consistently unable to receive and make calls, the same with text messaging.  I've been told when people call me, it doesn't even ring, but goes straight to voicemail.  So, I just purchased a new phone yesterday after only having this one for 6 months.  I'm over it and not excited to be spending more money for a phone this soon."
"Initially I was impressed with the moto g stylus 2022 (non 5g).  Despite being plastic housing the look and feel of the device was on the higher end.  The battery life was good and it has a nice large display. I went from a 3 year old premium smartphone to the moto stylus.  The stylus and its processor are quick...but not fast. You can tell you are working with a value phone if you have used a premium one in the past. And my 3 year plus old phone speed tested much better than the stylus. That being said I found it to be a great value overall. The reason I ended up returning it was due to ongoing issues with getting pictures, videos, and attachments in messages.  They were blurry and low quality. If not for this I would have kept the device and enjoyed it as a low cost alternative."
"I bought this phone specifically for Wi-Fi calling. Do not buy if this is your reason to buy and you have AT&T.  They do not allow unlocked phones to have Wi-Fi calling.If you need Wi-Fi calling, get a Google Voice number.AT&T should be ashamed of themselves for not allowing Wi-Fi calling on this phone.  They sell the same exact phone (for a higher price, of course).It's really a shame when you have been a customer of a company for nearly 40 years and they screw you like this.While on my cruise (the reason I bought the phone), the battery life didn't last close to the 2 days advertised.The touch screen can be too touchy at times."
"I have had 2 of these.  Right off the bat the battery is HORRIBLE.  If you buy this phone make sure to buy the extended warranty because the battery MIGHT last you a year before it needs replacing.  The cameras are also not really as described. Very blurry and hard to adjust.  Video is better than photo.  One little annoying thing.  The Ringer and Notification setting are together so if you want to turn off notifications you wont hear your phone ring either.  Really stupid, but all Motorola phones are this way.  I miss so many calls.  Overall I will not buy another Motorola phone. Too many little things that could be easily changed."
"Originally I ordered the the 6g/128gb device not the 4g/128gb as a standby for my 12g/256gb device. The device runs slow, overheats when it's attempting to process too much information. However, I use my device for work (outlook, teams) and personal (games, IG, FB, photos, video calls, etc) simultaneously. With a case on, the device will overheat and cut off. Not a terrible device as long as it's not doing too much."
My husband adult son and I all got this phone and I would like to say that it is without trouble but that would not be true. Now in general I love Motorola phones so it's nothing against Motorola for this particular model with it not being 5G and an urban setting it doesn't do very well compared to 5G phones I'm guessing but from what I understand it could be that it's fighting for bandwidth I could be wrong. All of this have had connection issues more one kind or another compared to our prior phones but it certainly isn't the worst phone I've ever had them misfortune of using and I would gladly still stick with Motorola.
out of warranty it changed. I don’t consider two years a lifetime for a phone
"I purchased this phone on second prime day this past October.  I didn't like the tall size and slim design, it felt a bit slow, I was expecting more.  Yes it did have 2 mor GB of RAM, but that didn't really do much for me.  The real disappointment was it still had Android 11...I mean WHAT THE HELL...Really...My two year old version of the same phone has Android 11...The price was descent, but I was paying for a newer version, which I felt delivered less.Still love Motorola, but would of wanted a Snapdragon  and Adreno to go alone with those 6gigs, and for sure Android 12.  Also my 2020 version had Dou speaker, this speaker on the new 2022 has one speaker."
"Update: Phone is kind of glitchy. Not sure what's happening but screen randomly minimizes during messenger calls and some of the text cuts off in notifications.I really like this phone, but it's important to note that I actually received the 5G instead of what is listed here. I'm not complaining because it's actually an upgrade, but I ended up having to order a different case. Other than that I've been super happy with both of my Motorola phones."
This phone lasted exactly 14 months.  Bought new.  From the start it had problems loosing signal.  Every time I'd go through a dead zone after coming out of it I'd have to reboot to get it to work again.  I could get by with that. It was a minor nuisance. The worst thing is that the charging port wore out in such a short time. And I'm not a heavy user. I'd charge it each night. That's it. The battery life was good as long as you could get it to charge. The battery life is about the only really good thing I could say about it.  But is has become impossible to charge so I had to buy another phone way too soon.  I normally use a phone for 5 or 6 years. This will be the last Motorola phone I will ever have.  I'll keep its carcass around just to remind me not to get another. I've had a lot of phones and many brands.  This was easily the worst of them all.  And the others that were better were all cheaper.
"This phone does not have a gallery, and is a lot different from other phones, so keep that in mind. The stylus will scratch the screen if you don't have a protector, and sometimes the stylus doesn't work well. However, it does have a lot of storage space, and is easy to move the sim card and an extra micro SD card for even more space. Didn't even have to bring my old phone in to get the sim card in."
"I previously had the Moto G.. oh, what's the model name? Power. Moto G Power. The battery life on that is great. I really wanted the Stylus. I'm happy with that, and the screen size/ display. I wouldn't buy this again because of the battery life trade- off and the Crickety spam/ bloat. Drops calls and text delays, but I'm pretty sure that's the fault of being in a marginal service area and not the device itself."
"I had a Motorola G stylus (2020) and it worked great, but after 2 years of updates it battery life had decreased and the phone started doing things on it's own-calling people, playing videos I didn't even touch, etc.  Well the Motorola G Stylus (2022)-bought in Nov 2022-started to have a mind of it's own within 6 months of purchase.  This is not even close to the 2020 model.  Had I known it would be this bad at the 1 year mark I would never have bought it.  I like to keep phones for 2 years, but may have to give in and buy a new one soon.  I would not recommend this phone at all.6/30/24 Update:  I have absolutely no idea why this has such great reviews and ratings.  The phone is now freezing up at a black screen when I use my finger print.  Have to put the phone down for a minute then try again.  On vacation the phone froze on a black screen, shut down, and wouldn't boot up until 10 minutes later.  No way on earth I could recommend this phone to anyone.  Looking for a new phone tomorrow. So this lasted 1 year and 7 months."
"It's a great phone for the price I paid for it ($130).  It has a good screen, plenty of RAM and storage, an ok processor, and decent (but definitely not 2 days) battery life.  The stylus is a silly gimmick and is mostly useless for writing, but it comes in handy on occasion.The only negative experiences I've had with this phone are related to wireless connectivity.  It often disconnects or fails to connect to weak or distant Wi-Fi routers.  It's not a problem with most networks, but it disconnects whenever I'm across the house from my router.I've also had problems with it randomly disconnecting from Bluetooth devices, although this hasn't happened again since restarting the phone.Update: the Bluetooth connection issues have returned.  Disappointing.Update 2: lowered rating because issues continue to persist despite constant troubleshooting.  Motorola should be ashamed of this phone."
"I thought that if advertised as having a 2 day battery, it might last for a day, but it doesn't. I charge it at night when the battery registers about 28% left and have to charge it again early afternoon. Other than that, I do like the phone a lot. It's a bit longer than my older Moto G7 plus, which is great. It wasn't so different that I had to relearn it. I wish it didn't have Facebook and Tictoc pre installed.The battery had to be charged twicw a day after about 3 months of use. The fingerprint option only worked for a couple of apps. and now after a year and a half, it cant be charged anymore. Tried many cords but nothing works. Phone is now useless. I really liked the phone. Too bad it lasted a year and a half or less."
The battery life is very weak and lacking. Even when its not being used the battery is dying fast. Won't last half the day when actively being used. Besides the battery life the stylus is great and the camera is not so bad but the main reason I bought this phone was for the 2 day battery life unfortunately I did not get this.
"I went cheap because to be honest, I've never felt really pleased with any phone, so why spend the money?  Didn't take a year before the stylus snapped, and the screen brightness dims to the point of seeming off when outside or in bright light.  Maybe I went a little too cheap.  You get what you pay for."
"I've been using Motorola phones for YEARS and I've always been happy with them until this one. It was a fine phone for about two months. After that it started failing to make or return calls, and I wouldn't get a notification that I missed a call like you do when you don't have service. It was always fixed by restarting the phone, but I only know about it if I tried to make a call or if someone trying to call me reached out on a different platform, and I haven't had the issue once since getting a different phone, so it wasn't a problem with my service provider. It's disappointing, because it's a nice phone and easy to use, but it couldn't perform it's most basic function after a couple of months."
The phone is very nice and the picture quality is great everything works OK except for the 2day battery life that was listed... The battery not holding up I have to charge it twice in a day without any heavy used.
"The only thing I liked about this phone is its data capacity.  I needed more space and ended up with this disappointment.  I miss phone calls cause it doesn't ring all the time, it has pop-up adds as you're reading articles (and your daily mail).  That's probably why there's a stylus that comes with it - so that you can delete the ads.  The articles and tips inside the phone don't work.  I could go on and on, but I'd have to stop and think - now what else is there.  Enough said.  But there's plenty more.  Don't buy the Moto D Stylus 2022 model.  Oh another thing, it gets extremely hot if you're on it more than 20 minutes.  Oops, I've run out of room."
"I bought the unit and returned it unopened. Never had a chance to test the unit. I returned it, cause I wanted the 5G version. Cellular companies are having out 3G and eventually 4G.... It only makes logical sense to get one that has 5G. If you ask my personal opinion, I think 5G is a way to get customers to upgrade their phones. You will never get the speeds that cellular companies promise. They say you can get 5G speeds to up 1gb! I rather have a decent 4G speed of 25mb!"
"I don't even have big hands. It is so uncomfortable to use this phone or type on it, I can't even describe how painful it is to use this phone. Bit the bullet and got another iPhone. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent phone for the money. Stylus is good but again - uncomfortable to use with two hands.Will be returning asap."
"Hey Amazon - this was a Prime Day Deal - but the day after I received it you reduced the price!! No big deal - was't that much - but kinda takes the ""Prime"" out of ""Prime Days"" .........Not a bad phone but......... ""What's the Deal?"
screen is dull in color. the only way to see ANYthing is to have it on highest brightness. my last moto phone could be on lowest and still see screen. has a green dull tint like the cheap LG phone I once had. It honestly looks almost identical to the free junk Blu View 3 I got from lifeline company.It is not charging. It has gone 3% points in an hour. And that is the entire reason I was replacing my old moto is the battery was messed up after many years.The display being dark and dull and bad is a deal breaker. OH also huge noticable finger smudges on the screen which make it even more dull. I think Motorola has gone downhill.being most of their phones are now plastic.. and my son and his wife had 3 phones screens break back to back.*no visual voicemial. says is disabled.*almost NO sound on phone calls. wtf
"I had problems from day one. I decided to return it but missed the return window by less than a week. The stylus came apart at the top a couple months after I got it. The moto motions or gestures come and go as they please. I paid $150 with a case which I know that's cheap by today's standards but I rarely use the phone due to a slight speech impairment. So lightly used is probably an understatement. I haven't had it a full year (three weeks short) and the speaker blew. I've never even heard of that on a phone. I don't blast music on it or whatever, I have a lovely pair of Bose earphones plus plenty of the blue tooth speakers and about every echo device there is. I've missed a ton of important calls thinking I'm to dumb to manage the smart phone when actually the ring is a quiet scratchy sound like you'd get when the network tv stations used to sign off for the night. Don't buy this phone, even if it seems like a great deal it's crap."
"Before this phone I had one that was several years older than this one. I had no complaints about that one at all despite it being ""outdated"". Best phone I've ever had, miss it. Yet this phone that's several years newer... Awful.Horrible battery life. Especially if you watch any video based media on it like Instagram reels, YouTube, Twitch streams, and TikTok too. Even using it casually drains the battery like crazy. I only had to charge my old phone overnight then it'd be perfect through the day, even until ~4am. I watched tons of videos throughout the day on that thing too.It's also way too dependent on Google and their products. Another thing is if you swipe the screen to the left while you're on the home screen it brings up some random media and news that I don't care about. Can't disable that mess either. Customization is pretty low too. Not to say it doesn't have any but compared to other androids I feel somewhat restricted in what I can do.I have other complaints but let's leave it at that. Just my personal distaste and nitpicks about this phone. Highly discourage buying this phone if you're thinking about it."
My husband bought this phone in July and now it's Aug and 2 days ago when I talk on my phone it sounds like people are far away. The only way I can hear is I have to put everyone I talked to on speaker.
First the ring on back came off. Second the speaker cord hole does not line up. But 3 stars because dropping the phone on concrete three or four times by accident did not hurt my phone.
"This is a locked phone that also overheats. If you have extra money to throw away, go ahead and purchase this junk!"
"It is my 5th motorola phone I buy, all where mid priced, this one is not even as good as the old one I bought 5 + years ago.The battery does not last at all, and I have been using less the phone, because I noticed the drainage of power ver. Less than a day and a half and its unused 8 hours a night.The camera settings are poor at best, even for my day to day use.some other issues too, latency and screen flashing.I am not in the USA, or I would return it.I really did not make"
Could not transfer data from a Samsung to this Moto G.  I tried for 2 1/2 hours &  ATT tried for 1 1/2 hours.  We both reached the conclusion that Moto G would not recognize the Samsung.  Was able to transfer photos from the Google cloud.  Had to manually enter 39 contacts and numerous apps.  As far as a two day battery that's only if you don't use the phone much.  The most non-user friendly phone I've ever had.  Will never purchase a Motorola again.
Delay in response. Freezes some times. However it is significantly cheaper. Once an app is started it's fine. Camera isn't good. But affordable. You get what you pay for here with camera. Also finding a case that fits all ports is impossible.
"The device gets stuck booting up every time. I ordered two of these phones, one for myself and my partner, and both frequently switch to Edge mode, meaning no data connection really, for no discernible reason. To resolve this, i will switch my 2G on and off, turn on airplane mode, or finally power cycle. Which, is about a 15 minute process when it fails to get past the boot animation most of the time. It's ok for the price but not worth the headaches"
Phone has problem with GPS. My old Motorola G 5G works better and more exactly on locatio
"When I make the order the item don't say are used, and the charger don't coming with the cell phone"
"Not sure if I received a defective product or if its just bad design but the phone only charges about 10% an hour using the original charger.Only plus over my moto g(7) is the fingerprint reader seems to work well. This was supposed to be an upgrade but I find myself still using my g7 for everything other than making calls.UPDATE:Moto support was very helpful with sending a replacement device. Unfortunately, the issue persists. This morning went from 100% charge to 48% with ~2hours of light use (reading articles on web browser) Battery does not function as advertised. Quick to drain, slow to charge.Another massive negative is that this phone automatically downloads a Chinese spy-ware app (tiktok) when setting up. Will not be purchasing from Motorola in the future due to this.This is not an upgrade over my 2019 moto g(7) which I will be using until I replace with a non-moto device.Do not buy this if you expect a full day's use off of a single charge. Do not buy this if you do not want to be tethered to a power outlet.Final Update:Phone is crap. Not worth 300$. Sent back."
I upgraded from the 2021 version of the same phone at least I thought I was upgrading! no wifi calling? It's not the carrier because I've called them and if I put the sim in my old phone I have WiFi calling there's not even an option also the colors are all messed up when you try and personalize it the touch is finiky and switching between apps alot of the time it just gives up doesn't feel like 6g of ram ugh disappointed my next phone won't come from Amazon
Lovely Phone but I don't NEED to fight with a PC of machinery for 4 stinking Hours to Take a Stupid Photo! #Exhausting! Customer Service? Hah!
"This newer stylus version is so bad. The phone is Very heavy, and after the 1st month began freezing up. After the 2nd month it began just shutting down/rebooting for no reason with no warning & continued freezing, and now it just randomly shuts down, reboots, freezes, And will no longer give message notifications. The phone itself ignores my changes made in the ""Settings"". VERY bad, biggest waste of money. I can't be without a phone, so I can't send this back until I get a replacement first. I don't recommend :("
"Phone is OK for a fill in till you can get something else. Laggy for heavy users. Buggy Moto software. Battery life is no where near 3 days or 2 or 1 whole! Construction is pretty good tho, I've already dropped it several times. Pro, it's got a headphone jack."
The battery doesn't last long. Great phone bad battery.
Unfortunately when using this phone people on the other end can't hear me half the time.  My daughter purchased the same phone and she has the same problem now as well.
"What I liked: Delivery was prompt.I liked the camera and a few of the options but within a couple of weeks the stylis broke. I put it in it's slot and then couldn't remove it.  I am so disappointed because the Motorola is a beautiful phone. It fits in my hand nicely but I didn't find it user friendly and before I had it a month, I replaced it with a cheap Samsung A 03 for around $50-$60."
"This phone has so many issues. I gave it a fair shake, its been months now. The main issues: it really struggles to maintain communication with blutooth devices, wifi signals and cellular data. I rarely have more than 2 bars of service, even though my carrier is prominent in my area. Like im just laying on my couch at 2am when nobody else is up and i have one single bar of service. Phone also freezes and power cycles if it restarts. I can power it off and then back on, but if i attempt to restart it'll loop for several sustained minutes, sometimes for up to 20. Camera struggles to focus, and really the only feature i enjoy about this phone is shaking it to activate the flashlight."
It's May 2023 ... still on Android 11. Android 14 is scheduled for release in the fall of 23. Very disappointing...
"I like the phone but the battery dies in a few hours. It has to be plugged in all the time, it's basically a land line. If I need to go out in the evening I need to plan ahead and make sure it's charged for a while before I go so I know I can get home (with Uber etc.). Disappointed. My old Moto lasted much longer, I expect at least one day on a full charge."
"After having it for a couple of weeks, it begins freezing in different apps. The camera makes my skin look yellow. It's not true to color. Not to mention, it does not have an NFC reader."
"Don't buy it! I bought it less than a year ago & it freezes a lot. When you try to open a page you're staring at a blank screen. My old phone started doing that after 5 years. This is 8 months old and I need to buy another one already. Who has time to wait around minutes at a time when you want to look up something? I'm talking trying to open a single web page, not multiple pages. This is a new phone,it shouldn't do that. It's very frustrating not being able to use it when I need it and having to wasted money on this bad product. Motorola has gone quality cheap."
"I would like this phone if it weren't for all the little glitches, overall makes it not worth it. About half the time I open Chrome it simply hangs up immediately and I have close the app and reopen, then it works. Youtube might play videos but have no volume, restart the app (sometimes more than once) now it works. Texts messages often simply do not get received until you restart your phone, then you get a bunch at once (even though it was showing a good connection the whole time). I regret buying this phone."
"Ok. The battery life is not two days.  Also, I am constantly battling to keep it on WiFi.  It truly sucked to see it not two weeks after my purchase be fifty dollars cheaper.  I truly feel jipped."
"I ordered what I thought was a new phone. It worked for a couple of months pretty well. Then I started to have problems, the screen would lock, the number pad wouldn't appear without a reboot, lines on the screen and blurry images. I think that it was probably a refurbished phone that wasn't refurbished very well. Very disappointed."
If I had to do it over? I would have gotten another brand. This Motorola phone runs hot ... I'm not a fan and for the price? It severely underwhelms! I am going to replace this phone soon and will give this one away. 2 stars (the stylus earned them that).
Functionality not friendly nor screen or memory.
"This has been the world phone I've ever had. It glitches, drops the signal multiple times a day, and touch screen is not very responsive. Have to touch 2-3 times before screen recognizes it. After restarting, I only get signal back half the time. Have had issues of being stuck on ""powered by Android"" screen for no apparent reason. Resolves itself after anywhere from 10 minutes to 2 hours. Finger print unlock on the power button is a joke. Recorded dozens of prints in hopes of it responding better but still have to unlock with my code at least 70% of the time. I've always used Android phones but after this experience, I'll be shopping for an alternative."
"The phone was ok for a bit, but in less than a year several updates have nearly crippled this phone. Recording video, the audio is compressed to nearly unintelligible garbage due to a feature they disabled the ability to turn off.... I've bought Motorola phones for years and always get at least two years out of them, less than a year and I'm getting rid of this asap. Bluetooth no longer connects reliably, phone is sluggish and has a typing delay, constant app crashes, the list goes on... after 10+ years of Motorola phones for myself and my family, this will absolutely be the last.Contacting support to address issues resulted in being ignored after being promised a fix to the microphone issue... just done."
"I have had several Moto G phones and have been pleased but this is the worst I ever had. I looked to see about returning it awhile back but missed the deadline by a few days. I was trying to make a doctor appointment and it hung up 3 different times while talking with the scheduler. I was speaking with someone else just now and it hung up again. Also, sometimes peoples voices sound like a robot and it's hard to understand. Unless things improve I will never get another Moto g phone"
"Despite what the text of the product says, T-Mobile will not activate a new LTE-only phone on their network."
"I like the phone.  It's very user friendly, but the video quility is very bad.  It records glitchy.  Not a smooth sound"
"I have a Moto G Stylus 2020 and I felt like it was getting on its last legs recently so I decided to upgrade and man was that a huge mistake. Not only is the speaker SIGNIFICANTLY lower quality as well as loudness but the phone is barely faster than my TWO YEAR OLD PHONE! I started opening apps at the same time with both phones and it only loaded slightly faster. The camera quality is also MUCH WORSE and doesn't have the option to film horizontally while holding the phone vertically like it's 2020 predecessor. The phone is also cheap plastic now rather than solid aluminum. Overall I'm extremely disappointed, so much so I think it's time to move on to a new brand. If they still made the 2020 model I'd easily buy that one over this hunk of junk."
Camera sucks. Can't access sd card pictures(very annoying). Everything else is great actually.
"Bad experience. It's like open box not brand new, then if you want to return it, you will be charge for restocking fees which doesn't shown in the description. I feel it's like scam."
This phone will not receive most calls or texts regardless of settings. Constantly having to restart it due to signal failures. It took around a month to fully realize what was going on (Just in time for the replacement window to be closed) It would never notify of a text while in the car and you CANNOT make that work. Each notification setting AND volume setting has  sub settings and its just a nightmare of an experience. Save yourself the frustration and skip this one.  Going to switch back to my 6 year old phone as it worked way better than this. They should rename it the lawsuit phone.
Developed Screen Burn in within 2 weeks of receiving otherwise seemed to to be a good phone for price
"I was never a fan of the low line Samsung's (Galaxy A 12 etc), of which Ive owned quite a few, but these things, are really disappointing. Being an engineer and relying on Motorola chips, muxs etc, I expected a LOT MORE out of the designers over there. There are better options."
"The phone itself is in great shape with no visible damage. It's a bit dirty. Upon turning it on, it needs a PIN Code, therefore I'm unable to use it. It was probably set up by the previous buyer and should have been noticed and fixed during refurbishing process, just like the smudge. It's very inconvenient, now I have to return this and order another one. Hopefully I can get that for the same price what I paid for this one.Update: after returning it I was looking for another one, but the price went up, so I will not buy it."
"This phone is awful. I've had it for 9 months now. This isn't a snap judgment. Every couple days, I find out I can't make or receive a phone call until rebooting it. Most times I have to reboot it three times because it keeps hanging up on the splash screen. The WiFi routinely fails to connect. Rebooting solves this for a while. I can't leave it on the auto screen brightness option because after a phone call I'll have a completely black screen for 15 minutes or so. Those are my three main gripes, and I think they're a pretty big deal."
Says new but sticker is cut open and no charger or cable. Stylus is also missing and sticker on the back of the showing that it is used. If it was new then why would it be locked with a pin code?
we sent in for warranty cause the screen went out the wouldn't fix or send replacement said that the phone was bent it was not the pictures they sent of how they received the phone was wrong and when we got back the phone it is way bent it was not like that it came on and you could answered calls all needed was possible screen now it's totally bent horribly was a waste of money if it looked that way they sent it we would not have sent in thanks Motorola will never buy your products again
Great my dad love it price should be cheaper.
"Let me begin with ""I hate this phone""!! I bought this with the intent of having a backup. My screen broke ony other phone so I have been using this moto for about 2 months. Everything is different and it is lacking a ton of small things I took for granted with my other phones. Too numerous to go into but I thought I better give everyone a heads up.Have a nice day"
"Edit: AVOID AT ALL COSTS!! pathetic! My first one of this model sucked too. Microphone stopped for no reason! Cant call out at all! This one has had texting, picture texting, even making calls to the wrong carrier! Data just stops working. Adding data doesnt register on this phone! Soooo SHODDY!!! Why even release this phone with so many glaring deficiencies??? Almighty dollar wins again. Pathetic.All my other devices work well with internet and wifi, but this phone has problems staying connected to any internet! Its very frustrating!Good memory! RAM is acceptable for processor but could use a little more. Camera doesn't zoom. Only one camera choice for picture messages, so that stinks.Overheats at times, especially when charging! Even with these issues, its way better than my last phone!!"
Nothing works. Speed sucks. Camera sucks. Video sucks. Speaker sucks. It's super buggy. None of the apps load or work correctly. It's slow. Battery sucks. I'm offended that I paid more than 30 bucks for this. Absolute garbage. Buy something else.
"Really disappointed that this phone I purchased only lasted 4 months 2 weeks before it started having major issues. The power button gets extremely hot which makes this phone over heat. When I say hot I mean I can't press on the button more that a second without it feeling extremely uncomfortable with a burning sensation on my finger and the only way to cool it down is to turn off the phone.I would not recommend purchasing, save your money and go with a different more reliable phone."
constantly disconnecting from bluetooth. stylus getting stuck inside the phone.
"I have only owned this phone for one day and have a few issues.First the package was delivered to the wrong address and I had to track it down.Secondly the phone is always warm to the touch all the time scaring me to think that it's defective.Thirdly the phone was advertised that the battery can hold for 2 days but it's not holding a whole day.Finally I noticed that I didn't buy extended warranty because none was offered.I am not impressed with my first day experience with this phone...,"
"This is the slowest phone I have ever had. I would give ZERO stars if I could. You can't even view instagram on here without it just being a perpetual loading wheel. Seriously, it doesn't just go slow... it just shows the loading wheel PERPETUALLY... and NEVER actually loads. I am going to switch back to the phone I bought this to replace and then just have this has a doorstop... it's also HUGE so it would work as a doorstop."
"This was a terrible phone, battery dies in shortest time ever. The slightest movement and the screen comes on. Returned it."
"I love this phone. Wish I could use it!!!!  Took it to AT& T store to activate.  Sim card from old (near death) Blade Spark slipped right in.  The Motorola powered up and....drum roll... nothing.  Asking for a pin number according to clerk in the store.  Are you kidding me?  After all this research, great review of ease of activation???? So frustrated right now.  Will update if I ever get resolved."
Bought this phone 03-2022 from AmazonWent to use it today and the battery is completely dead. A new battery cost is $78.00 I contacted manafacter to reimburse me for the battery. I was told I need to send in my phone for them to troubleshoot the problem. I will not do that because it will take forever plus I told them I will not release my phone to anyoneI don't know who or where it will end up atWith all my personal information on itSo I am warning you do not buy a moto phone at all. Amazon is not responsible for anything with the phone or to reimburse me for the battery.
"When I started to set up my new galaxy Tab A9 + plus tablet the quick start set up guide that was enclosed stated under GET STARTED instructions - Insert a microSD card. Since I had a Samsung 512 GB card I installed it. The unit did not recognize the card, so I pulled out the tray to reinsert it. When I pulled out the tray the card remained stuck in the tablet. I did not try to remove the jammed card as many suggested when I did an online search. Instead  I called the Samsung customer service number. They instructed me to send the tablet in to their repair center. Under their warrantee they offered a post paid label and a quick turnaround. While inconvenient, I was satisfied with the customer service response. I rated the unit only 3 stars because of the misleading directions in the Get Started guide concerning inserting a microSD card. Once I get the unit back, I will update my review."
"Samsung talks about video frame speed, but Bluetooth audio performance is severely lacking! While the overall Bluetooth performance has better sound than the best of their phones, performance is frustrating! The audio gaps occasionally on devices using Qualcomm APT-X Bluetooth and fails completely when LDAP is demanded from the driver. I now understand why a wired headphone jack is provided...there aren't enough resources to do Bluetooth satisfactorily. My A9+ has Android 14 but it appears this tablet barely has enough resources to run it. Also, compared to my previous Galaxy Tab S6, maximum SD card size is limited to 1GB instead of 2GB. I put all my data on the SD card and only use the internal for apps and the operating system. This assures my data cannot be monitored by Google & Samsung. Also, it's alot bigger than the 128GB internal storage which I use for the operating system and apps. These are the main bones of contention with the Galaxy Tab A9+While there is no fingerprint login on this tablet, the face tracking works remarkably well! Even in relatively low light, the tablet opens right up. If you are backlit however, the face tracking doesn't work...that's pretty much to be expected. For a screen that is not OLED, the image quality is quite good. Both cameras work nicely for videoconferencing and it takes reasonably good photos and video, something my Galaxy Tab S6 did not do well at all! Plays even 4K video I've shot with my Note 20 Ultra and Canon M50 nicely. Photos are reproduced very accurately.In conclusion I can say the following: Some of us don't play video games, in fact I could care less for that. A tablet should have strong suits not only in video performance but audio as well. This A9+ seems to fall flat on it's face in this area and I am somewhat disappointed by this! While it may be better than previous A series tablets, it's not even close for even older S series tablets. Perhaps back to the drawing board?"
"When we got it in the mail, it turned on no issues. We got it set up and turned it off because it’s a Christmas present for our son. Well today we went to look at it to see if we still wanted to keep it and IT WONT TURN ON! It was sitting up in a closet on the top and no way anything could have happened to it. Thankfully Amazon has sent a replacement so our son won’t be without his major Christmas gift. I’m just upset that had we not checked it, he may not have had his Christmas gift."
"I have bought several models of the Tab A over the years.  I have to say I am less impressed with this device than other versions I have owned.  For one thing, during the initial setup it  became apparent that I have less control over this device that ever before.  Another thing, on the first spin, it crashed on the first app I ran.  After a reboot, it might be working better.  Time will tell."
"It's a little bigger than the old, which I like. And it has more than 2x the the RAM and way more storage, especially with a 1TB card added. Now the part I don't like - the touch screen is very iffy - sometimes it's right on but often I takes a major pressure push to get it to respond. That can be very inconvenient.  All in all, I'm not sure I'd buy it again."
"This device is held back by the Snapdragon 695. Can't play 4k videos and video playback battery life is about 7 hours. So you'll constantly need to charge it. The 4 speakers and Atmos on this is awesome but that's about it. The screen is ok, not great. Just get a fire tablet for half the price if you just need a cheap tablet. The battery life on those is great. I ended up with Lenovo Tab Plus for $190 and it's 2x better."
"Good news and bad news abut this tablet.  The good news is the large screen makes it easier to read.  The bad news is that the larger size makes slipping it into a purse and taking it with me impossible.  Also, nowhere did it say you needed to purchase an SD card.  Since I don't have any lying around the house, I had to make a special trip to buy one.  Also, charging the thing is ridiculous.  One end of the data cable fits nicely into the tablet, but the other end doesn't fit into anything.  I had to buy a special charger, and even with that, it seems that my hair grew longer while waiting for the thing to charge.  I would not recommend this to anyone who does not have a gazillion accessories in their home already."
The tablet seems to work but it had all the personal info in it from a previous owner so it must be a refurbished unit sold as new. The packaging looked factory. If you live in the Atlanta area and sent one back - it's in Texas. I have a IT person that is going to clear it out.
"This product comes with a daily board that is too easy to accidentally invoke. It also comes with a smartswitch that takes over your screen and doesn't allow you to go back to the home screen. All I wanted was Android and in addition, I got a tremendous amount of unwanted garbare."
"I have had this for about a week, maybe a week and a half. I have several projects I was working on, this notepad shuts off in the middle of a project. This last time, it shut off and would not turn back on."
"After 3 months, tablet stopped charging/working. Had to pack it up and send back to Samsung, $13. I shouldn’t have had to pay anything to send for repair. Think I’m going to get an iPad now. I’m thru with Samsung!!"
"Just got the tablet. Loved everything about it. Installed my SD in the holder and inserted it. Tablet says there was no SD card installed. So I ejected the holder, but the card had dislodged and got wedged all the way in the slot!The card was inserted properly and worked fine in my old Samsung Galaxy A7 Tablet. Never an issue inserting or ejecting the card. So now I've lost the data on the card and I have a brand new tablet with an SD Card slot that's useless.But, I have 128GB storage, which is more than enough for me, and I love everything else about it from the display and audio, to the performance, which is way faster than my old Samsung A7 Lite that finally stopped working. I was surprise how quickly everything from the A7 transferred over to this one.PROS: Sleek, lightweight, excellent display and audio. And FAST.CONS: Terrible MicroSD card tray. Out of all the Samsung tablets I've ever owned, this is the first time I've had an issue with it not handling the card. Proceed with caution.Win some, lose some..."
"Overall, this tablet was perfectly functional and usable. If you're looking for a tablet for games/movies/general entertainment purposes, it'll probably be just fine for you!My main complaint is that I bought this tablet for note-taking since I'm starting school soon, and what they don't make clear is that this tablet is NOT ideal for that. There is no feature that allows for palm rejection, meaning you can't rest your hand on the tablet while writing, and this was something I only learned after purchasing, unpacking and setting up the tablet. I did some research to see if there was a way to make it work, but from what I could tell there is simply no option to do so. I wanted the tablet to replace pen-and-paper notes but there's just no way to write comfortably/nautrally without being able to rest your hand on the screen, so I had to return the product. Now I'm using the Samsung S6 Lite and it's already miles better (I'd recommend if you're looking for a note-taking tablet).One thing I'll say is that this tablet was totally compatible with non-Samsung styluses, so if you prefer to use styluses and want to use this tablet for anything besides note-taking it will still probably work for you, with no need to invest in the super expensive styluses out there."
"Outer shipping box was not damaged so this happened at the fulfilment center. Very thin box with no padding on interior. Device seems to be working okay, but I have barely been on it."
"We had an old Samsung tablet at our office and needed to upgrade our gear, so we decided to get this one instead. Right when I turned it on, the device had some minor lags when swiping on the screen. I also don’t like the placement of the buttons on the sides. This device is primarily designed for horizontal (landscape) display. While you can use it in vertical (portrait) mode, the overall design is clearly intended for landscape use. iPad would've been a better investment in the long run. Oh well."
No charger included. Special size charger had to be ordered as well as Microsoft card. Can't charge it or use it until that special order arrives
I got 3 for my 3 children and my daughter’s both seem to work fine but my son’s dies in like a hour and then takes forever to recharge.
"It has weird moments where it lags--a lot. Even unlocking the screen, or swiping down to get the notification and shortcut bar, taps and swipes won't register. The device is preloaded with some bloat that you can't remove. Some of it reinstalls itself. Samsung abuses notifcations to harass you to make an account with them, requiring your phone number. You can't disable this notification. The battery lasts a while, but that's not really a good enough reason to buy this. I feel wronged."
"I bought this to use as an inexpensive tablet I could use while backpacking. I was looking for something really basic that I could read at camp, check maps, and listen to music offline while hiking. Being a Samsung, it meant I would be able to find a decent case for it to provide at least some basic protection. If it got damaged during the hike, well... it was a cheap tablet so it should be good enough.It had 55% battery when it arrived, so I plugged it into a USB-C cable I had plugged into the USB port on my wall outlet. I figured this would be alright since it would need to be charged from a portable power source in the field anyway. After 48 minutes, it managed to charge only to 64%! I wanted to err on it being my cable, so I plugged it into a USB-C power brick instead and put that in my outlet. My wall outlets are 20w, and this requires 15w to charge, so it should totally work.It managed to hit 100% 4.5 hours later. Taking four and a half hours to charge anything 36% is insane. When I finally was able to power the tablet on, the screen was so dim, I could barely see anything. After rushing through the typical Android setup, I managed to increase the display brightness to around 50%. After installing 3 apps, I noticed that the battery was at 93% for less than a half hour of use.I definitely do not recommend this tablet. The cons far outweigh the pros in this device, especially since finding a budget tablet is not really that hard to find these days."
"I ordered the 64 mb tablet thinking it would be ok since I only use it to read books and do puzzles.  It is pretty sluggish, I will pull a puzzle piece and it will now move until after I release the piece.  Pretty frusterating.  My older Samsung table is actually better.  I would not recommend this one, chose the 128 mg even though it is more expensive."
I downloaded some games for traveling and noticed the tablet runs very slow when opening up apps.
I could not move information from one tablet to the other. I have found when I go to the help resources I’m usually more confused and out of sorts. I wanted to expand on the tablet with more memory but if it is time consuming and overly complicated I would rather just use my phone.
Battery only lasts a few hours after being charged to 100%.
"This tablet is very slow, and displayed image is very basic"
"Battery life is less than optimal, reading only gets about 12hr"
when you hold the ipad to operate the case doesn't hold the fit
Does not come with charger plug only the cord
keeps on hanging and very slow or freezing
"love the tablet, and the size. I am not happy with the charging connection. I have purchased 2 of these tablets and so far both have had to have the charging connections replaced.  so  in addition to the purchase price paid another 75$ on each to replace the connections within 6 months of having them."
"Having had the Samsung 7A tablet which was an awesome A+ device (until it would not hold a charge), I then read through reviews and decided on the Samsung A9 plus. Big mistake! This tablet lacks the screen sensitivity of the 7A. The tablet's overall system I have found to be a disappointment. Overall, I would not recommend."
"It lags pretty often with minimal effort, but for my purposes of reading/streaming, it's not bad! I got it on a prime day deal which made it worth the price, but I wouldn't go higher than $150 for overall performance plus branding"
Weak battery
Nice size but hard to get paired with my phone and really slow.  Would have been better off the a Microsoft surface at this point.
"Not easy to use, very confusing, button don’t work well need to be pushed constantly or held to get it started. Will not purchase again."
This product did not come with an sd card or an adapter to charge it.Do t know how it works cause it don't work
I really was disappointed with the performance of this tablet.  Found it slow and baggy compared to an iPad.  Avoid.
"The price was right, but I have found that with Samsung, you get what you pay for. This tablet works pretty good but has a slowish refresh rate and an unexpectedly slow CPU and a slow GPU. It has kindof a ""cheap"" feel to it. The microsd card tray is very difficult to insert a card into. This tablet might be great for kids 8-15 years old. Also not water resistant. Internal battery does not last nearly as long as claimed during use."
"I love everything about this except that even with the screen at full sensitivity it does not work. It shows it is being clicked on but even after a minute or two of waiting (incase it is just slow) it doesn't respond. I use this for work for taking pictures, editing and displaying pictures of my work.  Basically it is my portfolio.  But The screen is horrible! I wanted to throw the darn thing last night because it wouldn't respond of course I didn't but I really wanted to and that is a lot for me. I am the most optimistic person in the world probably with patience of a Saint I have been told. But this thing is driving me mad. I can't win. I transfer to this from an Ipad the only reason I left the IPad was because their editing apps are not free. I spent $150  on apps where on Samsung I can do it all for free do I ditched the IPad for the Samsung. I love my Samsung phone so I thought this would be a bigger version and in some ways it is but this screen is driving me nuts. I spent 12 hours setting the Samsung up with everything I needed so I guess I am stuck with it because I am not doing it again on another one. Stupid Screen!"
"I ordered this as an extra device to use with TikTok to stream video lives. The video camera was very poor. The resolution is lower and the pictures are washed out. It does not even have auto focus. I guess that I have been spoiled with the S series for phones and tablets. This is nowhere close to the quality of picture as my Tab S8+ or my S23 ultra. I am returning it to order the Tab S9+. If the picture and camera quality are not of importance to you, the Tab A9+ will probably be fine for you. I did like that it had 4 speakers which assists if you want to use the tablet in vertical rather than horizontal. Other that resolution and camera, it seems to be a quality device. Fortunately Amazon has an convenient return policy. Sadly, the replacement will take seven days, even though I have PRIME. Why has shipping taken from 5-7 days for my last few orders?"
ordered this near the middle of the year 2024 I've had it a few months now. I've been using it a lot for shopping reading listening to music movies and audio books. I did stress test it on the 3d mark on wild life. overall score is 1 203 average FPS 7.21 its score range was only better then 15% of other devices that have been tested. I will say the temp on this device does maintain a nice 27C with how much I use it the battery can hold for on average 4 days unless I use it for something big like watching a movie or playing a game will run it out in less then 5 hours. I have noticed when I opened it on day one system ran smooth but it was fallowed by updates needed after updates where finished the bootup on the device became slow and sluggish even unlocking it would cause a small loading screen after launch.
Good tablet but cant give it higher stars since it only comes with a usb connector with no wall charger.
"I have had a number of Samsung TabA tablets over the years. This is probably the 4th or 5th one I've owned. I will say that all the rest were very reliable and worked well for me. Though only 5 months old, the charging port on this one is broken and it won't charge. I didn't treat this tablet any different than any of the of the others. There is no reason it should be broken. I'm not a kid who mistreats their electronics, I only use it at home. Samsung customer service said I could sent it in and they wouldn't charge me ""if you didn't do anything to break it"". That means being without my tablet for 1 to 2 weeks. I took it to a local shop because I would rather pay for the repair than be without my tablet. They can't get the part. I haven't decided what I will do. At this point it's a toss up between sending it in to Samsung and getting a new one. The tablet cost less than $200. Sending it in means being without for a week or so, the cost of shipment and they will probably charge me $100 to fix it, despite the fact that I'm sure it is a defect and not my fault. I am seriously considering buying a different brand for my next tablet."
"I think I would like this tablet so much better than my past run of Kindles if it would just work properly.  The charge cord that came with it does not work, the tablet doesn't see it at all.  Unfortunately, the wifi isn't working well either. It loses connection approximately every 10 mins, sometimes more, rarely less than that. This would be the only device dropping the wifi in the household. It happens no matter what wifi I connect to in any household of my friends and family. Last and most importantly, I have never been able to talk to any human at the customer service contact info. So Samsung doesn't seem to care if their devices don't work, just as long as they have been sold. Never buying another device by them."
Very disappointed. Expected a better quality.
So I had my tablet for about 5 months and now I tried charging it and it's just a black screen it won't turn on I don't know what is wrong with it I suggest just buy them more expensive ones cheap don't last that long
"I have to say that I have been telling myself that this tablet is good enough for what I need it for, but I keep running into asinine problems. First off, if I ever try to use the keyboard, in any context (browser, notes, email), the words and letters are consistently in a different order than I typed. I type a word, say, “dysfunctional.” The letters won’t appear on the screen immediately. There is a pause, and what comes out is “functdysional” or some other nonsense, the letters transposed. I don’t have to be typing quickly for this to happen, either.For some reason, I’ve been living with this without complaint. Then, yesterday, I needed to use the tablet flashlight, and couldn’t find it. I contact Samsung support via the chat function. I tell them what the device is, and the rep asks for the serial number. Is the flashlight in a different location based on whether the serial number is odd or even? Why would that ever be a question? I specify the model number instead, and get the response that there is no flashlight. I say, incredulously, “are you kidding me?” expecting  confirmation. For some reason there is a long delay. I ask if he is busy talking to someone else, and he says he is sorry because he was looking into it. Either he was lying, or he nonsensically had to double check elsewhere to see if he was kidding or not. If this review sounds like it was written in frustration, and I’m being harsh, you are correct. You could say I should have known there was no flashlight before buying it, but it is such a basic functionality that I never would have guessed it wasn’t there. And after my admittedly testy exchange with customer service, I didn’t think I’d get a good or timely answer about the transposed text, since the rep was obviously in over their head. I would not recommend this product if you are looking for basic functionality, like the screen showing what you typed. The flashlight thing sent me over the edge, you could say. It is just a telltale sign of mediocrity."
"Works fine and is reasonably responsive when web browsing.However, the battery life is not very good, despite what other reviewers say.  I have power saver on with screen brightness at 5% yet I constantly have to charge this thing."
I would not purchase this item again. It charges when it wants. You have to have it setting in a  certain way or Position to be able to touch the screen to get the screen to work.
"I love this tablet! It uses google, YouTube, and Netflix just fine. Anything else that requires a lot more will slow it down! The touch response time is not the greatest and you'll definitely notice it, but if you’re buying this item you aren’t looking to buy a top notch tablet. Lastly, the only thing that bothers me is that it just RANDOMLY turns off. In the middle of using google, in the middle of YouTube, whatever it is, just randomly turns off. I’m sure it’s just something that’s happening to my tablet, but just be on the lookout!Also included a pic for size comparison to my RTIC tumbler."
"Setup difficulties, which could be illuminated if they would include written instructions.  Even a tech had a hard time doing it.  But Samsung did save 2c per unit."
missing part ..... tried to get it without having to return not so user friendly tablet that only took me three days to be able to use facebook
"WARNING!! ALERT!! DO NOT spend money on this dangerous (to your existing software and computer equipment!) piece of junk!!!  Having been an active computer builder and user since about 1970, my experience with this little monster was a disaster!! This ""computer"" and the Samsung firm WILL not allow you to freely use the computer!! I had to have a friend use his ""GOOGLE"" account and password (I use Google only for search functions -- nothing else!) to get to a point where I could even get a ""home screen"" to access the machine (his material was later deleted)!!  You will be forced to use Google apps and their functions, IOW, just to get to a ""home screen""!!  To make matters MUCH worse, as suggested by Samsung, I then then tried to use their ""Smart Switch"" bit of corruption, to transfer files from my old Samsung machine, and unbelievably, the software not only did NOT transfer all files, as promised, but ALSO actually, literally, deleted a number of ordinary highly useful apps that had been on my old machine!!!!! Icons that had been on the screen for those apps had also disappeared!!! Games and utilities I've used for many years!!! As mentioned earlier .. there is NO way to access this computer unless you accept a ton of invasive junk and create an ""account"" with Google !!!!!! First!! Including pages upon pages of legal jabberwocky that bind you and the computr for life, to Google ... OR ... you are not allowed to access and use the machine, YOUR machie, that you've just spent hard-earned money on!!!I have never seen such a heinous intrusion of rights and intense lock-down on a home level, non-professional small computer.Since I had foolishly used the ""SmartSwitch"" hackware in attempting to transfer files, and since Smart Switch transferred some but not all files, i have no idea what was moved and what was not, so I will literally destroy this bit of spyware/hardware and just lose the money I spent on it rather than return the wreck to an insecure destination. Once physically destroyed, it will go to the recycling center.  No more Samsung--- anything ... in my life!!! Shame I couldnt submit the review with NO stars .... but you have to have at least one to submit. This junk doesn't even rate that!!!"
So Samsung seems to be famous for having battery issues with their devices most especially tablets this I know because this is now my third one... I purchased them because they are affordable.... And my A7 needed an upgrade because it will not hold charge so I bought this one and then returned it... Because they do not provide a charging block... Which is annoying enough but when it went on sale again and I could get it with a payment plan and now that I knew that there would be no charging block I went ahead and ordered it again and I am seriously regretting that decision because I'm locked into payments and this cord that they send with it is not charging the tablet.... I had to buy a specific charging station that it would even fit because even though I have a Samsung tablet the charging block did not work and you can't use those generic ones from Walmart you have to use a Samsung cord and charging block as I'm finding out again I had this issue with the A7 and now again with the this one and the other thing I hate about Samsung is all those apps they insist you have but no customer service is available trying to get to them is like trying to get to the president... Anyway I'm stuck with the stupid thing it will not charge I don't know what to do.... I've got a Brand New charging station it charges my phone fine so it's not that the Samsung devices have battery problems and are notorious for that issue so please spare yourself although I will say if you're going to buy a Samsung go the cheaper route and buy this one because I would never trust just because you spend more money you're going to get a better device I'm here to tell you it's not true it is a little bit of a bigger screen but it's exactly the same as my old one with the same issues and I am very unhappy especially since I have three more months of payments... Samsung has gone to the dogs so spend a little more money and get a better device I don't have money to do that... But I could have spared myself and just stayed with the A7 until it gave up the ghost because the issues are the same upgrading did me no good and cost me financially which I really couldn't afford to do and I'm really kicking myself since I returned the first one and then turned around and bought it again they sucked me in with the low sale price... Full of regret and no possible solution I'm just stuck
"Guess with all the hype I was expecting more, Guess iPads spoiled me, this is slow to start and not terribly impressive."
Wish I had known that a Type-C charging cord was required for this device. I do not own one.
It’s okay for the price because it’s for my daughter but the camera quality isn’t great
"Seems like a nice tablet. I got it a few days ago. Relatively easy to set up since I have an android phone as well. However I go to charge it for the first time to find that they haven't given me a charging cord, just a C to C cord. I can't even plug that into a USB charger. Its just annoying how everything is extra now."
"My main issue with this device is that it won't fast charge while you're using it.  The battery level gets lower while plugged in.  Of course Samsung people claim that the charger or cable is bad, but I also have a Samsung S8+, and an S21 phone that the same charger and cable work fine for.  So it's gotta be either a software or hardware issue.  I'm guessing software because it charges fine when the tablet is off.  Also, the smoothness and quickness of scrolling and selecting apps is sub-par.  I'd expect this of a generic brand, but no Samsung product I've purchased has ever had these kinds of issues.  I realize it's not a flagship product like my others, but this product is just plain disappointing.  Don't know if I just got a lemon, or if I should go through the trouble of returning it if I'm just gonna get the same garbage as a replacement"
Bought September 2024 and now November 2024 and it went dead and been on a charger long enough to turn on and will no longer turn on. Tried many ways of turning it on to no avail. Wish I got the extended warranty but who remembers they bought it yet alone how to use it. 30 days to return is not enough on many things such as this. Wish I could return it and or get a replacement. I got this as an alternative to the iPad for testing as I have plenty of iPads and no Android tablets. Well this is putting a bad taste in my mouth.Will update if things change.
It's just soo heavy. The screen is big.
The cable don t match with the tab
"I expected to find a wall plug.More importantly, I expected a full or near full charge on the tablet.I was told that it was Tablet Only, but the power cord, 3’ , was sent, so the wall plug would be expected.  A full charge is expected as a minimum.Very disappointing."
"The Galaxy Tab A9+ Plus is a good value-for-money tablet, ideal for users who need a reliable device for everyday activities. It receives 4 stars mainly due to its combination of performance, quality display, and efficient battery, with minor limitations in the cameras and audio."
"The case is nice but the built in screen protector sucks, it makes it so you touch screen will not always work. Air bubbles will get behind it and no mater how many time you reinstall it the problem will not go away."
Nice tablet
I picked the red case. It came with a yellow case.I was really hoping it came with a charger. It only came with the wire and both ends are the same. So it doesn't fit in my USB chargers
Bought this item for my grandson birthday. He was highly disappointed when he opened it. It had a charging cable but no charging dock. A good dock cost about $40 bucks on top of the price of the tablet.
"Bought this because it has an earphone jack but could not charge it!  I have two older Samsung tablets and they all use a standard usb cord to charge. This came with a weird usb C to usb C cord that has a the same C connector on BOTH ends so you cant even use a regular charger plug or another laptop to charge it. No charger or adapter to charge it are provided so it is functionally DOA. Only good part is it still has an ordenary earphone jack.Will be returning it, big disappointment.Really cheap ommission given the higher price compared to other tablets."
Bought this for my step daughters birthday for her to use as a drawing tablet and it does run a little slower than we would like but it is a nice big screen.
"I'm rating 3 stars as neutral.I purchased this tablet for my mother as a gift. She's 73 years old and loves to play games.Love the tablet, but not not sure who's dumb idea it was to sell a device with no charger. Dumbest idea ever!Spoke with a rep and was told that Samsung doesn't include chargers anymore because most customers have one from previously purchased items. Well, what about new customers that have never had a Samsung device? Now, they have to spend more money to purchase something that should have been included. Very disappointed!"
"I don't see a screenshot option like my last Samsung tablet had.  I hope it lasts longer than that one.  It got a software glitch after a year.  Very disappointing.  I'd give this one a better review if it didn't beep it's little tune while I'm trying to watch a video. It's very distracting.  Also, the caps lock is extremely annoying.  It doesn't even come with memory chip and charging plug head so you won't be able to use it without a trip to the store. Glad I didn' get it or give it on Christmas. Dissapointing."
"I purchased this tablet mainly for browsing and online shopping. It works ok for browsing. It may be slow and get stuck on some websites. The Duolingo app doesn't work well on this tablet. It freezes and you have to close the app to make it work again. The Home Depot app is not compatible with this device. I contacted Samsung's customer service but they can't do anything about it. Samsung's customer service (chat) is extremely slow. They took forever to answer my questions. They told me to contact the sofware developer. I have never encountered an app that's not compatible with my iphone. The Home Depot app is just a regular shopping app, not some complicated gaming app. I'm very surprised that this Samsung Galaxy A9+ doesn't support the Home Depot app. Next time I will stick with apple products. They are more reliable."
"I waited to give the tablet a good test drive before writing a review and I would have given it 5 stars if it had been better receiving the WIFI signal. Compared to my 6 other devices (phones, laptops, Fire Tablets) which have no problems receiving a WIFI in different rooms, the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A9+ Plus 11” will lose the WIFI and I have to get closer to the router to keep the connection. So if you just want to watch downloaded movies and offline games, or be closer than normal to the WIFI router it's fine."
"Battery life isn’t good, the percentage decreases every 30 min, even fast when using video calls or video applications.Works perfect, like a tablet besides that."
"2nd UPDATE: ONCE AGAIN IT WILL NOT CHARGE AT ALL OR TURN ON.WORST TABLET I'VE EVER PURCHASED. PIECE OF JUNK. SAME WITH MY SAMSUNG FRIDGE. I'M DONE WITH SAMSUNG. THEY MAKE GARBAGE NOW. UPDATE: I bought this tablet exactly 60 days ago today.  First the tablet only had a very short battery life (5-6 hrs even not using it, just not charging it).  Now, the charging port won't even charge it no matter how many different new chargers I buy.  This is why I bought this one is because the other one did this after 18 months.  At 2 months old, I am having the same issue.  So disgusted with this product.  I don't know if I got a lemon or what.  I stopped using Samsung phones because they had this same issue but I wanted to give the tablets a try.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I was so disappointed by this tablet.  It is my 3rd Samsung tablet and in the 6 weeks I have had it, it already has no battery life.  I am not someone who is on it all day but even using it off an on during the day, it has a battery life of about 4 hours.  Even if it stays in sleep mode the entire day, it doesn't last even 8 hrs.  I haven't had this issue with Samsung tablets before so I don't know if this was a return or defective because I have noticed in the last year, the quality of the items I have received from Amazon have declined greatly.  I have received items in damaged product boxes or ones that look like they have already been used even though it's sold as new and you pay full price.  I don't know if this is a Samsung problem or Amazon/seller issue but I will probably return it and buy it directly from a store."
The tablet has a bunch of great features to it and because of the features it is my favorite Samsung tablet by far that I’ve owned. But what kills the tablet for me is the fact that the touch screen won’t respond most of the time. I have a screen protector on it and it says to switch on touch sensitivity but even with that the screen barely touches. It’s unusable at this point. I have to hit it just for the screen to touch again just for 10 seconds of touch. What a shame this has been.
"Purchased a TAB 9+.  Three months later the touch screen stopped responding to touch.  After two calls where I was made to go through self checks I was told to bring the unit into a local repair shop.  After driving 30 mins to get there I was told they only repair phones and that the CS the agent gave me bad info. Another call to CS and having to go through the same self checks the agent finally agreed I needed to send the unit in for repair.  I packaged it, and drove to a drop off site.  3 weeks later I got the unit back, it now works but was clearly damaged during the repair. The back cover is bent, the unit is bowed and there are 4  green spots on the screen where there is permanent damage.  Called back to CS where they insinuated that I sent in a damaged unit and they asked me for photos to prove otherwise.  After much argument where I asked why a consumer would expect to need to take photos to defend themselves. they offered to put in an UPS damage claim.  The unit was well wrapped and the packaging was not damaged so I refused to have them pass the buck to UPS.  I insisted on having the issue escalated.  Several days passed b4 I got a call back.  Again it was insinuated that I sent in a damaged unit.  After more argument the best they have offered me is to send the unit back to the same repair shop so they can try to re-repair it.  So for a $200 item under warrantee, I have spent over an hour driving, at least 2 hours on the phone, been hinted at that I'm lying, and still no resolution.  Where is Samsung's common sense, logic and respect for the customer? Buyer be ware."
I attempted to use the provided pin/paperclip/tool to eject the MicroSD card holder/cover.  It was very difficult to eject.  I placed my SD card in the holder and attempted to slide it back in.  It needed considerable force.  after registering the product and looking for the SD card it was not discovered.  I ejected the SD card holder/cover with the Samsung tool and SD card was left jammed in the tablet.  No way to get it out.  The SD card holder came completely out without the SD card!  Upon inspection with a flashlight the end of the SD card is visible but no way to retrieve it.  Be careful inserting your SD card.  This slot is poorly manufactured.  I would not buy this again.
"I didn't realize that this item doesn't include a sd card/storage, and I have to purchase additional memory for $99.99. However, I can utilize the device, but it's not what I expected when I purchased it. I am also an Apple user, and I was looking for a much cheaper way to use technology. I am unable to syncc my information between apps such as, BSF which is a Bible study tool. Also, the device isn't what I expected as far as reading aloud. Apple dictates and is more user friendly in my opinion. I guess now I will just need to purchase additional storage, it'll be much cheaper than increasing my cell phone bill by adding additional devices. Essentially, smart devices depending on preference, performance and learning style is paramount."
"Robloxs is my kids main thing and this runs it great. The only thing that bugs me and why it got a 3 out of 5 is the charger is not a normal UBS changer, its for a mini USB and i dont have anyway to plug that in making me have to buy a charger. But looking past that the tablet looks and runs great for my 10 year old who plays robloxs and watches youtube."
"I ordered the tablet early February 2024. Used it very little until late May. Since then, listening to audiobooks and streaming has been its primary function. A couple of nights ago, I moved it from my kitchen table, where I was watching Netflix, to my bedroom where I intended to finish watching the program. In those 3or4 minutes, it died. Now, it won’t open, charge…..nothing.  Black screen. Very dissatisfied customer here. I need a tablet, but it may not be from Amazon the next time."
"Really disappointed with this tablet. I was trying to replace my Surface Pro with something cheaper. Big mistake. I've really come to hate this android interface. It works fine on my phone, but on this Samsung tablet, it seems clunky and unintuitive. The battery life is ridiculously short. I barely use this tablet for 30 minutes in the morning and it needs to be charged almost every other day. Maybe it comes down to personal preference, but most Microsoft tablets seem to be a lot better than this Droid."
"If you're an android user who has never had a Samsung device, you will not like this. Common settings are gone. The way you do almost anything if pointlessly different than android and usually much worse. If this were a phone I'd return it but for a tablet I'll suffer through. The touch screen is not very responsive, I usually have to touch things more than once to get a response and closer to the edges and corners it takes several attempts to get a response. The hardware is fine and battery life average. If you're used to the Samsung OS you'll be ok with this even though it is so much worse than most Android based OS. It's my last Samsung for sure."
When I received my tablet I was surprised to find there was No power cord included in the packaging. If this item is not included it should be stated in the description so we can purchase it at the same time.Not only is it an inconvenience to wait for this item to be shipped again but I now have to pay an extra shipping cost when receiving it because I live outside of the US.I’m unable to review the quality of this product at this time due to not being able to charge it and open it up. I will submit another review at a later date.
"Samsung's One UI has a very buggy notification badge. I've been seeing bugged notification badges basically daily. The symptom is that there's a number on the icon that never goes away and can't be dismissed. I think I may have found a way to disable this altogether, but come on. This is amateur hour nonsense. The hardware is as promised but don't make it my job to fix your terrible customizations."
"Overall I like this tablet. It's easy to use. The only problem I've had, is the holder for the micro SD card. I've tried 3 different cards and none of them fit the holder.  It gets stuck if I try and gently push it in. I don't want to go through the hassle of replacing the whole unit, so I guess I'll keep it as is."
Sometimes the touch screen doesn't work when the tablet is laying down flat
"I bought this tablet mainly for its 90hz refresh rate, the only problem is one of the One UI updates broke it and now when you set the Refresh Rate to ""Adaptive""(90hz) it's really laggy and this is both on the 4GB and 8GB of RAM models. If you set it to ""Standard""(60hz) this problem disappears. But still disappointing, hopefully Samsung fixes this..... Other then this problem it's a great tablet!"
"I watch a lot of anime and the platform I watch them is Crunchyroll. Sadly iPod does not show english subtitle when the english dub is on. I've heard that Samsung does show sub even with dub in Crunchyroll. So, I decided to give this a try. However this was very disappointing and here is why:Pros:1. The price was reasonable for a Samsung device, making it an accessible option.2. The battery life is decent. It can last through a day of light use without needing a charge.Cons:1. The picture quality is a huge let down. Colors seems washed out and details that aren't as sharp as they should be. Watching video or looking at photos aren't enjoyable at all.2. Low sound volume. Even at maximum volume, the audio is quiet and clarity isn't great. This really limits its usefulness.3. The performance is average at best. While it handles basic tasks fine, it starts to lag when running multiple apps."
"like screen, speakers.dislike buttons close together, off and speaker."
"Decent tablet for the price, but infinitely slower than any Samsung phone I've had over the past 8 years. I wrote it off at first as it was installing updates, but after a week of using it, having very few apps on it and restarting it several times, it's still incredibly slow. Very disappointing."
"I bought this because SmartView had Second Screen functionality being built out for it. It would allow you to use the tablet as an extended desktop monitor. Samsung killed that functionality in an update. Now I just have a slow, hardly responsive tablet....that has ads baked into the OS. :/"
PROS:* Screen is bright with sharp colors* Good touch response* Price* Good for Samsung device ownersCONS:* Pre-loaded with Samsung related appsI have used a variety of tech devices and operating systems. This tablet just didn’t appeal to me.Still looking for a good Android tablet. The last good one I used was the Nexus tablet.
"I finally got everything set up. Tablet didn't include S pen. I am so disappointed that I  can't seem to find any help with trying to resolve this issue. I thought maybe I could use my S pen from my old tablet. However, the new tablet has no information on how to connect it. I don't think it supports an S pen. I'm thinking about returning the tablet."
"I keep going back to my old S3 tablet.  It's a better tablet. The screen is washed out.  There is no bixby.  The shape is totally wrong unless you like an 11 inch phone.  The front camera and light sensor are on the long side which I keep covering with my hand, which dims the screen. The audio is decent but there are no audio settings like on the S tablets.  Also  the S pens dont work on it.  If you buy this hoping to use your s pen, you will be disappointed.That's all."
"....maybe it's just the battery in MY tablet, but it does not keep a charge at all and takes forever and a day to charge.  I bought several USB C chargers and the only one that seems to charge a bit quicker, but still over 7 hours to fully charge and can not be used during that time, is the 240V usb C charger.  This tablet can not be off the charger very long and even when it is on the charger and being used, it still loses power even though it shows the charging symbol.  Aside from the battery issues, I like this tablet for its storage space, but still, I am disappointed in this unit and have to see if i can get the battery replaced for a better one....then i will love it.  No stars on battery life."
"I love the tablet but within 4 months it has charging problems.  I am using the charger that came with it and it only charges to 79% and stops. And when it does charge, it is VERY SLOW.  I have had several Samsung tablets and loved them all.  Love this one....but what good is it with the charging problem."
It was supposed to be new but when I received it had a bump on it and whatever the bump is is causing the bump light thing on the front screen. It does still work fine.
"Seems to need continuous charging.  I do heavily use it though.  Maybe i should have got an S tablet, one was on sale recently fornot much more money"
This tab is pretty basic and cheap.. you get what you pay for.Problems:The wifi speed is horrible. It speed tests consistently at 1/2 to 1/3 lower speed that my laptop sitting right next to itThe software is also horrible. Does not support YouTube TV and other streaming apps.  I've had it have issues with alot of the apps and the onboard softwareTakes forever to boot up.Consider a better quality tablet.. I would have returned if I would have known it would have these issues a few months after owning it. Having buyers remorse and may just donate this paperweight to goodwill.
"I bought this tablet to use for work and, after getting it set up, I found it to be a decent tablet and I enjoyed the pen that came with it. But, eventually, I noticed I'd turn my tablet on and wouldn't be connected to the internet. I would then proceed to reconnect, only to find that I couldn't and no matter how many times I tried to scan for my network (or any network around me) it wouldn't even attempt to find one. The only temporary fix I found was to restart the tablet, which would reconnect until it inevitably disconnects again.I then went online to see if anyone else had experienced this issue and found a thread on Lenovo's site with 10 pages of comments from other users that all had the exact same issue. The tablet would disconnect from the internet and not allow you to reconnect unless you restarted it. The theory is when the tablet loses its signal, it turns off the Wi-Fi module and doesn't turn it back on. This lines up with my experience as I had recently taken my tablet to a job site and upon returning I couldn't reconnect.Unfortunately, this issue happened to me once or twice in the past and I brushed it off as just a random glitch as I had done some research regarding this tablet and heard mostly favorable reviews. This issue did not come up during my research, which is unfortunate as my return window has since expired.I've heard that Lenovo is slow to respond and provide updates, as some of the thread comments were from last year, so I don't expect this to get fixed anytime soon, if ever. I wouldn't recommend this tablet unless you're ok with potentially dealing with this issue."
"What I didn't know when I bought a Chromebook it that the keyboard and functions are much different than  Windows.  In other words, all those keystrokes you've using for a million years are different, so for the simplest thing, like returning to  your home page or pinning something on a task bar, you have to forget what you know, and train yourself all over again.  I don't know about you, but I don't have time to do that.  I don't want to do that .  There are no advantages over Windows.  You don't gain anything.  It's just another bunch of things you fiddle around with for a thousand years.  I can't return it, I'll have to give it away.  It works fine as a computer."
"I really like the tablet with the building keyboard. I am legally blind so I purchased some keyboard stickers to make the letters larger so I could somewhat to see them. Imagine my disappointment when I went to type something after about a week and a half and the letter N could not work at all. I had not dropped the tablet or handled it roughly. I tried to use my protection plan and could not get anything to work with, I tried reaching out to Amazon the only option they gave me Was to return it.  And now they're telling me it will be at least a month before the money is returned. I really would like to buy another tablet, but I'm. Would be as struggled to afford it as I I'm on a limited income and had been saving money to buy one. The one good thing is when I talked to a second Amazon rap. She refunded me for the keyboard stickers. And I was able to cancel the insurance guarantee part so I received that money back so I have been credited For those two things. I really wish they would have sent me out of replacement.  I bought a Lenovo because I know the brand and have always had very good experiences for some in the past. After this experience, I will probably Just buy one of the cheap ones that have a keyboard. Why should I spend money for a brand name?"
"I bought this simply to read documents for work on the go because my office is still stuck on windows. Credit where credit is due, the screen is phenomenal. However, the device out of the box is super slow. I spent 30 minutes turning off all the intrusive stuff on the device and would say I’m now okay with, not happy with, the speed and lag."
"For normal use i'd say this is ok. But for notewriting feels clucky and terrible , there's always a 0.5-1 second delay between what you write and what you see , making it feel extremly weird. Sometimes the pen doesn't work and you need to write the word again making it a slow and petty process. The keyboard and desktop mode work nice though."
"I got this tablet because I was under the impression it could support an HDMI monitor (specifically looked up that feature, saw others do it on YouTube before buying)… out of the box it didn’t… so I figured what the heck, maybe it just needs an update…. It does, so I do the update, do the restart, and it just it’s suck “optimizing applications” so the device won’t finish this update… wasted about an hour on this then decided to do a factory reset and try again…. Which ended with the same result. So hours wasted and device won’t complete this optimizing applications screen, doesn’t seem to do HDMI out, and the answers online to fix it involve downloading things to my PC to do the update to the tablet… this seems like a know issue?I will leave the screen open and check back in a few hours, but total PITA and waste of time so far."
"I bought this to use as a travel alternative to bulky laptops for remote work. It is far too glitchy and can't handle basic functions. If you need to use remote desktop, this will take you so much extra time and cause so much extra frustration that it isn't worth it. You have to constantly charge the touch input mode because the cursor keeps disappearing. And half the time, the keyboard won't work, so you can't change file names, type emails, update spreadsheets, etc. And you have to exit and reset a few times just to make any minor changes.This is also too large and bulky to hold comfortably one handed. So don't expect to use it to replace a regular tablet or e-reader. I hoped it would be a good middle ground of a work laptop and Kindle, but it is just a major disappointment and not worth the headache."
"I ultimately returned this product, two days after receiving. It was incompatible with the rest of my electronics, and so difficult to set up. So extremely frustrating even with assistance that I just ended up returning and purchasing an Apple product."
Not what I thought.
I had read a couple reviews detailing how bad the software on this device was. I thought they were overreacting. I was wrong this is the worst Android Os I've ever seen practically unusable. Don't waste your money with this device until they fix the bugs.Edit: So they fixed a lot of bugs. The tablet is actually usable. They still need to optimize the software more. Animations and transitions are jankey and laggy.
"Too large of a screen vertically, was convenient to install, and has the pen 🖊️ pretty neat in having to learn to use as a go.Just it’s really slow and a bit junky with the keyboard attachment connecting and stabilizing because of the flimsy gap."
after about 2 months the tablet stopped booting on and there is no fix for it
"After two weeks the tablet started deleting apps on its own, did not connect to wifi networks and slowed down. This was even after I reset to factory settings."
"After reading so many tech reviews praising this tablet...I purchased it and I'm very disappointed.It's slow, slow toOpenStartChargeApps have weird delays when usingIt loses battery power very quickly.Pen and keyboard are great.I will be donating this junk and purchasing another iPad. My iPad air 2 lasted 10 years with no problems."
As the title suggests
"My expectations were probably a little too high. Probably should have just bought a new laptop. The tablet is too big and heavy for me, so it doesn't fit my needs for a tablet or a laptop..."
WiFi disconnects after inactivity and will not reconnect unless you restart the tablet. Lenovo seems to be ignoring this issue on their support portal.The UI and experience is negative because of the terrible navigation bar and virtual keyboard that constantly pop up and cover the screen.Returned and bought the P12 and installed Nova Launcher to fix the UI. Much better purchase and worth the money.
"Was supposed to come with 128gb and only came with 85gb. When I tried to use it, the interface was very laggy and choppy, and it didn't even come with a pen like it was supposed to. Likely just received a defective item which might not be the case with every one of these, but definitely something to note."
"I am really disappointed, it’s a great tablet. I was actually going to buy the p12 as well and use both of them for my school. But I started having issues with the capslock image appearing in the screen every single time when I clicked the button on the keyboard. And this is really frustrating as I need to write often. I tried getting it fixed, but Lenovo support was of no help. So I decided to back to ipad."
You must be within 10 foot of a modern to be connected to Wi-Fi. Battery only holds a charge for about 2.5 hours.  Difficult to navigate between apps. It took 6 hours to transfer information from phone to tablet.
"The tablet was so slow. It took forever for it to lead applications. Forget about streaming, it would just spin. We tried it on both our 2g and 5g internet with the same results. Not impressed."
I was unable to set up tablet because Lenovo does not provide access to policies if you don't accept policies first. I received no support from 1Lenovo web site and was unable to find d policies or even the tablet I bought.I then tried to contact Amazon for support and they were not available.
"It's nothing change from P11 Gen 1 with ARM speed improvement; however, the case for the tablet is bad. It's heavy with poor design to host the pen. P11Gen 1 has better case to connect with the keyboard, which is similar as P11 Pro. P11 Gen 2 is not and needs to take out the case to push out the pen holder, which is very annoying. In addition, it's still very heavy while taking the keyboard apart to play it as tablet. Plus, the USB connection is only USB 2 speed without ability to link with USB to HDMI cable for showing the screen on TV or monitor. Lenovo might try to have more differences between P11 and P11 Pro Gen 2, but those differences make P11 Gen 2 and accessories with bad design for using."
"I bought this for my wife for Chrustmas. On Feb 4, 2024 the system downloaded and attempted an install an update (TB350FU_S130343_240113_ROW) of firmware. It downloaded ok, but never could finish the application optimization step. Just hangs ther forever. I'm not the only person to have this problem. Literally hundreds have flooded the support boards to complian, and none of the fixes work. I wish I had never bought the poorly designed thing! Don't get sucked in on this rock!Update: After 1.5 hours of optimizing applications, it finally indicated a sucessful update. Still wish I  hadn't bought it."
"Heavy and bulky tablet with average battery life, nothing special.  Poorly implemented Android port with concerning compatibility issues impacting wifi connectivity. Also very strange menu choices with zero overall improvement. Screen is average, which was expected based on the tablet specifications. I would look to other manufactures for a better overall Android tablet package, this will be my one and only tablet from them."
The hardware on this tablet is ok for the price point however history repeats and Lenovo is not fulfilling the promise of bringing Android 13 in Q3 for this and pro version. Android 13 has optimization for tablets and having Android 12 on it in 2023 Gen 2 is crazy. I bought this for my Mom and my Grandfather and will be returning if I do not see any Android 13 update from Lenovo.
"Update: It’s trash. It’s fine for watching the rather small selection of videos available through Amazon kids but the performance for apps is horrible. It takes 30+ seconds for most apps to load and anything remotely taxing is going to be laggy and choppy and completely frustrating for any child who is used to any other device. My 2 year old has my son’s old iPhone and since giving her that she cannot sit still long enough for anything to actually work on this tablet. I still love Amazon kids as a standalone product and wish it was available on iOS but I have in and bought a fire max 11 for my 2 year old and the performance is night and day. For a little more just get that. Please. This tablet is garbage.I ordered this for my 1 year old simply for the ability to play videos for her on road trips and those moments when I just need her to sit still for a few minutes (diaper changes).Overall I really like that the kids section is pretty impossible to escape without the passcode. If you have the subscription, it only shows you apps that are 100% free with no in app purchases. This was the big one for me. I have an iPad that my kids use but it is impossible to find apps that are free and have no in app purchases (unless you subscribe to Apple Arcade which we do, but 99% of those games are not educational at all). It seems the majority of the apps included with the Amazon kids subscription do have some kind of educational value but many do not though they are still age appropriate from what I could tell.One thing I wasn’t clear about when purchasing was whether or not I could adjust the content for my youngest because this particular tablet says ages 6-12. I was happy to discover that you can indeed set the age all the way down to 2 years old and can set it to include a range of ages or just a single year if you want to. Once you set the age, the apps not deemed age appropriate no longer show up in the app browser so I don’t have to browse through a bunch of Transformers and LEGO stuff for my baby who only likes Bluey and animals.Another thing I found confusing was how to tell what apps are included with the subscription and which ones are not. This is important because I didn’t want to download ANY apps with purchases. It’s not really clear but basically if it shows up in the app browser, it’s part of the subscription. If you click the “store” button, those are apps that are NOT part of the subscription and therefore may cost money and/or have in app purchases. This is not clear at all when browsing. Kids can still download from the store but instead of downloading immediately like subscription apps do, it sends a request to the parent(s) to approve or deny the download or purchase.Lastly, it’s confusing to find what apps you already have installed. By default, it shows your child all the apps available for their age, regardless of whether or not they have it downloaded already. To view what’s already installed, you have to click “download” and there you will see all installed apps. It’s kind of counter intuitive to how other smart devices work but I can see how they did this to allow kids to discover new things. You can go in and block certain content (I blocked everything Barbie, for example 😑) so even if it’s included in the age range you selected, you can still hide it if you don’t want your kids to use it. There’s an odd selection of movies like “Where the Red Feen Grows” and others that my kids would just never watch so I blocked those so it doesn’t clutter up the things they do want to see.It does a good job of keeping kids in a safe area with content that is curated specifically for their age and interests. iOS was never great at this. Plus this tablet is much cheaper than any iPad and it’s all my kids need at this point."
"I got this tablet for my 6 year old because she's been practicing with ipads at school and we wanted to help her with some key areas around responsible device usage at home. The tablet and case itself are decent. They don't feel as sturdy as I had expected, but the case has a good thickness to be easy for my kiddo to grasp. I ordered another case that's a little thicker and has a carrying handle, and I like that one better than the case that came with the tablet. Installing the micro SD card that I bought (directly from an Amazon recommendation associated with this tablet at purchase) was incredibly confusing. It didn't work initially so I Googled and found many parents with similar challenges, and finally found a solution (you have to install the SD card while you're logged into the tablet on your parent profile, not the kid profile that auto-loads at startup).My reason for the low review here is primarily about the Amazon Kids+ subscription that comes with 1 year free. Wow, just....wow. Imagine the checkout lane at a grocery store in the late-90s, filled with junky toys, candy, magazines, etc at kid level so that every parent can spend 10 minutes in line constantly saying ""No, we can't buy that today, stop touching that, put that back""...then multiply that memory by 100, and you have the Amazon Kids+ subscription. I cranked the parent controls down as much as the settings would allow and limited content specifically to just ages 6-7, and the content screen still said ""There are 27,750 items available"" for my kiddo. I'm not exaggerating that number. The quality of the vast majority of these 27k+ apps, videos, and books is absolute garbage, filled with ads and prompts to buy things in-app. I tried limiting it to just ""educational"" material by maxing out the setting for ""complete educational goals before allowing entertainment content"" but Kids+ clearly has a very broad definition of what counts as ""educational"" and this didn't really help much.I had the Kids+ subscription active for all of an hour, and both my kiddo and I were so incredibly frustrated by the end of that time. It was overwhelming. Her home screen was filled to the brim with junk I couldn't remove. The content she downloaded in that time was glitching so often that my kiddo was in tears. I reviewed all the parental controls again and again, trying to figure out how to set up only the apps my kiddo wanted. Everything on the Kids+ subscription is opt-out, not opt-in. Yes, you can absolutely disable content you don't want your kid using --- but you have to do it MANUALLY, one app/video/book at a time. I don't want to sit down and scroll through a list of 27k pieces of content, manually unchecking boxes so that my kid's tablet isn't stuffed with junk. I even tried searching for the apps that my kiddo had managed to download in that hour, and the search feature in the content area of the Dashboard works really poorly -- I pasted the exact app title into the search field, and I still had to scroll through non-exact title matches for pages to locate the app I wanted to disable access for.Once again, I Googled and sure enough, again I found tons of posts online from parents similarly frustrated. It took some digging before I confirmed that the overwhelming content situation was due entirely to the Kids+ subscription. Some parents shared that they resolved this by downloading some apps and then turning off wifi or using Airplane Mode to disable the ability to search new content, but I found that this didn't work because so many of the apps we downloaded need the internet to run.So I decided to cancel the Kids+ free trial and get rid of the subscription. Since it was still in the 1-year free trial, i received a cheerful pop-up confirming that my subscription had been cancelled but that I can ""enjoy the remainder of my free trial."" There was no option to just cancel it outright and get it off the tablet immediately. Considering that I had used it for all of an hour, essentially I had to leave the free trial active for the next 364 days!Back to Google I went. Finally, I found some parent posts that explained that to get rid of the free trial immediately on the tablet, you can log into your Subscriptions area in your Amazon account (NOT the Parent Dashboard)  and simply uncheck the access to the Kids+ trial for each kid's device. I did that, and BOOM, the entire tablet became a much more usable product.All the overwhelm is gone! Now, I hand-select free and paid content of my choice from the Amazon Appstore and Kindle Unlimited, and I choose when to make it available on my kiddo's device. Once I got all of the above steps done (which took several hours thanks to having to Google everything and learn from other parents), finding and adding the content I wanted was super fast.All in all, I'm happy with the tablet now that I've got it set up in a much more usable way for my kiddo. I'm not at all happy with the Kids+ subscription service or Amazon's setup documentation. It should not have been this difficult for me to find how to manage or turn off the Kids+ stuff. By the end of that nightmare, it really felt like the Kids+ subscription is just designed to turn kids into little buying machines, and to cause parents to purchase digital content without full awareness simply due to the overwhelming amount of content on there and kids constantly downloading things and submitting purchases for review. Parents' lives are hard enough, and we need technology that supports us and makes our lives easier, not technology that just creates a digital version of that grocery store checkout line experience on steroids. Given how hard it was for me to find solutions in this case, and that I had to repeatedly find answers outside of Amazon's materials, I have to conclude that this is by design on Amazon's part.If you have an older kiddo and you're comfy with more open-ended access or a very large content library, then Kids+ might work fine for your fam. If you're a parent of a young kiddo who doesn't want your kid to have so much access to content (even if it is ""age limited""), your best bet is to just skip the Kids+ subscription entirely. When that's turned off, you can go to Amazon's digital content store and download any free or paid content you want to your account. Then use the Parent Dashboard to make it available on your kiddo's tablet.My kiddo's tablet now has a folder with a bunch New Reader books, a few coloring apps, PBS Kids video and game apps, a few learning apps (ABCMouse, HOMER reading, Numberblocks, Khan Academy), and a couple of kid mindfulness apps (Sesame Street and the Breathing Bunny). I like that I can change these out whenever I need to -- as she grows out of apps or loses interest, I can remove them and add new ones that she's interested in. I can also add videos (such as the Grinch movie, which she loves), or audiobooks from audible. She doesn't have access to the Store, the Web, or the Call functions yet -- I like that I can turn those off and on myself. This approach feels super manageable, and I have peace of mind knowing that she's not overwhelmed with a deluge of ever-changing low-quality content. This means I'm not overwhelmed either, and that is what this mama needs!"
"If you have a kid and you want a tablet that's easy to use, good value, and not peppered with content nobody asked for and nobody wants, this is not it. Which is a pity, given that's blatantly the target audience. The promised parental controls and kid-friendly setup are not very functional, not very friendly, to either parents or kids.First, the positives. The form factor is good and the case it comes in is pretty sturdy, even though it doesn't cover the front (and a screen protector would be great). Amazon promises a 2-year worry-free guarantee and I trust that the tablet can get replaced if damaged even though I haven't tried to get mine replaced (yet?). Also, this specific model comes with no lock-screen ads (which I guess justify part of the premium).Then, the negatives. Kid accounts get a home screen which is pitiful and full of junk which is impossible to remove. The reason why, as a parent, I bought this tablet, is because I want to control what my kids looks at and uses. This is simply impossible with the Kindle Fire.First I set up the account with the 'young kid' UI which is supposed to be good for ages 5-6 or so. The first screen that pops up has a 'for you' section full of content of doubtful provenance that cannot be granularly controlled and cannot be disabled. The other seemingly random sections (one was winter-themed) also cannot be removed. Cue 1 hour of googling random forums and arriving to the conclusion that yes, on a tablet for kids, marketed to parent who want to control their kids' experience, the content is actually decided by the manufacturer and cannot be granularly controlled. Sure, there is a way to remove individual apps, videos, etc -- except it doesn't work with those that Amazon considers age appropriate (you can only change the age appropriate range), and if you want to limit the content from the kids+ subscription, well, you have to block every single piece of video, app, etc, individually. There's no way to block all of them and only allow a few.The UI 'for older kids' is a bit better. At least it's not full of colorful icons a kid would obviously click on, but the built-in apps (like camera, or soundbox) cannot be removed, cannot be hidden, cannot be put in a folder. Paradoxically, the adult account home page is much less cluttered because at the bare minimum I can dump everything I don't need into a 'useless' folder and get that out of the way.I spend an afternoon trying to lock everything down and I still ended up with a home page app pushed by Amazon for no good reason which I cannot remove because it's not shared by me, not from kids+, and comes from the 'age appropriate' range instead. Having apps I cannot remove and cannot hide from my kid, no matter how benign, is exactly what I wanted to avoid by buying this tablet.The fact that not all apps/books/videos/etc can be blocked individually and without effort is a total deal-breaker in my book.On top of that, some decisions are just nonsensical. Minor details that should be obvious in 2024 are missing -- e.g. while I can easily set the clock to 24hrs format for my account, there's no such provision for a kid account (that I could find). Picking a bluetooth device to pair with requires an adult account code -- good luck having the tablet switch from the car to the headset when driving. At least existing, already-paired devices should be switchable from any account. Managing content requires a complicated mix of using the table UI, the Amazon parental control website and just hoping. An older kid can probably find lots of tricks and workarounds to unblock things as they please because the system is so fragmented and inconsistent that it's hard to guarantee that something can't be added (or isn't already there, hidden away).Hardware-wise, if you need to buy this, get this pro model with 3 GB of RAM. It's quite slow as it is (which is ok, really), I don't want to think how the 2 GB base model works. The speakers are tinny, the display is average at best and I haven't had a chance of trying the cameras yet. The software runs, including common apps like Netflix, Disney+, Spotify, etc, however it doesn't run very fast at all. For a tablet from 2022 this is a bit disappointing, and while the price is low, it starts competing against somewhat faster hardware, and the software, as per above, doesn't really quite buy it many points.The kids+ subscription is nice -- it does come with quite a few ebooks, as an example, some with pictures, some with text -- but it's yet another subscription to pay for after a while, and as I stated above there's no easy way to filter the bulk of the content.All in all, I cannot recommend this. Sure, it's fairly cheap, but so are uncountable other Android tablets. The interface for kids is not at all kid-appropriate or parent friendly, it's there to push as much paid content as possible, which is totally nonsensical given the target audience can't buy it (and a parent who's explicitly getting a tablet for a kid won't buy it either, most likely). This would be a reasonable buy with a much cleaner and configurable UI where extraneous elements can be hidden. At this time, however, you're better off getting a table that runs stock Android and then setting up parental controls there."
"Purchased two years ago and almost on the dot 2 years later it is not a black screen brick. My child enjoyed it from age 4-6. Most of the time things went well except for the storage being full and it was confusing to try and get rid of content to make it usable again. Some games were too graphic heavy and would crash the tablet. One major issue I had was with the approved content. There were too many that I had to manually remove which was tedious. I wasn’t notified when new content was added so I was unaware of what new things my child could see. One very problematic app which was a tap tap music game, had K-pop songs on it that had English swear words in it. The settings were set to age 5 and below apps. It was very difficult to contact someone to report it, and I’m still not sure if it was ever removed."
"We have 2 of these tablets, both purchased in September of this year. My children love them however I am quite annoyed, I purchased new SD cards and set them up with the tablet. Over the last couple of months, we have gotten several SD card error messages, SD needs reformatted, it's not in there when it is, etc. Even though we have it selected to save to the SD card I still have to go in and manually move things to free up storage. It can be super frustrating when they are in the middle of something and it just stops and gives them errors. We use their tablets for additional education and every time we have to reformat it resets all of their stuff."
These used to be great tablets. But the last 3 I bought didn't hold up well and I'm debating on buying different tablets for my kids for Christmas.  Sent one tablet in for warranty work and it came back exactly like it was when I shipped it to them.
When It came It froze up and did not work.  The replacement worked fine-- so far!  But since amazone tablets eem to last a couple years or 3-  thus most likel;y be my last one.  I was hopeling it be better for spy-war cramp but it worst.  It for children but no way -- even though I was hoping I could-- I never let this tablet anywhere near a child!
"My son used his old fire tablet for Roblox. Unfortunately, the screen cracked two weeks after the warranty ran out. I bought this as a replacement and he can’t play Roblox on it. Its way to laggy"
"I got this to help my child read he gets frustrated by our sessions but like all kids is drawn to electronic devices so even though he gets no phone time we bought this to help him prepare as kindergarten didn’t do much to boost his confidence. After an hour setup I was still unsure what was included and everything interesting turned out to be all subscription based, why would I pay for something g I do t even know I want for my child? Instead of back home etc there’s just vague symbols circle square arrow …meh"
"First, the tablet is easy to setup.  This is much improved over the past Amazon tablets we have owned.  You can even have it pre-linked to your Amazon account.Loading apps at setup is okay.  You get a choice of apps to load at setup, but you need to individually download the apps to play, which is lame.Screen quality is decent.  This is no Ipad, but the screen has bright, vibrant colors.  I do not see a blue light filter, so expect to take a trip to the eye doctor if you give this to kids with no limitations.Performance is slow if you are used to an IPad, Tab S, or a flagship phone.  The performance is a little better than past Fire tabs, which is not saying much.  Expect apps like Disney Plus to take 5 to 10 seconds to load.  Performance is fine for the priceGaming performance is subpar.  If your kid is an avid Roblox or Minecraft gamer, this barely squeaks by as acceptable for lower end maps.  Forget trying to play anything demanding.  The 2 gb of ram for the ""Pro"" version is not enough for good quality gaming.  Look for a used IPad 6 if this is your price point.  You will lose a lot in battery life and patental options compared to this.Sound is fine.  The build is decent.  The case is decent, but the hinge will break eventually if it is used to carry it regularly.  I recommend just using as is and trading it in when it's warranty is up.  Screen protectors are a waste unless your child is awful with electronics.To me, the flaws are as follows:Gaming performance is subparNo Google playstoreNo Google classroom appNo YouTube kidsNo kids Prime Video option?Charging is slowThere is a default store setting with cash purchase items that require parental approval.To me, the biggest positives are as follows:PriceCaseParental settingsFree kids book choicesAble to link to Amazon MusicCan link to Alexa for access to smart homeBattery lifeVibrant Screen for videosAbility to WiFi Call approved Amazon enabled devicesOverall, a good tablet with some big caveats.  Some flaws can be amended when jailbreak and sideloading is figured out.Update:  Tablet performance on any kind of online gaming is bad.  For example, the tablet on Roblox glitches, freezes, and stops working if it happens to load.  Disney + and Paramount + videos take 10 to 15 seconds to load.  The significant issues with performance are so notable that I dropped the review rating from 4 to 2 stars.  The tablet underperformed my 2019 Fire tablet and gets destroyed by a used Ipad 6.  Yes we restarted, reloaded programs, and deregistered and re-registered the tablet."
"I bought both of my granddaughters one of these tablets. I had to set them up on my account as I pay for Amazon kids. But, I very much dislike having my account on there also. I don’t want them to see what I’m reading or looking at. Yes they have their own profiles but it reverts back to mine every time it’s restarted!  This is a KIDS tablet not mine!  I called Amazon to try and change it but they said it had to be that way. Stupid!! And yes I know you have to setup a passcode and it protects my account but, this is a kids tablet and my account shouldn’t be on it!"
Received this tablet today for my 3 year old. Constantly freezes and runs very slow. It’s brand new out the box… and I’m not pleased.
"Once before this, I ordered a smaller and older version, my son loved it until one day when he poured juice in it causing it to go caput. So, having an ok experience before I decided to ""Upgrade"" him to a bigger screen and a newer model.... since me and my wife liked how locked down the Amazon kids software was with parent approvals and such.Buyer Beware.... Don't bother with this one... First off this is a 32GB model, but the System itself takes up 18GB and like 2GB for ""other"". The older tablet was only 16GB with no external storage and we had no issues. With it being a modified version of Android you can't remove even the most unuseful bloatware to save any space there. So, logically I buy a SD card to expand the storage. That helped for like a day... I moved all of his games to the SD card to save space, and then the very next day all the apps are back stored on the internal memory and the SD card is saying corrupted. Very weird, so I reformat the SD card and then I do it again. The next day... The SD card isn't being read at all. Rebooted it, and it worked, but now I'm having to reboot it twice daily because for whatever reason it kept unmounting the SD card and not recognizing it.Then one day, the reboot doesn't work. So I tried another SD card and it didn't recognize it. I tried a few internet ""fixes"" just the SD card reader won't work. Both SD cards work everywhere else, but not here. I suppose at this point I should have returned it, but my child being upset while we waited for a new one and me being a computer technician.. I thought I'd solve it.So, we run it with just the internal storage. Since that's what we did on the older one, But that filled up quick and it's been a headache having to reboot the tablet several times a day because of low storage. Occasionally deleting some unused games to save space all while wishing Everytime I could just decrease the 18GB the system uses... I identified several things within it that would save space and wouldn't cause issues, but again.. it's locked. So, finally after dealing with it for months, and a frustrated child Everytime it froze up... it's at such low storage now and continually pops up manage storage, that it's bricked. It doesn't have enough memory to run the manage storage app to clear up memory. It went in the trash this morning after my child had a complete meltdown over how he couldn't do a dang thing on it.Moral of the story.. is if you have a child that you don't won't to get frustrated, then pay a few extra bucks to get something that runs smoothly. Maybe the card reader issue was a factory default, that I didn't handle correctly, but I can tell you just in general it's runs slow, is cheaply priced, but cheap quality too."
"This tablet is slow and constantly glitches. This is the 5 or 6th fire tablet we've owned. My older child has 10 in previous generation fire tablet and we've never had these problems. I thought maybe I got a defective one so I called Amazon and they sent me a new one, sadly it too is slow. I wish I had purchased the same one we already have."
"Runs a little glitchy at times. Some games are slow, but works for most videos. Parental controls are setup well. Other than that no complaints. It’s holding up after 3mo of use."
"The tablet is alright, but it tends to run slow. It ran without issue before my 5yr old loaded it with photos and videos. My husband and I both have tried to get them moved to a MicroSD we inserted to free up space, with no success. Well, I found how to transfer them, but when I delete them from internal storage after copying and pasting them to the SD card, they also deleted from the SD card.... which shouldn't happen! Upon digging deeper into the tablet, I found that you can manage a ""storage plan,"" different amounts of storage you can buy. I wonder if there is some sneaky reason why we can't transfer these things onto an SD card... it forces people to buy storage from Amazon. We already paid for the tablet and are paying for a Kids+ subscription. We shouldn't have to buy storage as well.We only have 3 apps downloaded onto the tablet. Everything else came on the tablet. And the storage is nearly maxed out. I wish there was a way to uninstall and delete any pre-existing apps that my child doesn't use... there are MANY that came on the tablet that he doesn't play."
"I bought this for my daughter (7) last year for Christmas. She previously had a fire tablet that lasted her 3 years, up until the screen popped off of it and that was that ones ONLY flaw. This one? Worked okay for a few months and now certified junk. Battery lasts maybe an hour, constantly freezes, overheats, and volume randomly spikes. Also it will restart on its own, and lose all the apps she was playing or downloaded. She says its haunted LOL. Either way, maybe I just got a dud but it's too late to return it now. She doesn't play it heavily, so Im fairly disappointed with how this one didn't hold up compared to the first one she had."
"Let me start by saying the tablet is very cute & durable! The screen is a great size & love that it doesn’t have many advertisements compared to free iPhone games.However, I purchased this for my daughter as I thought her old fire wasn’t working well due to it being outdated but this one runs exactly the same. The memory is not ideal, as after purchasing only a few games, the tablet starts glitching & running very slow. I will try purchasing a micro sd card to see if that will help but I wish it worked fine as is!"
"So I got two of these tablets for my 5 and 6 yo kids and one works just fine the other constantly glitches freezes and shuts off for my child which honestly just drives us crazy while the other can be just fine playing the same games like Roblox trying to do things together, honestly believe was defective...now for the good..I really like all the child features nice to get them playing less games that don't ask for money, having them shut off at certain times, love all that but will have to purchase another due to constant freezing n will get from another company to avoid defects, hopefully handle games better too much of an investment at 150 to gamble for me again"
"The device itself is okay. An iPad is better, but this is great for younger kids that are not responsible enough for an iPad yet.HOWEVER, be warned that Amazon DOES NOT honor the warranty that they proudly advertise in the description. I am currently within warranty and have four more months until it expires. My child’s power button fell off the device and it’s very hard to turn it on and off now. When I follow the normal return procedures for the order, I am pushed to troubleshoot via articles or videos. But I need a PART replaced and those are not sold, nor should I have to do it, since it’s under warranty. Calling customer service leads to no answer. I attempted to use customer service chat and was passed around to six “reps” (not sure if they’re real or ChatGPT) and the device was reset for some reason (this is a HARDWARE  issue) and the others did not help at all - just asked what the problem was continuously, would disappear, and another would show up. This lasted almost 2.5 hours!  I don’t expect much from any company’s customer service, but I did think due to Amazon’s size they would be more organized/helpful.AGAIN, My device is WITHIN WARRANTY by 4+ months and they won’t let me use it and are actively blocking me from using it via UI design and customer service incompetence. I’m positive this is designed this way on purpose.  If you purchase the device, do not expect to be able to use your warranty."
Surprised you don't..
"I bought this for my youngest so she could watch her shows whenever she wanted but now I’m getting an email saying her profile has been inactive for the past 18 months and will be removed. I just bought this and activated it, how can it be inactivate when she’s been using it almost everyday whether to watch her shows or play games that are age appropriate. I’m supposed to get a year free when I bought this but it’s looking more like a month. So disappointed with its “free” year subscription."
"The tablet isn’t terrible and the parental controls are somewhat good. The thing is, Roblox crashes quite often. This may not seem like a problem for those who have no need for the app, but any app shouldn’t be crashing this much or glitching if the product is $100. Value for money is okay, not the best and performance could be better. Size is alright; it also seems sturdy. Camera isn’t great, but hey, it’s a kids tablet, so that aspect is alright."
"My son loves his tablet. But had it for two weeks and he dropped it and shattered the glass he also had a screen protector on it, that didn’t help. That’s the next product I’ll be writing about. I’m just hoping that the 2 year warranty will help out with a broken screen. We will see. It’s just been a disappointment. Make screen stronger."
This is a wonderful tablet for kids however I really dislike the fact that I have to link my Amazon account and this gives my child access to my photos and videos.  I didn't realize this was a thing until my child deleted several pictures from my album thinking he was making space for data on his tablet. I searched the internet and Q&As on Amazon and finally reached out to Amazon to try and remove the access and was told that there was no way to restrict access to my childs tablet so it is pretty frustrating.
"I saw some water near the charging port and earphone cable, the packaging around it was damp and the box was soggy. I turned it on and tested it out to see if there'd be any malfunction. None so far, hope it stays that way. Generally good tablets I've bought them before, sometimes the delivery process is just poor"
"I purchased this as an educational tool for my dyslexic 8 year old. There are lots of great features that would be helpful to her, like the ability to change the fonts in the books, and the vast selection of audiobooks, ebooks, and learning apps.Unfortunately, the tablet is not user friendly. It was very frustrating to set up, annoying to toggle back and forth between parent and child profiles, and worst of all, you have to pay for an Amazon kids + subscription to access the parental controls!! After a week of struggling to set it up, the final straw came when I couldn’t download an audio file anywhere but the parent profile. Since it was a therapy program for my child that she needs to listen to daily, that was it for me.I’m returning this, and I’ve already purchased an iPad, which is so much easier to use!"
"This may be long. It may get buried in here with all of the other reviews but y’all, I am frustrated. Having a child with autism can be trying at times, but every day is worth it. One of the things he loved was his 8” tablet with the intergalactic cover, I even tried to buy him a bigger version but he just wasn’t having it. He loved the smaller version.Well, that smaller version dropped a few days ago and the screen is absolutely shattered. I called customer support because I thought it was still covered under warranty, and a nice gentleman says I can turn it in, they’ll repair it and send it back, or I can get a new one sent to me for a couple bucks. I opt for the new one, in my ignorance not asking if it will be the same design. I blame mom brain.So, it got here, I open it up and it’s not the same design. Ok, easy enough fix, I’ll just swap his old case out for this new one. I show kiddo and his eyes light up! Mom fixed it! Well, then we both realize it won’t power on. The buttons have been swapped on the newer one, so the old case won’t work. I go online. Oh, they’ve redesigned the whole thing. His favorite case is gone in the smaller size. So I look up cases for it (there aren’t many) and all he’ll tell me is he wants the old one.So in a desperate plea, I call customer support again. Like, can I turn the old one back in and get the old one fixed still? Or can I even just get the old on fixed? I can pay, whatever it was my fault I just really need this screen fixed. Nope. Can’t do it.The best part? Not many places near us fix screens, and the ones that do don’t fix Amazon tablets. So, I’m now getting a $24 screen fixing kit on here, going to watch a YouTube video and bust this out because what’s a single mom to do when your sons favorite toy is broken? You fix it.I know it doesn’t seem like much to y’all, changing some buttons and getting rid of a design. Children like my son aren’t who you cater to, I get it. But man would it have been nice for a little compassion here, I don’t feel like I was being totally unreasonable."
"If I’d known it would be this difficult I would have purchased a different tablet device. I got this tablet thinking it would be a good option for my 5 year old for educational apps, games, videos, etc. It is not. Amazon has their own kids experience, which is content Amazon deems is for kids. There is way too much non-educational content to filter through. Then to make matters worse you have to delete everything you don’t want INDIVIDUALLY. You literally have to click on it, delete it, then go to next content you don’t want. It is 2024 how does functionality regress. Why is there no option to just get rid of all non educational content? If I don’t want my child watching Peppa or Bluey or content that has no educational value I should be able to search for that content and get rid of all of it, but no I have to click each individual video or game/app, or book which is tedious and stupid. Whoever established that user interface to work this way should be FIRED!!! This should be easy for parents but they have made this a parents nightmare as there is just way too much content they claim is kids content to filter through. Which makes me think that Amazon did this because they know parents will not want to filter through all the content, resulting in some parents to say skip it, which allows all the bs content for our kids to stay on the tablet. With the parent none the wiser. I called support and they told me “yes, ma’am you would have to delete the content one by one” and that he would escalate my feedback. So now I’m thinking of returning this just because of the hassle of removing content. I might as well get another tablet which better suits my educational needs and wants. I would not recommend this to a parent who only wants educational content on their child’s tablet. It will be hell removing and deleting all the content one by one. But if you don’t care about your child, about what they watch or are consuming I think this is the perfect tablet for you."
"Took little time to setup.  I really tried to like this thing and even forced myself to justify its lack of features with the price point but it just kept frustrating me and my kid.Too much unnecessary bloat ware and ads popping up before every app could be used. Home page has way to many apps for a kid that’ll be randomly pushing things.  When in kid mode the web browser just fails and doesn’t load simple searches.  Doesn’t have a YouTubekids app.  Below average settings options.  Web browsing In landscape view the screen just didn’t fit anything in it, with no way to fit to screen.  Amazon kids+ WTH 🤦‍♂️  even is that, just more junk on the Home Screen for a kid to randomly push and so many ads.  Had to go into adult mode just to find decent settings and a working web browser.  Parental controls weren’t clear cut and simple.Do yourself a favor and fork out the extra money for an iPad because:Your kid can use it for school, even in a few years.A lot easier to get some decent learning apps on an iPad.Less bloat ware.Customize the Home Screen for less clutter.Get a pen and keyboard for an iPad so your kid can draw and learn basic computing, cause it’ll last that long.An iPad will outlast the next 7yr versions of the kids fire tabletSimpler setup and parental controlsHas YouTubekids appiPad Faster processing zero lag, they said this thing was 30x faster… from what, a snails pace.Better Web browsing and better safety features on an iPad.I loathe this kids fire tablet can you tell.  I’m not even an apple OS fan, I prefer windows.  But for kids an iPad is so much more intuitive and easier for a parent to really manage and customize for their kid.  It’ll actually grow with your kid.  Plus, the parent can use it too.Ended up returning.Return options weren’t the usual drop off and they’ll box and tag.  They make you print the label and box it yourself.  Seems like extra effort to get you not to return their subpar product.  Spoke to customer service, even they said there’s a decent amount of returns on the fire tablet.  On the plus side my Amazon credit came a few hours after I dropped it off to UPS."
"Although in totality it’s a good deal, but prior to my 1 year warranty I reached out because we had had issues with connectivity, charging etc. nothing was done. I was told I’d get a full refund but I never did. I had a feeling. I’d say if you want to get something that only lasts a short time this is it."
"We bought this tablet for our son, set up all of the parental controls that were available and there is still no control over what he is able to access.There are a ton of apps being featured that are downloaded by simply tapping the app as long as it's free. We have selected ""delete from device"" for multiple apps yet they stay on the screen and are re-download with a simple touch. This has turned the tablet into a TV rather than an educational tool... needless to say, we are selling the fire tablet and going back to the iPad. .uch better controls and only the things downloaded by the user are present on the tablet."
I bought this a year ago. By child is 4 now and is more into playing on it and all it does now is freeze up and goes to a black screen. She literally just started playing on a month ago until then it was put up and off cause she didn't want anything to do with it. Now that she can play on it all it does is freeze up and the screen will switch between games its weird. Not sure if I would recommend this one or not.
I bought this for my six-year-old thinking it would be an upgrade from his tablet that I got him in 2021 come to find out the sound quality as shown in video is awful. It’s a full volume and I’m right next to the tablet and you can kind of hear it. it’s a very disappointing tablet considering it’s supposed to be the pro and have faster speeds. It’s no faster than the one that’s four years old.
Slimmer and smaller than I expected
"Wanted to upgrade my kids Amazon tablet to a faster one. We like the old one, but it was very slow. On our old one we were able to figure out a way to download YouTube kids by downloading the Google play store as well as Pokémon GO. With the pro it is much faster, but YouTube kids crashes if you want to use the microphone, Pokémon GO is completely incompatible, even  apps downloaded through the Amazon store like Minecraft often crash too and are glitchy. I got a really good deal on them during Black Friday which is why I’m hesitant to return. Their biggest perk is the Amazon kids profile,( it’s ad free games that don’t have in app purchases) and when downloaded  dont need Internet to be played, which is perfect for a plane rides/traveling however, as my kids are getting to be a little bit older, 6 and 8, they want to be able to play games like Roblox, Minecraft, Pokémon, and watch YouTube kids, and are not really interested in the games offered through Amazon tablet.  Another perk is that you can add a memory card which you can’t do for Apple products. Overall it’s decent tablet for some features but heavily lacking to appeal to kids that want to play mainstream games"
"My daughter loved her Kindle. Used for videos and loved recording her own. Was given to her for Christmas last year but started to run very slow. I had to shut it off just to get out of one app so she could use another. It now will not turn on, even after charging overnight."
"I wish we had gotta different tablet. These are incredibly slow. A full 2 minutes to buffer up. You click on a game and can count 10 Mississippis before it opens and loads. Which for a toddler and you g kid can be very aggravating. I purchased these for a 12 hour road trip. They were incredibly hard to set up. Also, even though we have a restriction set from 6am to 8pm with a three hour limit during that time. Sometimes it glitches and just allows my daughter to keep playing. We've doubled checked the restrictions and it's properly set. It's just a malfunction of the tablet. Also, every time we open my daughter's tablet it goes to my personal Amazon home page and then we have to manually go into kids.Honestly, I wish we had gotten a different kind of tablet. But it's past the time to return and I needed them for my trip. Battery life is good. Save yourself the trouble get a different brand."
Lags a lot in games and even just swiping through apps and stuff
"This the 8th Kids Fire tablet I have purchased over the year for my kids. This particular one has been crap from the get-go. Randomly shuts off, resets itself, very poor reception on WiFi (I have 250MB speed on fiber optic). Now the screen is cracked, and I am trying to get it fixed under warranty, but when I go to the replacement screen, it is an endless loop of self-help links."
"They block random apps that are Google approved, like duolingo.  Their solution is to go through their browser, silk.  That means you have to grant internet access, which is something I didn't want to do.  It would be okay if you could block everything and only have an allowance list, but that feature doesn't actually work.  And the browser keeps kicking me out and not letting me through to the website after its been approved.This is all because Amazon wants to exclude things simply because of their association with Google.  Ridiculously stupid and difficult for no reason other than corporate competition that hurts the consumer.If you actually want to let your kids use their tablets for the content you're okay with, and not the stuff Amazon says they should use, just buy a windows based tablet.  Amazon is killing their own products with this garbage."
Sadly I am not impressed by this tablet. I got it because a friend highly recommended it but it’s laggy and there are so many apps it does not support sadly.I wish I would have returned it in the time period we were just busy and I didn’t have time to really check out the tablet with my kiddo until it was too late.
"This has to be one of the biggest scams of the century. Amazobusiness, which we had previously regarded as reliable and honest, began defrauding its own Prime subscribers. This is regarding the two new Fire Kindle HD iPads taking the place of two Kindle iPads that are currently in use. Initially, they requested that we swap out our old Kindle for two brand-new HD Fire Kindle Pros, which we duly accomplished. Within a few weeks of using the new Kindle Pro HD, we discovered that they ultimately sold the faulty goods. They would abruptly shut off, freeze, or stop responding to anything. We called the Amazon customers multiple times, and they kept telling us that there was nothing they could do over the phone and we needed to ship it to their repair centre. They would take a look at the HD Kindle Pro and see whether it could be fixed or replaced with a new one. We should have known that we were lying about this, and we should have never shipped the two new Kindle Pro HDs to them.But instead of fixing the broken ones or acquiring new ones, they just pulled out the HD Kindle Pro and demanded to be paid $100 or not get anything at all. In the end, they took our new HD Kindle Pro away from us, confiscated our old Kindle, and wouldn't give us a complete refund for the two new HD Kindle Pros we bought. I would never suggest this company to others or even contemplate making a purchase from them based on my whole experience. This has to be among the world's most worthless, reckless, dishonest, rude, and unprofessional business."
"Write down all passwords and pins. Because you CAN NOT RESET YOUR PASSWORD WITHOUT WIFI. You can't fix problems with wifi from the kids side. Creating a paradox that you can't get in without a password to fix the wifi you need to reset the password. I just have spent some time online trying to figure it out. Basically I have to factory reset and start from scratch. Thanks Amazon, good one, I am not happy about spending this time to reset. And my daughter is going to be upset that everything is gone, and she has to start from scratch. Super security there amazon, I can't even get in my own devices.  I really wish I could say this is my only problem, but in 4 months there have been a few issues."
"The packaging for this tablet is weak. Flimsy plastic and cardboard, the dragon touch tablet is cheaper in price and sadly doesn’t have as much room as this fire tablet. But the Fire tablet should package like the dragon touch company with Styrofoam and plenty of pockets for shifting around while in the shipping process.Granted the tablet works. But I was unimpressed with quality of packaging. And the tablet case is hard plastic which seems poor compared to rubber like quality I’ve seen for other tablets. Im hesitant to give this to my child afraid one stop will not hold up on the case or tablet.After 5 months of use. I have seen this tablet only fall five times to the carpeted ground from a child’s hands. Today I heard the current game they were playing have crackling sound in the background. And then the whole screen went blank black  as it shut off.Note to all parents considering this device.  Strongly suggest getting it a shock absorber case because the one provided isn’t, it’s a given that a tann be let will fall and hit the ground. I’ve had my iphone for 3+ years now and dropped it for then five times and because of its shock absorbing case it still works."
My daughter lost the originalCharger that came with this tablet and so now when we try toCharge it it keeps saying their is moisture detected in the tablet. It only says this when we try to charge it. I have tried to order/ find the same charger but they don’t seem to sell it separately and so unfortunately it’s become a paper weight.
"Overall, I'm not a fan. It's slow, it's clunky, you're limited on what you can do and use, and the microSD settings are wrong. It gives you the option to either use the microSD as internal storage only - which means you cannot remove it and put it in another device to quickly transfer files (like pictures) - or portable, which it claims would allow you to transfer files on other devices. I didn't get far enough to test that b/c the main reason I got the card is for photos and videos taken on the device so they don't take up too much internal space. But when you use the Portable storage option, your pictures will NOT show up in the photos app. The camera will show you took a picture, but when you click the photos icon the pictures are not there. If you manually navigate the files app you can see them, but the only way for them to show in the photos app is to reboot. But even after rebooting it will only show the pictures from the last time. Any pictures you take post-reboot will still not show. I tried everything from uninstalling and reinstalling updates, force stops, clearing cache, etc. The only other options were to either mail it to Amazon for them to work on it or to do a factory reset. Both seemed like a major hassle so I just changed it to internal and I'll need to deal with using a cable to backup files. This device does have some pros, but I'm calling attention to this major miss for my review."
"We have had multiple amazon fire kids tablets - they are typically excellent for the price and use case (the warranty is a huge selling point for me as well); I picked up 2 on prime day of this generation and have already run into issues.Issue #1 - Setup went smoothly but downloading a few apps which we add to the tablet with the kids took hours, it was as if the download became stuck in a perpetual reload loop or something.  Finally I got fed up and just rebooted, most had actually completed downloading but I did have to re-download a couple.Issue #2 - (Performance) We have 3 8"" kids pro tablets in our lineup, one from last gen and two from this gen.  My kids love to play Roblox (I add this) and Tag with Ryan (part of the software Amazon provides through their subscription service) on their tablets.  The last gen runs both of these fine (a few hiccups but very playable for both games) but the current gen tablets - which in my opinion should at least be on par with the last version if not a little better - can't handle either game. To be clear, neither of the new ones will run Tag with Ryan (which is ridiculous because it is included!) but one does seem to allow Roblox to be played in a passable manner, while the other does not.  Consistency?? Additionally, one of the new tablets (the one which fails Roblox consistently) has to be rebooted multiple times per day.  Sure, my kids do technically have time to do this, but they shouldn't have to with a new tablet.I have not yet decided what to do but am currently extremely unhappy and am sharing the word with other parents in person, here and on other platforms."
"If you want a tablet that kills time with games and mindless screen time, this is great. Anything educational, try something else."
"I love the fire tablets for my kid - I love the control I can have over content and screen time limits, and it's so easy to set up!However, when I got the fire 8 to replace my daughter's old fire tablet that was ready to retire, I was incredibly disappointed with how slow this version is!Trying to use the tablet is an exercise in patience for me as an adult, much less my 9 year old. It will even give problems just trying to change the brightness level.Overall I'm disappointed and honestly debating returning it and getting a different brand, and finding an app I can use for parental controls instead, because this is ridiculous."
The older version of this tablet worked much better than the newer version. Constant glitching and it has trouble downloading anything.
"Somewhat disappointed in the performance and update support, which is so sparse it's practically nonexistent. Yes it's cheap, and the free year of Kids+ is amazing, but I'll likely get a Samsung or Google product next time. FireOS is honestly just kind of terrible, and the app store is quite limited for non-kid-focused apps. If even my toddlers are getting frustrated at how slow it is and apps freezing, you know there's a problem."
My friend and i have been able to get to the point of inviting our kids to chat. But theyre still not showing up in each other's contacts. I approved and accepted the invitation on my end. And my friend and her son show in my contacts but not my sons. This was a feature we were sure they could utilize but why is it not working?
"I was having an issue with a previous edition kindle. I spent literally 5 hours on chat & calls with Amazon customer support who also couldn't solve the problem but we decided that if they sent the newest one, it would hopefully solve the problems with in-app purchases. I also was sent an email giving a direct number to the kindle support line so i wouldn't have to go through 5 hours of basic chat again.My daughter was SO excited to get the newest kindle, but within the first 24 hours, we couldn't get her favorite app to load - it crashed constantly. Then the next two apps she tried to download got stuck on a cycle of repeatedly downloading and then we finally got an error message ""There was an error, please try again or contact Amazon Customer Service"".So thinking that the info in the email would take me to a person knowledgable enough to work with me again, I went to the email. The ""direct line"" was a link to the ""contact us"" amazon page, and the direct number said ""RESTRICTED NUMBER"".Customer service for kindle is ridiculous. I have grown to HATE kindles. There's no reason why it has to be so difficult for these to do the one thing they're supposed to do when other tablets sync and download apps properly. I will never buy another kindle, ever."
"I bought this for my nine-year-old daughter for Christmas, she specifically asked for this. She used to have an Amazon kids tablet in the past and it worked great. This is the new newest model and I feel like it is so slow. We’ve tried deleting some things, I always have her clothes out of her apps. But it moves so slow."
Headset breaks off into the machine and you can’t use a wired headset anymore
"The desktop organization is awful.  There is no customization.  No favorites section.  It is super cluttered.There are a few apps that I want to always be easy to find, but there is no way to do that.I like the content, but Amazon has clearly put no effort into the UI."
Got this kindle for my son because it says it has an extended battery life but it dies in 6 hours.
"I have always bought these kids Fire tablets, I have always been able to download the APK pack to get the google play store so I can download YouTube kids because you can’t otherwise. These tablets are useless to my kids without YouTube kids…anyways, got them Black Friday and was so excited only to find out the new 2022 release has a glitch that doesn’t allow you to download one of the 4 APK downloads, google play services will not work (I’m downloading all correct APK’s prior), therefore I cannot download YouTube kids. I read with the new update of OS 8.3.1.3 that this glitch was fixed, but it was definitely was not for mine. I bought two, this pink one and the Fire HD 8 for my younger son and it has the same problem. I’m going to return and have to buy an older version. And it’ll be more expensive as sales are gone. So buyer beware!"
Youngest got it for Christmas and it's wonderful except he has already broken it and I have no idea how to exchange!
Headphone jack stopped working
"The fire tablet family is extremely slow. They're very cheap for a reason. Simple actions require input, then quite a long wait time for the action to actually happen. Save your money and buy an iPad. This hurts me to say as I love my android phone, but these low powered tablets just aren't worth it."
I bought this as a gift for my little sister.Its durable and has many capabilities.Dowloads should be monitored as their are countless non-educational games on offer.Amazon also has features which allow guardians to view what is purchased.Duolingo is also available.
First of all I am not sure if our device is defective or what but it restarts multiple times a week (always at the worst times). The kids apps have features there that are “blocked” so my son keeps getting stuck in them. It’s a good concept but needs more improvement.
"My daughter loved it, but a few weeks into using the tablet, it started to get super glitchy and lagging so bad. It’s pretty annoying and she prefers not to use it, waste of money."
For some reason this only worked for a few days and then would not connect to the internet again. Trying to figure out how to get a replacement as it is under Amazon Warranty
"Tech support answers quickly but cant help.im 5 phone calls in each one minimum 45 min and my grandaughter cant use the tablet and i cant use it either.it was supposed to come with age appropriate apps and games which are almost impossible to access. I was able to open 2 and one had a link to scientology and the otger had bible songs.I think its better to pay more or get a $45 tablet. I hired someone to get the tablet set up with the games - and will keep it. My grandaughter likes it a lot but know that you need to explore every ""child appropriate "" app before you donwload. They are not screened for you. Its a lot of work and it is presented as a ready to go tablet."
This tablet is slow as hell and will show in appropriate ads while playing games. It happened few times and we were told to update software and reboot. It kept happening and amazon didnt care to support claiming games are apps not developed by amazon and they have no control over ads they show. But isnt this a kids tablet? shouldnt amazon be policing the ads shown by games app running on their tablet? We were outside the return window and they didnt take it back. Stay away from this tablet.
"You can't prevent a firehouse of downloadable apps and categories from showing up in the kids profile. A known workaround is to disable wifi to show only downloaded content, but then many apps no longer work. Amazon has also removed the feature to require a pin to turn on wifi, so if you were looking for a worry free experience this ain't it. You can't organize that home screen like a regular tablet (We want some apps available but for the home screen to primarily show a couple preferred apps). Even with store access turned off, you can't block one-tap downloading of all the recommended content other than by individually blocking each of the over 200 (probably much more) items, requiring you to click into each, disable access, click back, find your place in the list again, repeat.All this would be fine for an older kid you wanted to give a mostly fully featured tablet device to, but at that point there are better products for the money. So save yours, and find a different screen device for your younger, or older, child."
The tablet was supposed to come with a usb-c charging cable but came with something else. Can’t charge the tablet until it is replaced with correct charging cable or I buy the correct cable.
"We had an older fire tablet for my son that just wasn’t working very well and since this was on sale we thought we’d buy a newer + pro version to get better performance. Unfortunately this is just not good enough for kids. It is an extremely frustrating experience to download games, subscribe to games via a child profile (e.g. Paw Patrol Rescue World), get YouTube kids and stay signed in (constantly logged out and have to go through the very annoying login process), and the performance of the tablet is just not good enough. Sometimes it’s fine but too many times you’ll experience sluggish UI, apps locking up, or just buttons taking forever to do what they’re supposed to do. This is not a good quality device."
"We bought these tablets for our kids last year, and have had nothing but trouble with them. They were advertised, and still are as 1 TB expandable storage with an SD card. What they don't tell you is that the storage is NOT applicable to the child profiles, which we only learned after a deep dive on the internet for other user's experiences. We are always out of storage and gave to delete apps to add new ones. They are SLOW. SO SO SLOW. Customer service has been ZERO help. I've called and live chatted with half a dozen people who barely can't even understand the question I'm asking. I've asked for a refund and been denied. I do not recommend these tablets and I will never buy Amazon devices for my family again. I wish I'd spent a little more and gotten and android or apple device."
"Just not good all the way around , not worth what I paid for it ,to me it worth about 50 bucks definitely over priced it’s ok for a little kid to play on but not the best for online home schooling"
The buttons on the case suck and can not get any help from Amazon the tablet works well the buttons on the case do not spent weeks trying to fix now my kids refuses to use it with the case
My kids will only use their old ones because all 3 of this new version drop them while playing Roblox.
"I bought this for my child because of the advertised parental controls and the Amazon Kids + subscription. I'm very disappointed to find out the that the Kids + content is not easily controlled, therefore we will not be using the subscription. Upon  first seeing the Kids+ content on my child's device, I immediately spotted two shows that I wouldn't allow my children to watch ( although the age limit was set to 6 years old). It is possible to delete individual show/books/games, but it is impossible to vet the 1000's of titles available on the service, therefore giving you no real control. The only way Kids + would be useful to me as a parent is if it allowed me to choose what content I wanted on my kid's tablet, rather than trying to choose everything I do not, which is an impossible and endless task. The quality of the tablet itself, so far seems good. The subscription is a conscientious parent's nightmare."
I bought my daughter this tablet for a Christmas present last year. The “kid friendly” usage Amazon advertises is what made me want to purchase it. It is now September 2024 and while I will say it is durable (she hasn’t broke it yet).. it is slower than a Windows 1998 desktop computer. My daughter is now a little over 3.5 years old and she gets frustrated that it takes so long to load. 300-350mb download speed and 50mb upload speed is what our household WiFi runs so I don’t think it’s our internet. I definitely would look into purchasing a different brand (I would personally go with Apple) and configure the settings to suit your child. The “child friendly” features of the Amazon fire tablet aren’t worth purchasing if the tablet doesn’t operate sufficiently.
"We mainly use it to play movies in the car for our 1 year old but touch screen isn’t the best. Idk how she gets it in store mode but the only way to get it out of it is to restart the tablet, it gets annoying. Overall it’s ok."
"We have only had them for 3 days and they are already slow as can be and freeze up. Certain videos won't even play, and says video unavailable. I only like these tablets because of the Amazon kids profile but the tablet in general is junk. My daughter's old tablet runs faster than these."
"Despite the tablet being advertised as a way to control what your child sees: you should know you are absolutely --unable to control--- what is being suggested to your child. The suggested content is extremely overwhelming and they have access to download -any- of it instantly. The only way to hide it is to hide one title at a time but there are thousands upon thousands and it takes several seconds and clicks for each one. There is no way to just remove this content easily or until they are older and have just the apps/videos/books you choose. Even if you set it up for an adult there is no way to hide suggestions. Very disappointing.AMAZON PLEASE ADD A HIDE ALL BUTTON TO YOUR SUGGESTED CONTENT CATEGORIES.We are keeping the tablet for now but only because it runs games pretty smoothly and seems to be built well enough to survive a preschooler.. but to be honest, not happy about it. We will not be using this tablet for very long as we do not like these features and will be saving up for a proper customizable tablet in the future, but certainly NOT amazon brand unless they change their ways.  It's really a shame because otherwise it would be great and you may have had a lifelong customer... not that they care with their billions in profit."
"I don't like having to have a parent account on the tablet, as my child is constantly asking for the password to get into my acct on HER tablet."
This was our 3rd tablet in two months. This tablet is somehow wiping itself clean. When you go to turn it in it will have an android man saying no commands. It will not do anything. Definitely get and use the warranty. Again this is our 2 tablet in 2 months. Let’s hope this 3 rd one doesn’t do the same thing.
"These are decent, except that you cannot do some very basic things with them, like putting youtube kids on the tablet. I've tried a fair number of work arounds to allow it, but nothing works. This is only one example of apps i have tried to put on their tablets, but is not in the amazon app store, but is available in android app store. This is the overall problem with the amazon app store, if it is not an amazon app, you cannot use it.  For a kids tablet not to have access to youtube kids is just plain dumb.  The parental controls are nice, but ths is why ipads are a better choice for kids tablets.  i cant imagine daily driving a fire tablet for this reason."
This was a Christmas gift and a big disappointment.  the apps keep freezing and closing. Can't find help for it anywhere.  it sits on a shelf---would not recommend
"Very slow and glitchy, we got two tablets one for my daughter and one for my son and hers works just fine, his glitches like no other"
"The stand will does not allow the tablet to stand long ways. Although this kindle came with Amazon kids, I found it a bit excess with useless apps for kindergarten. However I haven’t had time to filter those app out. We mostly keep it educational removing YouTube  and supplementing with other useful apps. I love the parental controls that requires c snout of Edu before unlocking entertainment."
"Rating is in regards to Kids+ content.  There is no way to filter what you do/don’t want kids to have access to without spending hours and hours and turning off access to each individual app/video/etc.  There should be an option (but there isn’t) to only allow the kid to see what you approved.  It allows everything for the age range you select unless you spend hours blocking each individual item.  Cannot block videos for a given show, must try to go through the potentially hundreds of individual episodes to block them each individually.  This is so tedious.  When you turn it on it is so overstimulating with how much content pops up.  There’s no way this is not overstimulating to a child, way too many choices.  Kids content should be simple to set up and control….  Otherwise the tablet itself seems to work fine."
Takes forever to charge and don’t even think about using it while it’s plugged in but close to dying- it will die. Also not as fast as I wanted. It lags as much as my $45 fire tablet. I got this one with a discount and turning in my other tablet. Otherwise I wouldn’t recommend paying full price. Just get the $45 ones.
"We bought this table for our kids, however they can never use it as it constantly lags and the user interface is terrible.  Selection function is a chore as it never seems to click on what you want and when you do click on it it, you have to wait awhile before you touch it again because it is still trying to run your last selection. If you click a second time too soon, the tablet kinda freaks out and performs a function you didn't mean to or takes you out of what you were trying to do, forcing you to go back through the tedious process of whatever you were trying to accomplish in the first place.  Only good thing about this tablet is the battery does last a long time, however if we can't get tablet to work how we want half the time then what's the point."
"Very laggy, upsets my 4 year old. I ve bought 3 of these over many years and the lag has never been fixed. They only make them thinner with wider screens but they never update the hardware. Definitely wont be purchasing another one. Not even sure why i bought the 2nd or 3rd one. Ive never been happy with the functionality."
"Not sure that I'll buy anymore Fire tablets. While they're durable in the cases that they come in,  they lag all of the time and freeze. I've tried resetting the search history and cache and it continues to do so. This has happened on two separate Fire tablets that we've purchased"
"Don't like linking account with infotransfer to kids tablet such as pictures, n apps. Should be separate for kids"
"I received this item for a replacement for my three year old daughter’s fire hd 8 kids tablet. The lady who said she would upgrade it free of charge failed to tell me that this tablet is for older kids. The front screen options have the following: websites; calls! (Yes that’s right, something a 3 year old shouldn’t have access to) amongst other things. This tablet is for the age range that it has on it. Not for little kids that aren’t in school yet. The skin protector is paper thin. Again not a good idea for a 3 year old. 0/10 don’t recommend for a replacement for a regular kids 8."
I've had mine for not even 30 days yet and it is very glitchy and freezes constantly
I bought these for my great Granddaughters. I had to set them up first. Parent controls etcetera. Well.. it was a nightmare. Not user-friendly at all. I usually don't have problems with electronics.  But these are awful. The best thing about this is the 1 year subscription that comes with it. kids utube and lots of learning apps available.  But to get to that point.. be ready to yell for help.
We had a similar tablet previously and it was stepped on we came across this one and thought it was the same or similar and absolutely not. Every time she puts a game or show on it she has to delete it to see something or play something else no storage at all. She hates it.
"Why must amazon keep making tablets that slow down after 1 week? The speed is unforgivable, on top of having to restart this thing almost daily. I've had 3 different Kindle fires and all of them were slower than molasses. This may be the last one I buy and I will most likely move onto an ipad."
"I’m not a huge fan of screen time, but I wanted just a dinky tablet for my kids to be able to mess around with since they are getting older. So that should set you up for my expectations here. I didn’t need bells and whistles or anything really resembling an iPad, but this dumb thing has just been one huge headache from the beginning. It took FOREVER to restrict content since you have to go through the entire library of apps, games, books, movies, etc. one by one to do that. A few weeks after we got them, one of them started going so slow and showing ads (which it’s not supposed to do in kids mode), so I called the help line. Couldn’t fix it, so sent a replacement. Got the replacement today, and guess what? Can’t even log into it. So stupid. And the help line is absolutely awful, both call and chat. I got one good person one time, every other time the call or chat was ended or they told me they couldn’t replace it or some other nonsense…once the chat was even ended because I took too long (3 minutes) to reset the wifi on the tablet which she told me to do (chat was on my phone, so not disconnected on my end). I will never ever again buy a Fire tablet, not even for a dollar, it is not worth the trouble. If I could give zero, or better yet negative stars, I would. Seriously, find another tablet!!"
"I had this tablet for a little over a year.  My kids loved watching videos and playing games on it.  But, after a little more than a year, the sound started cracking.  There must be a short in mine, because now, the tablet is getting really hot and the case is starting to melt.  After trying to reach out to support, it appears I am too late for any help. So, I am here just to warn you, if it starts to melt, it’s time to get rid of it."
Not sure if it makes sense but it returns to a lock screen every ten minutes and it is not on the setting for that. My grandaughter is quite disappointed
"The time and date is instantly set up when you connect it to your phone, it has great accuracy. The watch quality is great, it's waterproof and works very well. The size is decent and fits well. The battery life has been great so far! The features are minimal but still useful and great, you can take calls but can't text and you can't use apps such as insta or camera. Besides that it's pretty functional and great for exercise and health."
"Bought this watch and the extended warranty,  it broke within a month, they sent a replacement  and it broke too. The warranty  buys you time to return it after Amazon's return windows ends, hoping for a refund for the watch...."
"So I've been wearing this a couple weeks now, and here's where I'm at. Firstly I was very upset that you can only download and change one clock face at a time. There are 4 o'clock faces available on the device. 3 of those are permanent and cannot be changed. That leaves one slot for a face of your choice. Terrible.Second,  it disconnects constantly,  but not completely so it disables the notifications on the phone but also doesn't notify the watch so I have no idea I'm missing calls or texts.Thirdly, I'm pretty sure most of the health tracking is just made up numbers,  I have high blood pressure but never with my watch same thing with heart rate sleep data.But it is pretty sharp and it can answer calls thru the watch like I'm James bo d or something but other than that it's just a watch."
Love it so far great product
It's a ok smart watch
"Money down the drain. I wore it, but the band came apart, and it's somewhere lost, unknown where.  Thanks anyway!"
Back of watch has become unattached from face
"This watch is overall amazing, but has its limit. The alarm clock is not able to be set to vibrate only, so it makes a loud alarm sound which doesn’t work for my wife. lol. The company took a day to respond to email questions. They responded at night. They did inform me I couldn’t mute this sound. Bummer!"
"This watch looks nice overall, however, I mainly purchased this watch to have my blood pressure tested regularly. Unfortunately, it's not accurate and misleading. After one week of using it, I started noticing that the battery gets drained really quick."
"Update 2: less than 4 months after recieved it, it's not working anymore.So basically, if what's next is true, keep in mind it won't last long.I own 4 watch from this company, recieved at the first time. So far, 2 out of 4 are not working anymore. Make you choice accordingly...Update: does not keep settings, no possibility to keep it onIt has a nice look like other models from the same brand.As for others, the design is nice, and given accessories well made.However, functionalities like phone, sports and others are not really reliable. It disconnects and have trouble to be efficient.I'ts ok for the price but don't expect too much.Finally, you need to install app to make it works"
"This smart watch includes the following:1 x watch (without strap installed)1 x Rubber strap1 x Stainless steel clasp based band1 x Link tool to be used with the metal band1 x Instructions manual1 x Magnetic USB charging cable1 x Bag with 3 spare pins.  If you use the metal band, you will need 2 of these.There was a protective film on both the watch face and sensor area on the back, which is a good thing and can easily be peeled off.  The first thing to do is installing the strap and unfortunately there is absolutely no instructions provided on doing so, which is a disappointment for those who have never installed these type of straps before.  Fortunately, you can find some videos online.  The rubber strap already has the pins applied, however, the stainless steel band is extremely difficult to apply.  You have to apply a pin on each end, with the spring part on the side with the opening.  Due to the inclined nature of the lugs on this watch it is extremely difficult to get it installed and quite frustrating.  You have to hold and press hard on the sides, and this is where the watch buttons are so you end up having to press those very hard.  You may need to use the link tool to push pins out and remove a link, as by default it may be too large for your wrist.  I've been unable so far to install this strap on other watches before, which had a better lug design and one which was straight.  The other strap included is also difficult to apply again due to the inclined nature of the lugs on the watch.  More so, they seem to be a tighter and less comfortable fit compared to other silicone bands I have used before.As far as the build quality of the watch itself, my first impressions are mixed.  This does not seem to me like an ""indestructible"" watch as suggested in the description, nor military grade / tactical grade.  The 2 buttons on the side are flimsy and they move a little.  It looks like something that can become loose over time.  Build quality overall is average in my opinion.  The main button is a dial type, it can be turned, but it serves no use on this watch as it is not used, so it is strange to me that they have included this type of button.The screen is an AMOLED display, and I can see that right away with the pure blacks.  Unfortunately, it is not as bright and vivid as other AMOLED watches I have tried.  Battery type also seems to be lower as well with less than 400 mAh.  It is a good idea to fully charge watch before first use.  You will need to provide your own 5V USB source from your computer, power bank or own phone charger and take care not to lose the cable as magnetic charging cables are not universal (the distance between contacts can vary from one watch to another).It is strong recommended to install the app (FitCloud Pro), it is safe to accept all permissions and is required in order for the app to fully access features and communication with your watch.  Refusing permissions will cause some functions not to work, like notifications, syncing contacts, SMS, calls, etc. The app will automatically adjust your watch to the correct time and date and will provide you with options to upgrade firmware if one is available.  It will also provide much more details on your fitness and health than the watch alone due to the limited resources on the watch.  There are tracking and health settings that can only be set through the app.The way the watch tracks your fitness and health is through wrist only and the use of light sensors (PPG) and motion.  Due to the limits of this technology, data accuracy will vary.  The watch interfaces with the app and phone using Bluetooth.  You can make and receive calls, receive SMS notifications and other.  Call quality was OK, loud enough and clear both ways.  Step counter was similar to what I have seen on all other watches, its accuracy falls short.  Nothing beats the accuracy of monitors placed on the leg.  Since this relies only on the wrist and motion, you will get steps registered even when you are not walking and many steps not registered when walking.  It seems to be extremely sensitive to specific motions.  For example if you are  a brisk walker with wide swings, it seems to be better at registering steps, but it may not be 100% accurate.  If you are walking normally, with narrower swings, it will skip majority of the steps.  For some reason also, it seems to suddenly register steps in bulk.  Not a good steps tracker in my opinion, unless you are brisk walking longer distance.For calories consumption it will way overestimate the results.  Calories burned is different from one person to another and varies depending on your fitness level, weight and height.  Less fit people will burn more calories than those who are closer to their normal weight and fit.For sports and activity tracking, same principle, many sports and activities have similar patterns of movements so it would be impossible to track with accuracy the type of sports you are playing and will often provide a false sense of accomplishment.Finally, health monitoring.  I have tested only the following features:  Heart rate monitor, blood pressure and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2).  For heart rate monitoring results were compared to my trusted and accurate OMRON, and results were fairly accurate with an acceptable margin of error of  < 2%.  For blood oxygen saturation, results were compared against an actual oxymeter, and results were also fairly accurate with results accurate within +/- 1%.  For blood pressure, I urge people to to use this function on any smart watch.  The only proper way to measure blood pressure is through the upper arm and inflatable cuff.  This watch uses light (PPG) and its method to estimate your readings are extremely inaccurate.  I have compared against a trusted OMRON for those readings, and here is the tricky part.  The watch will always return results that are optimal/elevated, so either < 120/80 or 120-22/77-80.  If you already have a blood pressure in those ranges, the watch will give you a false sense that it is accurate.  However, if like me, you have high blood pressure, relying on the watch can be harmful.  For instance, I have non medicated high blood pressure for now, it is in the ranges of 145-150/90-99.  The watch will always return results of 122/77-125/80.For sleep monitor, watch was fairly accurate in determining total sleep times and awake times.  Ability to monitor heart rate and oxygen saturation during sleep is good, however, it is very disappointing that you cannot adjust the intervals.  It appears to be locked into one setting, and possibly to preserve battery life, but the gap is too wide.  This is a far cry from an actual sleep study.  Sleep stages can ONLY be measured accurately using brain waves, and obviously this watch does not do that, so the results are based on estimates, with data from the watch - it was not meant to be accurate in any case.Overall given that the watch is very inexpensive, it could serve well on its own as one for hands free calling and notifications, along with monitoring your heart rate during activity or rest along with alarms that can be set.  However, I do not recommend it if the main purpose would be for activity tracking and expecting accurate results."
"This watch uses the always disappointing FitCloudPro app, which must be installed on a smart phone if you plan to use the watch for anything. FitCloudPro watches have a common set of ""features"" that are guaranteed to frustrate and annoy - they usually have a button on the watch that spins (but spinning it doesn't actually do anything, which means you have a big button sticking out that can get caught on things instead of a nice flush mounted one), they don't let you leave the timer screen while the timer is active (so if you set a 30 min timer, you have to stay on that screen. You can't go check the timer or your notifications or anything), the incredibly useful ""find my phone"" feature is usually buried in the main menu instead of being accessible from the main screen or the quick menu, you can only set an alarm on the app and the notifications are janky (compared to the other apps, FitCloudPro has a tendency to post a notification multiple times, repost a notification when it is cleared, ignore calendar notifications, and does notifications for outgoing AND incoming text messages). If any of those is going to be an issue you should absolutely avoid ANY watch that uses FitCloudPro.The positives of FitCloudPro are that it doesn't seem to bad for draining battery life and it will run with most of the permissions turned off (it does need bluetooth and possibly location for basic features, other permissions are needed for access to contact list, phone, media, notifications, etc... if that is your cup of tea). It also will (eventually) let you run without creating an account (and unlike the most superior veryfit, it won't constantly nag you).We have tried a ton of these smart watches and this one is pretty disappointing because it was priced so reasonably but falls short on features and functions.The watch looks great and it comes with two bands - a soft sport band and a nice metal one. The metal one comes with a tool for adding and removing links and it works great. The watch body has a metallic feel to it, even if it is mostly plastic. It has two buttons on the side, one of which also spins (although from what I can tell, the spinning doesn't actually do anything). The big spinning button sits out far enough from the watch (and is pretty wobbly) and I worry that if it gets caught on clothing it will rip right off. The bottom button is programmable from a short list of options like ""return"" or ""turn off screen"" or ""jump to fitness screen"". You can pick a different option for short press and hold. This feature is pretty useful if the options line up with the reasons you got the watch for.The watch does usual tracking steps (not bad) and heart rate (in the ballpark). Sleep seems reasonably accurate although this a heavy watch to wear to bed (I've found I have to take it off but that's true of any metal-band watch). The rest of the tracking (O2, stress, blood pressure) is just random noise. Fortunately you can turn most of it off.Battery life is pretty good. With most of the features turned off it lasts a week easy. With everything turned on and making multiple calls (Dick Tracy style) you will easily get through a day with plenty of charge left.You get a short list of favourites which you can access by swiping from the main screen. They can be customized via the watch (you can add/remove favourites and change the order). I like the weather screen and sometimes the music, but I mostly don't use them. This watch has two quick menus. Swiping up accesses a sort of system quick menu that lets you set the brightness, start/stop music, and control some settings. This would have been a great place to put the ""find my phone"" button but unfortunately it has a couple of less useful features instead. Swiping to the left brings up an overlay that has a shortcut to the phone, weather, and 4 other options. I was hopeful that these would be the most commonly used options (or you could select them manually) but it seems pretty random what shows up. Sometimes when you select something in the menu it shows up right away as one of the 4 options, but other things won't show up no matter how many times you use them. Sadly I couldn't get ""find my phone"" to appear here no matter what I tried. Sigh.The watch face situation is a mixed bag. The built-in watch faces are mostly non-offensive. You can create a custom watch face (pick your picture or background, choose the location/color of the time/date) and you can pick another watch face from a big list in the app. Many of the watch faces have buttons that let you jump to certain screens (like clicking the heart will bring you to the heart-rate monitor, or clicking on a music note brings up the music player) which would be great if it had buttons for features I actually wanted to use. I was able to find a couple of watch faces I liked but they all had issues that bothered me. For example I really liked one of the faces until I realized that the battery power was shown twice - a very prominent percentage above the time and a very prominent progress bar across the bottom. Once you see it you can't unsee it and it bothers me. Some of the watch faces are downright obnoxious - why do I need a button for notifications when I just have to swipe down to see them?And that really summarizes the issues with the watch. For $40 you get a lot of features, but a lot of those features aren't actually usable. Notifications don't work well enough to leave turned on. I can customize some of the menus, but I have to pick from a list of features I'm not interested in using and I can't pick the ones I want. The features I don't want or need are easy to access and the ones I consider critical are buried or don't work. It's too bad because this could have been a slam-dunk 5 stars."
"LIGE Smart Watches for Men(Dials Call&Answer), Fitness Activity Trackers with Blood Pressure,100+ Sports Modes,1.96"" Amoled Screen Military Smartwatch Compatible Android iOSThe watch itself is nice, it comes with two straps; a black rubber one and a gray metal one. I have a large wrist and both straps fit well.The watch has a lot of health monitoring like step counter, distance, calories, heart rate, blood oxygen level, sleep tracker, etc.  The blood pressure is way off in my case, but to be honest, never had a smart watch that was precise for that.I can make/receive call, choose which notifications I want from my phone, control music playback  and more.This is a complete watch.  My only issue is that there a a lot of faces to choose from, but most of them are childish, and I can't find one that I really like."
The watch was totally inaccurate on all functions! I returned it!
Quit working after 36 days of use
Doesn't count steps accurately. Blood pressure isn't accurate either. Checked it with to different machines then with the watch & was off a lot. Sleep data Doesn't work like it should. Looks great if it worked as good as it looked it would be great. & the charging cable is very short. Hard to charge because cable isn't long enough to reach table or countertops.
"Hmmm.  Have owned similar Lige smartwatch before without issues.  But this one.....I dunno.First the app needed is by far more complicated than the dafit app. Second, couldn't get the watch to pair phone and audio with my Motorola.  Third, adjusting metal watchband is a lot more difficult adding or removing links.Overall.  I'm disappointed and will be returning it for a refund."
"It broke after the second time I took it into a swimming pool. It kept restarting over and over until it completely stopped working. Now it does nothing—not even charging. I really liked it for its design and the fact that it tracked blood pressure, stress, and heart rate. But honestly, claiming it’s very durable and military-grade seems misleading because it shouldn’t break just from pool water."
"I guess this was a fad buy because everybody else seemed to have a ""smart"" watch. This one is comfortable to wear has good battery life, and does a nice job with basic functions. But for me it's just a big watch draining my phone battery all the time. I even have to ""sync"" it all the time, so it can tell me what I could easily get by looking at my phone. I will keep it and maybe later if I adapt a more outdoorsy lifestyle where things like Altitude will come in handy. But for now, I'm not wearing it very much. My significantly smaller basic Casio does fine. My opinion is based on how I perceive the watch. If you are the type of person or life the life this tough watch is made for, don't hesitate."
"LOVE this watch and the app, my only complaint is it will randomly stop letting me know text messages were received. No vibration, no notification. I've checked all my permissions and settings in the app and watch itself. Everything is on.Seems to be no rhyme or reason as to why or when it does it. Frustrating!"
What did not like is not being able to sync certain functions with your phone such as do not disturb. I use it daily and needed that to sync.
"I have had this watch for 5 days and have 3 issues, 1) Unable to put my height in the file under the imperial version just keeps kicking me out of the app. 2) When entering the sports mode I am unable to stop and get out of the setting without shutting down the watch and re-starting it. 3) Unable to connect to my apple health. I have contacted C/S and after market and still to date have not received a resolution to these issues. I get one email a day for the past 4 days but no resolutions offered. I am extremely  disappointed with this response and lack of receiving a phone call (I did advise them of my phone#) to address these issues. Update as C/S and after market sales we’re unable to assist with my issues and also the app actually stopped syncing with the watch. I was never offered the option of a replacement but the did issue me a credit. Not a good product based on my experience. Sorry"
"I purchased this watch, and on the first day, I noticed that the battery was not as good as advertised, from 100% to 80% in just one day, even on the lowest settings. I went swimming at the lake, and the heart rate monitor stopped working. I tried to reset the watch, but it did not help. The speaker is quiet when you talk on the phone unless you keep it close to your ear. I returned and went with a better option. Kospet, please make some updates, and you will earn a lot of happy customers."
"Update - much better, reallyOk - I've changed my mind after a few months. Yes - great battery life and the watch face is much easier to see in daylight (I'm 71 and have eyesight issues). A recent app update has made all the difference in the world for me and the rest of my issues.Swiping works smoothly - great features (always)Good bluetooth connectivity.Excellent build.People have actually complimented its looks.I like the watch faces - wish the watch face creative tool was more sophisticated - maybe a separate app for that in the future??Can't judge the biometric functionality. Steps - probably ok(??) I really wanted it for the battery life and bright face.After my first review KOSPET quickly contacted me and offered suggestions and even to swap out the watch. Frankly, I ignored them and just tried to do it myself (stubborn old fart). But like I said above the app update seemed to cure things. KUDOs for customer support though.First review good and bad...Good News - long battery life, bright watch face.Bad News - constantly having to re4set this device, its settings. Randomly changes watch face. I just want it to worm rather than having to check the settings every other day (and reset them again and again)."
The battery life was as advertised. I used for a number of days but was dissatisfied with notifications. There was no sound and the vibration even at the strongest level could not be felt. Also the notifications would only sometimes show on the watch. I guess you get what you pay for.
"Description talks about “rough & tough”; the pins that hold the band on to the watch…..if I landscape for one hour, they will pop off (I’m a professional landscaper). Watch is WAY TOO fragile to withstand what you say it can withstand.  I’ve restarted/rebooted….everything, it will not pair with my phone.  I’ve never had a paring product before. All red flags for my use. Instruction book is teeny tiny and hard to read.  Sorry."
"I had a Amazfit for a long time, then the battery gave out. I should have bought another. This watch has poor battery life. If you want to save your steps, you’ll need to sync it daily. Syncing workouts is also problematic."
"Just a so-so smart watch, has trouble staying in contact with cell phone.  Does keep good time."
i just received this watch orders 8/20/24 was supposed to be here between 8/31/24 to 9/2/24  by the 2nd  it had not even shipped and said to be delayed by the next day has no tracking detail and i try to cancel to which im told i cant do that i had to wait for the details to be update. i had to contact amazon just to confirm the expected date so that no one steals its being unaware of delivery. amazon tells me delivery is set for 9/6/24 and it arrived on time. why they couldnt tell me the new detail and made me have to go though amazon i dont know. i wouldnt  recommend anyone doing business with this company. the watch better make up for the hassle. i will leave a review on the watch after some time so i can tell if it lives up to its advertisement. if i could choose all over i would have gone else where.
"Weighs a ton, doesn't hold a charge.  Does NOT connect with iPhone for calls or texts at ALL!  Bluetooth drops constantly.  Notifications are in CHINESE no matter what the language settings are!  Contacted support and they are clueless!  Buttons are hard to press and screen has poor response.  Amazed that anyone would use this.AVOID!!!"
This was working good for me then out of nowhere it just stopped working the screen froze up and now it does not charge when I put it in the charger it doesn’t charge this was a complete waste of dam money I’m so upset. This was my fourth watch I got this year thinking I finally got one and this happened I’m done
"Unboxed it powered it on, and a button fell off. I am hoping this is a one off issue. But if the replacement is just as bad, I'll be more disappointed."
A bit disappointed. Watched worked well for a few months. Last month it began freezing. And now it doesn’t charge or turn on. When I did work it was great but I rather something that will last more than a few months.
"Regarding the battery life of my recently purchased smartwatch. The product was advertised to have a 60-day battery life, or at the very least, a two-week duration. However, my experience has been significantly different.I received the watch late on Saturday night, July 20, 2024, and fully charged it. I embarked on an international trip to Canada on Wednesday of the same week. By Friday morning, July 26, 2024, the watch had completely depleted its battery, lasting only approximately 120 hours. This unexpected battery drain left me unable to monitor my oxygen levels for the remainder of my trip.Given the discrepancy between the advertised battery life and my actual experience, I am not recommending this product."
"Inaccurate health and sport readings, system update takes hours, full charged battery will not last for a week not as per ads. I'm very disappointed by this product."
This watch does not hold charge at all. My son has the same watch not ultra from a different supplier and the battery life is much better. Same app
After wearing two days noticed face had cracked and watch never connected to phone would not recommend anyone to buy it
Stopped working in less than 2 month. Spend more money on a real brand is my strong advice.
"I do not recommend this watch at least for swimming. I used 2 time in a pool, it works ok, but after the second use the touch screen did not work any more."
"The watch itself is okay and functions as you'd expect from a Chinese off brand smart watch.The highlight of this watch is definitely the AMOLED display. Beautiful dark blacks. But it's a very low refresh rate display and you can tell as it stutters a lot as you scroll through the menus.The phone app is probably one of the worst I've seen so far. It's called KOSPET FIT. It's a mixed bag and it's barely customizable. You can't set alarms in the app. You can't set up the watch to be on left or right wrist. There's no power saving options for the watch within the app either. Almost all of the settings need to be set up in the watch itself, the app is not really needed after initial setup unless you want to use this to make phone calls and receive text alerts etc. For some people this would be a good thing. I'm much more inclined to setup my smart watches via app exclusively.I slept with this watch on my wrist a couple of nights and it was really annoying because the lift to wake kept turning on the display as I moved around in bed. Since that first night I completely turned off the lift arm to wake display, as it doesn't function as any other smart watch in that aspect. It's a mess. The watch would light up every time I moved my arm.The watch did not sync my sleep at all either one of the nights I slept with it in the app in the morning. It displayed my sleep in the watch itself but it didn't sync up with the app until I closed the app and manually synced it with the watch a couple of times. It's very glitchy and somewhat inaccurate.The watch faces weren't bad, and my favorite was the colorful one with the Rolling Stones tongue. Most of the watch faces don't really go well with the dark gunmetal frame and bright orange buttons. Had this watch been made with a true black frame and black buttons it would've been much easier to swap straps and select different watch faces without looking at a color mismatch mess. Even though the listing says black, this watch is definitely not black.I do not like the silicone rubber strap this watch came with. It's too thin, stretchy and flexible but it is comfortable to wear. I can't tell how long this band would last with daily use. But it doesn't look durable at all.I don't know what this watches' asking price is because the listing says it's currently unavailable. I've seen these exact same watches going for 120 to 140 dollars and at that price it's a hard pass. It's simply not worth it. I'd probably buy this for a kid for no more than 20 to 30 dollars.What works? The time, phone calls, incoming call and text alerts, alarm clock (though it has a very annoying alarm sound that cannot be turned off), heart rate, SpO2, blood pressure all seem to work as expected.What didn't work? Sleep tracking, lift wrist to see time is faulty and turns on even when the watch face is facing down, no left or right wrist use selection in app, no power saving features in app, no automatic screen brightness via schedule in app or light sensor on watch itself, you can't select wake up alarm ring tones or completely turn them off- I much prefer vibration only for waking up in the morning.The app is simply too feature anemic. They should copy Zepp Life app as it's a much more robust, useful and customizable app. If this employed the Mi Band 6 app and features, this would be a 4 star smart watch. Unfortunately, they coupled this watch with a very simple app that doesn't do much to extract all this hardware could provide its users."
The heart rate was bad wrong.
I believe the product is great for the value but only if the one you get works. I was given this as a birthday present and used it for 3 days before wearing it in a light rain and the touchscreen is rendered inoperable. I want to like it as it’s attractive and the included watch band is comfortable but at the end of the day what use is it if the screen can be destroyed by a sprinkle of rain. The buttons still function but that’s it and I couldn’t seem to restore the screen functionality via and series of reset options.
Just got this watch in the mail two days ago and it was a complete waist of money. Health monitoring will not work. Sleep monitor also will not respond. And customer service has yet to respond. I hope to get a refund but the way it's going I doubt I will. Don't buy
"Good looking watch , big and chunky matches my big hand perfectly, battery life is not so great as advertised, I  got 2 days max with everything onScreen is awesome very visible is direct sunlight but doesn't have an ambiant sensor so brightness have to be adjusted manually.I've ordered the silver version but received the black one , black version is also pretty nice so I decided to keep it but I would've preferred the silver one.Dose everything even blood pressure.Conclusion.It's a very good looking watch with everything on board and an awesome screenUpdate:While answering calls from the watch the volume is very low .Latest firmware update has improved battery consumption, now the watch last longer"
This smart watch was worked for 72 hours. I hoped that it would last a year and give me my blood pressure and other essential records but no it did not. So I sent it back. Great price but it just quit.
"Ok, so after a tad over 3 months review I still have my watch, and it still works fine.  I like the way the watch looks, but wish it was a tad thinner.  Also, I am still having trouble with the route tracker working witch is one of my main reasons for purchase (possible user error, who knows).  The screen cracked when I bumped into a painted cider block wall, you may be able to see it in the upper left corner in pic.  So don't expect it to be an extreme outdoor accessory like in the products pictures (still, for the price it is likely the best you will find for rugged use).  I was going to use it kayaking but now am having second thoughts.  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this product nor will I purchase again only for one reason:  The lower right button is failing.  I now have to hit it multiple times to get it to work.  At first it was fine, then it started up.  This is the return button and quick select button.  One of the most frequently pushed and most important option for navigating the screen.  Although it ultimately works it is extremely annoying.  It really sucks the user friendly out of the product, but again, for the price, some may be able to overlook the flaw.  However, I can't stand it and it shouldn't have been a problem with my light day-to-day use.  Sorry Kospet 😞"
"I really wanted to like the Kospet M3 Ultra watch, especially with its sturdy build, but unfortunately, it's been nothing but trouble. For the last six days, it hasn’t recorded my heart rate at all, which is frustrating as that’s one of the main features I rely on. Additionally, the software seems glitchy — the screen freezes frequently, making it difficult to use. To make matters worse, the battery life has taken a sudden dip, lasting much shorter than advertised. These issues combined make it unreliable for daily use, so I’ll be returning it. Hopefully, these problems can be addressed in future updates."
"This was the first smart watch, or any watch in 30+ years I have purchased. I got it because though I am in relatively good health, I am no spring chicken anymore. I bought this as a 60th b-day present to myself. I knew I did not want to go super cheap so I chose this one after doing some research, expensive is not always better, and it seemed reasonably priced as compared to most.So here is the good and bad.Positives:1) Reasonably priced2) Pretty tough and durable. The reason I have not  worn a watch for over 30 years was I tended to destroy them.3) Easy to chargeThe Negatives:1) The battery life is not what it was advertised as. I get about 3 weeks out of a charge. Advertised at 60 days2) It has trouble maintaining a connection and synch to my phone. I use a galaxy 21 plus. I have to restart the watch and sometimes my phone to get it to reconnect via Bluetooth.3) Once reconnected, It has difficulty synching and can take several minutes once reconnected.4) Not a fan of the band have to wear it kind of loose otherwise it pinches and is a little uncomfortable to wear. I find myself messing with it to much. That might be on me because I have not worn a watch in so long.5) I spend quite a bit of time traveling and could not find just a charger for the watch, as it requires a specific one by the manufacturer. To take on the road and leave the other at home.  That is why I needed a long battery life.When it gets down to it would I recommend this watch? Not sure. I purchased it in April 2024 and am still undecided as this was my first one, and I bought it mainly for the health monitoring features.  I do not use most of the other features. But the features I do use seem to be good and relatively accurate."
"I an a new caretaker for an elderly man and am up regularly to empty his urinal and stoma bag and wanted something to easily track 4 hour intervals. The description says you can set alarms with your voice, that doesn't seem to work. Also while some cheap watches allow 8 and even 10 alarms, these are pill taking alarms watches, this watch is limited to just 5 alarms.  The pill taking watches didn't seem rugged enough for what else I do, like working in the yard, washing things, I wanted something that would hold up, and the ability to answer my phone is very nice, rather than keeping my phone on me, I just keep it within 20' and I receive calls.  The timer is nice, but it won't continue in the background and there isn't a face where I can also see the time, so keeping the timer going for 4 hours isn't going to work.I realize now that this isn't for working, it is for sports. When I was in construction, I also could have used more ways to measure time and set reminders that this watch doesn't have. So, overall a disappointment. The compass is nice when I go on hikes, haven't tried the gps yet, it just seems that even the gps is tied to miles hiked, it seems everything is about sports people competing with themselves or each other, as opposed to simply having a rugged tool that tracks time in many ways and is less concerned with your oxygen sat then it is with reminding you of time intervals passing."
"Great watch, I loved it but there is no silent/vibrating alarm function this is a huge oversight this option is standard on most watches"
"I had bought a Tank 3D watch it is good.. how ever the software (KOSPETFIT). It is poopoo even with flies etc..  It crashes almost all the time.. so, I would say don't buy the watch.. until the software is stable.."
While battery life is better than my iWatch it still is not what was advertised.  A full charge lasts 3-4 days depending on activity levels.  It does fully charge quickly with a minimal impact to my battery pack.
Returned wouldn't stay connected.
"Hart rate appeared to read high.  Batteries do not last long if you use lots of features.  Hart rate display disappeared when batteries were below half charged.  There is no MPH display when walking or running.The weather display seems to always have the wrong outside temperature.  Due to an apparent programming problem, I was unable to use the app to register the watch."
"Followed the minimal instructions.  Downloaded the app and connected the watch to my phone.  Allowed all possible permissions but cannot get any text messages or calls to the watch.  Submitted numerous emails to Kospet for support and got nothing in return.This watch is bulky and basically is a glorified regular watch you can buy at walmart for much less money.  I does collect some of the health information and syncs that to the app on the phone, but get reminders to get up and walk around while I am up and walking around."
"Tank M3 needs firmware updates and stability fixes . Music player doesn't always work , doesn't always show correct songs . Needs a calendar and some more functionality"
I really wanted this watch to work.But the companion phone app is just garbage. I should have read the reviews on Google Play.Returning this thing.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Watch was great quality built, unfortunately only lasted a week and the display has gone, blurry into sort it and not clear as it was"
"Can't verify User and product statements in order to use apps with phone and watch. Could not register watch as result. Whatever you are supposed to ""tick"" doesn't work. Waste of time and money.Readability sucks as you need an electron microscope to read.Pathetic"
"I expected to see as many watch faces like I had on my tank m2, but there's not so many.  I wonder why instead of improving, they are rather going backwards."
Watch ⌚️ is ok but battery needs to be charged every week. And was advertised to hold charge for months.
It is not a watch as advertised and I haven't used it for months so it just sits there.
It’s heavy. The screen display not user friendly.  The instructions are poorly worded.
"I cannot figure out why I cannot receive vibration when new text arrives and I do not see the gps function where is it and how is it usedUPDATE: this watch is really bad quality. Feels like cheap plastic, which it is. the gps has never worked. the text messages still will not vibrate.this purchase is certainly tone of the worst purchases i have ever made. amazon has not accepted my return or updated complaints."
Have had nothing but problems don't wast your money
"I had this watch for 3 days now , and it keeps turning off randomly , the Time keeps changing and it's never right. Very laggy UI . The buttons on the side are useless they don't even work . Don't waste your money ."
"This company never answers their phones nor do they return their calls. Made server attempts over week span, and no callbacks whatsoever. One of their watches did not last more than four months, and it crapped out, made the mistake of buying another watch only to go to the same heartache of not getting no customer service whatsoever, this company just wants to sell and provide no customer Service ."
Blood pressure inaccurate Doctors tested me while wearing the watch.
Did not meet my expectations.  Was unable to get it set up. The item is being returned.
This monitor stopped reading accurately after 7 days. BPM was all over the place when I was exercising. I do not recommend this monitor if you are trying to keep a record of your fitness.
The watch died and won't charge. Had this for less than a month.
Watch does not stay connected to phone. Have to reboot watch and/or phone multiple times a day. Not dependable as a smart watch
"This thing does a good job tracking health stuff like BPM and steps taken/calories burnt. The app is pretty good and offers the ability customize the watch faces and set up some of your metrics specific to you.I was bummed with the mentioning of the GPS that it pretty much will just track your route and make it visible on your phone. I was hoping it was built in monitoring. I haven't figured out a way for it to make a tone instead of just vibrating and when I have it on for answering calls I can't just slide to answer on my phone which is kind wonky. I like it. But it's kind of just a phone support device with some on-board vitals tracking. The app works good but feels a little empty. Maybe they plan to roll out some other features down the road. I went to their website but it really doesn't have more information. The charger works well if you take the time to line it up correctly. I really like that I can play/pause music. That's handy if I am making supper and don't want to unlock my phone or adjust the volume. I thought I wouldn't like the band, and it's a little stretch but it actually looks pretty nice and is as comfortable as my regular Casio and Armitron watches. If the stated GPS provided more than just elevation information I would rank this thing higher. It will tell you the temp and weather and barometer as long as it is within a 30ft-ish distance of your phone. It's a tool to work with your phone not really a standalone device, -M-"
"The watch seems to be well built, it is solid,and the battery lasts at least a week.Pros.  Case is solid, the screen is large and bright, easy to read.It has plenty of sport and health options the blood pressure and pulse rate are very close to what the doctor gets. For the most part it is easy to set up.  And can be set for metric or imperial.Cons - mostly nit-picky. The silicone band is hard to buckle/unbuckle and hot. I will have to repce it.The Weather app looks good - but there doesn't seem to be any way to set it to the local weather.  It selects a small town about 100 miles away, and on the the other side of the mountains.  It is usually close, but I suspect during bad it will be off.The other downside it the very limited watch face selections.  I'm left choosing the best of the bad.  Some might be OK, if they they didn't gave Chinese writing and logos.  None of the faces are really appealing.  Oh, and contacting customer service has been unsuccessful so far."
"The ""5ATM Waterproof Swimming Diving"" is not something this watch can do. 5ATM means that you can be in the water UP TO 50 meters down for no more than 10 minutes before the watch starts to suffer water damage. So NO, it is not waterproof. Just water resistant."
"I like altimeter and many of the features.  The iPhone app hangs and won't sync or hangs when I try to start a workout.  Steps and distance are very inaccurate.  The GPS can take 20 minutes to activate and some days it won't activate at all. Workouts can crash and then don't save.  The app always says there is an update even when there isn't and and if there really was an update, it won't install.  Kospet and Amazatim are the same company and the same software and so don't expect either to be reliable.  Another bugaboo is a workout record won't end and then never gets saved.  Really a pisser when you think you've reached a new milestone and workout has crashed and has been lost.  I use 2 or 3 backup pedometers to gather steps, speed and distance because in GPS mode this watch will say you walked 800 feet when you know you've walked miles."
"I got this watch for my husband. He likes it, but a few days later the wrist band broke."
Worked great until I couldn’t monitor my health needs. It just stopped taking heart rate and everything else
Well i liked the watch but after about 2-3 months the rubber bands that hold the extra band down are broken off and now it sticks out.
"My friend gifted it to me. It was working fine and i was happy with the results.  One day accidentally I used it in the pool and from that day battery started malfunctioning and died after few days. I asked customer care about it and shown interest in buying the battery, but received response that they are not selling spare parts.  So i will suggest not to use watch inside the water as it is not waterproof else it is awesome.."
"I've had this watch for a few months now. It mostly worked ok at first except for loading the wrong set of contacts and there's seemingly no undoing that. Now, despite deleting and reloading the app multiple times, the app:1. Will not sync with the watch.2. Locks up every time I open it. App does not respond and I'm given the choice of waiting or closing the app.3. Limits changing the watch face. Lots of choices but doesn't allow me to change.Great step counter but not worth the trouble. Especially for what I paid."
"really poor performance. One month after having it in use, with 60% battery it turned off. I could turn it on again after many times after two days charging it.  Then,  it completely froze . After a hard power off, it started working again. The battery then went down 50% in one day. Today, no way to have the pulse rate, SpO2 working, there is an error message. Maybe it stands a truck on it, but not dayly life."
this thing would be so great if it worked but it did not and the company is not interested in fixing or replacing it.
"To Start......-Be aware, this isn't an apple watch, or a samsung galaxy watch.I say that because certain things don't integrate well, I tend to wear my watch at night because  sometimes my sleep i need the vibration of the watch to help me wake, my galaxy watch it works perfect, the tank, not so much.-Up until the most recent update (7/20/24) the watch required me to restart my phone for it to connect to the phone, once the BT connection was interrupted. It didn't matter if i walked away from my phone for a minute, or a whole day, it would not reconnect.(ok the watch made me a liar, I just tried to reverify how well it worked after the update and its doing the same BS, (7/22/24) Having to restart every time to reconnect is a HUGE fail...... and until they fix this huge issue, im knocking off 2 stars from the original 4, maybe this will get there attention....... this shouldn't be a thing, and btw im using a samsung note 20 5g, that has no connection issues with anything else.....-Just because this isn't a big name brand, doesnt mean its garbage either, the watch is really really nice.Polished UIgreat screengreat watch face optionsnice buttonsthe strap is a bit large and clunky, but it works.Nice charging baseLooks much more expensive than it is.great health tracking features, and no separate app to install just for health tracking info like samsung.The stock ring tone is annoying. (cannot find a way to change it either)I decided im keeping my galaxy watch for work stuff, and run the tank when i want a nicer fancier looking watchUntil they remedy the BT reconnection issues, Its gonna have to be a DO NOT BUY from me. IF and WHEN they fix it, i will update my review, because other than that issue, i can live with any other quirks and features....."
"BOTTOM LINE:1. I recommend this KOSPET Military Rugged Smart Watch for Men.2. The current price of ~$ is reasonable.LIKES:- Ability to answer and make calls when connected to my phone.- App doesn't connect very well. I have had some trouble getting it to stay connected to my phone.- Blood oxygen seems accurate.DISLIKES:- Band is not comfortable.- Blood pressure is not reliable, period. I ignore this feature completely."
"UPDATE 3: The watch is buggy. The Bluetooth connection dropped twice. The first time, I reestablished it by rebooting the watch. The second time, I fixed it by trying to view my contacts. Even though that fixed the Bluetooth connection, I have never been able to view my contacts.For no reason, the watch stopped recording my sleep and health metrics. I was forced to reboot my watch again.UPDATE 2: I got the GPS working today. After I waited about 3 minutes for the watch to acquire a lock, I remembered a cheap car GPS I briefly owned that would only lock if held perpendicular to the ground, so I tilted the watch until its face was 90 degrees with the ground and it locked immediately. I tracked my route simultaneously with my Samsung Watch5 Pro and the final distances were almost the same between the two watches. Additionally, the route displayed on my Tank M3 Ultra and it looked very similar to the route shown on my Watch5 Pro.When I got home, I tried to get a GPS lock with the watch face perpendicular to the ground. The Tank M3 Ultra locked in under ten seconds.I'm increasing my rating from 2 to 3 stars.UPDATE: The watch DOES sorta track naps, but naps don't appear until ten or 15 minutes after you wake up and there is no breakdown of sleep stages.. Speaking of sleep stages, they are only reported when you sleep more than three hours and the results look completely different than what I obtain with my Samsung Watch5 Pro taken at the same time. Normal sleep and naps are aggregated inconsistently. For instance, the watch claims I only slept 52 minutes yesterday, but that was a nap.As another reviewer reported, notifications do not seem to work at all. I granted the app all of the necessary permissions but I have not gotten a single notification in the four days that I've had the watch.If the watch just delivered on its basic features like the GPS, I'd give it four stars. If on top of that it had decent watch faces, I'd give it five stars, but I still cannot give it more than 2 stars.ORIGINAL REVIEWI ordered my KOSPET Tank M3 Ultra Smart Watch directly from the company, and it took about ten days for the watch to arrive in Arkansas from China.The watch was packaged well. It looks nice and feels well-made. It includes a screen protector kit, which is a welcome bonus.The OLED display is large, bright, vibrant, and generally responsive, although it occasionally lags and glitches particularly while scrolling through options. The display does not have an autobrightness feature.The watch face options are limited and those that are available are mostly goofy looking. The best watch face I found lacks basic information like battery level. The custom watch face option only allows you to set an image as the background for a preset, generic, uninspired digital display. I could not find a watch face with the moon phase or sunrise, sunset times, nor are there applets that provide this information. Watch faces for many Android phones allow customized complications, but Kospet does not. AFAIK, a watch face development kit is not available.The watch does not appear to track naps like many other smartwatches do.The most serious shortcoming of the Tank M3 Ultra is its GPS. I waited about two minutes for it to acquire a GPS signal under sunny blue skies today, but it never could obtain a lock, so I had to start disc golf anyhow. While the watch tracked my route, it reported a much farther distance than what my son's T-Rex 2 measured (3.22 miles versus 2.85 miles). Worse, when I viewed the activity on my phone, it did not show a map of my route (and a map was not available on the watch either).The watch also lacks basic features like ""track me"", where the watch will start recording your GPS path and can then route you back to the start when you choose to return.The watch has a ""Tap to measure"" feature that takes 60s and returns stress, heart rate, and blood oxygen level. These metrics can also be called up independently.Interesting features:* blood pressure: it reports believable numbers, but I have not verified them. Your blood pressure can be tracked throughout the day.* emotion: the watch reports and can record your emotional state throughout the dayBattery life seems to be much better than my Samsung Watch5 Pro but worse than my son's T-Rex 2.The silicone watch band is uninspired but functional. It was easy to attach to the watch.The watch does not support apps nor does it have local music storage. You CAN take calls through the watch though. You can also control your phones music player.All-in-all, I am disappointed by my KOSPET Tank M3 Ultra Smart Watch, primarily because its GPS support is so bad. GPS signal acquisition can take several minutes even on a sunny day when the T-Rex 2, Samsung, and Garmin watches are nearly instantaneous. There does not appear to be support for maps of your route, and the watch does not have a ""track me"" feature. I also wish there were less dorky and more functional watch faces with sunrise, sunset, moon phase, tide charts, battery level, along with heart rate, stress, and O2 meters. However, if the blood pressure tracking is accurate, that would be a big bonus.Most of these issues can be fixed with software and firmware patches, but until that time, I can give the KOSPET Tank M3 Ultra Smart Watch no more than two stars for this price, where it is about the same cost as the T-Rex 2."
This watch worked properly for about three days. First thing to go was the health applications. Checked for an update and it had the proper update. A week later after being fully charged it suddenly turned its self off and has never turned on again. Will not charge. Will not do anything. The watch is useless. Do not reccomend this watch to anyone. The app seems weel enough but with a watch that will no work the app is useless. I have watched all kinds of videos on trying to reset the watch and none will work. I will be returning this watch.
I tried to leave a three star review on the manufacturer website. Anything less than four will not post. Battery does not last as advertised. Health tracking does not work as advertised. I’m expecting it to break soon
The upper right button was lost after 5 days of normal use. It’s not a heavy duty watch at all
"It's the strangest thing. I bought this for myself but it won't read my heart rate, record my steps, etc. My husband puts it on and it begins reading his heart rate, recording steps etc like it should be. Put it back on me, nothing. It's tight enough, the app is connected, everything is done correct. I ended up giving it to him instead. I ordered a new one in hopes it will work....It's a great price and easy to use otherwise.EDIT: I figured out that it won't work on my left arm because it is tattooed!!! You will need to wear it on non-tattooed skin for it to be able to read and track things!!!"
"Amazon deleted my review for an undetermined and unspecified ""violation"" of their community guidelines, but I digress and will attempt again. This watch should be avoided if you expect for it to function as designed. The watch touts a contact sync that doesn't work properly. I have 83 contacts saved to my phone's memory. It only allows you to import 100 contacts, which is fine, if I had more I would select the most important, but when I initiated the sync, the app only pulled 31 contacts, some of which had been deleted for months. I have no idea where the app is pulling contacts from because you aren't able to specify a source location so you are stuck with only 31 sometimes incorrect (because they were already deleted out of the phone) contacts, instead of your full contact list. The app is very difficult to use and not user-friendly. It took me 2 hours to get into the app for the first time because the app would not email me a CAPTCHA code so that I could access the app. I had to force quit the app and restart the phone several times before it successfully completed this process. The app is very clunky and poorly designed, in my opinion. I would rather have an analog watch with no features that at least correctly displays the time. This watch sometimes does and other times does not. My last complaint with this watch is the unreliability of the ""raise arm to wake"" feature. I don't want to have to press a button every time that I need to see the time. So I selected ""raise arm to wake"" and it works for about 5 minutes and then the watch refuses to wake even with you holding your arm upside down over your head. The only way to get the raise arm to wake feature to resume working correctly is to toggle the feature on and off in the app, force quit the app, restart the phone, and then toggle the feature on again. This is entirely too tedious and needs to be done several times a day for the feature to continue working. Overall, the watch looks nice, the face is big and bright, and the touchscreen is very reactive which is wonderful. The watch band doesn't quite fit right, and the watch just makes up numbers for the health tracking. I wore it to bed and when I woke up it hadn't recorded my sleep and additionally had recorded over 700 steps. It is impossible for me to walk in my bed, so I concluded the watch was either egregiously inaccurate or simply displaying random numbers based on things like vibrations. Consequently, this watch falls short of the mark by several hundred yards because the advertised features don't work properly, the app is difficult and frustrating to use, and customer support is entirely less than helpful. I would not recommend this watch to a friend or a person I cared about and hope that you strongly consider your other options before making this purchase. I was deeply disappointed with my watch right out of the box and initiated a product return the very next day after I received it."
"I've always been a Fitbit person, have gone through several. When my Versa 2 finally died, I was looking for a much cheaper alternative. This fitness tracket seemed ideal. I paid $30 for it, loved the features it advertised and initally was very happy with it. The watch band is INCREDIBLY comfortable, the watch face is large, very easy to read and super easy to navigate, And it has TONS of features. I personally love using the watch to talk through. I've taken many calls when I didn't hear my phone ring or even know where it is! The battery also goes for days and days. I can usually squeeze 8 days between chargings. Now, if you use ALL the features it will drain the watch in about 4 days.My disillusionment began with the phone software. It doesn't old a candle to my Fitbit, is clunky and hard to read. And apparently the phone apps works better on iPhones than on Android. And the more I paid attention to the data being delivered I realized how truly superior the Fitbit is. Yes it cost hundreds more, but the date regarding heartrate, Oxygen level, Sleep seems spot on. This fitness tracker advised I'd been apparently running a marathon as my heartrate was in the 150 beats per minute range and I was only reading a book!As a watch and pedometer, it's very cool! As a fitness tracker I don't believe it's very good. The data it delivers regarding heart rate, sleep and oxygen level is very inacurate."
"I knew going into this that I was buying an inexpensive watch and that you get what you pay for.Well I was hoping I was paying for a quality pedometer, blood pressure/heart rate monitor and fitness monitoring.  I wanted something I could look at through out the day with reminders, that wasn't coming from my phone relying on my phone for these features was draining my battery and making people think I was distracted on my phone all the time, when I was just glancing at my numbers.The first disappointment is the battery.  I was hoping for something I could wear for a week.  Nope. I can maybe do 36 hours.  So my recommendation is, that although it says water resistant, do not wear it in the shower. Instead, get in the habit of taking it off in the shower and letting it charge for the 10-15 min you are using the bathroom.  If you do that you have enough time to charge for the day and keeping it topped off will always leave you with a day of reserve time if you are away from your charger for the night ;)The pedometer is not accurate.  I have kept the phone and watch on the same side and checked the steps. They have been off by anywhere from 600-2000+ at the end of the day.  My phone, which I expected to have less steps from leaving it on tables as I walk around the house, had more each time.  I know that my phone is actually not sensitive enough (part of why I got the watch) and misses steps.  This is my second week having it.  The first week I walked until my feet were ras because I was not hitting my step counts when I switched to mileage I soon discovered I was doing nearly 75% over what I needed because steps were missed all week.As for the other features, they hype what the watch can do with careful wording in the ads.  IT has so many ""workouts"" listed but the watch does not auto detect your workout or what you are doing. If you go in and choose a workout, then it starts clocking activity.The feature telling you to get off your butt because you are sitting too long is good.THe features in the watch to check your steps is awful. you cannot see a breakdown of what you did, just the basics."
"After some concerns with how intense exercise was affecting my heart, I needed to monitor my heartrate during times when it was elevated while cycling, walking or just relaxing. An Apple watch is overkill and too pricey and I just needed something that could give me a heartrate, tell me the time and the ability to alert and show me texts from my phone was a bonus.For $30 (at the time of purchase in Summer 2024), this seemed perfect. However, the more I used it, the more I realized just how inaccurate it was...with EVERYTHING.  When I was awake, the sleep record would show I was lightly sleeping. On a night where I barely slept, it showed that I did sleep. And when I would get my heartrate up to what my Kardia or chest trap heart monitor would show to be elevated way over 100, the watch was still showing under 100 bpm. There would be times where it was kind of accurate but it was typically 5 seconds behind my other devices and would hang on the numbers for long periods of time before adjusting up or down accordingly. It was slow.The software running on the watch is a little juvenile I feel - big solid clunky icons without any animated features, at least maybe have the heart beat as you're reviewing your heartrate or the ""Z's on the sleep record animate out - just something to give it a little interest. And the data for your sleep, heartrate and oxygen levels can't be viewed in detail. You get a very rough and static graph that you can drag your finger across to see the variables but there are so many times where I wanted to zoom in to view when values changed and how drastically within time.The texts come written in some typewriter style font - no emojis come through, making it hard to read at times. Also, I wish the text would stay on the screen until I dismiss it - I've missed so many of them when having my phone in another room. I've tried it on both wrists and had to constantly take it off because of a skin irritation.The longer I had the watch, the more frustrated I got. It's one of those pieces of hardware that so many companies use, maybe tweak the software a bit or name it something different and sell it as a completely different product but there's a ton of these out there from what it seems. My return date has passed so my money is gone...another case of ""you get what you pay for."""
"This is my third attempt at a smart watch for exercise monitoring and this is the best one so far. My biggest complaint is the user manual. It has extremely small print and pictures, does not identify the different options and icons, and is not as advertised. The ad says they have 24/7 customer support to help setup and answer any questions. I spent a lot of time searching for how to contact them and never found a phone number nor email. If you want to have to read the manual with a magnifying glass, this is one. And if you are curious to see what miniscule print looks like in other languages then this manual will entertain you.Initially I have been disappointed at how difficult it is to monitor my exercise session using this watch but at least it seems to be within 5-10% accurate on HR which the others were not. I'm guessing that unless one wants to spend a great deal of money this may be the closest to accuracy possible. Not real pleased. Still have questions but enjoying the challenges of guessing and discovery. Don't really recommend, but is the ""least lousy"" so far."
I decided I didn't want to spend too much on a smart watch. This watch was my choice.  I would not recommend it. The screen on the watch is not visible in sunlight. I can't see my progress while outside walking. The app that I added to my phone for Gloryfit had to be un-installed. It kept crashing and caused issues with my new samsung s24 ultra phone.
"I initially purchased this sports watch for my daughter so she could have something to help monitor her heart rate while working out and working at the office. The order did not arrive on time as promised and I had to order a different watch, which ended up being a better product.  I ultimately kept this watch for myself because I thought it would be great to have a new sports watch. However, after a week or so of wearing this watch I developed a rash on my wrist because the sensor was overheating and burning my skin. Otherwise, the watch was nice and has really great features. I did receive a full refund."
"Seemed to not want to sync Google contacts, just the local ones on my mom's pixel phone.  I even moved her contacts to local and still it wouldn't sync, reset watch, still same result.  She wouldn't wear it after that trouble.  Failed attempt to get my mom to wear a watch for emergencies.Looked good and was easy to set up except for the issues."
"I got this watch to teach yoga with mostly for the time and timer. You can't set your own timer you can only choose from the times already there. When it comes to the stopwatch - it pauses any time I touch the watch so I can't use it for classes. The calories can't be right - I took an hour hot yoga class and it said I only burned 60 calories, there is no way. When I work my apple watch to hot yoga it told me almost 500 calories. It fits well and looks and keeps a charge for a while which is good. However I don't love the functions, it doesn't work anything like an apple watch and I wouldn't buy this again."
Sleep tracking is not accurate. Sometimes it doesn’t work at all and sometimes it doesn’t get the number of hours slept correct.When it works it’s great..Photo was from last night when I fell asleep at 10:30 pm not 1:30 am and actually had almost 8 hours of sleep
"You can get a refurb Galaxy Watch for twice the price, but that has many times more smart watch goodness."
"It would be challenging for me to set up. I returned the one I bought for me, but I kept the second one I bought for my nephew that I know he would successfully set up (he is in his 20's). My nephew I think, would love all the functualities."
"I'll update this, but so far not impressed.A huge part of getting a watch like this was vibration on my wrist at work to keep on top of coworkers texting me. This has been hit or miss, and that is with my phone in my pocket, so it isn't a distance issue.The weather, as far as I can tell, does not update automatically at all. I have to go to the app and drag down to sync. At that point it is easier just to look at my weather app.Heart rate seems accurate - unfortunately I can't test the step counting function due to breaking an ankle immediately after buying this, but I'm am hopeful that the fitness aspects are at least reliable."
"Smart Watch has all features as advertised and a large face. However, as mentioned in other reviews, the interface with my Android is almost non existent. My android paired with the Smart Watch but most functions still don't work and i keep getting msg ""bluetooth disconnected"". My android clearly indicates that bluetooth is on.My biggest frustration is that the advertisement on Amazon is very clear that mfgr has 24/7 product support but doesn't give any contact information. A search online gives me a UAE overseas Smart Watch Repair business. There is no USA contact nbr for the mfgr. So basically i can't set the date/time on the watch because the Gloryfit app won't provide access to Smart Watch, even though my android indicates that the Smart Watch has been paired.  I purchased the unit to primarily monitor my vitals. While it performs a couple of functions, the longest i can turn the screen on is 15 secs, per setting on Smart Watch, the  screen then goes black and i have to reactivate. I've deleted the app twice and reinstalled but with same result. Wish i had paid more to get a product with local support. The back of the pkg the Smart Watch came in has a contact name and email for someone in China. I reached out to that contact a week ago but no response."
"I like a lot about this watch. It looks good, feels good, has a nice screen. But I could never get the ""quick reply"" function to work at all. The sleep tracking was weird. It would keep tracking sleep sometimes for an hour after I was up. Decent product but don't expect too much from it."
"I liked the size of the watch, the face of it was big. The screen would go black very quickly. I was able to connect my phone calls only. I couldn’t get the text messages to show up on my phone. I tried everything, emailed company, watched videos, googled it. Nothing, no reason why it shouldn’t have work. This was very frustrating, as this was the only reason I wanted the watch. Ended up buying an Apple Watch."
Have to charge watch daily
Had one before around same price that was more responsive.  The screen on this one is not touch friendly and it doesn't allow much screen time. Probably to save the battery. The old one lasted days longer.
It’s been a couple days wearing this and so far I like that I can change the picture to one of my own and it’s pretty light on my wrist. It does not count steps correctly. Went for a two mile jog and it only counted around 660 steps. Still exploring options but I really got it to log workouts and steps and so far it’s not counting steps correctly.
Works good for lots of things but cannot get the voice optiont to work. No support online or tutorials to look at either
"Update: I returned the watch. Two days ago, the app indicated that I was in a deep sleep for 16 hours (I wasn't) and then this morning it said I had slept for almost nine hours when I actually slept about 5. This plus the other issues made it pretty useless for what I wanted from it, which was mainly to track my fitness and wellness.The watch has a nice look and is fairly comfortable to wear. I purchased it mainly to track steps and fitness, and I'm finding the step counter to not be very accurate, plus there's no way to add in any other types of fitness such as cycling. There are many different types of sports listed, but as far as I can see, they can only be timed and the activity isn't saved. The sleep monitor is also inaccurate. Today it indicated that I got up 20 minutes later than I actually did. The user manual is pretty useless since the typeface is so small. I don't use it for calls or texting, so I can't comment on that. I'm glad I paid just $29 for it."
"Being 78 yrs old, my sight is  not that great but I do love being able to read this.  I am disappointed that the phone app only has the settings on it.  I was hoping to  find a log on it to give me a history of my oxygen and pulse and steps. so that I can print them out for the doctor, but it did not.  My biggest  disappointment was how easily the glass got scratched.  I'm not very active and in fact I am somewhat handicapped because I am recovering from a broken leg and broken shoulder.  Being that my shoulder is broken, my range of motion is limited which happens to be the arm the watch is on.  I have no idea how it got scratched so easy.  Poor quality.  I would have returned this watch, but I already threw away the box for it."
"I’ve used this watch for 2 weeks and a half. It works so-so… at first.. The step count is questionable. My iphone step counts are over 1k/2k more than what the watch says. One time as I was jogging and checked my steps it wasn’t even budging. I had to hold down the button to restart it for the steps to work again. The watch connects to my phone calls and contacts fine, but not my text messages. The hours of sleep only worked a few times, but most nights it recorded I didn’t sleep at all when I know I’ve slept. It connected to my music playlist fine at first until it glitched.  I had 8K steps in but then it disconnected and reconnected and all of a sudden I’m down to 6k steps and then it won’t let me scroll over to the other functions like heartbeat, music, ect. It’ll freeze and power off. I’ve tried holding down the button to reset but it’s still glitching. Welp, ya get what ya pay for I guess. I would not recommend this. Nope."
"It says it connected to sync contacts messages, apps , but it not connecting to smartphone"
User interface is a little clumsy. Had some trouble picking up my HR. Sleep tracker seemed to work good.  Bang for buck not bad.
I cannot wear the watch for long periods of time.  It caused a rash on the arm.
"Once set up, its functions are ok. My IT person was able to sync w/ my phone swiftly."
I have had this watch less than a week and it is already not working properly. It has missed the last two nights of sleep. It will randomly stop monitoring throughout the day. It was worth the $29 I paid to just be a watch. I wouldn’t rely on the health monitoring part. I have walked over 1k steps since waking up and the watch did not track any of them. It is frustrating but I guess you get what you pay for. If you want accurate health monitoring spend more and get something else.
"Battery life is the only good thing. The heart rate monitor, weather display, and notification delivery are all inaccurate. I've missed several text notifications and other notifications I have synced via in the app. There arent as many watch faces as advertised and the custom face option is lacking. There are very few other customizations to make the watch's many tools and features user friendly. Im returning this to get something more reliable"
Works well but I can't get the app to work with other health apps
Works fine and is priced right for the product.
Answers call and clarity pretty well. But I purchased to track fitness. I’ve done at least 1200 steps and it’s like it maxed at 575. Wiped it off. Put it back on it counted another 50 or so steps and stopped again
"Don’t know what the deal is here, but there is a grand total of 68 watch faces in the app. Way less than half of usual number of faces in GloryFit app. Not sure if I’ll keep it or not. Not happy!!!!!! Very large and not comfortable also."
"If you paid more than 30usd for this, you have been scammed. It works as a mini smart phone on your wrist, ie, you can answer your phone and play music through a cheap speaker, check your texts, and send pre-written replies. It has a flashlight and a calculator. It tells the time. Does what your phone does but on your wrist and worse.If you want something to track literally anything, steps, calories, heart rate, any of those fitness watch based functions, look elsewhere. The watch itself loses connection constantly, and the app crashes constantly, meaning you're going to me missing huge chunks of time in your readings and they're not going to be accurate, even if the tech inside was accurate, which is doubtful for the price. I spent an extra 20 dollars on a watch from a different brand and it actually works. Don't waste your time here."
The instructions are hard to read because very small. The heart BPM is not accurate and there is no guide for the various applications. Example: how do you delete items from the call log.
"I have had this smartwatch for 3 months now. I am not sure how it has such high reviews. I bought it to track my steps, sleep and heart rate and it is completely inaccurate. It is constantly 1-3 thousand steps shorter than what my Apple health tracks. It frequently does not pick up on my sleep cycle at all or only tracks half of my nights sleep. Yes it’s inexpensive but a waste of money in my opinion. Pay more for a reliable one. I have since bought a Fitbit."
The watch is great however the charger stopped working and I had to order another. And still cant find the correct charger
"I keep having to try and find ways daily to make it record my steps, sleep tracking and heart monitoring. It's frustrating."
"I bought 2 watches. One still works attached to IOS app.  The other was paired with Android. Much more difficult to get operational and functions / screens have been going away. It tells time ok, but it looses connection with the phone and does not show the correct time, weather, or messages. Manual sync is necessary to see any statistics from the watch."
"The app keeps failing????It looks nice when it does work, it does what it's supposed too"
Clock faces  do not has it.  Phone contacts do not work.
Good value and large screen. Trouble answering and making calls
Unfortunately it doesn't read calorie burn accurately!
"Just the same old AliExpress watch rebranded for the 100th time. It requires a sketchy app in order to be functional, you cannot set any preferences or even the time without using the app. The app feels like bloatware at best, spyware at worst. The heart rate monitor is not just inaccurate, it's not even trying. It reads my resting heart rate as 50, which is about 20bpm lower than it is. When I'm jogging it reads 90-110 when I'm actually around 160-170. The lift sense is calibrated to light up the face when it becomes level, not when you lift it, it will turn on randomly and unprompted. The strap is cheap, it will likely need to be replaced within 6 months."
Can’t  figure out how to reset the home page. No amount of clicks will work.
For $39.99 this watch feels very cheap and not very good quality 😕 It is very light and poorly made.
"Tried to wear facenin inner wrist. Substantial skin irritation and scratching resulted, mostly from wearing as I slept, I think."
"I like this smartwatch. It has a large, easy to read face and it mostly does what I need it to do. However, it isn't easy to connect via Bluetooth to my Samsung phone. The only way I can get it to pair is to uninstall GloryFit, then reinstall it. I have to do this every day, so I don't have a history of my data. The product description mentions that they offer product support, but has no information about how to contact the company. I couldn't find a website for UAUE either."
"The watch is very very cool but my main reason for getting it was for running. Although I did a 4 mile route, it said I had gone 2 miles. The pace calculator was WAY off also. While waterproof, if running in the rain, touchscreen won’t work."
After a month it started acting up. I now have to push the bottom sometime three times for it to show the time but in bed if I roll over it show real easy. Haven’t heard back from the seller. I wish I had spend at least a little more. Do not buy!
Didn’t really have it long.  It would never stay lit long enough to learn and experiment with features.
"I was excited to get this watch with the great reviews, but................... I cannot for the life of me get it to show up as two devices under my bluetooth.  The sleep function doesn't work either.  Not sure if that has anything to do with the second device not showing up.  The watch doesn't light up when I lift my hand.  Very disappointed with this watch.  I have been on the internet trying to figure it out for a week!  I have uninstalled and reinstalled, reset it, rebooted it and nothing works.  I am done with this thing.  The face is clear and has alot of functions, but I can't use the ones I wanted the most.  Returning it!"
"Large bright clear face. Fairly easy to set up. Overall, its a good buy for the money"
I lose connection. I use the step counter daily and it’ll stop counting even when I have my phone on me.
Let me start off by saying I'm 57 and pretty good with technology. I find it difficult to navigate and the app that it's connected to isn't that great either. I only paid $30 so I'm fine with that but much more and I'm out.
"It looks good, it has a lot of promise, but it’s pretty temperamental a lot of the times. I have to reboot it at least a couple of times each day. I find the instructions that came with it very inferior in telling me what the watch is supposed to be able to do. my advice: bite the bullet and get an Apple Watch, which is what I am doing."
Doesn't hold charge very long
"Good replacement watch from my old fitbit. The alarm sounds are a plus and very loud. The size of the watch is great and allows you to read without squinting and isn't very heavy at all. I can get my email notifications on it but I'm not a big fan of how they come across. I was able to read them on my fitbit and this watch only allows the subject to show. The setup was simple and easy to do. At first the Bluetooth connected without issue and after the 1st day, I continuously have to reconnect it and sometimes this takes patience. I would recommend it as a backup but will be upgrading to another name brand sooner than I expected."
"I received this watch last week and just opened one of the boxes this weekend. I was excited to start using it for my MoveQuest activity tracker. The watch was on sale, so I purchased 2 of them. If you mine MQT, then you know why I purchased 2 watches. Unfortunately, the app would not send the access code to my email and I was never able to setup the watch after the GloryFit app was installed. I uninstalled the watch's GloryFit app multiple times over the period of 2 days without having any success. The instructions were vague, incomplete, in poorly written English, and too super tiny to read. I had to use my phone to take pics and enlarge the instructions. Once in a while, the watch would receive signals from my phone, even though the watch showed that the Bluetooth was disconnected. I wish I read the few 1 and 2-star reviews before I purchased the watches. But, there were so many 4 and 5-star reviews, that I thought this watch was safe to buy. I was never able to set the date or time. Unfortunately, I will have to return the watches and buy a Samsung watch to use with my Samsung S21 phone. I am extremely disappointed with this product. I am sorry that I let the low price influence my decision to buy. Go headache-free and spend the extra money... buy a Samsung watch to pair with your Samsung phone. The GloryFit app and the UAUE T60 watch have too many issues."
"Cool watch, nice features. I bought 2 and my watch kept connecting to my mom’s phone. Unfortunately it wasn’t the watch she wanted and we couldn’t fix it after multiple attempts. The other was fine but we wanted matching watches. Returned them both."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Oh please the instructions are so tiny you can’t even read them.  You have to more or less figure it out for yourselves.  You have to have your own plug to charge it.  It does not come with the outlet plug.  The strap is giving me a rash. It’s constantly wet underneath because it makes you sweat.  Not impressed with it at all.
"Cute, but doesn't hold a charge. I've had other off brand watches before but I've never had one that has the be charged every 7 days.  Finally lost patience but now it's too late to return."
So I've set time and measurements to US Standards and it still shows kgs and 24hr. Then to boot....it continues to disconnect from Bluetooth. My app won't show any details or progress and if I reset I lose ALL my data to date. Very very frustrating. Guess you get what you pay for. Not even worth returning. I'll buy an American and give this to my 8yo
"I've had this watch for about 10 weeks and it is very low quality. 1.) The gyroscope within the watch that is responsible for turning the clock on when you turn your wrist over stopped working after the first week.2.) The sleep feature which is responsible for accurately indicating how long you were asleep for is 100% inaccurate. It either tells you that you slept an hour longer than you actually did or in the case where I knew that I slept at least 12 hours after being up for 30, it told me that I was asleep for 93.) The stopwatch feature doesn't reset the lap time So you're forced to subtract one lap from the next in order to figure out how fast the lap before actually was. Very annoying.The only 2 good things about this watch that I have come to find is that the battery is quite good And it's pretty comfortable. So if all you want Is a watch that tells time accurately and feels good then it's okay"
Bought this junk for my wife  lasted  for about  three months now I can't even get it to connect to my phone  and my phone won't even recognize it
"UPDATE: After seeing my review, the seller contacted me to refund my money or send me a new watch. I had already returned the watch, so they offered me an Amazon gift card. The response was quick and receipt of the digital gift card was quick. They seemed eager to help me resolve my issue.I purchased this item a few weeks ago. At first, I was excited because it was working nicely. However, I started noticing a few things that were amiss.1. The display didn’t always come on when I lifted my watch.2. The step count and distance recorded were much lower than actual numbers.3. The heart monitor doesn’t consistently collect data, even when it’s selected.4. The watch face is quite large for my small wrist. I would’ve dealt with that, but with all the issues, I will be retuning the watch. It kept the time and that’s about it."
Worked well at first but quickly started to lose battery life and became very inaccurate. Wish I could get a return.
The watch does not record my steps accurately.
My pulse was not detected many times.
No user manual
"The watch is well made. Good display, light weight and functionable. But the main thing missing is the ability to provide accurate biometric readings. Unfortunately it cannot do. The heart rate monitor is horrible and gives random bogus readings. I would not recommend it if you want it for tracking body measurements."
Wish it would work with other apps but..
Easy to set up but you can't change the ring tone and the vibration doesn't really change. Not getting message notifications even though I have it turned on. So would not be worth it at $100 for sure and not sure about the $40 either. Would not recommend it to anyone there are much better ones out there.
I bought this for myself thinking it would be nice to know my steps and have all that technology had to offer.I returned it the next day. It was hard to figure out and the wrist band was very cheap looking and easy torn in my opinion. For a heavy watch like that - you need a strong band.
"I've had this watch for almost 2 weeks and today it simply stopped counting steps earlier. Even the Apple Iphone steps counter is listing over 7K steps and I haven't had my phone with me all day. It should be close to 10K at this time. Really sad, I was enjoying the watch, but without the step counting, it's useless to me. Earlier today I walked for almost an hour, and it counted 10 steps."
"I like the look and the comfort, but I don't think its designed to be worn consistently for long periods.  I am not not happy with the fact that I have to press the button several times before it will even light up to show the time. And the battery lights just blink for no reason like it's too hot after being worn all day."
"The watch was good in the beginning at tracking and workouts however it has started to have a very low battery life, charging almost everyday and today it decided not to pick up my steps or workouts.  Sending this back!"
"Doesn’t work as described after 2 months of use, not tracking sleep, training doesn’t start time anymore. But the watch works to tell time at least, for now"
"The watch itself would have been a very good watch if it would have connected to all of my contacts. It did not connect to all of my contacts but only about a fourth of them. Try multiple times to reset and changed all of my settings. But nothing did the trick. If you are not using this for messages or phone calls, then I would totally buy. But the whole reason I bought this watch was because of the calling features and texting features."
"Beautiful watch, soft band, nice color, but, unable to link/pair with my phone, not sure if it was my phone or smartwatch. I have a Pixel 7a, tried to trouble shooting, called Amazon  customer service, representative was not able to find a contact number, rep also tried several trouble shooting options and unable to resolve my issues. had to return the device.I really feel the combination of my phone and device together is not compatible. My google phone has been a problem since day one. Google has the worst customer service dept for mobile . I had to leave a message with another dept for my issue, they in turn sent a email to cs dept. It took 3 weeks for a email response. That is unacceptable. Stay away from google phones. there are some nice features a positive for Google, but more negatives. I only mentioned this, because I really wanted the watch.  I guess I could of tried contacting Google to help me pair my smartwatch, but my return time frame could of expired before I received a response from Google."
"Only kept this smartwatch for a couple of weeks. It simply did not record accurately. If you really need a smartwatch at dirt cheap prices, and you don't care about performance - this one works. If you want quality, find a different smartwatch."
"Tracking my steps, sleep, don't like that I have to charge it continuously, every 2 or 3 days."
I purchased this watch based on the reviews and the cost. Unfortunately This watched works off & on. It started off okay then I realized it stopped tracking my steps so I had turn it off & on a couple of times to get it to reset. I wish my window to return was still available I’ve only had it 2 months
"It works but you get what you pay for. It feels cheap, but it works for what it is. If you want a smartwatch but have limited budget it works and looks nice but has very limited functions but overall decent for the mone"
I do not like this watch because everytime I have to charge the watch it disconnects the bluetooth and I can not use the features on the watch.  I have to pair and repair it with my phone and some times that does not work. It is real frustrating.
"I wanted a watch that could more accurately count my daily steps, since my phone is not always in my pocket. It stays stuck in the 300s most days and is way off from the count on my phone. Not sure if it can be fixed but basically a waste of money so far. The ability to answer calls, change music, etc. on the watch is pretty cool though."
"It charges well, the appearance is modern, and the fit is right. I wouldn't say I liked how the watch band launched. But my problem with this watch and why I've sent it back is the inaccurate sleep recording and o2 level. I have sleep apnea, and it's important for me and my health to track my sleeping and o2 levels. Everything else seemed to be fine."
"Time and Battery life are great! Beyond that, not worth much!  Temperature is WAY off! 101 degrees now and watch says 87!  Step count is somewhat accurate. Several times, when I first put watch on, I would walk from the kitchen into the living room and it still shows no steps? Heart rate is off. I walk at very fast pace and through big hills and it would show my heart rate at 78! Time to go back to Fitbit!!"
Just one day is use so far and it's not tracking steps  correctly. I'm wearing it with my Fitbit. And it's over 3000 step difference. Which will be more at the end up the day. I don't know if I'm wearing it wrong or if it's defective. I only bought it because of the price. It is a nice watch but so far very disappointed with the step tracking
Not only did I find this difficult to install I could not find a camera or recorder. That is the reason I bought it. Buyer beware.
"I purchased this watch after my Versa 2 died. The reviews gave me hope that this was a good fitness tracker/smart watch for a great price ($29.99). I charged it immediately and planned to set it up as soon as it was fully charged - then I saw the instructions. The print was so tiny that I had a flashlight and magnifying glass to attempt to read it. The instructions were written by someone for whom English is a 2nd, 3rd, or 10th language. I tried my iPhone camera, but the print became very grainy when I enlarged it enough to attempt to read it. I got the gist that I needed to download an APP called Glory Fit as the interface. That's when I realized that this was not a good product. The reviews for this app are horrible. If I would have looked at these reviews before I read the Amazon reviews, I would have never ordered this device. This watch way overestimated my steps as well. I returned it and purchased a Fitbit Inspire and I love it."
"I like this watch, but it does not keep the steps that I should be getting accurately"
Do not expect a lot from this product it doesn't track heart rate well. The text on the screen is something from an 80's computer. Sure you can read text messages but it's not very good. The apps in it are clunky at best. All in all I regret purchasing this product and would rather ha ed saved my money for another actual smart watch from a reputable company. You get what you pay for.
"Step count not accurate, sleep monitor doesn't work, and text sometimes come through but most of the time don't. Going to use for work watch, but if your looking for a good smart watch this is not the one"
"I bought this on sale for a great price however it’s not worth the price I paid. Within the first month, it didn’t sync so I had to let the battery die to get it to sync. It did sync however once the return time passed that I could return it, this happened with greater frequency and started not syncing for days at a time. Most recently, it gave me credit for 1142 steps for 3 days even though I was producing a tradeshow during those days and the average steps for those days are normally above 20,000 steps. It was just frozen. When it unfroze, it reset to zero for a day before it started capturing my steps accurately. I haven’t had it for 5 months yet and am looking to purchase something else. Please don’t waste your money."
I'm use to a apple watch so I might be expecting better performance but this watch is very slow reaction time but it keeps time well.
"The product itself isn't so bad, but the app that we had to use wasn't the greatest. There were times that the watch wouldn't automatically connect to my son's phone and the app wouldn't even pull up all of his contacts."
"i've had these for about five months now to replace my last pair of headphones that were reeking with debris causing my outer ears to itch and get inflamed with eczema. however, the sound quality on those headphones were far more superior than these.these work pretty good if you're on the go, but they're not great for me, as a person who works with production and music software. there's not much bass or immersive sound in these headphones, and we can't excuse the price because i've had insanely great sound quality with headphones for cheaper.the equalizer choices make no genuine difference and i have to keep it on ""pop"" as it's the most tolerable choice to use, but the lack of bass and the fuzziness makes it a pretty dry headphone brand.the good side is that it's a pretty fast charge, and you can pair the headphones on more than one device, but the piss-poor features are disappointing."
"I bought two of these, and they were pretty cheap at the time, hence why I bought them. First use of the first one and we noticed a big delay in the audio output when using Bluetooth connection. The module on the PC is brand new and uses BT5.1. We tried it with the phone that uses BT5.0, same delay. Then we tried the other set, tried it with a PC that has BT4.0, and another PC that has BT5.2, and a phone that has BT5.1, same delay across the board. And it isn't a small one, it's pretty big. You can actually tell the audio is not synced with the video when you are watching. And in games it's even more dramatic, you literally can't play a game like Geometry Dash where some levels have music-based pace. They have no delays over the 3.5mm connection, it is strictly with Bluetooth. This is a fundamental flaw in the design. For those concerned, the delay is somewhere between 200-400ms, YOU WILL NOTICE IT.The audio quality is OK at best. The range is pretty narrow and there is sometimes too much bass or treble. Some songs just sound bad on these. Luckily I have another set that I paid over $100 for and I use that for most of my daily use. So now I only use this set to listen to podcasts while doing something else.They are comfortable to wear, so the design is good, and the build quality overall is pretty good.If I'm being honest, if I knew there was such a big delay I would not have bought them, not even for the price I paid when they were on a 60% discount. I'm barely comfortable giving 3 stars and would give 2 at best if I paid full price. And if the delay was not there, I would rate them solidly at 4, even for the full price. Yes, that's how irritating the delay is."
"Good buy, sounds greatThe power switch is touchyMake sure they are in fact OFF when your not using them"
Instructions are very small to read and difficult to follow up lol
"The volume controls are very bad, you have hold them to make the volume go down and you don’t even have control on how loud or quiet you want it to be specifically. Additionally when you use the volume buttons it automatically starts playing the music or video for you. The pause buttons are also a problem, it has a deep if you press it."
"I bought a pair of these headphones on sale for around 14$ and they sound good however, I have to connect them to any device twice. The first time it connects right away but everything sounds staticky, so I disconnect then reconnect and everything is fine. This makes using them annoying but hey it works the second time every time."
First and foremost these are inexpensive headphones so don't expect Bose sound. Fairly comfortable to wear and decent power up time. I don't notice much difference in the 6 EQ choices. I use them on my desk PC.
"My use was for a long haul flight. I did not expect the head phones to preform but, they more then exceeded. Highly recommend this headset! A value for the price."
I have ear problems and they give me a headache and ear pain if I use them just to watch a movie. I have others similar and I had no issues.
"Unfortunately, I had a slight problem in understanding how to activate the headphones; found instructions to be unclear and not through."
"They are not life changing,  middle of the road 🎧s-- they do there job,  sound airtight----"
Sound quality is pretty poor but they still work for some cheap headphones
Because it is too small for
Okay for the price I suppose but absolutely zero noise cancelling.  Also quite large even when I have them on the smallest setting and I would say I have an average size head.  My husband has a giant melon head and they fit him well on the smallest size.
"The noise cancellation is not really a thing, but I already expected that from experience with other headphones of this time. Same with the EQ modes. If there is any real difference, it is outside the hearing range of most humans. Maybe kids can tell? Don't know. The sound quality is average, the battery life is not as long as claimed. It says 65 hours playtime - that's 2.7 days. But even without consistent play, after fully charging, they turned off at about half that - 39 hours.The bluetooth is not too great either, but again, that is par for the course with cheaper brands. The connection almost never auto-connects when it is turned on, and often you have to remove the device from the bluetooth catalog and re-add them in order to get them to work. I don't know if that is a problem with the devices themselves or just bluetooth in general. But it doesn't seem to be a problem with every device. I also couldn't get the simultaneous two-device connection feature to work properly. And there were no instructions for that.I can't complain too much given the price. Everything else was as advertised despite the cheap feel of the product. However, the one thing I would complain about is the power and volume buttons. They are very hard to identify and distinguish from one another while wearing the headset. You either have to feel around for a bit, or just take them off to adjust them."
"Bought 2. One for travel/work laptop. The 2nd one for home.  The first one, paired and works great.  Connected everytime I turn on the laptop and sound quality is good.The 2nd one for home. Paired and connected fine to 3 USB Bluetooth dongles. After a while I noticed the sound would get stuttery and robotic. I rebooted and same. I would swap out the next Bluetooth Dongle on my desktop. It would connect fine then start all over again. Same with the 3rd adapter.  2 BT adapters were BT5.0 and 1 BT 4.0.  I then used a spare earbud BT on all 3 and worked flawless."
"The paltry tiny print instructions weren't clear on how to set up the headphones. Should have stated clearly in big letters that the headphones have to be fully charged and manually turned on before attempting to pair via Bluetooth. Also, the button to be used for the equalizer is poorly designed and doesn't make it clear when a specific choice is made. Finally, it sounds good for awhile, then the sound quality decreases. Might be due to a poor connection via the aux jack and the audio device or a problem with Bluetooth. Not sure if I'll keep these."
Did last long had to charge after 4 hours
"audio bleeds even when low music is playing. need to turn it up pretty high to get decent audio. flexible band. ear cups are comfy. ai voice is annoying and modes are unnecessary but work ig? you cant turn up the volume on the headphones, + is to skip song, - is to go back a song. also cant pause, it just activates siri."
"If you want to use these headphones for live monitoring, forget it!!  These headphones have in the order of 250ms+ delay which makes them impractical for live recording or doing podcasts.  They are OKfor listening music or watching videos but other than that they are not that good.  For talking live they are probably adequate as long as you accept that there is a delay.Sound quality is OK.  The bass is a bit lacking but you can use the EQ to boost on the headphones or your computer.  The Built in EQ’s are pre-set so there's no manual adjustment but they are adequate for most types of listening.The headphones stow well and seem to last a long time on one charge.  I’ve never had them run out on an 8 hour session so that’s good but I don’t have them on load so who knows.  They are comfortable and close your ears off well.Value is good for the price but you get what you pay for in quality of sound."
"Not really impressed by the sound quality, if you are looking for a very clear or clean sound quality, if you are someone who loves to hear the instruments etc... you'll need to spend a little bit of money. I owned a Sony headphones in the past, was about $60, even though it wasn't Sony's best headphone but the quality was very impressive. For this one I will say it's an Okay sound quality, value for money. But I like the bass. I will keep it anyway, I give it 3 stars just because it got good bass sound, the material doesn't look cheap, and value for money."
The sound is off when it starts the voice seems to be broken-up and then is connected the volume is good no super high just that I don’t think that it would last 😬
"I should have known better. Like the guy said in the product video, these headphones are not top quality. He was trying to minimize expectations. The sound is a 3 out of 5. I cycled through all the sound settings on the headphones, and they all gave very muffled vocals. It sounds like the vocals are coming from the bottom of a well...Are these good for kids who might lose or break them - yes.  Is the price right - yes.Just beware - the overall quality is a 3- not terrible- not great."
"Have bought several cheap wireless headphones on Amazon, and most of them broke fairly quickly. This one, at least, seemingly cannot be destroyed. Its metal band that crosses the top of your head and holds the ear speakers in place does not swivel, so it doesn't break easily. That's the good part.The bad part is, I've had cheaper (but less durable) headphones that sounded a lot better. I like to go to sleep listening to podcasts, and this one won't snap and break, like a lot of others.But I miss the sound quality of others I've owned. Will keep this cheap one to sleep in, and another, different one for times when I want to really seriously want  listen to music when not in bed."
"Easy to pair to the phone. Sound is OK, I just used it for audiobooks at the gym and it is very unimpressive. As a woman with…apparently a small head (??), the pads don’t really fit very well over my ears to create a seal. It’s fine, but the fit is a little too big either with the seal of the earphones themselves and/or the headband size over my head. I think these are a better fit for a man than a woman. Volume was fine, not very loud. They are light. I walked several feet away and they didn’t lose connection with phone. They fold up which is helpful. Come without a travel bag or anything. I feel meh about them, they’re nothing special."
"I loved everything about these headphones. But suddenly after 6 months, they started suddenly disconnecting from the devices and whenever I try to repair again, I have to “forget device and pair again.” But then it kept saying they aren’t inrange while the blinking is still on. Maybe their ended after 6 months? I am not sure."
"These headphones were great at first. The battery life was as long as claimed, maybe even longer. The sound quality was good, not perfect but better than expected for the price.However, it has been only two weeks and they've already broken. The speakers are crunchy and barely play. The microphone doesn't even pick up my voice anymore. I have treated them gently and taken care of them and they have not gotten wet or been carelessly handled, yet they still failed. They just stopped playing sound properly.This is the last time I trust a cheap pair of headphones."
"I bought a pair of these a few weeks ago and love them. They're cheap, lightweight, sound good, work well, and have a long battery life. So I bought another pair for my wife.I just got off the phone with her while she was wearing them and oh my god the microphone picks up EVERYTHING IN A 50 FOOT RADIUS. I mostly couldn't hear what she was saying because of the music Walmart was playing in the background. A family walked past her and I heard their conversation just as well as hers. I've never heard a microphone in any kind of earbuds or headphones have the same effect. And it made me realize that, whenever I'm in a meeting with these on, and anyone in my family opens the door to get something and silently walks back out, my coworkers have been treated to every single detail in HD."
"I was going to return these because of the sound quality, especially the booming bass but for the low price, I will keep them around as an in case backup.- Fairly comfortable- Easily adjustable- Clean sound but somewhat flat and the bass is bit boomy- I don't notice much, if any, sound change using the EQ button for different genres of music- Main control buttons on the right side are difficult to  feel.  The buttons should be raised higher and spaced further apart.- Battery seems to last long as advertised"
Loved these headphones at first then after 11 months at times they refuse to even come on so prepare for these headphones to frustrate you
These were too tight and I have a smaller head!  Returned without issue so company must be ok.
I've owned these all of 2 months and they stopped working. The power button only works occasionally and I have to try several times to get the buttons to perform the correct function.Disappointed because otherwise they were really comfortable.
They're cute and will work for the price point. Just don't expect much.
"Don't buy these, unless all you want is to listen to music on your phone.This was the only perfect thing that I think these headphones can do.Making phone calls:  It makes calls with voice activation.  The cold sound really clear and and the person on the other line assures me that you can sound slightly muffled but can be heard.BUT When you accept a call or are transferred during a call, you cannot hear that person, at all. They can hear you but that is all. Also, after about an hour of talk time, the headphones  may lose connection for half a second only to connect again but have horrible horrible static. Listening to music: This was the only thing I super loved about these headphones.  There was nothing uninterrupted or garbled about this this part. Don't expect amazing bass or amazing noise cancelation. It is what it is. It has better sound than just ear buds that you have to push into your ear to make out sound sometimes. But that's my experience. Pairing to a Bluetooth ready TV: It doesn't work. You need an an adapter. Well, they do pair but the sound is terrible. It sounds static-y for 10 seconds at a time but if you can put up with that then I guess it's OK as backup headphones when your regular headphones die. Also, you have to completely disconnect from the TV to hook it backup to your phone or the phone will not recognize the headset, and visá versa.  And when you do reconnect you have to go into pairing mode, again, it will automatically start with high volume. The volume buttons do not work when you hit them one at a time. You have to hold down the button and possibly go past the volume that you wanted. So, just don't buy these. Maybe they were faulty and I got a bad pair but they are actually pretty flimsy. The rotation on the the cup flails around.  If the sound quality had been fine, regarding the connections, I imagine they would have been broken in 8 months time or so. At least for me, because I definitely use them on a daily basis.. Going to return these though. At least they charged well and seemed to last for a long time before needing a new charge."
Hard connect to my IPhone.  i kept having to reset both my phone and headset.
They were working great but they broke easily
"I bought these to cancel out outside noises. Background noises are still present but to a lesser degree. Muted to a certain degree, but still present. I kept these headphones because they were cheap and I was still able to reduce noise. So it did serve my purpose to a degree."
"i liked them at first but after a few days they started having this weird issue where the audio would constantly be distorted. feels like i'm in a horror movie. this is easily fixed by disconnecting and reconnecting the headphones, but it is extremely annoying to have to do that for these headphones to work properly."
Headphones were sooooo loose and I know if I move around a bit they’d need to be readjusted on my head.  They were overall pretty good but any headphones I have need to be snug enough to not move.  Sent them back.
The plastic from the body keeps falling after using for 7/8 months. There are some technical issues with the sound too when connected to laptop. Sound quality and features are good for this price range.
Stopped charging for some reason. Got a mew cord and nothing
"I have a large head and these phones were too small and hurt my ears. For this reason, I had to return them"
"I can spend weeks without charging it, I love it! The bad thing is that it doesn’t not cancel sound so you can hear your surroundings. In order to listen your music better you have to rise the volume to the max which is awkward because other people near will listen what you’re listening as well. This are my first headphones, before that I used to wear EarPods. If I would have know the noise canceling was a bid deal I’d have spent more in a better quality headphones"
"I have ended up not using these headphones as I can't control the volume, turn on and off with the tiny controls."
"They’re cute and pretty comfortable, I’ve enjoyed using these often over the last several weeks. The problem is, I bought these in August, and now (mid November, just 2 months later), the Bluetooth will not pair to my iPhone anymore. This happened randomly. They’re in great condition, I’ve never dropped them or anything, they’re fully charged but won’t connect to my phone. What the hell. Tried “forgetting device” and then re-pairing, didn’t work. I’m pretty tech savvy so I’m surprised they wouldn’t connect. A bummer for sure."
"So these sound OK for cheap headphones. I would not say amazing or even great. The buttons are super... annoying. You can't find them by touch as you can barely feel them and If you do find them using them is annoying as well. A single click on the volume up or down does not change the volume as you would expect but instead changes the track. You have to hold them down to change volume, exactly opposite of what you are used to doing. To power on or off you hold the power button down for what seems like forever. The EQ modes are pretty bad, and unfortunately they did not include a defeat or flat mode. I would not buy these again even for the price."
Charges pretty quick but doesn't hold a charge if unused so it drains all by itself. Too late to return.
"I normally don't buy super-cheap audio products, but I figured I would give these bluetooth headphones a try. Unfortunately, my pair was very crooked when it arrived (looking down at the headphone from above the headband, the earcups were not flush with each other, like the headband had been warped). I don't know if it's a packaging issue or a quality control issue. But, here is a short review of what I did learn when using these.The build quality is okay, and I imagine these headphones won't last against any kind of abuse, because they're made completely of cheap plastic. If you're very careful with them and don't fold them all the time, they might last for a while. For the price, it's what I expected.The sound is good for the price, but it's also nothing special. The sound signature is what I'd call balanced; you can enjoy most genres of music with these.The comfort seems good, they're lightweight and don't have a tight clamp, and the earcups go over my ears just fine (I don't have small ears, but I don't have super-large ears either).I didn't test the bluetooth connectivity, since I wasn't going to keep them.You could try these if you want a decent, really cheap pair of bluetooth headphones, but I would say to spend a little extra money and buy something like one of Anker's Soundcore headphones, they seem to be of much better quality. Otherwise, you'll be taking a risk.And the return shipping on these isn't hassle-free like most other things on Amazon, so be wary..."
"I bought mine earlier this year, and received it sometime around the 28th of May, if memory serves.Now, they were quite good...Being over ear headphones, they weren't going to be good at noise cancellation or the like. But the sound quality was decent enough and as I am always listening to music, they gave me exactly what I wanted.The material strength is kinda... iffy. Mine haven't broken, and I was constantly worried they would. But to my surprise the durability of it's physical structure outlasted it's ability to play music.You see, today (07/07/2022) I played them at like, 80% volume for about 2 hours because I wanted to hear my own music over my sister's car speakers, and they just completely died.I got less than 3 months of use out of them.If you want something temporary and won't be used in the long term, these are perfect.But if not, please, I recommend buying higher quality headphones. They'll perform better and last a lot longer. Guaranteed."
"When I first used these headphones, I noticed the bass and how it loud it was. I was happy but after many uses it seems like it lost its volume and bass. They sound like regular headphones now, they are not canceling the noise out. I'm in the market for a better pair. I don't suggest these if your looking for bass and high volume no matter what song you're listening to."
"The headphones are really flimsy. The cushion on the top gives the idea that it’s plush but it’s just hollow rubber/plastic. It isn’t noise cancelling but noise reducing. If you’re studying in a library or some place semi-public like a doctor’s office, make sure you’re listening to nice music because everyone in 2 seats around you all sides will hear you. Don’t pay $20 for something worth $5 at Ross. Invest in something better, it’ll last you longer. I can’t imagine these lasting more than a year, maybe less than that.TLDR; DO NOT BUY."
Great for listening to music and comfort. But do not have it for gaming or phone calls. Once you plug a microphone in the headset....it turns off and won't turn on with the microphone plugged in at all
"Although you can adjust the volume of the video you're playing, you cannot adjust the volume of the AI voice that SCREAMS at you painfully. You're in bed sleeping with some nice sounds from one of those 10-hour storm-sounds videos, and suddenly BATTERY LOW!!!!!!!!! feels like someone has punched you in the eardrums from inside of your skull. There's no need for an AI voice that loud!I was using these during a workout once, and it started screaming BATTERY LOW!!!!!!!!! at me. I couldn't stop to take them off, had no place to put them down until I was back from the workout, so I just had to keep going. Two hours later, the headphones were still working perfectly fine except that every 1 minute it would yell at me BATTERY LOW!!!!!!!!!! If it still has two freaking hours of use left, then THE BATTERY IS NOT LOW!!!!!!! There's no need to yell in my ear every 60 seconds for two hours!But now the thing has stopped working altogether. It refuses to connect to either of my computers now. I'm kind of glad they're dead so I have a reason to order new ones, because I HATE THESE HEADPHONES!!!!"
Great set of blue tooth headphone. Weedeating no problem but on a riding mower the external noise is not muffled enough and the volume will not boostenought to hear well.
The first one was cutting in and out when using with my laptop. Amazon is amazing at handling problems like this and promptly sent me a free replacement and a prepaid label for the defective one. I paired it (after fully charged) to my laptop and it worked perfectly. For one day. Then just like the first one it started cutting in and out on any videos from any source. I thought maybe it was interference from something else and paired it with my phone. It was flawless with the phone. It’s something with the Acer laptop it seems. Next time my daughter is home I’ll try it on her very expensive Apple laptop.
"I couldn’t find the previous wireless pink headphones I’d ordered twice because they were so awesome and stayed charged forever, so I thought these might be close.  .Not even close! These suck when it comes to battery life and slowness of connecting. The other ones would shut off immediately or when I was out of range which helped preserve battery life. These don’t do that. They don’t have the playtime as advertised. I don’t recommend them."
"Sound Quality is good. Battery life is good. Volume control is not good. Can't hit the sweet spot. It's too loud or too quiet. And Noise cancelling is poor at best. I've used these alot while doing yardwork, and it doesn't even block the wind noise, let alone the leaf blower or the mower. But the price is right."
I purchased these to be able to watch TV in bed without disturbing my husband.  Mission accomplished.  There is a buzz when they pick from interference which is annoying.  It stops when I unplug the Bluetooth transmitter.  i wish these cancelled noise.  Three headphones have good battery life.
"I BOUGHT THIS TO HELP WHILE I WAS MOWING. I HAVE APPROX 4 ACRES TO CUT. LOOKING FOR SOMETHING ELSE TO LISTEN TO FOR 3 HOURS BESIDES MY MOWER, IT HELPS, I CAN HEAR MY PODCAST OR MUSIC. HOWEVER I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO THE NEXT GUY"
"I wanted to love these headphones so badly. Great price, they work for just working out or something but if you are trying to make phone calls there is a strange popping noise that is constant. It is heard on the sound of the other caller not on your end. Which is frustrating because I didnt realize it until someone pointed it out. So unless you want to make phone calls with it where someone on the other end has to deal with that these are probably not worth it. Too late to return but oh well"
Cheap plastic build and too much bass.  But worse is the size being TOO SMALL and super tight for a larger head.  I will give them away to a smaller headed friend.  At this price point maybe I shouldn't complain!
I use this around my house. When at my desk and it's plugged in with the cable it is wonderful. However the Bluetooth mode is where my biggest issue lies. Everything comes out in stutters which makes listening to music or podcasts or whatever I am trying to listen practically impossible to listen to. This could be user error but none of my other Bluetooth devices have this issue.It holds it's charge very well and the range seems to be fairly decent but the audio quality is very poor in Bluetooth mode.
"Works well.  I hate Blu-tooth but I was forced to find a Blu-tooth headphone because most products nowadays do not have a headphone jack and opt for Blu-tooth instead.  These are fine, sound quality isn't outstanding but works well enough."
"Most of the time when I try to use my mic it just disconnects entirely. When I open my sound settings it freezes completely and then disconnects the headset (it never froze before), then reconnects a long time later."
"Sound was OK, given the price.  It fit over a ball cap for walking and kept my ears warm in the cold.  Pairing was cumbersome, bordering on a pain in the neck."
"These do not adjust down enough for my small head. I bought them because there were a couple reviews saying that it does fit small heads, but not mine!"
I was looking for light weight and stress free experience. This was well made but with the quality it also carried weight and too tight. Unfortunately I had to return.
"Great lightweight headphones.  Very comfortable. Love the EQ choices.  I can't believe how good the sound is compared to the price of these headphones.  I also like that they fold.  They are a big large otherwise.  As a balding man, I also appreciate the padding at the top.  Very pleased after trying several options at this price point.2023 Update: Ordered a second pair in Jan 2023.  There is a NEW model that has 6 EQ modes. Unfortunately the treble is lacking as is the clarity.  Preferred the prior WH202A model.  I wish they still sold that one. Also the design of the headphones is not as nice as before.  Ended up returning the second pair I bought."
"I simply tired of that messy headfone cord on the keyboard. tangled with the mouse, etc,etc.Alas,  the new headset was designed for a much smaller head, than me !Sounds good, easy to operate, odd (NOT USB) cable, too short for a charger.I'm not a smart-phone-aholic,,, but I 'coupled' to Android and its nice to hear 'normal' voice & sounds.Now, if I can tap into the TV....  I guess I got my moneys worth !"
Does not stay in place.  Too big for adult with small head.  The location of the buttons on the headset are not user friendly.  Have to hold the button down too long to power off and pairing.
They aren't honestly that comfortable to wear for any length of time.
"These were great at the start but I was hoping to get at least a year out of them, but my daughter's set no longer works at a little shy of 7 months."
"Disappointed.  I suppose it depends on what you’re looking for, but they don’t have many features.I wish I’d paid more attention to the description. They look just like my other 2 sets, and mostly assumed they had the same features.No fast forward, pause, or rewind button. The the button to adjust the sound for jazz, classic, vocals, rock, doesn’t do much, if anything, to make the sound change.Volume doesn’t get all that loud even all the way up.No case to store them in. I don’t use the case a lot, so not a dealbreaker, but others may be looking for one. My other 2 pair also included a case.They fit well, doesn’t totally cancel out all sounds, but they stay on while doing chores etc.You could do worse, but if you’re looking to use them while doing other things, and don’t want to have to use your phones controls, I’d look for a different pair."
"I purchased these headphones after my Insignia headphones broke. Four things about these headphones I do not like.1. The buttons are extremely difficult to use. I cannot find the power button unless I take them off and look at it. The buttons are so low profile and close together you cannot feel the difference between the buttons. I have to take them off to answer the phone.2. Two of the buttons are multi service. If you want to increase or decrease the volume, and you don't hold the button down long enough, it changes the track to the next or previous track. This is extremely annoying.3. I can connect the head phone to the TV and to my phone at the same time. This way, when someone calls me and I'm on the treadmill watching a video, I can just switch and answer the phone, but I can't find the button to do that.4. Sometimes when connected to the TV, the sound is seamless. Sometimes it is choppy and the sound comes through in 5 second bursts with 5 second gaps. Why the inconsistency?So, I'm going to throw them away and but a better pair.These headphones are inexpensive and I guess you get what you pay for. My bad."
So I don’t know if this is happening for anybody else but I have a Windows 11 and it just does not work. It just glitches out shows like a high pitch for a second. I don’t know if this is happening to anybody else but I’m gonna give it three stars for that.
Poor sound quality..
Got this as a gift for my sister she said it’s muffled and her friends can’t hear her when she on the phone with the headphones on but it’s good for music
"It’s okay. If I were to pay full price for it, it would not be worth it. Sound quality is not the best, noise cancelling is so-so.Edit: I used it all day at work and the earphones are very comfortable."
Was looking for something to replace a pair of Soundcore headphones. They work fine the sound isn’t too good and there is no volume control on the headphones. Get what you pay for.
Did not like how it worked. Didn’t work as I expected.
"Worked right the first 5 minutes using it then sound became muffled, then all the sounds just kept breaking up and it would turn off completely. I didn't have time to return them because I really needed headphones right away, so I just had to toss them.I ordered a pair of blue ones and those did the same thing as this one. I also bought a black pair at a previous time (Which made me want to purchase more) and they work just fine."
"Sounds good and are comfortable, but the control buttons are very difficult to use. Shouldn't have these many problems with trying to adjust the volume."
"Color and item is as shown. Pretty ok noise cancellation (use it for gym). Easy to set up with your phone. Downfall that I have notice is changing to ""rock"" setting is where the static is heard. Otherwise for what I need them for, they are ok."
I gave three stars because these are some really good headphones thus far but comes with no case?! Why?!
"It is pretty good for the price. However, it has issues whenever I try to use it with teams. I have to close the meeting then rejoin each time for it to work."
"these are really big on mine and my mom's heads. half the reason i bought these was to be able to wear these while doing chores around my apartment, but the second i tilt my head these are falling off. also there's no clear power button which is a little confusing. i love everything else about these headphones, but i will sadly have to return these."
The head band could be tighter...
The earphones themselves still work but one side had a plastic piece break off and now it fits weirdly on my head. Still good as back up earphones but wouldn’t use as a main headphone. Also I find that it is 50/50 on whether or not people scan hear me on the phone with them on
Sound quality decent
average sound quality
These  headphones were ordered to watch tv with.  They told me when power was on and that they were pairing. Could not get any response after that no matter what buttons I pushed. Headphone’s themselves were very nice and fit my head well.
"I purchased these headphones in March of this year and they have already quit working. I am outside the return window, so I can't even get my money back for the purchase. I have tried several times to recharge them, have checked my bluetooth connection, etc. These headphones are useless! I was using them everyday for about an hour when I take my walks and do not believe there is anyway they should have quit working already. They have not been abused, dropped, etc. Just junk...don't waste your money."
"At first it worked well, but then it started to sound scratchy and it went away. But it soon came back and didn’t wanna go away."
"for the price, the sound is decent. the noise does bleed through though, so if you have the volume up a bit, people will hear it also. no sort of noise cancellation either, which again, for the price is kind of expected."
"I really, really wanted to like these. These have excellent reviews and are super cute, but the sound gets super choppy. It cuts out while I'm trying to listen to stuff, and they are terrible while trying to talk on the phone... it sounds incredibly robotic."
"I like these because their loud, but I think I was sent a  refurbished pair, because they fade in and out. I think I will send these back for another pair."
"They are comfortable to wear, but they rattle when I turn the volume up not even all the way the rattle and sound distorted."
Nice sound for the price but it squeezes my head and gives me a headache. Guess I have a big head. Had to return them.
"Overall these are good headphones for the price. But I would like to issue a Do Not Buy warning for those with sensitive hearing like me. When you answer a phone call, they emit a loud, annoying and completely unnecessary PEEP that pierces my ears like an arrow. Same thing happens when you disconnect the call. I am returning these phones on principle, to call out product designers who have no qualms about torturing us with annoying audio signals."
"I wanted to get a pair of earbuds that were wireless because I was tired of the constraints and nuisances of wired, and headphones are uncomfortable and mess with my OCD too much.These seemed to posess all the features and qualities I was looking for, and it did deliver. I don't think that these are garbage, but I definitely don't think 40$ is a price befitting for cheap Dollar Store earbuds; I will explain what I mean.Firstly, the base sound profile - it's terrible. I am no audiophile, but I do have some standards. They are not drowned in mud like my previous Monster Achieve Airlinks, but still very flat and lacking body.The soundstage/spatial sound is decent; it fills the stereo appropriately, but don't expect to feel it project.The buds come with a companion app which allow you to use different EQ presets (my personal favorites are Piano or Accoustic, which help bring the sound up a bit). These presets also program into the buds, meaning if you connect them to your PC or another device, they will still retain the preset. My only gripe is that when you use solo bud mode (which I do a lot while at work for environmental awareness), it will not activate; you need to have both buds connected for it to activate, which to me makes no sense.The fit is something I cannot get really comment positively on. I have had these for a month and while the right bud is secure, I can never get the left one to secure, no matter how much I fasten it nor what eartip sizes I use. Though this may be a fault of my canal shape. The comfort otherwise is very good.Battery life is great. They come with a 10 hour charge and a case that holds up to 30 I believe.  I use these for work and then take them home and use them for my PC, which the buds are fully charged for by then.The touch controls are responsive, albeit difficult to get right as I can't always tap correctly due to not knowing where my finger is in relation to the bud (though this just may be a me thing). You can also change the taps/holds for one or both buds, amd program them to do different things - I like having single tap for play/pause, double-tap to skip forward, and long press for Assistant.The verdict in general - I think they are a decent humble pair of earbuds not trying to present themself as anything extraordinary,  however I would not recommend them for audiophiles, unless you love bass and know how to EQ to your preference."
"For me personally these earbuds are just okay. For the price they aren't too bad, but for me they're going to become a backup pair in case I need them.First off, the sound quality is pretty good in both mono and stereo mode and they charge quickly. But that's about all I like about them.Secondly, the call quality isn't great. I've been told it sounds like I'm ""under water"" and it's hard to hear me. When I change to another earbud the person on the other end notices a huge difference. Lately I've also had issues with AI answering services not recognizing my inputs so it might be part of that as well.Next, the range is much shorter than other earbuds and often will skip or disconnect when I move into another room. The touch controls, especially pause and fast forward, can be really annoying to use due to it not always registering your input and the fact that it takes about 5 seconds to skip ahead 10 seconds. The touch controls can also be TOO sensitive which leads to it pausing or just beeping in your ears without you intentionally touching them. They hate hats and other head coverings! I primarily use earbuds to listen to podcasts and audiobooks, so having these finicky controls is not ideal for my needs.Are they the worst earbuds ever? No. They're okay. But they're not great either especially for what I use them for. I have since purchased a different earbud from the same company (p3i) that has actual buttons that is MUCH better for my needs!!"
I’ve had these for close to a month now & I’m a bit disappointed. I’ve tried countless earbuds & was hoping this pair would be better than the others but unfortunately that’s not the case. While they do have really good sound for playing music audiobooks podcasts etc they are horrible for phone calls which is mainly what I needed them for to begin with. On my end the call is clear & perfectly fine but for the caller it’s loud & they can hear EVERYTHING in the background but me unless I’m in a room that is quiet or in my car with the radio off. At first I thought it was just this one person & possibly their phone but I’ve heard the same complaint from numerous callers across all brands or types of phones. It’s annoying to say the least & frustrating when I’m told to call them back later when it’s quiet or I’m forced to take it off Bluetooth in order to finish the call. I’m on the road all day so that’s usually not an option. If you’re just needing earbuds to play music or listen to books these are great but if you need to take calls make sure your in a quiet area or apparently the callers ears will be blown up by the background noise.
"Update: The vendor spontaneously reached out to me and offered a full refund, surprisingly WITHOUT asking me to edit my review. 5 stars for customer service, I'm bumping my review up one star. The buds sound fine, with the functional limitations noted below that make them less optimal to me, but might be OK with you. (I actually found that my old style -Life P2- are still available, and just purchased a pair: i like the brand, and the customer service appears second to none!)Over the years, i've purchased 5 pairs of Soundcore BT earbuds, and have managed to lose all of them, save one last survivor. I really like my old ones, but they're not available anymore, so I bought these new ones, trusting they would be as good if not better... wrong. The sound is fine (especially since i mostly listen to audiobooks), they fit as well as the old model, and i can use only one individually, to effectively double my listen time when away for charging options. But --a) the ""tap"" controls are awful: it takes me dozens of tries to get my book or music to pause, or start again,b) there's no way to completely turn them off without placing them back in the charging station. I used to just take one bud with me, drive or bike to work or wherever, just turned it off with one long press on the control button when arrived at my destination, and turn them back one a few hours later when heading home with still lots of battery left: not possible anymore unless i pack the charging pod with me, an unnecessary & PITA step.c) i've used them for over a week now, and i've had _several_ instances of them connecting to my phone when the buds are stored in the charging pod... :-|So -- good buds for the price, but be aware of those 3 backwards limitations, if they matter to you as they do to me. I bought 2 pairs, knowing i'm going to misplace some of the buds soon, but will return one pair and look for another alternative: i can live with remembering to take the charging pod everywhere i go, but the lackluster pause function and random connections are very frustrating."
"Extremely comfortable. I’ve worn them all day with no soreness. (The Tozo T20 is as good.) My AirPod 3’s hurt after 3 hours, these are much better. Really good sound regardless of the price. Good bass, which my hard AirPods could not reproduce with the lack of a rubber tip. Pairing is super easy. When talking on the phone, the other party has no problem hearing your voice clearly. Now the bad. 1) The case. Who designed this? Did someone set out to make the most slippery case possible? Success! Without the leash this thing would slip out of your fingers constantly. Fail. 2)Clamshell form. Combined with the slippery finish, almost impossible to open without being EXTREMELY careful. And given the case is so round everywhere, there’s no place to hold on to it. Also needs a bigger/deeper indent at the body/top split. 3)Charge LEDs. Or lack of. One on the front of the case is all you get. When do I charge my case? What level the buds are at? 4)EQ. Not a major issue, but the pre-set EQ choices are just silly. You’ll use the one on your phone instead. Sound quality and comfort is great, but I don't think enough to overcome missing features. We'll give them 1 more week."
"First Impression/unboxing. My first pair of SoundCore earbuds. I love the presentation of the item. Graphics and information on the box. Everything was nicely packaged. The contents consisted of the earbuds and case, 1x USB-C cord, and a manual.Breakdown:-Body/Quality. Flawless design. Made from sturdy plastic! It doesn’t feel cheap which always makes me feel better.-App. One of my most favorite things about using the earbuds is the app! It enhances the usefulness of the earbuds. Besides being able to change the equalizer, you can also customize the taps/holds to what you want! You can customize it to when you use 2 earbuds or even just 1 earbud.-Functionality/features. Bluetooth 5.3, IPX5, 10mm dynamic driver, up to 2 hours charge time, able to use the earbuds upwards of 10 hours and 30 hours with the charging case. And has fast charging; 10 mins of charge gets you 2 hours of playtime. Controls are done by a series of taps or holds.-Performance/Results. I had mixed results. First of all, fitment was good, comfortable for me, and this is coming from someone who normally has issues with earbuds staying in my ears. It paired up easy. BUT I found that it kept pausing my shows or music, I had no idea why. Then from listening to the beeps and seeing what it was doing to my phone, I found that it kept disconnecting from my phone, then reconnects. It was all happening randomly. I own SEVERAL pairs of earbuds and wireless headsets, and none of them have ever had this issue. I unpaired it previously, and paired it back (but didn’t reset the earbuds), didn’t fix the issue. I chalked it up to a faulty set, so I returned it and received a new set. Well, once again, the same issue. I am going to try again to reset it. Its unfortunate because I actually really like the earbuds, but for how many times it disconnects is pretty annoying.Also, when trying to reach out to customer service using the app, I couldn’t get ahold of anyone since there was no option to select “P20i”. I guess its too new of an item.I tried using these in the gym during a 2-hour workout. Fitment wise, these did pretty good, every other set, I had to readjust them, 1x time one of them almost fell out. But that’s still pretty good for me, keep in mind, I haven’t changed out the silicone pieces, usage outside of the gym, the original silicone pieces fit good. The volume and sound quality are great. The issue was the disconnection that happened continuously which got old really quick. Odd occurrence, I was using a different set of wireless headphones, all of a sudden, my music randomly stopped. I looked at my phone and it said it connected to the P20i, even though, it was in its case and fully seated. This happened twice, after each time, I opened up the case, and reseated the earbuds, then it stopped.SummaryI’m in a weird position because I love these, but the performance with the disconnection is annoying. The app and performance of audio quality was good. There’s no reason why you should have to go through extra steps of unpairing/pairing, and resetting the earbuds. And once again, I have never had any issues like this with any other brand (JBL, soundpeats, Edifier, ADV, random/no names, and boltunes). I can’t say I would recommend these until  this issue is solved."
"These are the first pair of detached bluetooth earbuds I have ever owned.  previously, my earbuds have always been connected to each other by a cord, which made them convenient to hang around my neck when I couldn't use them.  But after going through four pairs of earbuds in 3 years, I wanted to try something different but didn't want to spend an arm and a leg.  I found these on Black Friday and thought it was worth a shot.  After more than two weeks of using them, here are the things I like and dislike about them:Likes:1.  They turn on automatically when you take them out of the case.  With my old earbuds, you had to press and hold the play/pause button to activate and I didn't always remember if I had already turned them on.  Now, if they're out of the box, I know they're on.2.  They charge automatically whenever they're in their case.  If I'm not using them, they're almost always in there, which means they'll be charged when I want to use them again.  With my old earbuds, they would usually hang around my neck when not in use and of course the battery would continue to drain.  This meant that if I had a heavy usage day, they'd be screaming ""low battery"" at me before I was ready to stop listening and I would have to plug them in for at least an hour or two to get them charged.Dislikes:1. Comfort.  The ear tips don't do much to make them comfortable to wear.  I've tried all three sizes of the silicone tips that come with the buds and I also ordered a 3 size set of memory foam tips.  None of them made them super comfortable to wear, but one of the memory foam ones make them less uncomfortable than the others.  All the same, I find myself taking them out after awhile because they do become uncomfortable.2. The touch control features don't always work right.  With my previous buds, I could pause my music and turn the volume up or down with actual buttons on the cord.  I almost never had to press the pause button more than once to get them to work.  The touch control features are not as reliable.  I originally had the play/pause command as one tap, but if I happened to take my bud out and accidentally touched the area, my music or audiobooks would inadvertently turn back on.  So, I switched it to two taps.  Now I have to double tap my bud 2-3+ times before it will successfully pause anything; which is not ideal when you're pausing whatever you're listening to in order to hear what someone is saying.Bottom line, they're not the best earbuds in the world in terms of comfort and functionality, but their pluses might outweigh their minuses depending on what you value.  I'll keep using these for now until another option presents themselves."
"I thought I liked these at first, the sound is good, however, people can’t really hear me in the phone, and they are very bulbous and don’t really want to stay in my ear. These may be suited for a man’s ear, but my girl ears aren’t deep enough out something and they don’t want to stay in, especially if I’m not sitting or standing. I can’t really lay back and relax. I wish I could return them but it says it’s past my window. I’m going to try anyways."
"These earbuds are great if you are only going to use them to listen to music/videos, etc.  If you plan to use them for calling then keep shopping.  You can hear your caller just fine, the problem is your caller cannot hear you over all the background noise these ear buds pick up.  Also, Amazon changed the price on these to make them appear to be on sale.  Regular retail is only $24.99."
"Let me start with the positives. These are some of the most comfortable earbuds I’ve worn. Well cushioned and can be worn for a long time with no discomfort.The audio is well designed and comes through exceptionally clear. It’s easy switching from podcasts to music and keep the audio quality strong.My big issue is that there is a consistent Bluetooth interference whenever I’m in a moderately populated area. Walking down a city street or waiting in the train station, one or both earbuds will stop sharing sound. It’s really difficult to give these earbuds a higher rating when this is something I know is going to happen when I leave the house.The accompanying app also is a huge plus. It’s great to have many options for EQs and to be able to customize the “tap” controls."
"These have pretty good sound quality. Not very good range. At about 20 feet, they start cutting out. The most annoying thing is they are supposed to be able to push the note on them to pause and then to continue with another push and somehow skip forward. I've been able to make that work twice in about a 100 tries. I get beeps but they do nothing most of the time."
"One of the most reliable brands out there I have like 10 pairs of earbuds for every everyday use depending on what I’m doing that’s what dictates which pair I’m using, this pair did not disappoint at all, it’s cheap but not in a bad way, affordable would be the best word, it sounds decent and the quality of the product is what gets me every time, top notch quality 👌"
"These were a replacement for some others that were a nodule type bud where I dropped one and it blew the bitty speaker bits in it, so anyway, I thought I'd try these. I was interested in the little drop piece on the outside like air buds, wondering if it might make them more user friendly...quite the opposite. They would get hooked on stuff or I'd catch them with my hands when tucking my hair or something and would get knocked out of place or fall out. Idk how y'all do it with those air buds, lol.I ended up buying some jlabs that I really like now, so these are just backups for me now.Sound quality:The got the job done, but nothing spectacular. They have an app so you have a few different equipment setting options, but I wasn't too impressed with the performance of any of them, tbh.Pros:- One good thing about the app is that you could change the quick settings to your preference, so if you wanted to pause with a single tap, or a long touch, you could change all that how you like, or how you're used to doing already. That's what I did, and set them up to mimic my last pair, which was probably my favorite feature.- I also liked the colors and the little case they came in with the little lanyard."
"Have had these for about a month.  I use them when i travel and also when i run.  Generally like the earbuds, but they will fairly frequently disconnect from Bluetooth and won't reconnect for several minutes.  They disconnect on two different devices so it appears the earbuds are the problem.  Not worth returning given the price I paid.  Just a bit disappointing."
"For listening to music these are just fine for the price point. They're comfortable, not heavy, and seem to be decently constructed.The mic quality, however, is absolute butt. It seems to me that it picks up everything BUT your voice. Nobody listening to you will be able to hear you outside of background noise.TLDR: Great for music, bad for talking."
Would I buy another one even though it's only $20? No.Is the sound quality surpass $20? Yes!For some reason the right side of the earbud keeps popping out when I'm working out.  I thought it was just my ears but saw some reviews of the same problem. If this wasn't the case it would definitely be a high five stars. Unless you are walking or just sitting around then you'll be fine. If you're jogging or lifting weights good luck. Another thing about this is if it can go up just one more notch louder it would be perfect but what can I say it's only $20.I would probably return if I kept the Box and use this money and triple it for a higher quality headset to be honest.
"I like the sound and design for it. Unfortunately, I lost one of my earbuds the first day I used it at work. It has great connection but be careful if you use it. It has moderately EMF frequencies which poses a health risk for long use. I'd recommend if you don't care but if so maybe try a different brand."
"So it is supposed to connect immediately to the source and it started out doing that, but now it makes me put BOTH buds back in the container and take them back out again for it to activate and turn on.Having said that,Everything else I like about these. I've had a few now and more annoying ones will loudly announce YOO HABA INCOMIN CAH over and over with no gap in between nonstop, this is just a subtler phone call notification sound. Nice. Also the sound to notify you that it is connecting is nice. These feel great and don't move, the middle size fits perfectly and I like that you can switch ears and wear the left one in the right ear etc without them falling out.The charger light flashes green when it is charging, flashes white when it is very low battery. Each come with a mini lanyard attached to the bud case. They charge quickly. The battery lasts a long time, all day, at least eight hours the last time I checked. I go to sleep with these in and I actually wake up with them, no problem with comfort and the battery lasted all night from full charge. Really love that.But this connectivity issue is annoying so I will keep one and try to find a replacement for the second pair that I got. They have to connect otherwise what's the point? But I still recommend these. Maybe I just got a dud pair. Overall, a good purchase."
"Sound is great from these! My only complaint is that they just don’t stay in my ear. I’ve tried all three provided rubber tips and I think it’s a design thing. Especially if you’re being active while using, you need something that will stay in your ear better. Hopefully, Anker can figure that out, because it’s annoying."
i looovveee the sound quality and the battery life but one of the earbuds will stop working within 2 months which makes them unusable after that for me. i have to have both in my ears or nothing. so these really aren’t any better than other earbuds but i keep buying them cause they’re cheap.
"My wireless earbuds before these were Skullcandy Jib True, and as fine as they were, they pressed on my ear so much it hurt after a while. I bought these thinking this shape would be better, since it didn't seem to all be packed in the area right on the ear, but it hurts the same way.Apart from that, these sound pretty fine. Though they never feel like they're securely in my ear, unlike wired earbuds I usually use. The controls are touch sensitive, so I disabled them to prevent accidental commands. I like the shape of the holding case, and how easily the earbuds snap into it magnetically."
"I never write reviews but wanted to on these.. these work fine if you’re indoors but i walk outside a lot where it’s windy and  these do NOT work while I’m walking outside. Constant static, starting/stopping, losing connection. I can only figure maybe the wind is somehow pushing the buttons."
I love them because there are loud and compatible with apple devices. But my only issue is if i move a certain way they will fall out of my ears . And I’ve tried all of the cushions they still fall out.
"Well, I really liked these the 9 days they worked well. I use earbuds with my computer pretty much all day for listening to music or while gaming. The sound was not great out of the box, but with a couple of tweaks in my Windows audio settings (enhancements), they were perfect. I love how long the batter life is. The earbuds I currently use [from 2 other brands] only last 2 and 4 hours. Getting 10 hours out of these Soundcore P20i earbuds has been a boon. I do find that I'm constantly accidentally touching the sensitive touch pad found on the upper outside parts, so am regularly having to adjust the volume due to this. Overall, based on this experience alone, I would give these a 4.5/5 stars.Last night, however, while changing out earbuds after my other pair died and needed recharging, these suddenly weren't pairing correctly, got super choppy and kept disconnecting from the bluetooth as if I had gone to the other side of the house (even though I was still sitting right in front of my computer). Today, not only is the sound still choppy, the left earbud won't stay paired to anything or pair at all, and the sound is really low in the right earbud now. I tried all of the usual troubleshooting. As others have stated, there is really no easy way to reset these (no button), and unpairing/re-pairing and conducting tests across multiple devices did not resolve the issue - it remains the same. Since I'm still within the return window, I will be returning this set and try a different pair. Based on the other reviews I've seen, though, this seems to be a regular issue."
"I shouldn't complain about the exterior box feeling like it's cheap plastic, because you pay a low price and you don't get the grand package. However, I can't complain about the earbuds either falling out, or constantly feeling like there about to"
"Over all it’s nice the Battery is durable , giving it 3 star because I  can’t wear this for a longer period of time because my ear hurts may be because, the ear buds are too big"
They work you can connect it to your device they look good on the outside. But they aren't good quality at all sound goes in and out all the time and the mic is kinda meh
I tried all the tips that came with it and it just falls out of my ear so easily that I can't use these. Sound quality is decent when I tried them.
"HONEST REVIEW: During specific/certain higher pitches, my left ear bud will make a clacking/ticking sound like something is loose on the inside. Not sure what compound is used to hold things together but, it seems it may not be assembled properly. Whether it's a sort of epoxy or solder, it doesn't seem to have held up quite good either from production or miss-handling during shipping. I also didn't receive small, medium and large sized fittings. I only have small, large and large hahah.These ear buds sit just outside the ring of your ear canal, so the noise cancellation may not be what you're looking for, or it may be perfect for ya! Unfortunately they come loose in my ear way too easily and I’m CONSTANTLY fiddeling with them to get them in a comfortable spot, the design just doesnt work to keep them in my ear very well. I would honestly say they block between 40%-50% of the noise, depending on your ear shape. My previous pair blocked about 65%-85% which is what I'm in the market for.Ultimately these are a solid product of what you're buying them for, just that I genuinely enjoy the technicalities of my purchases. Though I won't be returning them because for the price, quality of sound, touch features, simplicity, case design, quick Bluetooth connectivity and battery span, I'd be a fool to! Overall a decent pair!"
"Microphone quality is poor, have had several complaints from others on my cellphone calls that I sound like I'm 'talking into a tin can' or the microphone is overwhelmed by mild wind noise.  These are also not very comfortable for my ears, compared to more expensive earbuds (but that is acceptable at this price point). If I had known the call-quality would be so poor, I would not have purchased.  Also, these earbuds do not 'pause' podcasts, etc when you remove one earbuds, which is an annoyance."
"I did not realize that these earbuds can only be used with my smartphone, as opposed to other devices, likechromebooks and tv's i have with bluetooth capabilities."
"These have a fantastic sound and rich bass, but on calls it picks up every background sound so whomever you are calling can't hear you over it."
"I like the look of the case; earbuds sit nicely and are easy to take out and place back. Strong magnet for docking into the case for charging. Plus the material of the headphones and everything else feels well. Nicely assembled.But out of the box I have pairing issues. Both earbuds are at 90% battery. The audio on the left headphone goes in and out intermittently. There's no real cause for this issue. I Checked the app and firmware up to date and tried to unpair and repair it again, but there was no change. Kind of thing that will drive you crazy. I'm going to give these earbuds 24 hours to self-heal and improve.The bass and audio quality are good for on-sale headphones, but if the pairing issue doesn't resolve, I'll have to return this set. May go up to the next model in the SoundCore series. Stay tuned 👀"
"1. Why would earphones need a start up sound…..It’s not a tv… so everytime it takes forever to start playing your music or hear someone cuz you gotta spend 2 seconds hearing start up chime then the connection beep (it has already connected the second it came out the case so the startup is what’s taking foreve)2. If you have one earphone in don’t even think abt putting the other in  your pocket…..it’ll start glitching the song or audio (I’m assuming it’s not very good at differentiating between the phones Bluetooth and the pairing between the two earbuds)3. Just nitpicking but the low battery warning sound sounds ugly 💀💀4. That’s it tbh it was $20 so it sounds great for the price, battery lasts from yesteryear to new millennia so no complaints there. All in all it’s great just those two issues grind me gears every now and then."
The right units stop working after 3 month. You can see it on the phone bluetooth list but no sound.
"This is great for listening to music and sound quality is great , love the case and battery life is good however it is terrible for taking calls it amplifies everything in the background and it zones you out - only flaw for me.I bought two and both have the same issue oh amplifying back ground noise and zoning you out.Otherwise it’s good and pairs easily ."
With the earbuds would turn off once placed in the case but they stay on till u turn blue together
This is really good and comfortable easy to use you won't remember that it's in your ears 😉
Bummed out this has terrible connectivity to the Bluetooth I have to par then everything I need to used them.
"These earbuds are only $20 for a reason... Let me just say that I really wanted to like these because of the brand. Before these earbuds I had a pair of Soundcore Life P2 earbuds that I loved and had for at least 3 years with no issues until the last few months I used them. I just assumed the issues were coming up because they were a few years old and it was time to replace them. But after my experience with this model, I don't even really know anymore.I picked these P20i earbuds for the brand and the price. The first day I used them, no issues at all and they sounded great. The 2nd day I tried to use them, (which was the 3rd day of me owning them), I started having connection issues. Over the course of my shift at work they kept randomly disconnecting and then re-connecting after a few seconds all throughout the day.I have had these for a couple weeks now, and keep trying to use them but it has gotten progressively worse. They started taking longer and longer to connect, then it was saying they are connected and you can see the music playing but don't hear anything. When I finally got the sound going, even with the volume all the way up, the sound was very low. Then today no amount of charging, factory resetting the earbuds, ""forgetting"" the device on Bluetooth and re-adding them would get them to pair and connect. I really have been trying for hours today to get them working with no results.I don't even normally bother doing reviews on anything, but after this I'm just so irritated. I have looked all over the internet for possible solutions, and have seen that this is a fairly common issue for at least this model from Soundcore, so I just feel like the reviews on here are misleading, and wanted to add to the people that are on here telling you not to waste your time and money with these earbuds. I'm not saying Soundcore in general is bad, but maybe try a model that costs a little more? My original earbuds were like $40 or $50 if I remember correctly, and like I said I really did not have any issues until the end, after several years of use. So I want to say maybe this really is just a case of ""you get what you pay for"", and these earbuds are just not the way to go."
Hello I would like to exchange for  a  new pair the left one doesn't work
"I've been using these earbuds for about 3 months now, and the right one just stopped working."
Sometimes they won't connect but I like the design & they are easy to use & lightweight
There are decent quality but get the job done and are waterproof
"I bought these to replace a really inexpensive pair I purchased a couple of years ago. I expected these to be a better quality based on the brand but that is not the case. I'm starting to have problems charging these. The green light on the case indicates that they are fully charged but I receive Bluetooth messages stating that they have 10% power after being charged. Sometimes one ear bud will charge and the other one doesn't. Also, they are constantly falling out of my ears. They came with three different sizes of fittings but I have the problem no matter which size I use. The next time,  I'll replace these with a higher rated no-name brand."
These headphones have pretty decent sound quality. I use them mainly to listen to audio books. The range on them isn't the greatest. And people complain that when talking to me on the phone I sound muffled. But they get the job done i can listen to my books or podcasts and still be productive.
"Really liked them, especially for the price.  Have started at times to have a split second delay between the two buds.  Can be a pain when using for meetings on my laptop.  Have to take one out.Sometimes when I then put it back it works fine, but not always."
"During my experience using the headphones, the left earbud often cuts out. Additionally they earbuds lose timing with each other and then one headphone will be on a 2-3 second delay from the other.Overall the sound quality isnt bad and the battery life has been pretty decent."
"Purchase the set of these to replace a set that was stolen. I have numerous sound core products, including four speakers. The set that was stolen was perfect and had been for some time. I had the life a3is, so I used the same model from amazon, they were defective out of the box. Knowing I was getting a refund from Amazon I purchased another pair while returning the first pair. Amazon customer service screwed me over. Apparently you now have to pay an $8 return fee if they pick it up at your house. If the ship you a label by mail it's a $1 fee. The second set was also defective. I threw them away not going to hassle with customer service again it's not worth my time. Got this pair instead. Paired up right away, works exactly as it should, but the sound quality is not as good as my old ones. I will eventually repurchase my old ones, but not from Amazon. Walmart has them for about the same price, and Walmart won't charge me to return it defective item on for only 48 hours. I've already paused my Amazon Prime and canceled my Amazon music. I believe Walmart plus is a better deal, Walmart's and no hassle return policy, and I'll go to Pandora plus from my music."
"Sound quality is OK, mic is pretty good and touch controls work well but these developed pairing issues after about 5 months. They would struggle to connect and even when connected sometimes there would be no sound.Pairing is also a challenge when you want to use with another device. I also wish these could pair buds individually to different devices like I could with other brand.I had a beat up pair from the other brand that still worked and never gave issues after years of use. Lost those 😔Using these made me crave wired headphones.I would not recommend these, spend a little more and get something better."
"Fitting is not good , they fall out easily"
Occasional audio de-sync between left and right buds or volume mismatch.  Don't take telephone calls with these if there's any amount of background noise since it'll pick all that up better than your voice.  Otherwise okay if just listening to music while working or doing chores.
"Pros• For around $20, I consider these earbuds a very good price for the quality.• This is my first pair of wireless earbuds so sound and quality appear great. The earbuds do their jobCons• The touch controls are clunky. For example, when attempting to lower volume during phone call or virtual meeting, I inadvertently disconnected the phone call / virtual meeting. Or maybe I don't know what I'm doing?• These are not multi-point earbuds so you cannot seamlessly transition from phone to computers (I have 3). You must manually reconnect to each device, which is disappointing. However, for the price, it is reasonable this feature is not included.• If earbuds are not connected to your phone, you cannot see battery status on the website page (on computer). That is, you can only view battery status through the phone app AND ONLY when connected to your phone. The phone app offers no battery status when earbuds are not connected to phone. You do receive an aural ""battery low"" warning but you don't know how much percent or time you have remaining until it disconnects on you. So, if you are trying to train your battery and/or maximize the life of each charge, it is only possible when connected to phone and using the phone app.• Same thing with the Equalizer. You can only see and adjust the Equalizer if you're connected to your phone and only view on the phone app. You cannot view equalizer when accessing your account through the website on your computer.• There is no way to view when the charging case needs to be charged, which means you would have to be motivated to count / keep track of the advertised hours of charging the charging case provides.While I gave 4 stars for sound and battery life, which are great, for the Cons listed above, I gave an overall score of 3 stars. I also use other Anker products, in general, like the quality for price, and intend to continue purchasing Anker products and remain brand loyal."
"Things I like about this is it's sleek design and it does seem to have noise cancelling abilities. However, it is really hard to connect these earbuds especially if it's mid-video call. It connects but there's no sound."
"It’s not the best pair of earbuds I’ve owned but it’s definitely ok. It cuts in and out some times when jour iron my back pocket while sitting down. Other than that, it has great battery life"
"These ear buds have pretty good sound quality, but the mics pick up and magnify even the smallest background noises on calls.I liked the ""lost my ear bud"" feature and being able to customize the controls.However the mics pick up way too much background noise on calls and it's problematic. The person I'm trying to talk to on the other end can't hear me for all the noise.I've tried calls in many settings and had problems, which is a deal breaker for me. I'll be returning these for another set of Anker earbuds."
"Decent, but they got stolen."
"The quality of the earbuds is great, especially for the price.Only problem is when they are closed up IN their charging case, they'll connect to the phone, overriding an existing Bluetooth connection. Very frustrating!"
"The sound quality isn't bad for the price, but they don't stay in my ears, and the sound quality degrades rapidly even when they start sliding out of the ear just a little bit.  Trying to press them back into the ears ends up skipping to the next song.  Overall a bit frustrating to use.  For about the same price I was able to get another pair  of ear buds with an ear loop, and those stay in the ears.  These will be a backup pair..."
"I've used a pair of Anker soundcore life note E earbuds for over a year now & they have been great. So I decided to try this model out since it's a newer model & has app support. After just a few minutes of using them I packed them back up & processed a return.  My Life note E's have great range & I can leave my phone laying anywhere downstairs in our house & roam around talking with no problem. With the P20i's They started losing connection as I walked into only the next room. This is unacceptable to me. The sound was good with them when the connection was strong, but I just couldn't do it with them giving less range performance than my old Life note E's.  I also prefer the size/shape of the Life note E's case...it fits well into a pocket without getting in the way too much. Also the P20i case does not have the 3 LED's on it like the Life note E case does which allows you to determine the amount of charge its battery has remaining. The only plus with the P20i case over the Life note E's case is the tether string, which the older model does not have.  Even though they were a few dollars more, I went ahead & ordered a pair of Soundcore Life P2 Mini's, since I read that they are the same as the Life note E's(just the version of them made for Amazon)....I hope they're right about that!"
I had a similar pair before and loved them but I’m so disappointed with this pair. The left bud works like 60% of the time. It’s so frustrating
"Purchased in May and these had done well. The call quality is decent and sound is pretty good. After 3 months it stopped charging, worked after cleaning the contacts on the earbuds and the case. 4 months later the left one is not holding a charge as long. They still last through the night and for a few more hours after, and quality is good, so you will get a good amount of use from these. Updating 4 1/2 months later and it only charged to 50% after a full day of being in the case AND being plugged into a charger."
"The first pair of wireless earbuds that I purchased from Anker were the Life P2 series and I loved them. They sound great and still work without a hitch despite every day use for the last couple of years. Deciding to upgrade I went with these based on reviews I’d read on line. Slightly smaller, more features, great sound (using the app is a breeze when finding the right sound profile) —- great purchase, right? Not really. I returned the first pair due to the right earpiece dropping out randomly and then reconnecting, plus they wouldn’t hold a charge that lasted four hours.  For context I use these on my daily commute (an hour each way) and maybe an hour every day during break time. When not in use - back into the case. No more than four hours before I was getting the battery low warning. Time to send them back.Got my replacement pair in good time, fully charged them and off we go. Nope. Same issue. Randomly dropping on one side, losing connection with certain apps (Audible being the most likely, but occasionally with iTunes and YouTube as well) and still won’t hold a charge for more than a few hours. I’ve updated the firmware and reset them multiple times as suggested on the Anker website as well as a few troubleshooting sites I’ve looked at. No change. As of now, they sit as a backup pair (shame, these really are nice earbuds) and I honestly can’t recommend them as a purchase."
"I gave it 3 STARS, because they work fine while I'm close to my LAPTOP and I can listen to music and news,and that was the main purpose for buying them and they work ok but once I move a few meters away, reception is no good!!.So again, these are entry level headphones are OK for the price;But if you want to listen to high quality music then you better buy APPLE or something else, more expensive.."
"The sound quality is good but they won't stay in ears. You'll have to keep pushing them in every so often which is a little frustrating. I've tried all of the ear bud sizes that it comes with with no success. I would not recommend these ear buds for anything that requires movement like walking or exercising. Again, the sound is good and call quality is good. Others may have better success with the buds staying in the ear."
"They don’t have great noise canceling abilities, they get the job done though.An annoying thing these do is, even if you aren’t actively trying to use these, if the case runs out of battery, the headphones turn on and they automatically connect to your phone. I have to go through my Bluetooth setting at least a handful of times a day to manually disconnect them.They’re ok for the price point, probably wouldn’t buy them again once they die."
"These have great sound for the price.  Too bad I only had them about a month before they stopped charging.After original post, seller reached out and sent replacement.  Excellent customer service.  Hopefully these last."
Stopped working after about a month of use. Not sure why. Case still lights up to charge but no sound on any device.
"These are not expensive and they were fantastic when I first bought them. I was impressed by the sound quality and the length of time they held its charge. After a month of owning them, I’ve noticed that after taking them off the power cord, within a few minutes of wear, I get an alert that says there’s a low battery, I can still use the headphones but the intermittent message about low battery is annoying."
"As far as headphones to listen to music, they’re ok. A bit muddy and it’s not high end sound, but hey, they were $20. My only true gripe is how they function for phone calls. No one can hear me and there are complaints that my voice goes in and out and there is a lot of background noise. But as a second cheap pair to have on hand for music, they’re ok."
I bought these mainly for calls but the sound quality is poor. Keep getting complaints that Im not being heard clearly
Pairing was easy. My thing is I need to be able to change the next song fast and easy. These headphones do that well. I am not so much into the sound reduction because when to change the song you push the earbud farther into the ear. Witch really cuts out the background sound. There not to bad sound is good. Wish it had the charging percentage on the case.
These arrive today to replace my dead Jabra's. I got to say these have a very nice sound quality to them and they fit nicely. But the problem i having with them are stability issues. I will be listening to my music and then they will cut out few times during the coarse of the song. In they fix this issue these will be some great ear buds.
"Both headphones won't sync properly, have to use them one side at a time, bit of a bummer"
Returned product because they were just too large and kept falling out of my ears
The headphones are very good for listening to music but talking to people on the phone I had an issue where my friend kept asking what I was saying as if I was cutting out or something. I will definitely keep them for the gym but I would not recommend if you like to talk on the phone everyday.
"I don’t like this product, after some time the quality of sound not good"
"Well I love anker but this but this one is just ok.  I bought it because I work by myself so I listen to audio books. The battery life is great, no problem with that.  The sounds works for books, don't know about music because I don't really listen to music.  The problem is when I get phone calls.  If I'm inside it's soso, but outside just horrible. The mics pickup every single noise there is and I have to cancel the bluetooth and go to speaker which kind of defeats the purpose.  I will keep them because I really just use them for the books. But I don't recommend them for phone calls."
"Received as promised. These earbuds feel and sound very good. However, i gave a 3 star rating as the right side stopped charging after just 3 days of use. All efforts were made to address this problem as recommended by the manufacturer (cleaning contacts, resetting and firmware update)."
They have good sound but they aren’t the best for those who have VERY small ears. Mine wouldn’t stay in my ears when I tried on all three sizes of silicone earbud covers. Over all if you have “normal” or larger ears I would say it’s worth it to try it.
It has good sound but the battery dies quickly.
Between walking and jogging I put in 40 miles a week. These headphones work great except when I am on a call. They say AI for good call sound but they don't have noise canceling and people can't hear me if cars go by on the road.
The sound is very clear but it is not smooth.
They're really nice but they will drop the call like disconnect and then it whoever you're talking to you will hear over your phone and you won't hear over the the earbuds other than that they sound great and they work great...
Sound quality is pretty much what I expected.  The bass is pretty decent . Only issue is there is no noise isolation because of which all the background noise can be easily heard so it can’t be used in noisy spaces
"Fit is OK but have to tuck them in tight otherwise will fall out. Bass is marginal at best.Pairing was not as automatic so scan the User Manual to see the details if yours do not pair.For the price, they are OK."
Love the quality and feel of the headphones. Only thing to watch out for is that you may be missing the USB cable in your box. It doesn't kill it for me cause basically everything is USB-C these days
"the sound quality is ok, it’s on par with what you pay for. my main complaint is i’ve only had these for a couple months, and the right one has stopped charging entirely, so it no longer works. :("
"I purchased it specifically for taking work calls while at university or away from home, and the sound quality is good. However, the microphone is not up to par. My friend's Chinese earpods have better microphones."
"If your looking for earbuds that are noise canceling or high volume,  these aren't them.  As a contractor,  most my tool's decibels will exceed the earbusds maximum volume.  If they're used in a quiet environment,  they will deliver a reasonably good sound with surprisingly decent bass. When i tried usung then for a call, i was asked if i was on speaker or standing too far away from my phone. They connect without any issue and haven't had connectivity issues as some do when one gets more than a few feet away from their phone."
"3.5⭐️After the end of a pair of regular AirPods and then  gen 2 AirPod pros  I decided I was done with Apple headphones. I really didn’t want to drop a ton of money until I could do some research and spend a more around Black Friday.What I liked:They don’t fall out, a constant problem with the AirPod pros for my small earsI’m not supper picky on sound but they sounded better than I was expecting.Battery life is excellent.Cons:Phone call quality was not greatCase does feel a little cheap"
"Pros: size of the earbuds and charging case, lanyard, noise canceling, excellent sound quality, portability, doesn’t fall out of your earsCons: hurts my eardrum, buttons difficult to operate, no display indicating how much battery life on charging case, so tight that you have to physically remove earbuds to hear someoneOverall: while Anker did an excellent job making a very compact, portable and high quality sounding earbuds, these particular ones are just not for me.  Earbuds shouldn’t be this painful.  Maybe some of the other Anker earbuds might be better suitable for me.."
Quality is good
"At this point I am happy they STAY in my ears even after talking and eating at lengths.  Too many have popped right out and one has been lost.Trying a pair with a cord caused me too many issues. They ALL sounded as I am told, as if I were in a tunnel.  Or very far away.  At least I can report that sister and one friend tell me.I am having a hard time learning which, side gets the two longer bong than the right to tell them/they who to call. This or that or that or this.I wish the case and ear pieces were not slippery.  The case seems to have mind of its own were it not for the cord attached to its so slippery back.  Uh side other side?"
"Opened them up and charged them for 30 minutes. I was listening to music, and it was such a great sound. It has better treble height and bass low end than my old pair. Then I made a phone call and got this weird echo. The headphones were getting feedback from itself and causing evil hissing and buzzing. I had to turn the volume down, and it went away, but I couldn't hear the call well. It's so great for music and movies, but it could be better with the mic on!"
"Fit good,  sound is good but no app function.On the Amazon page they make it seem as though the app works with buds,  They don’t!"
"I bought these earbuds because I am part of a meditation class on Zoom. The speakers on my 8-year-old Mac are shot, and I wanted to hear the voices of the teachers well, hence the purchase of the earbuds. They work find with music that is a constant sound. In the class, after a short time of listening to speaking, I hear some static. After a short period of silence, an obviously required part of a meditation class, the earbuds shut off, so when the teacher begins speaking again, I see lips moving and hear nothing. When I sought support, the phone number listed says there are no support people for the P20i product, and recommends emailing anchor.com. When I did that, the email came back as undeliverable. It seems there is essentially no support other than the basics of setting up and turning the earbuds off and on. The ""manual"" is in such small print to be undecipherable and the symbols do not address my issue. I don't see how these can help me, and since there is no support, they will have to go back. Disappointing."
"I've had a Oneodio A70 headphones for about 2 years and  I was looking for a better sounding wired headphone to leave plugged in to my computer to reduce wear and tear on the A70.  As I liked the sound quality and fit of the A70s, I purchased these Oneodio Pro 10s wired headphones and Amazon had them to me next day.  I opened the package and everything was as it should be.  I plugged them into my computer and gave them a listen. My initial impression was they had a MUDDY SOUND as some of the negative reviews had noted on Amazon. Knowing that headphones and speakers need some break-in time, I listened to them for about an half an hour and I realized that while the description is Over the Ear, these hit both the top and bottom of my ears and started to HURT as negative reviews had noted.  Still hoping that the sound would improve I left the plugged in and a music mix playing for about 15 hours.  Unfortunately the sound did not improve. I am returning these due to POOR  SOUND QUALITY  and being TOO SMALL my ears."
"I'm an ex-recording engineer, but lately I've just been playing guitar and producing electronic music at home for fun. I'm not an audiophile, and my days of having a very discerning ear are far behind me. So when my old knockaround headphones (Status Audio CB-1s) finally broke, I thought I'd shop around the sub-$50 price range for headphones to see what's been happening in the last decade.The good:Build quality seems decent. Everything seems well made, and the connections feel solid. Love a detachable cable. Having a bunch of different options for cabling included is a really nice touch. They fold up pretty compact for their overall size.The bad:I can't figure out how people wear these for more than 20 minutes or so. The earpads are a little too small for me (average size ears) so they press against my ears no matter how I turn the earpads. Looks like there are some aftermarket ear pads that might fit a little better, but I don't want to double the cost of these headphones just to have them be more comfortable.Here's what I'm surprised by: the sound. It's incredibly stuffy and unfocused. The low mids are just blurry and muddy to the point that it's hard to listen to. I tried running some headphone burn-in tracks for a few hours and it doesn't seem to have made any difference.I'm going to keep these since my five year old will be starting to play drums soon and I think these will work great for her for years to come given their size and durability, but I cannot recommend them even at their price point."
"I purchased this Headphones based on the good reviews, but when I got them, and tried them out, they seem to be too small for my head. I tried to make them fit my head, but it was just not possible.  The sound was decent, not as good as my Sony Headphones, but not too bad for the price.  I had to return them, mainly because i couldn't use them, they were just too small for my head.  For someone with a smaller head that needs a decent, but not real good sounding headphones, these headphones should work just fine."
"This is a low priced item that's definitely on par with professional studio headphones, thanks to it being at an outstanding 20-40k hz frequency range.***HOWEVER*** The picture is a LIE.There's no air space between the earcups when not worn, meaning you'll have to stretch the headphones sideways to put it over the ears. Now imagine how painful your ears will feel for having that vise clamping down on you for more than 30 min. It hurts! The hurt hurt kind. It's so bad I suspect all the 5 star reviews were users that found a DIY video and modified the headphone for practical use.Note: I originally was going to give it a 5 out of 5, but while wearing it and writing the review my ears starts to get unbearably painful as time goes by.Pros:- Moderate noise cancellation from the earcups encapsulating the entire ear. A soundtrack going at a modest volume level of 8, it blocks out 95% of city noise heard through a closed window. It helps alot when my desk is next to the window. Caution: you might get mini jump scares from not hearing people walking up to you.- Frequency response range of 20- 40k hz. This is huge! Many audio equipment manufactures dictates their price range through this alone. For it to be at 40k hz range it's comparable to a professional headset.- Price. If I wanted a headphone at 20-40k hz range back it'll cost me around $80+ back in 2016.- Unpluggable wires from the headpiece. You can replace the wires when your headphone inevitably breaks down or upgrade to a better microphone addon.Cons:- Detachable mic that comes with the headphone is ass. I can hear static artifacts just by plugging it into the pc.- Small cheap headband that clamps down on your head that will hurt your ears on prolonged use. And as mentioned at the beginning... The picture is a lie. There's literally no air space when you position the earcups to face each other when not wearing it, meaning you'll have to stretch them apart every time you put them on. And what's confusing is the earcups are actually quality sounding items themselves. I tested if there's sound quality change when the earcups are barely touching the ears vs letting the headphones clamp down on the ears. The results were negligible!If you've read through the review and still considering a buy, make sure you found a DIY video and see if you have the tools to modify it yourself or if it's worth your time and hassle to go through process."
"The sound is good. But the clamping force is too much. I wear glasses and it pushes my glasses out because of how hard the sides clamp on them. Also the ear cups and small and hurt my ear after may be 20 mins. Also, one of  the 2 cables, the black one has a contact problem and doesn't work properly, not a big deal since I can use the other cable but I think it shows that it wont last long."
"There's so much to like about these headphones. From a features only perspective, this is hard to beat especially at this price point. The issue here is that these are NOT over ear headphones. I have small ears compared to the rest of my demographic and these sit directly ON-EAR. The fact that I can't wear them makes all of the other features irrelevant. Regrettably returned them."
"I bought these headphones to stretch from my DAW to a piano. The product specs say 6ft or more and a coiled cord. The coil is tiny, less than 1/2 inches in diameter and doesn’t provide much length. Other than that they are okay headphones; sound quality is good."
"UPDATE: I've found that on a Windows PC / laptop with Realtek audio drivers, these sound even more muffled. Even using a 3rd party equalizer application and bottoming out most of the bass and mids and tuning up the highs, these are still very lacking in the high frequency / vocals department. The other annoyance I've come across (and I know these are considered DJ / studio phones) is that there is no resistance to the rotation of the cups / earpieces. As in, as soon as you pick these up or lay them down, the ear pieces like to rotate 180 degrees causing you to have to mess with them to get them straight to put back on your head. A minor set back for these but still part of my review.ORIGINAL REVIEW: To start out, they are comfortable to wear; however, if you have a larger head then they probably will not fit you well. I was impressed how well they sound for the price and I was also impressed how loud they are for not having an amp or being powered in any way. The bass is very good because of the larger drivers but this is also where they fall short and their downfall. Where they excel in bass they lack in treble. The highs are almost entirely lost. Because of this they are not great for movies, tv shows, audio books, classical music, etc. This seems to be the case for most of the sub $100 headphones I've tried out over the years with the exception of earbuds. I guess I'll keep looking for the unicorn."
"I tested these against a handful of other headphones including, Sennheiser HD280 and Sony WH1000XM4.For the price these are fine. The main problem is the base isn’t so boosted it’s not enjoyable. It overwhelms the rest of the audio. If you turn the volume down then the vocals and highs are more hidden. So they are fine for a song but fatiguing over time. Of course vs headphones hundreds of dollars more this is expected. Soundstage isn’t terrible for the price. The Sennheisers lacked base punch but were so much clearer and had immersive soundstage and were not fatiguing.The fit seemed good for the hour I tried them.With some lower base EQ these are far more balanced and you can actually enjoy them for more than a few songs. For $30 they may work for my daughter for school but I’m inclined to get something better so she can learn to enjoy music, and I doubt she will always remember to EQ adjust them or may not be able to depending on the use case. I also ordered some Audio Technicas for a little more that I will compare back here later.Songs tried: Ballad of the runaway horse, Tin Pan Alley, 24k Magic, Runaway, Hey Jude, Toto2/5 for audio quality, 3/5 or maybe 4/5 if you can EQ the base. Fit and finish good for the price."
"I needed a replacement pair of headphones quick and I was able to get these delivered same day, so my problem was mostly solved.When the package arrived and I unpacked the headphones, the first thing I noticed was the prevalence of cheap plastic used in the construction of these headphones. It is the kind of cheap plastic that might break if you look at it too hard.But I put all that aside and plugged the headphones into a source and cranked them pretty substantially and they sounded OK. Do they have the highest fidelity with zero distortion at absurd sound levels?? Absolutely not - but you shouldn't expect them to at their price point.From a sound perspective, they punch slightly above their weight when you consider price and value. They are loud, and the bass is decent, but they lake the depth and punch that high-end competitors have. Again, at this price point, this is definitely acceptable sound quality.My concern is that they don't feel substantial and sturdy enough to withstand very many normal DJ gigs out in the real world - and I'm not hard on my headphones at all. So when you consider their price in relation to durability, this is where you get what you pay for with these headphones.The cord that is provided is rather cheap and detracts from the overall appearance of the headphones. Every time I plug that brightly-colored cord in at a gig, I cringe a little bit!!"
"So first and foremost, the sound quality is great. I did have an issue at first with a weird echo that turned out to just be a setting in Windows that was enabling an ""audio effect"". Once disabled, the echo went away. Good bass, I enjoy listening to music with them.I'm not sure if I will keep them, I guess I have a large head (I wear an XL motorcycle helmet) and I find that they do put quite a bit of pressure on my head and I'm afraid I'll get headaches if I wear them for too long. Even adjusting them doesn't release the pressure at all.I also don't care for how the ear cups swivel so much - I get that it's so they can collapse for easier storage, but they seem to very very easily flip/swivel/rotate and then it takes me a moment to figure out how to rotate them back the right way again."
"I really liked these headphones a lot and felt like they really had good quality with the microphone and also with the audio quality, but they really did not stand up to very mild wear and tear and ultimately after buying more than one pair of these, one side of the headphone would become loose and not fit correctly around my ear it would be kind of bowing out. I liked that it had the adapters for the microphone and it really has a nice appearance. But overall several pairs of these have not lasted the test of time for me. I would not buy these again. Unless you're just using them for gaming. I don't game I just use them for music. But I feel that the way I use them may have more wear and tear than a gamer, so if you're a gamer, I would really disregard this review because I feel like you wouldn't be folding them up as much to take out with you which is ultimately what I think caused the headphone bow outward and be really loose feeling."
Sound quality not bad but it feels weird over your ears. Also the arrangement of the cords are weird too. There is a reason this one cost 1/6th to 1/8th of the price the decent ones sell for.If quality and good fit is not your priority then go for it.I am using it to listening Youtube videos on my computer during late night hours so I don't disturb others with noise.. As you can imagine the sound quality is not important for that purpose. If I want to record music or work on sound editing this thing will not be my choice at all.
I really Like this product.The Sound is goodand the fitting over the head is good as well.but it should come with an adapter to connect to phones.
"So the size and shape of the space between the padded part that goes on the ear is too big to be an ""on ear"" headphone, but too small to go over my ears. So it is actually quite uncomfortable.  I'm a 6'3 man, so maybe I have big ears.  But nobody has ever said that to me.So quality is pretty good. And I like the ability to daisy chain a second set of headphones into this one."
These head phones were for my disabled nephew who is hearing impaired among other things. He keeps his head phones on almost 24/7 and frequently falls asleep with them on. These head phones didn't look like they would hold up under such constant use. I didn't even open the cables so they can easily be restocked. I'm sure they are fine for typical use. They are on their way back to Amazon.
"the quality of these arent very good, sometimes scratchy when im using them"
"Love these headphones, however purchased them twice due to having a shortage in the cable connection. Hate having to listen to them while looking to the side in order to hear both sides of the headphones.Comfortable and pretty durable, also a affordable price. But adds up when you can't listen to both sides after a couple of months use."
I purchased a set of these for my electronic drum set. My biggest gripe is that the cans are very small and rest directly on my ears. The circular shape of the ear pads are not very ergonomic for the shape of an ear. These would be perfect for children though.
"I do not feel I am too tall. At 6'1 and 180 pounds, but now I am starting to wonder. Buying baseball caps and headsets has become difficult and everything is too tight if it is made in China. These feel cheap and flimsy do to compact size when folded."
"Excellent sound quality for the price. These were purchased to replace the next lower model headphones that failed 6 months to the day, by completely losing sound in the right side. They have a 30 day warranty! there should be some consideration for repeat buyers replacing broken products."
"I bought this because I' a video editor.  I didn't expect sound engineer quality but this headset is way too on the bass side.  I don't recommend for listening music, you won't hear the high ends."
"For an average guy it’s cheap and not a bad deal. Except after 5 years of use, they vinyl on the surrounding cap has started to come off. Other than it has been alright"
"I recently had the opportunity to try out the OneOdio Wired Over Ear Headphones, marketed as a Hi-Res Studio Monitor and Mixing DJ Stereo Headset. While they have some positive aspects, there were a few drawbacks that made them fall short of my expectations. Here's my detailed review:Let's start with the positive side. OneOdio Wired Over Ear Headphones excel in terms of comfort. The ear cups are well-padded and provide a snug fit, allowing for extended listening sessions without causing discomfort or fatigue. This feature makes them suitable for long commutes, work sessions, or casual listening.However, the price tag of these headphones left me disappointed in terms of quality. Considering the price point, I expected a higher level of sound reproduction and clarity. Unfortunately, the audio performance did not live up to my expectations. The sound lacked the crispness and depth I was seeking, resulting in a somewhat underwhelming listening experience.Another aspect that didn't meet my expectations was the microphone quality. When compared to cheaper wired earbuds available at half the price, the microphone performance of the OneOdio headphones was noticeably subpar. If you rely on clear and high-quality voice calls or recordings, you might want to consider other options.While the OneOdio headphones provide decent comfort, the lack of exceptional sound quality and microphone performance makes it difficult for me to recommend them. Considering the price point and the availability of alternative options in the market, I wouldn't personally choose to purchase these headphones again.In conclusion, the OneOdio Wired Over Ear Headphones offer comfort for extended listening sessions, but they fall short in terms of sound quality and microphone performance. The price is relatively high considering the overall audio experience provided. If you prioritize audio fidelity and microphone quality, it may be worth exploring other options before settling on these headphones.Disclosure: I purchased these headphones for personal use and have provided an unbiased review based on my own experience and expectations."
The large jack on the headset side didn't work. Only the 3.5 plug works. Tried three different cables same result. I guess for the price can't expect much.
The don’t fit my adult male ears. Feel very light and will probably break quickly. Other than that they seem fine. I’d say they are worth about $19
"The sound equality is not bad at all, a little exaggerated bass that makes sound clarity less prominent. The major issue I have with this set that it did not fit my head completely with the maximum extension, I feel like this is way smaller than it should be. They should have put more space for extension. I use many headphones and this is the first time I have this problem with a headphone set, meaning my head is not that big above average 😂"
"They are okay…serviceable. But I wouldn’t buy them again. I rather spend more money on better sounding headphones. I am using with my electric drum set, and my Simmons speaker amp sounds much clearer and louder. When I plug in my headphones I have to crank up the volume. And when I switch back to the speaker amp I have to remember to turn the volume down or get quite startled."
"I've owned 6 pairs of the headphones and every one of them eventually just falls apart. I don't put them in a bag or travel with them at all. They are just cheap quality. But, the fit and the style makes it work getting them over and over vs. more expensive headphones. I WISH they were better built, but if you need a cheap pair of over the hear headphones that fit well and last for… a while, these are a good option."
"Day 2 Update: Lowered to 3/5 because these caused me physical pain. I replaced these with the OneOdio A70 because the ear cushion is larger. I had immediate relief as soon as I put the A70's on. If you have ears bigger than 1.5-inches, then go with the A70's or A71's. However, just know that the A70's cable is a bit shorter than the regular OneOdio's cable, and you can't use the regular OneOdio's cable with the OneOdio's A70 headphones, or vice-versa. Sound quality between the two are the same.Day 1: 1 day delivery. Bang for your buck. Sounds great! A bit pitchy, but the Bass will rumble your ears a bit. The ear holes on the cushion are small (1.5-inch hole) so it's slightly uncomfortable for people with larger ears. The slight ear discomfort is the reason I give it 4/5.I'm using a Focusrite Scarlet Solo (3rd gen) and I'm trying to figure out how to equalize things."
"I've liked the sound of these headphones, but they need to come up with a better material for the outer gold headliner, and the foam ear cups, with have both disintegrating over the last four years, and with very little use.  I realize they are not high end, and still work, but they look horrible now."
was going to use it for silent guitar practice.
"I can't complain about the sound quality but the ear cups are very cheap and have no contouring whatsoever, so if you don't have child-sized ears you'll get them squished and it'll be uncomfortable after a short usage. I got them as starter headphones and need to upgrade ASAP because it's so uncomfortable."
"""1-Star""Fit - neither ""over ear"" nor ""on ear"" leaving part of your ear inside the can, and part mashed against your head.Clamping pressure- isn't enough to form a proper seal, which is actually a good thing (if you don't want your ear smashed).Padding - neither soft, nor rock-hard but somewhere in between.""3-Star""Finish - wasn't expecting anything amazing at this price, and this headphone set is in line with expectations. Decent plastics, and nice lookingCords - Nice that they give you (2) cords, with differing connections capabilities. However, the smaller (1/8"" jack) line for connecting to most portable devices is extremely ""microphonic""...it will pick up any sounds from adjusting the cord or tapping on surfaces and transmit straight to the earpieces.""3.5 Stars""Sound - these are pretty flat in frequency response. Not like some of the ""boomy"" cheap headsets out there. Bass is there, but lacking. Voices in the middle ranges are quite good, but high frequencies either roll-off or become sibilant (spitty sounding).Tested these with high-end home stereo and an old iPod.I didn't expect Dan Clark or Audeze quality for this price, but with all the positive reviews, these OneOdio headphones should have performed better.Honestly, the ONLY use case I can see these for is someone with small ears on a big head, looking for a cheap way to listen to podcasts. (these actually perform quite well with the spoken voice)"
My issue is the ear cups are very small and don't fit over my ears all the way and I have small ears. Definitely not good for glasses or earrings. The audio is fine but I only use them to watch TV so I'm not sure how they would do for music.
"Really solid, clear headphones. Base could be a bit better, but they're very good for the money. Very stylish, and after some months, the cushions and other soft parts of the headphones still look brand-new.BUT WAIT. AFTER SIX MONTHS THEY BROKE!However, I am downgrading my review from five stars to three stars because the plastic connection on the right side has come loose. It's only been 6 months. It's possible to pop it back in each time I put them on, but the issue is that the headphones don't hang properly or hug my head when it invariably pops back out. (EDIT: Can't pop it back in anymore.) It may seem like a small thing, but I have never had that particular problem with headphones. It makes them uncomfortable, hang loosely, and since the seal isn't made, they don't sound as good.BUT WAIT. THEY SENT ME NEW ONES! NO HASSLE!So I decided to NOT recommend these. But I wrote to the company. Generally, they make you go through hoops to get a replacement, including mailing it back, waiting six weeks, all that jazz. Skullcandy does this. Which is why at that point I just by new headphones.NOT OneOdio! They wrote me back very quickly and asked me to send them photos or a video, assuring me not to worry because it was under a 24-month warranty. I did so. Then boom! They said they put new ones in the mail. A week from contacting them, I had my new headphones in my hands. Listening to them now. Easy peasy.And is it just me, or do they actually sound better? Maybe it was because I was listening to my backup headphones for a while. The mids are very clear, and the highs are crystal. Again, the base could be more base-y, but it's solid. Some songs sound like they're in my head!Also, I forgot to mention in my original review that they are extremely comfortable, which many headphones are not when worn for several hours (looking at you, Skullcandy).Will the plastic bits wear out and pop out again? Maybe. We'll see. Could have been a fluke. Hopefully they hold up. But OneOdio stood by their product.If these hold up, I could definitely see myself getting some more expensive headphones from OneOdio. I wish every company had customer service like them. They're actually about making it easy on their customers, not hard.EDIT:Alas, a month or two ago, I had the same issue with the headphones. After about two years or so, maybe that's not so bad, but I am downgrading my review again. There are other options out there. This time, I paid more but went with Sony Studio Monitor headphones for $80. Done with OneOdio for now."
"I should be satisfied with what I already have, right? WRONG. I’ve been driving my Sundaras and BD DT1990’s with the ever popular Schitt stack (MAGNI 3+, MODI, LOKI) and thought I was happy, but as a freelance videographer and independent filmmaker, I had a specific need for closed-back cans that offered some degree of acoustic isolation to monitor audio while recording video.Keeping in mind this was how I made my living, I decided cost was no object. Nevertheless, I aways want the best possible value, so I decided to go the ChiFi route and settled on the OneOdio Pro-10 studio monitors. They just arrived yesterday and I honestly didn’t know what to expect. Here are my initial impressions:Overall musicality: Pretty good. The bass is prominent, but not overbearing. The bottom end is a bit flaccid and there is significant loss in detail below around 100 hz. The highs have some sibilance that is somewhat disappointing.Soundstage: There is none. All music plays in the center of your headLook and feel: They are really lightweight and that makes them reasonably comfortable. I wore them for an hour with no fatigue. The build quality is somewhat lacking. Rather thin plastic and I’d be hesitant to drop them for fear of breaking them, but who knows, they might hold up better than expected. Time will tell.Value: Incredible. I mean, for $31 I was very impressed.Now that you’ve indulged me in a bit of satire, let me come clean by saying all I needed was a pair of cans to monitor input audio on a camera. This is exclusively voice, so the actual demands on the headphones are minimal. Seriously. A $7 pair of Skull Candy earbuds did the job just fine. All I need from them is to tell me the mic is well placed, the background noise is minimal and there isn’t any problem with the mic cable or other hardware issue.But come on, a tiny pair of earbuds really undercut my image as a high-end media producer, so I wanted some earphones that presented the thin veneer of being expensive while actually being cheap as hell. They just need to look impressive, while being cheap enough that if they get trashed on a shoot, I could replace them without giving it a second thought.For this specific role, I wholeheartedly recommend the OneOdio Pro-10’s. You won’t find a better pair of headphones at twice the price!"
I used these for my guitar they aren't the best but they aren't the worstUsing the instrument to headphone cable that came in the box didn't quite give me a clear soundBut when I used my extra instrument cable I had laying around it sounded betterBut it only worked out of 1 ear
"I've purchased these headphones 2 times, and each has had a lifespan of less than a year. The plastic used to make the joints is cheap and prone to breaking, even through careful use and proper storage.The problem both times starts with a loss of tension over the ears, making them uncomfortable to wear and prone to ""leaking"" sound. Afterwards the black plastic snaps wherever the tension is highest, making the frame trashed and unusable unless you want dangling headphone cups hanging down on your ears with no support.Until they expire, this product works really well! Quality sound and comfortable. It's just not built to last. Which makes it, in my opinion, a garbage product. You should get your money's worth."
"THESE WERE GREAT...til they weren't.  I had last headset for years, this one works when it feels like it if I play with cords.  Not worth the money for far less than a year._________________________EDIT:  Desktop speakers I've had for about three and a half years, just stopped.  Ordered more, but won't arrive for two days and then I remembered this headset I keep set up to listen to audiobooks and just unplugged it, plugged it into my desktop, and voila!  SOUND.  Granted, not the greatest, but considering I had NO sound, this will be fine til my new speakers arrive.  Beats having to use the subtitle option on streaming!SO if your speakers ever go out, something to keep in mind.__________________________________________Got these to replace a Sennheiser Professional Headset which I have been using since 2017 and this is 2023.I USED THEM A LOT.  I would often fall asleep with them on.  Eventually one of them shorted out probably because I did fall asleep with them and a wire likely got pulled.If anyone hasn't noticed, things are a lot more expensive even in the last couple years.  I didn't want to spend a fortune, but wanted a decent headset to work with my Sony boombox I listen to audiobooks or music on EVERY night.I looked at TON of headsets, reviews, price, type of ear pads and chose this one.PROS:Right out of the bag (they came in a box, but within the box, not wrapped in plastic but a silky bag), I was impressed.  The ear pads looked PLUSHER than my Sennheisers did.  It overall looked really good quality.So...PLUSH EAR PADSTHEY SWIVELHEAD BAND - SOFTER than the SennheiserSOUND - comes with two jacks, the small one fit my boombox PERFECTLYand I immediately plugged in it and was impressed by the sound quality.  Is this going to rival professionalequipment in a sound studio?  NO.  But great for music and audiobooks.CONS:Just two so far (and I WILL update if they don't last, anything changes).  The ear pads, while PLUSH, are quite as big as the Sennheiser's.  They kind of sit more on top of your ears instead of really engulfing them.  I think I'm ok with that though.  Also the head band is not for a REALLY big head.  It's fine for me, but thought I would mention.BOTTOMLINE:  I'm HAPPY.  Got it on discount while on the Amazon sale.  Feel I got more than my money's worth.  Would get again, and if they hold up, I would get this again over the Sennheiser I had."
"Let's be honest they are not great headphones, they are built really good and I had it connected without any issues for almost a month. Today I had to do a return for the same one. The sound just stopped, and as I was recording a mix I was working on it just went caputz...Don't get me wrong the sound was clear and amazing for the price. I had it connected to my dj controller, I never had the volume very high anyway. So I looked for the return window and I'm still safe.I hope the replacement works longer than the first one, if doesn't then I will update the review again. I turned off my controller and restarted and no sound to my headphones."
"I bought these to use for narrating an audiobook. I've spent a couple of months using them a lot for editing. My head seems normal to me, but unlike the other reviewers, I find these very uncomfortable. The top padding is very squishy. I can feel the weight of the headset press the hard plastic down on the top of my head. Awful! The sound quality is... what is the opposite of sharp and clear? In addition, the earpieces swivel, as you can see in the pictures. Every gosh darn time you put them back on you have to reposition them.. backwards, upside down... what the hell! Do yourself a favor and buy yourself something better."
"These were great, at first. I've had them for 1 year and 3 months and recently they've begun to make ""creaky"" like noises when I move my body, turn my head, and laugh even, which diminishes the quality of the audio for my podcasts. Granted they're not an expensive headphone, so I'm not entirely disappointed because the playback audio is still great!"
Kinda small for over ear headphones. Not comfortable for me even when adjusted all the way out. Cables are illogical and poorly designed. TRRS cable connects on the right side and is DIRECTIONAL. TRRS cable is also only 1 metre long! 1/4 Plug TRS cable is far too large and bulky for headphones. Polymer for the outer jacket feels off and like it will disintegrate or attract dust. Cable has too abrupt of a diameter changes and will break. Does not include a TRRS to TRS 2x splitter which is insulting and bizarre. For this price point you would be better off with a generic pair from Walmart or the gas station.
"I am not sure if it was just the unit I received or the way the product is, but the volume kept jumping all over the place. It was extremely uncomfortable as they were not minor jumps. It’s like someone was constantly sliding the audio volume from 30, to 70, then 40, then 70 again, then 20, then 50. All in a matter of a few seconds. It was truly awful. Yes, I checked to make sure they were plugged in all the way. Unplugged and plugged them back in several times, same thing was happening. I even tried to find an audio driver for the brand and fiddled with advanced audio settings on my computer. I thought I fixed it, but as soon as I saved the settings and closed the window, it went back to jumping around.They were very comfortable so I was bummed, but actually unbearable with the audio jumping around like that."
"I needed a decent pair of wired headphones for online courses, and these are fine. The audio quality is pretty good for the price, but I personally don’t get the rave reviews saying they’re better than Sony or other top brands, I don’t hear that at all myself (although I know I am an “audio snob” and have had extensive training and experience in audio engineering so I may be biased toward the top brands). They’re about the same quality as my JBL earbuds in the same price bracket, but not anything astounding. The hinges on them are really odd to me, really loose so that the cans wobble around if they’re not being worn, and I don’t love that. They look really nice, love the color, the pads around the ears are comfortable but they’re on the small side - I have pretty small ears and they sit on the edges of my ear cartilage and my ears will get a little sore if I wear these for multiple hours. Overall, they’re good for the price. If you want a sound quality and overall quality of professional headphones, you won’t get it from these, but for $30 they’re good enough."
"Usually I don’t write bad reviews. I was super excited about these headphones, but when I opened them I noticed they were super cheap looking, but I thought that for the price it made sense and I still try them with my focusrite, because I got this for podcasting.The sound was super weird and for some reason on the right side I couldn’t hear anything then suddenly I was able to hear but it was super low. I decided to try it directly on my computer and the same problem.The fit was super uncomfortable, and the headphones are big but the noise is not sealed, you might think that this design will cover and seal your ear but it covers your ear but it’s so cheap that it doesn’t seal the sound.Also the headband sits weird on the head, I was deeply disappointed. I already requested a refund."
"I bought these looking for a good pair of headphones to listen to music and movies with. I was considering another gaming headset but I don't game that much where I need the directional audio and thought these would be great for just music and movies. I was wrong. The bass on these is very good. The mids and lows are great. If there is any kind of voice or higher pitched sound, it gets muddied out by the bass. All dialogue sounds like it's far away in comparison. Explosions, footsteps, etc. you feel but if someone is talking during it, you can't hardly hear them. It's great for music without words but not much else. Full ratings:Sound: 3 (Because it isn't balanced. Lows override highs creating uneven music)Bass: 5Comfort: 1 (Very uncomfortable for me to wear. They are very tight and give me a headache after an hour or so of wearing them)Setup: 5 (Very easy to set up, literal plug and play. Had to move my PC as the regular 3.5mm > 3.5mm cord is very short. Sound quality is worse with the red cable with no mix amp)Overall I would give these a 3/5. They are good for what they are good for. With some tinkering with my own equalizer on Windows I was able to get a respectable sound out of them but I don't like having to jump through hoops to make it sound good. The comfort is really a drawback for me as I wear headphones almost all day and I need them to be comfortable. The sound is great for musicians but not much good for anything else."
"I love the sound but they always break. I have gotten a replacement 2 times and gave up after the third time and just purchased another. I have 3 broken sets of these headphones. Don't let them fall on the floor. They will break at the ear peace joints. They will always break until they create a stronger design. Other than that, the quality of sound is beautiful."
"The headphones are functional and Ok for listening to a book, news or podcasts etc.,  but don’t expect much if but you’re looking for good headphones for music. As the saying goes, You get what you pay for."
"I did not anticipate these to resemble studio headphones; however, I expected better quality given the price. The bass response was nearly nonexistent, causing me to make adjustments to my PC equalizer to compensate. Overall, I find myself unimpressed."
"I've had these headphones for nearly 4 years now, they are dead reliable like an old Toyota, but are made with some of the cheapest materials I've seen on headphones, they feel like an early 2000s GM product, stylized mediocre quality plastics. I've had both sides of them crack and break in two right above the headphone driver/speaker.They sound fine, but certainly could use improvement. Slightly too bassy for my tastes. If more bass is your preference, go for it, but beware of how easily these things break apart."
I used this on my electronic drumset. It worked pretty good. Not as loud as I had hoped but for the price it does the job.
"Sound quality is good. Construction quality is good. Your ears need to be on the small side for these to truly fit comfortably ""over"" the ear."
"..... but my daughter has hydrocephalus so her head it slightly larger than normal.  ANY lead on even larger shiny pink car eared OVER the ear headphones would be GREAT.  Also, the seller did a GREAT job of correcting the mistake of shipping the wrong size out the first time."
The headphones have a good sound so I have no complaints on this. I do have a complaint on the confort on the ears. It's not as comfortable as I'd hoped but not real unco.fortable. I also want to comment on the length of cord. I ended up having to buy an extention for the cord length. Outside of the main complaint on cord length I'm fairly hapy with them. Thank you
I like the headphones and they sound great.I think they are just a little bit too Lightweight.They are working though for me
Sound is decent but the ear muffs are uncomfortable on my ears. Too much movement on them and they just hurt after wearing them.
All fine but earphone cord.  Have to manipulate the plug into the headphone jack to make good connection.
"I wanted to love these. They are a large set of headphones with soft padding. They come with a nice storage bag and two sets of cords. I like the idea of unplugging them at the headphone itself to use differnt cords. My one big problem is that these are over the ear headphones and the headphones have round cups! I do not have round ears so my ears are not completely inside the cups. After an hour my left ear started to hurt as the soft padding easily pushes in to put my ear on a hard part of the frame. My ear ached for several hours afterwards. Also, when I first put them on my ears started to itch and would not stop. I cleaned them off with some alcohol wipes and that problem went away so they must have had some chemical residue on them. They sound great. The tone is outstanding. The bass is not that great so if you are in to heavy bass these may not be for you. I am not returning them I will use them but not for long as they hurt my ears after  about an hour. I usually switch headphones after a while anyways for a different sound. Thanks to Amazon for one day delivery for free. Good Luck BP  PS; I do not believe my ears are bigger than the normal joe!"
"I bought these headphones because my good ol reliable studio headphones broke after several years of service, and lets just say I was expecting a lot more. The audio quality was nice, I could hear my computer again but the headphones made entirely out of plastic and cushioning. All the metal parts (except for the electronics) in the photos are all shiny plastic! And they're light as hell too, my Xbox gaming headset is lighter than this! But for their use, they work just fine and I can finally hear what my audio after the retirement of my old headphones.I would strictly recommend that one uses these headphones ONLY for the most DELICATE of tasks. I'm talking about editing, writing, homework, work, studying, etc. Use these for gaming? Unless you're a calm gamer then sure but if you're a very intense gamer, then save up for the turtle beaches."
"First, these were just a bit too small for me. Now, I have a slightly larger than average head, I'll admit, but I've never had a paid of headphones that didn't fit like this. Bigger headed folks, beware.Second, despite the big cushions, these things were really pressing on my ears and head. I do a lot of audio work throughout the day, and I had these on for maybe half an hour before I had to take them off because of how uncomfortable they were, no matter how I tried repositioning them. Again, big head problem? Maybe, but not a problem I've encountered to this extent.And finally...these. Sounded. Bad. The high and mid tones were weak, and the low end was muddy. Maybe I got a bad set, but I felt like i was listening to my audio through a down comforter or something. It was the worst I've ever heard, but it was bad enough that I returned them today.If you have a smaller head, consider this a 2 star review, as it would probably fit more comfortably. But the audio quality is just not acceptable, even for this price. Spend about $20 more and grab some Audio-Technica ATH-M20X or something. They won't be the best headphones you've ever heard, but they are a LOT better than these."
"I previously purchased these headphones (almost 3 years ago) and was actually going to get a ""better"" pair (Pro 50, more premium ear padding, same 50mm driver, questionable tuning difference). I opted to save $20 and get what I already had (just needed a second pair, they sound GREAT!). I was thrilled that they came the same day with Amazon Prime and was excited to try them out, but as soon as they touched my ears I noticed 2 things: padding was still soft but not quite as supple (could change over time, but I don't remember the first pair feeling like this at the start) and (most importantly) THEY ARE SMALLER ON THE INSIDE!! My ears literally could not fit inside of the cups - yes, I have a big head and perhaps big ears to go along with it, but they haven't grown any bigger in the past 3 years. Or even if they did, my first pair of headphones grew along with them. I kinda tried to move them around, but it was no go. I took them off and compared them to my first pair and could immediately see that they had shrunk the inside of the earpiece. Not my imagination, see the attached pics - old pair on left, new pair on right, white area in 2nd pic is the area of the ear space from new pair.PROBABLY gave it more padding to make it more soundproof, but that doesn't work for me. These are going back immediately. Tragic, since I really like them. I may try one of the oval pairs if they use the same driver, but I hate it when a company screws up a good thing."
"I ordered these back in 2018 and the concept is great! I like the interchangeable cord with different size male ends, however the quality is subpar. Eventually the padding on each earpiece starts to peel and leaves black pieces of material all over my ears and scattered about. It’s good to get approximately 6 years out of them, but wish they could last longer."
"Very comfortable and worked well with MP3 and laptop, but could not hear anything with my micro recorder which was the whole purpose I purchased these headphones."
"I originally bought these headphones in December 2021 for use at another residence where the common living room and bedroom areas were adjacent to each other. They worked great for a while but like the old adage goes, buyer beware! After I moved late last year, I noticed the wiring on them was getting loose because it was losing audio consistently on the left headphone. So, needless to say, I ordered another pair hoping to get them sometime last week, but lo and behold, I never get them delivered to my new residence's address and only get notifications that they are delayed in getting shipped out. So, all in all, they are great for a max of 2 years and after this shipping fiasco, I'm going to buy a different pair of headphones due to my current predicament."
The cord is nice and long but headset is not especially comfortable.
"I bought this exact pair of headphones back in 2019 and they are still working fine. I'm no expert in headphones and I just wanted something to be able to record music along with doing other general things on the internet. The ear cushions are starting to flake off but that's about it. Decided to check these out again but was a bit worried when I saw a fairly recent review from someone that was in a similar situation as me. When they arrived I also decided to do a side by side comparison and they definitely changed something...On my older pair the bass is definitely NOT as overpowering as this newer version. Which could be a plus if that is what you are into. Also it seems to have a more boxy kind of sound. I tested it with two different genres of music and whether you are at low volumes or have it cranked you definitely lose some mid range clarity with the more bass focused headphones.They also feel more tight on my head. To be fair, they haven't had 3 years of being broken in so that could be the case. I wear glasses and had a different pair that were always tight on my head and I couldn't wear them for more than 2 hours, so I'm not sure I wanna risk it.I was hoping they were the same as my first pair and I could swap this out as my main headphones but unfortunately I'm going to be returning them and looking for something else."
"I think the sou d quality is great, but it's really uncomfortable to wear for extended  periods of time."
"I decided to upgrade my headset (which I primarily use for gaming). However, I don't game online so I have absolutely no need for the mic that ALL gaming headsets come with. My previous one was an on ear so I went with an over ear...big mistake. All of these companies should actually measure peoples ears and offer various sizes instead of things meant for gerbils. This one has a fairly high clamping force and rests directly on the upper and back cartilage of my ear, so it becomes very painful, very quickly.The sound is good, much better than my previous one. However, I often find myself reverting to my older set so that I can play games or watch videos for long PAIN-FREE periods."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I 'like' the sound. 🤔I'm good with the price point. 🙂I love that the ear cups rotate and that it comes with a couple of earphone cables. 😃I'm diggingI HATE THAT IT'S MADE ENTIRELY OF CHEAP-A** PLASTIC!! 😡I've purchased a half dozen of these and they all, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM BREAK AT THE PIVOT POINT ON THE EAR CUP!!Whether bumping into the phones, or dropping the phones, or the phones feet jostled in a bag, or orcs just an unknown contact, THEY ALL BREAK THE SAME DAMN WAY!Here's a 'suggestion' that I would strongly implore that (the manufacturer) should consider:USE LIGHTWEIGHT METAL, LIKE ALUMINUM, FOR THE MOST MOVABLE JOINTS LIKE AT THE EAR CUPS!Aluminum might bend a little, warp, a little, but it can also be reshaped.IT SHOULDN'T JUST SNAP AND BECOME TOTALLY USELESS...because ya BUMPED INTO IT!! 🙄Just try it out. Even raise the dang price $10-20 for the metal version.And PLEASE make me a part of the pilot program!I guarantee you'll be selling out of these of they aren't soooo brittle.I just purchased my last pair out of 'need'. I've GOTTA find a solid, good-sounding, fair-priced, set of headphones with rotating earcups, made of solid materials that WON'T SNAP SO DAMN EASILY!😩Any suggestions? Hit me up!😜Cheers!😀🍻-ALS"
"Love the sound these had.  Great extra long wire.  However, simply hurt to wear them.  Ears felt numb after 1-2 minutes."
I didn't like the way my ears felt after wearing these for over thirty minutes. They felt heavy to the ones I'm going to replace them with. The sound is great!
"The sound quality on this is fine, but the sound drops often. I'll randomly set my headset down on my desk or hang it on my mic arm and come back and  the sound has stopped coming through. I check my sound settings/mixer, I check if I accidentally muted something, and it's still detected but zero sound is coming out."
"These headphones sound really good for the price point. The build quality is better than expected too. The only thing that really annoys me with these headphones and the reason I’m sending them back is the swivel. It’s too much and there is no detent to keep them in one place so every time you take them off the ear cups flop around all over the place and makes it annoying putting them back on quickly. I’m going to try the oneodio studio hi-fi ones that are a similar price but don’t swivel as much. This may not be a problem for you, but I put them on and off a lot and it drives me crazy."
These are for kids...fully extended to just barely fit..and ear cups do not cover ears..they rest on the bottom earlobe.  Could have been decent...but too small all the way around if you are a normal sized adult. Due to size un comfortable
"TL:DRMaterials: Cheap.Sound quality: quite Decent but a bit heavy on the lower ends and weak on the higher ends.Over Ears: For people with larger than average heads or slightly larger ears than a 10 year old you will notice the headphones are more like on ear instead of being over ear.the quality of materials feel a bit on the cheep side of materials, The only part of this headset that is metal are the adjustment strips and the arch band on the inside of the padding so they would wear out slower, all the other parts are plastic and i could see many of them breaking quickly if the user is someone who takes their headset off many times a day and plops them on their desk.The Speakers/Drivers are decent for audio and the noise cancelling works as you may expect .My problem with these headphones is if you have a slightly larger head than average you may struggle to have them sit over your ears correctly and they will tend to drift up your head, The ear pads are also not as soft as one may think from what the description says.Since the ear pads are circular so they will tend to sit on either the top, bottom or back of your ear, This will cause pressure sensitivity on already soft skin, If you do buy these and notice this problem.it is up to you if you return them but if you plan to keep them i would 100% recommend getting replacement ear pads for them that are softer and will form over the ear instead of pressing down on them like the factory ones do."
"I really wanted to love these headphones, but I simply can't because they lack comfortability. They have a tight fit while wearing them which gives me a headache. I hope I can at least use them for the purpose I got them for which is to record vocals. I have a different pair I use for mixing and mastering, because I definitely can't use these for long periods. The sound quality is decent, and they look really nice! But all that means nothing if they hurt while you wear them."
"Each pair lasted about a year after taping them back together everywhere they broke. The plastic construction does not hold up well. They are heavy enough that if you drop them it they will almost always be a crack that will open up and and eventually fall completely apart. The faux leather bits will crack and start peeling off after about a year as well, more so on the ear pads.However, for the price they cannot be beat, the sound quality is good and you can get 10 pairs for the price of one equivalent pair with potentially the same durability problems...so I give it 3 stars"
"I need to have mine on and off a bunch of times, and I found the ""foldability"" to be a pain.  They will fold nicely for travel and transport, but I found that feature to be a nuisance; they were always turned to some odd configuration when I went to put the back on - like a puzzle.  See the photo for what I mean.  Sound was OK and they were comfortable once I got them set, but getting them set could be frustrating.  Not for me, but OK for someone who will put them on and leave them on for a long period - flight, train, etc."
I purchased this item and it worked great but the left ear doesn't sit flat down on my ear. It turns out that the arm is broken and is defective.  I wish I could have known that it was not normal sooner. They sound great but I can't use them because they don't sit right.
I don't like these.  They work fine regarding sound.  I find that the fit and ease of use is lacking.  Too much articulation with the ear pads.  They rotate and flip flop around too much.My advice is to save your money and put it towards something better like Sennheiser.
"The following review is based on my experience. That being:Audio-technica ATH-m20XRazer kraken 7.1Bose Quietcomfort 35 IILogitech G230Build quality:They look cheap. There is no getting around this. Most of this is due to the chrome plastic. Construction wise they don't seem to have a lot of flex and seem to be decently well built.The cable is another matter. The cable itself feels close to a nice headphone cable but the connectors on the end are VERY cheap and not attached very well. Strain relief is provided by a ""Bic pen"" spring. (The pictures show a rubber strain relief) That being said: The cable can be easily replaced and that was the main reason I chose this set.Comfort:It is hands down more comfortable than the Razer headset. It doesn't clamp my head like a vice but is still a but tight for my (small) head. It loses quite a bit to the Audio-technica (but at almost half the price that is acceptable) At a similar price-point I liked the logitech headset a little better. (Doesn't clamp your head and has oblong ear pads rather than circles.)Audio quality:Again, it loses to the Audio-technica set but beats the razer set. It seems to tie the logitech headset for quality. Has a much better high end than the bose headset (but NC headsets struggle with the high end in my experience) but this is very subjective.Noise canceling:Non existent.  The audio-technica set has some passive noise canceling but not much. The bose is a nice active set and such has an unfair advantage. This headset is similar to the logitech and razer in terms of passive cancellation.Conclusion:I purchased it for the ""Line out"" feature. If you don't need this I would almost recommend the logitech G230 for the same price. It is more comfortable and sounds about the same. If you can spend a little more the audio-technica is a solid (durable) set that wins in almost every way."
"Unfortunately, after six months, one side of the headset stopped working"
"These are lightweight but they're not very good quality. They're definitely not noise canceling. I wore them in my house and even the brand new very quiet washing machine was something I could hear over the music. The bar on top kind of fits oddly and hurts your head. And they slip around a lot and don't stay on. I tested them against another item and the others were like being in the studio, you could hear every aspect of the vocals and better range."
"Tl;Dr Keep looking, trust me on that.Let's start with the build quality. The plastics used in these headphones are cheap, thin, and flimsy. The hinges at the ear cups are loose and floppy which for me caused issues with the sound quality more on that later. There's foam in the ear cups and at the top of the head but that foam isn't robust enough to provide real padding, it just squishes down and you feel the edges in the plastic anyway. The fit is adjusted by sliding the ear cups in and out, but the little tabs there are cheaply constructed, so the cups end up loosening when you turn your head.But okay, it's a 30-ish dollar pair of headphones, right? As long as the music sounds good...But they don't sound good either. Most of the issue stems from the cheap construction. The floppy ear cups aren't held to the side of the ear with any force, and the poor fit causes sound to leak through. So the noice cancellation is ruined, to whatever extent they would have cancelled noise. At the same time, judging by the cheap construction, they used cheap components inside the headpheadphones. Certainly the volume of the unit doesn't impress, subtle notes particularly at the high end are lost and rather than slapping the bass sort of nudges. I even tried squeezing them to my head, it's not the fit these are just painfully low quality headphones.I have a list of complaints, in the end. The port for the cable is poorly placed so that if you plug them in and lay down the jack scratches your neck. There's a foam layer over the top of the strap, it doesn't make them feel more quality but sort of exaggerates the bulk, makes them seem more robust than they are. The ear cups swivel, I guess for storage, but even that is so loosely constructed they just flip around in the vertical axis too.I guess you don't need a 1000 word essay on the matter. These are still too cheap, you're gonna have to go up in the price range."
"The comfort level of the headphones wasnt what I expected , though I have a big head lol."
"I just wish they were wider overall to fit my head. I wear glasses and when I put these headphones on it crushes my ears against my glasses and head. Not comfortable at all for me. I didn't think my head was that big, but I guess so. If I were smaller these would be fair for the price. I got them for the removable jack, in case my cat chews the cord..."
"Although the reviews were good, especially the video  from the Jamaican gentleman, however this  product indicated that it can be used with Samsung phones (I have an S22). After opening the box, I discovered that I need to purchase a USB C adapter to plug into phone in order to hear audio on phone. There were no instructions, and I had to ask someone at my office what I needed. The box says ""Adapter-Free."""
"I have other headphones and don't have a problem with them easily covering my ears, but these don't extend down quite far enough to not bother my ears. I'm an average size guy.I can't comment on the sound quality because they didn't fit well so I haven't listened to much with them.They seem well made."
The plastic is not hard enough in the areas. He broke too easy. They were great speakers sound was great plastic it was holding earpieces broke off to dag on easy easy hopefully it holes tried super glue.
"This is a review of my personal experience, you might get these and love them, other people who bought these and love them might think I'm nuts, it's all subjective. But what isn't is the build quality, right off the bat, right out of the box they felt really cheap. Then I put them on, the earpads are not comfortable, 2 minutes on and I was ready to take them off. One of them was hurting my ear, no comfort to these whatsoever.The sound quality, is... not great, you can feel the bass I'll give them that but it's hardly a win in the overall picture here.You look at the price tag of these and you think to yourself, look at the number of 4.5-5 star reviews, it's too good to be true, right? the answer is, yes, it is indeed too good to be true. You get what you pay for here, super cheap plastic headphones.I understand you won't get super quality in a price range like this, it's budget, we get that but I'm thinking to myself there has to be another pair that's at the very least a lot more comfortable than these, I would have put up with the crappy sound quality if at least they were comfortable, they're awful in that way."
"I got a set of these for christmas in 2021. I really liked them and they fit well (encapsulating my ears). Over time, the leather-like material on the ear pieces started to crack and break down, leaving bits of black fabric all of the place and on my shirt/ears. However, I still liked the feel, so despite them only lasting ~18 months, I decided to buy a replacement set.The new set appears to be made slightly differently. Maybe to correct the issue of the fabric breaking down, the ear pieces are made with a different material. They are also smaller, so instead of fitting over my ears, they now sit on top of them, and the headset slides around a bit. If I turn my head too fast, they can also slip or fall off. Looking at the pictures closer, the new headset does resemble the pictures, so I assume this is the new style and not just a difference between the colors.So while the sound quality is good, I'm not sure how long these new ones will last. The previous ones were less than 2 years. And the new style doesn't fit as well."
"I bought these to hear and I'm happy with them for that. They're a little smaller than I expected, but they will work. Not if I had bigger ears though.My daughter tried them but didn't like the mic so she switched back to the old headphones with a better mic, even though they cut out a lot."
the hing broke after long use they sound nice and made of plastic after about 4h of use in a day made my head hurt
"So I will say this, for the price these are surprisingly professional looking with the look and feel of a much more expensive set of headphones.  I love the red wire that has some coiling in it, nice touch.  So here is the problem I had.  Within a few months of very light and normal use, the wire starting cracking, so I had to play around with it to get audio through.  OK, fine.  So I reach out to the seller through Amazon to explain what happened.  I have yet to hear back from anyone there and it's been almost a couple weeks now.  **UPDATE** soon after the review was posted the company responded and sent me a new cable.  It works fine so far, but it wasn't the same cable.  Not red with coils, just standard black.I'm not saying this will happen to you, but I felt it was worth sharing.  There are so many other cheap headphone companies you can try your luck with."
"For a lightly used pair of headphones that sit at my home office, I enjoyed these until I noticed a light crack in one side adjuster causing them to not be as ""snug"" on my ears anymore. It's a cheap design that is a very easy part to replace or probably replicate via a 3d printer - OneOdio does not sell parts, which sucks and while fidgeting with it due to that problem, the other side broke so they slip around.. and of course one thing leads to another, the foam covers deteriorated... I'm giving two stars.. I won't be going back to One Odio, and will try another brand - preferably one that stands behind their product."
"I got those because they work with two sizes of jacks. My main complaint is that these headphones seem to be designed to always show their wrong side to my ears. The pivoting ears are irritating, and I am not sure why they exist. To save space in shipping?"
"I specifically ordered these to block out any noise at my workplace, especially female voices. I have the sound up at 2/3’s and can still hear everyone talking. I don’t want to turn the sound up more than I have to. It fits very snugg around my head to the point of hurting after 35 minutes. The sound is great though."
"I produce music in my free time and I started out using the Cowen E7 headphones which are pretty good but mine recently broke and I've been trying to find something similar if not better for a lower price point... These are it. I'm actually very surprised by these headphones. The bass and kicks sound amazing. The highs are good. Noise cancellation is great. The only downside that these have are they are extremely tight and will definitely get uncomfortable after wearing for too long, unfortunately. But I mean... I can't imagine it gets better than these, especially for this price, omg.UPDATE: So it's two days later and these headphones have proven to be extremely uncomfortable for my head and ear type. i.e. if you have a larger, rounder head or larger ears these aren't going to be comfortable at all for you. It's a shame because the sound quality is great (which is why I initially gave it 5 stars) but wearing these for more then 5 minutes gives me headaches and ear pains... the shape/design is indeed ""weird"" it seems as if they're made for someone with the head shape of an alien lol the top is wide and the bottom is very slender... painful, um I might have to return them if I can't find anyone with the right head shape to gift them to... buy at your own discretion... I would recommend Cowen E7 for music production... but they're about $30 more expensive than these but you can't make music or even focus on work when headphones are this uncomfortable****UPDATE:It’s about 3 months later, I decided to keep the handphones. My initial review still stands, the sound quality on these is amazing. They’re still very tight and make my ears sore after awhile but I recommend these."
"Let me start by saying, this Bluetooth headset is almost everything I could have asked for. The sound quality? Incredible. The battery life? Outlasts my longest work-from-home marathon sessions. And the fit? Snug as a bug. Honestly, for those key reasons, it deserves five stars.But… and it’s a big one... the microphone.You see, the mic quality isn’t just bad; it’s relationship-altering bad. Let me explain.It all started last Thursday when I was at the grocery store. I had the headset on, listening to a podcast on “how to cook the perfect steak” (because, you know, priorities). Out of nowhere, a woman taps me on the shoulder and says, “Hey, those are some nice headphones!”I respond, ""Oh, thanks! I just got them; they sound great!"" You know, normal small talk. I thought nothing of it and went about my day.But here’s where the Bluetooth headset became the villain of my story. Unbeknownst to me, my lovely wife, Sarah, had called me during this grocery run. And thanks to the poor microphone, all she heard was a garbled mess. Something like:""Hey, I just met this girl—she’s great!”No, I did not say that. But that’s what she heard.I didn’t even realize she was on the other end, listening to what she thought was the start of a soap opera called My Husband’s Betrayal. I didn’t notice her silence as I chatted away about the produce aisle.By the time I got home, she was already packing her bags. I tried to explain that it was just a Bluetooth miscommunication. “It’s the mic!” I pleaded. But she just shook her head and said, “The mic doesn’t lie.”Now, I’m sitting in an apartment with great acoustics—perfect for testing headphones, by the way. I’ve had time to ponder my life choices and the tragic role this headset played in my demise.So, if you’re in the market for a Bluetooth headset with great sound quality but a mic that might accidentally ruin your marriage, then look no further. It’s got everything you need… except a crystal-clear microphone and, well, my wife.Final thoughts: 5 stars for audio, 1 star for the mic. Divorce papers pending."
"Okay for a pair of wireless headPHONES but ...Okay I saw these were at a good price range, wireless, foldable and had very high marks in reviews. I was glad to find them cause the built-in mic on my phone is misbehaving and lately people only ever hear me when I have it on Speaker. I ordered hastily so this is just as much my fault for not checking more listings first. That being said, I'm still irritated and unhappy with these as a purchase.The design is smooth without any protrusions, they're light as a feather and the sound reproduction is actually pretty great which isn't something I've come to expect from headsets in this price range. They don't sound tinny, high highs and low lows don't wash out the rest of the sound coming through and on games it had no audio delays. The connection was also solid until you hit the max range and the Battery drain rate was excellent. I had it connected for 3 full days and it still sounded crisp when I played games.What was so bad about it then? Just a little thing called a Microphone which is what separates a HeadSET from HeadPHONES! It came with a microphone as was advertised but it barely registered my voice. At first I thought it was muted somehow but there is NO Mute feature listed in the booklet it was sent with. THAT sucks, BTW. It's not even in FULL English. It just stops translating in ENG abruptly after the rundown of the basic functions for each button. Later after getting frustrated I grabbed the phones in my right hand to put them away and maybe even return them if I don't figure something out. When my thumb touched down near the port on the surface I saw the sound meter on my desktop flash briefly. I started tapping on the shell and as I progressively used more and more speed/force to tap it the sound meter got higher but it petered out right around 30% registered sounds. To get it to 30% I had to damn near punch the thing though. Yeah real great microphones definitely shouldn't only pick up sound via blunt-force trauma. So I came back to Amazon to once again try to find a decent wireless headset. This one was so close, too. Very disappointed the one feature that sucked was the microphone."
"These sound great once you get them paired... that's the deal... And when I say it LITERALLY TAKES 2 TO 3 MINUTES to find the headphone name on the scanning list on screen, then the real waiting begins.......I timed it after about 19 times of it taking way too long to pair, and at 3 minutes and 23 seconds, it finally paired!!!  After all the wait, I guess it was worth the 20 bucks I paid for these... Human nature at work here... they became too sensitive to pairing, would lose connection for no apparent reason, and then the charade starts allover again....damn...what a shame 😕... they sound pretty damn good, but 20 minutes later... you get the picture... I will be forgetting I own these...Oh wait, I ALREADY HAVE!!!  20 DOLLAR DUST COLLECTORS..."
"Let me start off by saying that I wear glasses. Wearing these headphones forcibly squishes the top part of my ears inside of the cups and presses my glasses frame clean into the side of my head -- very painful over extended periods of time. It's handy that they're adjustable on the headband, but there's no comfortable setting for saving my ears from being crushed. Buyers beware if you wear glasses.Regarding connectivity, they function but have some hiccups with connectivity. I've paired these headphones up with five different Bluetooth devices. Syncing up was successful on every one, but 3/5 had a complete disconnect within an hour. Two of them refused to pair up again until I powered off the devices and waited 5 minutes. In terms of reliability, I'd have to question it and certainly wouldn't want to rely on it in a crisis situation. That being said, they're serviceable and DO work decently overall.The cups themselves swivel, in which the only purpose it serves that I can think of is being collapseable for storage purposes. In effect the headphones can ""fold"" up. Nifty if you're frequently travelling or very mobile, but not so great for comfort (as described earlier) or for durability. This leads me to my next concern being that the swivels (where the cups attach to the base) are not reinforced. Too much torque or pressure applied and I'm very confident they'd break clean off -- with no hope of repair, I might add. You definitely have to be very careful with pulling them on and off.I've worn these headphones (off and on again to rest the pain felt by my ears and the side of my head) for easily 6 hours in one stretch when I was editing audio files on my mini pc and only lost about 10% of battery when my editing session was done. Bass sounds are surprisingly quite rich with these, and while not ""noise-cancelling"" in the technical sense, they do have enough good aural sound inside the cups to block out a lot of environmental noise. Treble levels are good and the volume range is actually surprisingly good too -- was not expecting the volume range to be great at all so the fact it is has been is being treated as an added bonus.Overall, I rate this product a 3/5. It's very decent for sound quality and acceptable for the price -- especially so when on sale -- but the comfort just isn't there for those of us who have worn glasses (i.e. ""corrective lenses"") for most of our lives and also not quite there is the overall construction quality. If these two issues were addressed properly, this manufacturer/company would have the affordable Bluetooth headphones world by the tail! I genuinely want to love them but simply cannot because of the physical harm inflicted upon me just by wearing them. Hope this review helps!"
The sound is good however when I put these on they are very loose fitting. If I wanted to run they would fall right off. Now on the plus side if it's cold out and I need to wear a winter hat they fit perfect. Downside is I will have to keep looking for another set of headphones for the warmer months
"I got a couple of these due to the price.  The sound is okay, but I wasn't expecting too much.  The only thing I'm disappointed with is the material they used for the ear cushions.  They started to disintegrate less than a year later."
"UPDATE: I have had these headphones for two months, and for the most part they have not connected easily. I have to constantly turn off the blue tooth on the PC, even though it all said, ""connected"", but no sound came out. Today (9/6//24) I tried several times for it to connect, but again even though the headphones turned on, and seemed like they ""paired"" and then said, ""connected""--nothing.  I immediately switched to my older headphones (I was missing my livestream program that was on!), and as soon as I turned THEM on, all was well--they immediately connected and worked.I don't know what else to say here, except I am a little disappointed that I am having so much trouble connecting them to my PC, and having them work. But WHEN they work, they're fine.When I look for lightweight headphones, that is what I expect.I took a chance in getting these, trying to save some money and was hoping they were what I had before, but were wired.  They were not.They work. Connected quickly to my PC, so I guess I'll have to deal with them for now. They just aren't as comfortable as I would have liked them to be."
"This is an otherwise great pair of headphones with quality better than I expected - and a fairly long battery life.But why does it beep every time I play pause. Happens in ALL my apps - youtube, Spotify, Disney+ etc. the first version I bought didn't do this. Extremely annoying. Is there a way to disable it??"
"These sound OK.  The sound is clear with no static.  I'm not an audiophile, but I think they lack the bass that my previous pair of Bluetooth headphones had.There are a few problems that make these a little annoying to use.Connecting To Two Devices-------------------------------These headphones can connects to two Bluetooth sources, but it only connects to one of them automatically.  I have paired the headphones with my Windows 10 laptop and Android my phone.  When I turn on the headphones, they automatically connect to one or the other device.  To connect the other source I have to go into its list of paired devices and click the connect button.I have two other Bluetooth headphones that reliably connected to my two device automatically when I turn them on.Two Audio Sources----------------------I have not tested these headphone's ability to handle a call.I have tested multiple audio sources at the same time.  It seems to handles two sources quite well, but I believe some of this behavior is up to the software being used.If I am are listening to a song with Amazon Music's (web site) on the laptop, and then start playing a YouTube video on my phone, the audio from the phone does not come through.  YouTube silently plays the video with Close Captioning enable.  While the video is playing if I pause the song on my laptop, the sound from the video comes through.In contrast, when I'm playing a song on my laptop and then start playing a voice message on my phone, the song on the laptop pauses and the voice mail audio comes through.  When I pause the voice mail playback, the song resumes on the laptop.Controls----------There's something not quite right about the ""Volume Up/Skip Forward"", ""Power/Pause"", ""Volume Down/Skip Backward"" buttons.  On these headphones, I often find myself skipping to the next or previous song instead of increasing or decreasing the the volume.On my two other headphones a quick press of the ""Volume Up/Skip Forward"" button would increase the volume.  A long press would Skip Forward.  A very long press would increase the volume by multiple steps.In contrast, with these, headphones a quick press skips to the next song.  A long press increases the volume.  A longer press increases the volume multiple steps.  If I want to increase the volume one ""notch"", I have to do a long press, but not too long otherwise the volume goes up more than I want, and not to short otherwise it skips to the next song.  I find it hard to get the buttons to do what I want.  Perhaps I have been trained by my other headphones.  I see the logic in these headphone's controls scheme, but I believe the other control scheme is better.Announcements-------------------These headphones have voice announcements.  The female voice sounds natural (not synthesized), but the voice actor has an accent, or English is not her first language... or maybe the voice is synthesized and it is have trouble producing the correct sounds.""Power On"" sounds like ""Power Ong""""Power Off"" sounds like  ""Power Opf"",""Connected"" sounds almost  normal ""ConnecTED"",""Maximum Volume"" sounds like ""Maximum Voloom"","
"I have purchased 3 pairs of these.  These headphones are generally easy to operate, provide great sound quality, and are quite affordable.The charge for playtime has varied between sets.  The last pair that I purchased, which was teal, runs down on power very quickly, faster than the first 2 pairs that I purchased, which were black.  The color shouldn't matter, but it did in my case.I purchased 3 due to contamination.  There is no easy way to clean these headphones, and the material appears to be prone to holding or growing mildew and fungus.  I purchased a replacement pair after trying to clean the first set, repeatedly.  Although I have been wearing headphones for 20+ years and never had this problem before, I thought that it might be a user error on my part.  Now, I do not believe that it is a user error.  The same problem with mildew happened on the second set of headphones.  Whatever material they use is prone to contamination.  The way that the headphones are made, there is no easy or logical way to clean or disinfect the earbuds.  This is a design flaw.  I have never had to disinfect any other pair of headphones over 20 years beyond a quick wipe.  When I say prone to contamination - whatever this material is likely traps sweat and just incubates.  Even with regular wiping of the earphone cup, the skin on the ear that touches that cup has begun to peel, which suggests that not only does it hold and incubate mildew, fungus is at play.I have had to throw these headphones away.  It's a shame.  The sound quality and price are great.I would not recommend this if you sweat, even if (as I assume one would do) you bathe regularly and disinfect your headphones.  There is something about the material that is not conducive to regular, continued use.  You will continually buy and trash these.  The price makes it easy to do, but it's not worth your health."
The sound is not a bad quality but they do not hold charge well and they constantly unpair from my device. I would not buy again
"These are decent, though not exceptional, over-the-ear wireless headphones. For the price, though, they're a bargain.In the box are the headphones, a micro USB charging cable, and a 3-foot 3.5mm cable that you can use to connect the headphones via wire to your audio devices. The cable is not long enough, in my opinion, and not nearly as flexible as you want and need this cable to be, but it's an easy fix to replace with something better.The headphones fit comfortably over the ears, and the unit is lightweight enough that you can wear for maybe an hour or two without discomfort. The headphones adjust downward from the headband to accommodate longer heads, but their highest setting limits these to adults and people with ""average"" or longer heads; kids and people with short heads (e.g. Stewie, from Family Guy) probably won't be able to make these fit.Fidelity is decent but not great. Low and mid-range frequencies come through well and the bass response is good. It's the high end that's lacking, which gives the headphones an overall muddy quality sound, equivalent to turning down the Treble setting on a radio or stereo. The high end is there, it's just not as prominent as the bass and mid-range. If you listen at low volumes you probably won't notice this as much, but at higher volumes the difference becomes much more pronounced. The sound quality is the same whether the phones are wired or wireless. I used lossless audio as my test source, choosing several songs that I have listened to many times over the years. Remember, though, that these are sub-$20 wireless headphones, so it's unrealistic to expect these to rival Sony studio headphones or Bose headsets.The headphones have a microphone built into the side, which works via Bluetooth or the included cable. I didn't test that, but these tend to have average or mediocre response. There's not a boom for the microphone to extend out close to your mouth, so don't expect others to hear crystal-clear sound if you use for phone calls.All in all I think this is a good buy, if you aren't expecting audiophile-quality sound.These don't include active noise cancellation and thus I wouldn't recommend these as ""travel"" headphones (phones you wear on a plane to block out all the noise there), nor would I recommend these for any serious music listening. For just about everything else, though, they are more than sufficient, and"
Work like expected. Great for price!
"Quality and designFirst off if feels EXTREMELY cheap and flimsy. I was very disappointed. When I first pulled it out the box I thought they were BROKEN! only to realize that’s how it was designed to swivel and hinge almost in every direction. (See pic) I absolutely hate it. Im scared to unfold it because it feels like it will just break right off. I don’t see the purpose of it swiveling so much because it’s not even compact when you close it normally. (See pic) you have to really break it down for it to get compact and it already feels flimsy and easy to break so I won’t be trying the make it more compact than what you see in the picture.They don’t fit snugly AT ALL, they fit weird and are too wide. If I shake my head I feel it moving on my ears. It doesn’t have any grip at all like the Beats ones for example have.The only plus with this is that I don’t think it will be uncomfortable after long hours of use like the Beats.FitThe oval parts to go over the ears are HUGE and the padding is thin So it doesn’t form a seal around my ears. I imagine there’s a lot of sound leak too. If you don’t have huge ears, get something else. The material on the ear muffs are NOT breathable it’s the kind gets hot sweaty easily. It slides off behind my head easily. These wouldn’t be good for the gym or any activity except sitting stationary upright.Sound and noise cancellingIt only cancels human voice (I can’t hear myself singing when I have it on and music is playing) but it doesn’t even slightly cancel out a YouTube video playing at low volume nearby.The sound quality is just …okay. For music, the bass is louder than everything else. I can hardly hear the actual singing.If you just want a headphone for watching videos while studying then it will work for that. Anything more than that, I would not recommend this. Just pick something else more expensive with better sound quality, I wish I did. Lastly, the few positives.The Bluetooth connectivity is great, It switches seamlessly from my iPhone to my Mac just like AirPods would.The battery life seems to be good. (Expect since I can tell this thing is cheaply made,It looks cute on ur head unlike most of the others on Amazon."
I would LOVE these if they had aANY wind noise reduction at all. It sounds like a Cat 4 Hurricane when riding my bike or scooter. Fantastic other than that.  😀
I purchased them almost a year ago. This week they started to fail. Started with lots of crackling yesterday. I listened without the headphones to confirm it was not the video itself. The crackling got worse and then the audio went silent. Got them working again today and they made it to nearly the end of the day before the crackling started up again. I guess I got my money’s worth for the price I paid but I don’t feel right having something fail so quickly and add to a landfill.
I like the sound quality that the headphones give and also how easy it is to connect to them. But… I have sensitive ears to the material the ear muffs are made of is quite important to me. I expected the headphones to be made of cheap quality but the muffs are too hard and uncomfortable for my ears. I don’t think I would wear them for more than 10 minutes before my ears start to get agitated.But goodish quality for your buck🤷🏽‍♀️
"One major problem: It takes repeated tries to get these headphones to connect to my IPhone using BlueTooth.  I sometimes have to turn my phone on and off, etc.  So I often lose 10 mins at the start of my workout trying to make the connection.  I will look at better options soon.I got these for workouts at the gym.  I don't need great sound quality and I don't want noise-canceling headphones, bc I do want to be aware of what's happenign around me.  The sound is quite metallic, but that's fine with me for listening to podcasts & work out music.  I would not try to listen to opera or classical music on these headphones.A mixed situation, but these were cheap and so are not bad for the price once they connect. If I had to do it again, I might buy a better pair."
"These are great Bluetooth headphones, (we actually have two other pairs) but we are returning this one because I didn’t realize the mic only works if you’re connected via Bluetooth— NOT if you’re using the 3.5mm jack (for instance, to use with an XBox controller that doesn’t have Bluetooth capabilities). So if you don’t need it for something like that, I’d definitely recommend; the other two we’ve had for awhile and haven’t had any issues with near-constant use… so five stars for using with Bluetooth; but with the 3.5mm jack I guess it’s for only if you’re listening to something.. and my bet would be that you wouldn’t have any issues with that (though we haven’t tried it since we are returning them because they won’t work for what we need them for this time)."
Smaller than my first pair the mic is really distorted
Tv. Not really snug enough but adequate.
Not the quality I wanted
"It is great for listening to music, etc. BUT it is dangerous for the eardrums because if you try to make a call or end a call, it makes a piercing beep inside the ears before connecting to a call or ending a call.  I've had it for well over a year until today when one of the ear pieces got unhinged. I was somewhat relieved because I no longer have to use the headphones. During a call, I have to quickly get them off before ending it to avoid the screeching beep in my ears. Besides these manufacturing errors, they are great for sound and calls. [I would buy again with no hesitation if the ""end call"" beeping sound were to be eliminated. Perhaps this issue is already addressed in the new model, since my last purchase was in 2022]."
"Anyway, someone wrote on here that this headphones sounded as good as pair of skull candy’s I can tell u they don’t but for the price as an extra pair u can’t go wrong hope this helps your expectations"
If don’t sound as loud no more I bought me another pair assuming it was going sound the same and it was very disappointing I was sooo disappointed the sound on it now is very mid I don’t know if they changed it updated or what ever the case might be it should be undone these headphones use to be so loud u feel and hear the base in the headphones but not no more  it’s a 5/10 I thought I was going get the same thing as last time but nope
"I saw the reviews and wanted to give these a try. Apparently someone else had the same idea. Keep reading to find out more. The headphones were packaged in an outer box. Opening the box, I find a large plastic bag that says ""Ready to ship"". I notice floating around in the sealed plastic bag were the instruction sheet and charging cable. I opened the bag, set the instructions and cable aside. I opened the product box to find the headphones laying on top of some plastic. After removing the headphones, I found a bubble wrap bag that apparently the headphones were supposed to be in. Then I found another opened plastic bag. I can only imagine the instructions and cable were meant for that bag. BTW, the headphone jack cable was missing. So at this point I can only assume that I received a returned unit and not a brand new one that I paid for.Before I boxed them up for return I gave them a try. Paired pretty easy. Button placement a little difficult to maneuver to hit the one you want. Sound is OK for what you pay. Bass was a little muddy. The beeps and voice in your ears for directions is annoyingly loud. I mean very loud with no way to lower the beep volume. They were large on my head to the point of wiggling. I put a hat on to tighten it up.Conclusion: I don't blame the seller for me receiving a used unit. For the money it's OK.  I bought them for working in the year. A $15 price or less would be more in line."
"I thought the picture of what I was ordering was a baby blue, (my granddaughter’s favorite color), but what arrived and now shows in the picture of what was delivered was a darker blue."
"The sound quality is fine for the price, however I bought three of these for my three kids… and they all have the exact same identifier when they attach to Bluetooth. Maybe that’s normal- I’m not super techy - but it made it next to impossible for the kids to figure out who was attaching to whose device. Sometimes they could get two going, but never all three at the same time. I ended up have to buy a couple from a different brand."
"Only giving this product 3 stars because when it did work the sound quality was great and noise cancellation was perfect ( I couldn't hear my wife lol). Unfortunately after only using it once, I never powered back on. Tried charging it and red light charging indicator never came on. I felt like from the start it may have been defective because I had to Hold down the power button for 10 sec in order for it to even come on."
"Feel cheap, didn't get that loud. didn't connect through wired connection through what I needed. Just not what I was looking for"
The headphones are comfy and the sound quality is good but in no way do these cancel out any noise.
"Most headphones of this type have three buttons, with each button serving a dual function. This one is no different, but the ""volume up/next track"" and ""volume down/previous track"" buttons are backwards from how most others function. Tapping the button skips tracks, while holding it changes the volume. This is very awkward to deal with, not only because holding to change volume is annoying, but because accidentally tapping the button will immediately skip tracks which is far more jarring than just having your volume changed a tiny bit.The headphone cups only rotate forward, meaning that if you were to wear them around your neck, the speakers would face upward toward your face. I personally enjoy this, as it means I can take them off but still have the music playing if I need to hear something else for a moment, but you may not like this. It's all down to personal preference.The sound quality is decent, connection time is generally pretty fast, and you can pause your music instantly with no delay via the headphones. Other than the volume/track controls, this is a very good pair of headphones, but those controls being reversed is a major downside that can't be overlooked."
"I got these headphones to wear at the gym while I'm working out. There were several problems right off the bat. They are NOT adjustable enough and keep sliding down because they can't be adjusted smaller. The control buttons on the side are so tiny and close together that changing the volume up and down is difficult. The volume isn't always uniform. The volume buttons are also supposed to allow you to change to ""next""/ ""back"", etc. So far, they don't. If you don't hold the buttons long enough or short enough, it's difficult to gauge what's going to happen next. Also, the ""turn on/off"" button is located between volume buttons so close that you have to take off the headphones to use it.  When you want to turn off the headphones, MAKE SURE that you hold down this button for a LONG time because it doesn't turn off quickly.  It will stay on and you won't realize it until you try to use your phone/pc/tablet( or whatever you were using them for) has no volume. Another issue is charging. There is no indicator showing the battery usage. I just plug it in every few days on the assumption that it likely needs to charge up.  The only reason I didn't return them is because I don't need anything fancy, just something that would do the job, seeing as I only use them during my workouts. However, inexpensive shouldn't necessarily mean cheaply made or chintzy."
my first pair of big headphones. they feel great when i'm wearing them without glasses/sunglasses. if im wearing glasses/sunglass the headband digs the temples into into the side of my head..not comfy at all🤣 i wish the on botton was in an easier spot to reach and i wish the voice who says lower on/off was louder
I should have spent more on Bose
"Had these for about five months. Had some weird issues from the start — mainly when charging/turning on and off — but I shrugged it off. They’re cheap, so whatever?Those issues just kept increasing, though. Well the other night, I was finished charging the headphones, took them off the charger, and tried to turn them on. They were being weird. Wouldn’t turn on, wouldn’t turn on… I was used to this though, so I just kept pressing the button. My brother — who was visiting — came in to ask me something as I was still pressing the button and then the headphones turned on.Normally, I’d immediately put them. Thank god my brother distracted me, because about seven seconds later, the headphones suddenly warmed, sparked, and then caught fire. My brother grabbed them and threw them into my metal wastebasket. Then, he dumped his waterbottle on them.They could have been on my head. I had a small burn on my hand. That could have been on my face. That fire could have been in my hair. I could have died or been blinded or seriously injured.While the exploding thing seems to be rare, it does seem like these have an extremely short lifespan.I had my brother look at it. My brother is studying to be an engineer and is a great mechanic. He bought a half-hollow shell of a mustang and fixed it. He built his own computer. So I trust him with this. He says it looks like a wiring issue and seems to just be really, really poorly made.Looking at other reviews, it seems that they often break after 4 - 8 months of use. This is a faulty product and a scam."
"I bought these headphones specifically to where while watching movies on my tablet. I wanted something that would be gently cushioning on the ears and provide a certain amount of sound blocking without messing around with active noise canceling. I find these comfortable but not quite as plushly padded as some other brands I've had in the past. The sound quality is on the okay side. It is a little bass boosted I think, not terribly distorted but more than I really need. And overall the clarity isn't really what I was hoping for in movie watching headphones. They will probably over exaggerate explosions in action movies. The battery is not lasting as long as I thought it would though it's still pretty good. I find the left and right markings kind of hard to see because they're just a very small letter on the actual headband whereas I'm used to having a giant l or r printed on the actual fabric of the ear covering. As budget headphones I think they're fine but if I were to have paid their full listed price I would be very unhappy with them because I have bought major brand headphones at that listed price that sounded two to three times better than these. Overall I would rate them as B+ sound quality which isn't bad for the money."
"The battery life is not good, it goes down just being connected with practically no use."
"Headphones are seemingly decent quality with good sound quality (I am no audiophile), long use time and short charging time. Overall good basic headphones for basic use IMO.Irritating drawbacks are the buttons and their function. The ""vol up/down"" and ""next/previous track"" are the same buttons and the usefulness is seriously hampered because IMO they have the use for the functions backward. The way the buttons are set up, single quick clicks change the track and longer presses control the volume. It should be the opposite IMO. The way it is makes it very frustrating because it becomes nearly impossible to properly control the volume in small increments.So, all of that said, if you are a person who is going to use them with your phone and control volume levels via your phone and not the headphones themselves, you should be ok. If you are like me and use them to connect to your desktop PC and need to frequently change volume using the headphones themselves, these headphones may irritate you."
I like the product; the product was missing the usb-a to usb-c cable for charging.
"Bluetooth connection stopped working after less than one year of very gentle use (two days per week in an office, stored in a desk drawer when not in use). They are basically useless to me now because they only work when physically plugged in and the wired cord gets in the way when I’m working. Two stars because they are cute, lightweight and comfortable and worked well - until they didn’t."
Like them but could be louder but blue tooth stays connected good
These worked well for about 1 year. Then the power button broke free from the internal circuit board due to a poor solder joint which has to take the repeated force of on/off button push at an angle that it doesn't support well. I can't resolder the button -- it is a very small surface-mount item -- so I guess these are going in the trash. They were good while they lasted.
Its all pretty good but it leaks sound at a medium volume.
"For the price these work pretty good. I wouldn't really consider them noise cancelling because I could still hear the airplane noises, but like I said, for the price I can't really complain. My biggest issue was they didn't fit around my earrings and I had to keep adjusting them so they wouldn't press on them."
"The headphones were fine when they worked, but they all stopped connecting within 3 months.  I originally bought two pair for my wife and myself on 9/21.  One stopped connecting after about two weeks and was returned on 10/3 after talking to an Amazon rep.  She said I had already tried everything she would suggest and authorized the return.  I thought it was a fluke and bought a replacement of the same item.  The second one failed on10/25 the same way.  Amazon authorized another return but this time I bought another brand for a replacement.  The third headset failed with the same problem on 12/17.  I'm not even going to go through the return process.I don't know what the problem was, but to me they are not worth the hassle of when they stop working within 2 weeks to 2 months.  I rate them 1 start only because 0 is not an option.After posting this review the company contacted me to offer a refund on the third pair.  At that point I told them that I still had that headset if they wanted it.  They arranged to have it sent to them so they could test it an try to find the problem so they could improve their product.  When that was done they send me a new headphone for testing.I increased the rating by 2 stars for the excellent customer service."
"The sound is muffed, and lacks voice clarity, which is desired when listening to a conversation on the TV.. However, the sound is acceptable for listening to music, as the bass is good, but the high treble is not very clear.. I returned my headphones and bought a pair designed for TV."
"These look good, are comfy on your head and ears, but the noise canceling is no existant. I've had awesome earphones at this price point so I was expecting same, which is why I'm disappointed. If I wasn't outside my return window I'd return them. Now I'll just blast my music so I can't hear the horrible music played on the speakers at my gym."
"I like to wear over the ear headphones when work outside, so this isn't the best for that, because it falls off my head too easily. Also the controls are so close and indistinguishable that I turn them off when trying to adjust volume."
its ok
"Purchased these just to lay off AirPods for a bit. They aren’t noise canceling which I knew before purchasing, they also is very muffled and doesn’t let you adjust the EQ if needed."
"Very impressed with them!Pros:Very comfortableClear soundBluetooth calls work wellGood priceCons:Cheap materialNo EQ to adjust the base as it's really thick overall!Buttons are in an uncomfortable position, wish the design was more like the classic beats design!Overall considering how inexpensive they are to purchase even with my listed flaws I still believe they are a good buy and would buy them again if needed! I've owned many pairs of headphones and ear buds,, from beats to Sony to Samsung and so forth! These compare pretty well!"
"Just got it today. The color's solid. I like it. Immediately, I connected it to my laptop. The pairing was quick and easy. The fitting is comfortable, and I like that I can adjust it to the right length.I played a Youtube video and a song on Spotify and tried out all the buttons in both, while following the instructions. The next song/last song buttons only work on Youtube if you are watching a video in a playlist. On Spotify all the buttons work.The volume control is a bit finicky. You have to hold down either the next song/last song button for 1-2s according to the manual, but this the volume changes too fast and, to be honest, why is volume control a secondary function?The audio cord is about 3.5 ft or so, which a great length for when you're connecting it to a phone/other mobile device. For my laptop, I'm probably going to get a longer aux cord.I'm not very technical about sound, so I have nothing to say about the sound quality. I can clearly hear what's playing, so that's good for me.Overall it's okay. Wish the controls were a bit better for the price."
Sound is good via Audio Wire - but cannot connect via Bluetooth.  Also - phone curls up when off my head - a small pain to unwrap all the time.  I will keep it as a back-up headphone but will buy a different one for Bluetooth.  Will also investigate if Computer is problem not connecting.  Lastly - spring tension is to tight for my head.  I need one with less pressure.  Sorry - but this is Not my favorite headphone.
"although I have a cell phone I do not, and do not anticipate using it with the headphones.  Unfortunately nothing in the User Manual addresses installing the headphones for use on a computer.  For example, although the manual addresses an 'on/off switch', nothing in the manual or on the headphones is identified as such.  I think I may have found something that works but it took many hours and much frustration.  The manual either needs to be rewritten or the phones marketed as for cell phones only.  (cell phone installation instructions are in the manual though I have not tried using them).  I finally got sound to come through the phones from my computer and that seems to be fine - so far."
"Not only is the sound quality lower than I had hoped, but the fit isn't right (despite my very average-sized head) and the headphones are somewhat uncomfortable because of it. The headset is stiff and you cannot change the tightness, only how far down the earpieces are, which does not help. The imperfect fit means that there's extra space between the headphones and my ears, and they don't sit around the ears but rather rest on the earlobes on top and then have open space near the bottom. The sound escapes, and naturally there is a lack of noise cancellation because of this. But even when I press against the earpieces to fit them perfectly over my ears, noise cancellation is completely absent. Sound quality only improves slightly. There's an odd imbalance in the high/ bass sound quality. It says they're bass-boosted headphones, but it's more like they forgot to put in high sound altogether. A true bass-boosted headset should sound like there is an added, rich quality to the sound. This set makes it feel empty, like the sound is coming from a long distance away through an echoing, wet tunnel. It's not only disorienting, it's also unsatisfying and extremely frustrating. I was hoping for a more rich and full sound quality.This is a disappointment."
"Updating my review stars for the new 65 hour version... Because it's NOT good. I purchased the original pair about 1.5 years ago when it was just 40hr of play time.. I still use that pair every day (wearing them now). The audio of the original (40hr) pair is fantastic! They connect to BT without issues, and I can walk around my entire house and listen to music while they are connected to my PC in the back room (About 32ft)... The ""New"" Upgraded version (65hr Playtime) and absolutely horrible... The ONLY thing that is similar is the design.. Other than that.. nothing. The ""Upgrade"" is a massive downgrade... The Bluetooth (for PC) has a hard time connecting, and when it does it sounds like a cassette tape being eaten by the player (Yeah I'm old).. The sound constantly cuts in and out and has that bizarre wobble effect to it, where it sounds like its being pitched up and down really fast. The bass is now very hollow, and... I don't know how to describe it... foggy? It's like its being simulated in the headphones... It makes the rest of the audio muddy sounding. ALSO.. the original version had a very soft spoken and pleasant to hear natural voice whenever you turned the headphones on/off and when connected to BT... The ""Upgraded"" version is a harsh, very poorly done robot voice... It's just bad.. even the new voice is choppy and low quality. Because I LOVE the original version, I decided to buy another pair because it adds 25 more hours of play time... I wish that was the only change they had done. I had to get the new version replaced because I thought something was wrong with it, but both pairs I received had the exact same issues, so I guess that's what it is now. I cannot in any way recommend the new version, even if you get them on sale for $20... Bring back the 40hr version please. :((Yes that is gorilla tape on the black pair (40hr) in the photo.. They are not broken, I just did that because I sleep in these every night and I was afraid they might... The originals were that good!)"
"Update 8 months later.  I *-=HATE=-* these headphones.  It seems as if they're ""Moody"" as sometimes they'll pair with my pc, sometimes they won't.  Sometimes I have to remove and re-add them, and then it may fix it, or it may not.  It never seems to auto connect to my phone, despite having connected to it several times now.  Overall I hate them.  I only use them when I have too and I can't spend more money on a better pair.  I used to think it was my old PC's bluetooth but now I have a brand new one and its doing the exact same thing.  I wouldn't ever buy these again.  Oh, and also, at around 20-25% battery (which can still last a long long time) it will start saying low battery every 30 seconds or so, and continually do it until you charge them.  Oh, and did I mention, that when I charge them, I can't seem to get them to work at all?  Yeah I hate them.  Don't buy these imo.These headphones are ok.  The sound is pretty decent, but don't expect to be the only one listening if you have the volume up high.  The sound bleeds out into the room pretty significantly.  The bass on the headphones is good too, but it does sometimes make the headphones ""bounce"" a bit.The biggest problem I have with these headphones is that it CONSTANTLY has issues pairing, re-pairing, and becoming activated in windows 11 (for me at least.)  Basically every single time I want to use them, I have to remove them from the list of devices on the computer's bluetooth list, then re-add them and make sure they're in pairing mode.  I NEVER had this problem with a previous pair of bluetooth headphones.  Subsequently, I can't seem to get these headphones to pair with both my computer and my phone at the same time.  It just doesn't seem to want to work.  Again, this wasn't a problem with my previous headphones.Given the price, the battery longevity, and the decent sound, I'd say these are ok enough for me not to return.  I think I'd probably choose something better though in the future, but I won't be returning these."
"They get the job done.  They wear like a pair from 5 below. Not soft, volume buttons are confusing, but sound is clear. Power works so slow. You have to hold the button for some time and even then it's inconsistent.. again, If you just need a pair and the price waa in your budget. These will do. I'm not wooed about them."
"Hard to connect on different devices. Don't connect to the device that says ""Amazon****"" you need to connect to ""WH201A."" It may not show up on first attempt. I connected it to my phone, 3rd time was the charm. I listened to music for an hour and a half. The sound is fine and gets loud if you like it like that. It's not the same sound quality as the $300 headphones but these are a decent throw around. Don't expect to be able to connect it to the PS4. The PS4 recognizes the device but won't pair and says the device is not compatible. You can wire into the controller but mic only works while connected through bluetooth. I'm hoping to get a PS5 for Christmas if they don't connect to that then I'll be returning this."
"Okay, all in all, a good pair of headphones for twenty bucks. But I wouldn't spend any more on this. I saw other people's good reviews and thought maybe this was a diamond in the rough for this price point. And I will say that it works.However, a few problems. When watching a show or video, the headphones are behind by a few seconds. This is very frustrating and mostly what i purchased the headphones for. It's lagging pretty substantially. This might be solved by plugging into my laptop with the cord provided, but the whole point of the headphones is to be wireless. But if one is using it for music, it's probably fine. This is also pretty annoying because I needed a cheap pair of headphones to take to class with me while I work on audio/video files, which need to be accurate & on time.Also, purely aesthetic, but the band of the headset looks very odd when wearing. The band sits an inch or so away from my head/hair and looks incredibly awkward. It's not cute and I'm not sure if, coupled with the audio issues, this are headphones I will wear outside the house. It's obviously not a huge problem, but the way they look while being worn is something to consider."
"I just started using these because I can't use air pods. So far so good with the quality, I'll have to see how long the charge stays on. I'm prone to getting headaches and wasn't sure about this product. I just made a few simple adjustments to make them fit good, and I'm fine, no headaches. I'll update review if I notice any difference.  Update: I'm returning them because I can't find the volume controls and when I do it's it's either too loud or not loud enough. I also had to find a pair of my own power cords, since I didn't get one with the pkg."
"I recently bought these headphones for gaming. Not serious gaming however. There is no adjustment on them for tone. Only on /off switch. Change channels up or down. So 3 switches in all. I feel they have too much bad for my situation, however they might be ok for music . The price was right . They work ok."
"These aren't terrible, but unfortunately they weren't for me. First, the color isn't quite like pictured. It's more like a pale sage green than the bright aqua in the picture. Still, not the worst.The folding ability is nice, but I found them a little too bendy, if you get my meaning. Even while wearing them, I found them too shifty, and I had to touch them so carefully to prevent shifting them off my ears. The audio quality is tinny and unclear. They're loud, which I guess is nice for some, but my ears are a bit sensitive. The onboard volume controls didn't work for me at all.But the biggest reason I am giving three stars is because they are just way too big. I couldn't create a good seal, and had a lot of ambient noise leaking in from the bottom. There was a good 1 inch clearance between my ear and the bottom of the headphone, with no way to adjust it. I've not seen experienced this with other headsets, so I don't think my head or ears are unusually small.Ultimately I ended up returning them. I wouldn't recommend these."
While the sound is great these headphones do not fit me. I have an average sizes head for a women and these are just to long and loose for me. Color is also misleading. I got the green but the Pic looks like a dark minty green and these are more like a sage green.
"The headphones are light and it was really cheap, but that's about it for the pluses. The ear cups are pretty flimsy and don't make a nice surround around the ear. Not expecting any ANC for this low low price and that's fine for my home use.The sound quality, however, is absolutely atrocious. I picked up another cheap headphones for comparison and for about $5 more, it has ANC, much better ear cups and the sound quality is leaps and bounds better than this.The power, and volume buttons have a very cheap plastic feel since that's what they are.Don't bother with this set."
"The sound is really good. It's also quite loud, even when turning all the volumes down, app, OS, it's loud.The volume control on the headset does nothing.  The on/off button does pause videos though.The ear fit is small.  Too small for my ears and it compresses the top and bottom of my ears."
These replaced a Sanag that finally wore out. Too bad that they don't offer those anymore because their sound quality and tone were great. These not so much. They are advertised as having 'deep base'; they are too 'deep' for my taste. They are usuable but the sound seems a bit muddy too me.
They are ok for the price! Can not be muted and the volume wasn’t very loud. The charge lasted like 3 days so that’s a plus but sound quality suck. I work from home and customers complained so I tried them on my Xbox but the party echoes. Ultimately I sent them back
"Hi I like to be fair, I bought these for the good reviews  and my other Bluetooth headphones were falling a apart, don’t know if the battery will last 65 hours but I was severely disappointed in the sound quality.  It would never suit me for music but for podcasts or audiobooks may be ok?  I reboxed them and put them in a yankee swap I went too, a friend got them and loves them, go figure! One man’s trash another’s treasure? If I had returned these my rating would be 2 stars but because my friend enjoyed them so much I will give them a 3. These are the Kvidio brand."
"A little over a year has passed since I bought it. It has stopped charging, and the power button is no longer responding. I can no longer use it, although the sound was not bad."
"Good for the price, but for some reason, every time you reach top volume, it turns off your music, announces to you “Maximum Volume”, then starts playing your music again, skipping a couple seconds. Incredibly annoying, not sure why they added that."
"I can hear everything very nicely.  The problem is the people I'm talking to can't hear me very well due to the microphone being of very poor quality - maybe?.  At least that's what I'm hearing, well, I mean that's what I'm being told."
"These headphone are comfortable to wear, have a good battery life, and were inexpensive, but they really don't do bluetooth very well. It's rare I get a good connection to my mac mini. 90% of the time it sounds like tuning in to a distant radio frequency - lots of crackle and fuzz. If I disconnect/reconnect several times I can sometimes get a good connection.I compare them to my ""JLAB Rewind"" bluetooth headphones (pictured) which do not have as good of a battery life nor feel as good on the ears, but they tune in to that same mac mini's bluetooth without error."
"These are so comfortable I get up from the desk and forget I have them on. Seriously. I do wear glasses - no problem. However...I use duolingo everyday twice a day. I can go long stretches with no disconnect and then for no reason I can search out - I loose the microphone and have to spend the rest of my day trying to get it to reconnect w duolingo again.  Could be windows, could be windows and duo either way its happened too many times. Too much time wasted. Will have to find a wired pair."
"Got a new phone and can't get the volume on these back up to what it went to with the previous phone. Pairs easily, but finicky with other controls. OK sound quality, leaves me wanting more though"
I've had these a year now and over the last several months the power button slowly stopped working until it's now stopped turning on entirely. Really unfortunate they only lasted a year.
I originally purchased these and help to block out sound which they are not very good. Sound quality is acceptable. I held onto them in case I need them for some weird reason.
"It squeeze my head. After while, it causes my ears very painful and further triggers my headache. Also, once put it on, I almost hear nothing surrounding me. Bit dangerous."
"These headphones technically work, they seem to operate adequately to ""get the job done""...  But we are talking about a pair of 20 dollar headphones, so you have to keep expectations a little on the low side. Sound quality is ""adequate"" but no exactly amazing. For around 40 bucks seems you can get much more quality (and value)These are good maybe for work, or your average zoom meetings, or working in the yard, although I did not find them very comfortable over long periods (like after 30 minutes or so)"
"Pros, great sound true noise canceling as well.. cons, the placement of buttons is wrong & there to small & to close together for even those with skinny fingers to press them, have to take them off all the time to see what button ur wanting to press.. dumb designers must not ever wear headphones. Also if u have a normal sized head these will shimmy off ur head.. alot,  wear a ball cap under them then there ok.. I love the sound tho..."
"They are nice headphones and work well with long battery life, however I wear them all day at work and they really hurt my ears.  The inside is too shallow from the soft foam and my ears rub on them and are always red and sore."
"The build and audio quality is pretty decent for the price, but the headphones disconnect at random intervals quite frequently"
Unfortunately these headphones don't seem to match my Surface laptop and I can only use them successfully with my phone.
The fact that it hangs up on my phone calls is very annoying I tried getting customer service help 😒 and even watching YouTube videos I thought it was going to be my first Bluetooth headset not a just a pair of headphones but oh well
Apparently I have a small head because they fit weird on me. Too much space on top.
The microphone feature of this wireless headphone does not work well in most zoom meetings.  I have a lot complains from the zoom meeting attendees not hearing my voice through this wireless  headphone microphone.A disappointed product and do not recommend.
"The headphones were good, but they heard it my ear cannot wear them too long"
Got this to workout with power walking mostly and chilling at the house when I’m cleaning.Sound is good but i found it’s uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time and hurts my head personally.It also pinches and hurts my skin most of the time when I unfold it to wear hence the two stars.My skin on my hand gets caught in it and I feel like it’s going to rip it off just trying to get it uncaught.Not comfy to fall asleep with either sometimes I like to listen to some relaxing sounds without waking the husband and unfortunately it hurts my head.So far it’s held up to everyday use.The connection is starting to disconnect from my phone out of nowhere which I don’t understand why.It will stop my song and I have to use my phone to play it again because the play button won’t work on the headphones when this happens.I wouldn’t recommend it because of the pinching of the hands when unfolding.Unless your on a budget then I guess you can try it for yourself.Also it feels flimsy too sometimes I feel it will break one of these days but so far it’s been holding up.If your looking for a headphone that’s wireless on a budget and has a decent sound quality then give it a try.
I've had this pair for for 6 years now. it's still going strong but sound wise it's very no thrills. for music you'll definitely have to get an equalizer to fix the sound as bass is non-existent but if that doesn't matter that much to you and you need something cheap that gets the job done you'll enjoy these
The left side goes in and out. The headphones keep saying disconnected.
"The sounds quality is good for the price range. The bass can get a little muddy depending on what you're listening to. My biggest peeve with the product has been how frequently it grabs my hair and tears it. That's just because I have long hair though, and is a problem with most products to begin with."
Wish it held charge longer. Fine for the price.
Are these amazing? No.Is the sound quality like being in an IMAX theatre? Also No.But are the comfortable? Yes. Were they affordable? Yes. Have I bought three pair because I keep leaving them on the plane/subway? Yes.They are FINE! decent even. But for the priced they are amazing.
When its connected to just my laptop the sound quality is horrible. Its like a robot is talking and its broken. If I connect to to my phone and laptop its perfect. There are times when this is not what is needed! The headphones are unusable when the phone is not connected.
"It's the buttons.  Everything is great right down to the price, but the controls are awful--the buttons are too small, too close together, and in the wrong place.  If  not for them, I'd do five stars and be buying these for gifts.  Maybe next year, hey?"
Power button stopped working 6months in
I really want to give it 5 stars but I can't because you have to run these headphones on stereo which messes with windows and changes random stuff. Its blue tooth sound for computer is terrible.  It might be good for phones but don't get the pair for computers.
"Beware that if you're planning on using these wired, your microphone will not work. You'll need a special cable with an inline mic, which defeats the purpose of these having a mic with noise cancellation.Audio quality over Bluetooth is fine but wired audio quality is far superior. If you want these strictly for wireless use, probably save your money and get anything off brand for cheap. All Bluetooth headphones sound horrible so there's no point in wasting your money. If you want a proper wired headset, this is good but only for listening."
"I was expecting for bass-heavy headphones when purchasing these 2 months ago. I learned that lots of reviews praised ULT for their bassy sound.The sound is good, but doesn't really wow me. The EQ helps, but I am disappointed with the bass though i pressed that ULT button twice to get the lowest range and most powerful bass. They're definitely better than my Bose QC45, but the Bose have much louder sound. Bass is not spectacular and the sound isn't loud enough either in ULT.If you are a basshead, i suggest you try Skullandy's Crusher ANC 2 or Crusher Evo. These fellas will literally rattle your skull, and the level of bass is in your control. 50% of the bass will be enough to shake your head. Price is more or less the same as ULT. I really don't understand why YT reviewers chose ULT over ANC 2 in terms oif the best bassy headphones available.I had to download a separate volume and bass enhancer app to maximize my headphones. I hope Sony will improve their app to bring a more powerful bass and sound.I have no problem with the ANC. They're comfortable to wear too and don't tire my ears. The battery life is also great (i rarely use my ANC as they're soundproof enough when the music is on). The sound leaks a bit though, but I'm fine with it. ULT is dependable for making and receiving  calls too. ULT deserves 5 stars for all these, but im giving 3 stars for the bass and loudness."
"It’s just there and nothing special at all even with the AlT button, I don’t think it’s worth the amount"
"These headphones have a pretty solid sound-stage, and have really great bass quality, which is their focus. However, mine broke after a few months of normal wear. I was just taking them off my neck to put onto my head and they snapped at a hinge point. Cheap thin plastic not expected to last I guess. Unfortunate as I love how light and comfortable they are. I could wear them all day without them hurting. Just a weak plastic at an integral hinge point which doesn't make since."
