"Inexpensive, and it gets the job done, by and large. It doesn't quite toast the way you'd like it to toast without fiddling, and the pop-up isn't very strong, so the toast doesn't emerge from the toaster without lifting the handle. When I first got it, the handle would actually stick and not pop up at all a couple of times, having to push the handle up to get it to pop. After that it worked... sort of. I suppose I could return it for one that actually works properly, but it's acceptable and not worth the effort for the cost."
Sliced bread from store-bought bread loaf does not fit with the opening. It also does not fit inserted on end with leaving part of it sticking out. Might fit Wonder Bread
I use it for standard toasting. You have to put it on level 8-10 to toast anything lightly. It is not like the original from years ago.
"Pretty much says it in the title. You won't get an evenly toasted slice with this thing. The top will toast but the bottom won't (or vice versa if you're using the other slot). One side of the bread will brown faster than the other, as will the very ends of the bread. The number dial is meaningless - the dial on 2 will take 2 minutes or maybe it'll take 1 minute or maybe it'll be 5 minutes. Who knows? And your bread will still be toasted (or charred) unevenly."
Top of the bread nearly burned when rest is just right
"How can a toaster fail so miserably at the one thing it is supposed to do?  This is a terrible product - in order to get any kind of toast the setting needs to be close to maximum.  The toast is uneven - in patches and hardly at all  on one side.  The ""cancel"" button stopped working after a month of use.  I should have returned this as soon as it came in.  My mistake - but I won't make the mistake of buying another Hamilton Beach product ever again."
We bought this toaster after our expensive cuisinart broke. I noticed this toaster makes a humming noise unlike the other toaster. It works well despite the noise. Just something I noticed.
Died in 9 months of limited use.
Too bad I didn’t review this earlier. This is the worse toaster I have ever owned! I have used it twice. Today was going to use it but it caught on fire - there was a wire completely unattached inside that caught fire. Toaster is now in the trash.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS  TOASTER - IT IS A FIRE HAZARD
"This toaster toasts slow, takes a while for your bread to get brown. Easy to use and nice looking, just wish it worked faster."
Lever wouldn't stay down. Returned.
The cord is to the front of the toaster not the back of the toaster. I have to have it right next to the outlet otherwise it doesn’t reach.
I wish the cord was a bit longer. It works properly.
Decent for toast. Bagels burn even on light setting.
This is the second Hamilton Beach toaster I tried. Couldn’t believe they both failed to toast both sides of the bread evenly.
"Disappointed so I'm searching for a different toaster that features mode settings that work. On this toaster, the Bagel & Defrost are all the same as full on toaster. It has these optional buttons but all for show & don't work. Not all heating filaments worked. 2 on each middle section of toaster.."
Ok toaster but the bottom trey doesn't fit very well allowing the tray to fall and the crumbs all fall out.
Works well for the money but it doesn’t hold the slightly larger bread sizes.  I’m not asking for it to hold really big slices just slightly larger than typical bread size
"Love the toaster. Has a defrost, bagel mode if needed and of course it toasts normally but… the bottom tray for crumbs does not stay closed. It sometimes opens at the bottom on just sliding the toaster over the counter. Love the defrost mode the best. Company needs to fix the crumb latch. I love the toaster!"
Don’t know what’s up with toasters 2024 but this is my 3rd try to get one that toast evenly both sides- nope another failure
"I can't get a good photo that shows down inside the toaster.  The middle ""septum"" plate is warped towards the right slot, the right slot metal piece that cradles the bread and lifts it up and down is twisted, a big section of the coils on the far left side doesn't seem to work because I don't see them turn red and the bread doesn't get fully toasted.  In the right slot the right side of the bread toasts perfectly, but almost nothing on the left side.  The ""Bread Lifter"" can't come all the way up because the inside structure is twisted and warped (as described above).  It's basically a piece of junk.  The only way I can use it is put one piece in the right slot for one cycle, then flip it over for a 2nd cycle."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I bought it because of the price and good reviews.  The toaster only lasted about 5 days after the return date.  First issue was that it wouldn’t latch to toast the bread.  After 10 or so attempts it would latch and work as expected. Then the latch wouldn’t even slide down. It was like locked it the open position. Keep in mind it only gets used a couple times a week.
Terrible.  It burns the upper part and the other part is not toasted.  Don’t bother with it.
It toasts unevenly.  The top half is clearly toasted more than the bottom half.  I think heat rises.  The engineers should have taken this into account when designing the appliance.
it would be nice if the toaster would toast on the first try  - it does not.  you need to put it in a second time about half the time again to get as golden ...
Loved this gadget for the first 1.5 years. Sadly we noticed a significant reduction in heat produced and toast would take longer and longer to prepare. Looking for a replacement almost exactly two years after purchasing.
"This is a disappointing purchase that was made in late December, 2016.  It has now broken (3 months later).  This product was selected because our previous simple Hamilton Beach toaster lasted us many years.  This newer design belies its poor quality which includes a smaller toast section which barely fits a standard size loaf slice, a pop-up mechanism that keeps the lever at the half-way mark resulting in burning fingers from reaching in to grab hot toast, a flimsy crumb flip door at the bottom requiring you to pick up the toaster to access (the previous version had a much more desireable and functional crumb pull out tray on the bottom), a below surface design flaw which places a sub-surface rim around the outside of the toaster which collects crumbs which are difficult to remove, and, as mentioned by other reviews, an oddly placed cord which is attached to the bottom at the front of the toaster body (who would ever plug in a toaster from the front?). Yes, this was an inexpensive appliance, but there is no excuse for such poor design and quality.  I should just chalk it up to bad luck, but I don't want others to have the same experience, so I am writing this review."
"The ""push down to toast"" handle catches half-way down. Excessive force is required to get it past that point. I am going to try again with this toaster because Hamilton Beach is generally a quality brand. I will update this after I get the replacement."
"Ordered it, got it. Never worked one time. No return label. You have to ask for one print it out. Not worth my time"
Hamilton Beach limited warranty. I was offered a new one but with a 12.95 sipping fee. New the item was $30 delivered!! I refused to pay and will just throw the toaster to the trash.
"I've had the toaster for 10 days and on setting 2, I now get one side burnt at the top while perfectly brown at the bottom and the other side is barely toasted."
"Consistently inconsistent surface toasting. Does not actually eject toast above the unit to be extracted. The 3 buttons do not light up to indicate use, at least not on mine.I hope there are better performing pop-up toasters out there, but I'm certain they are pricey. You'll get what you pay for here."
It’s nothing special. I would rather have a crumb tray than the little trap door on this toaster. I wish I had chosen a nicer model.
Bought in April by June the handle to push the toast down did not work..had to hold it  down the whole time.  It was under warranty but i could NOT get the ompany to call me back I left repeated emails and voice messages ...NEVER again willl I buy Hamilton beach....
"Piece of junk. Never worked right. Like other reviews, the handle wouldn't work consistently and I had to fiddle with it to get it to stay down. Today, after multiple tries, one side clamped shut, but the handle decided it was just there for looks. Straight to the garbage."
"Toaster is okay for smaller sized bread and english muffins.  Not really wide enough for bagels (they get stuck) and not big enough for other larger slices of bread, e.g., rye bread.  On darkest setting toast/english muffins don't come out well done.  Need to toast twice.  Disappointed.  Would not recommend."
We got this toaster becauseb it old one was taking so long to toast. This one literally takes twice as long. We will be buying a different one.
"It does its job but fresh out of the box multiple heating coils don’t fully function. The two middle sides both don’t heat up as well either. Very mediocre toaster, barely worth using."
"Disappointed, was nice but didn’t work! Lame"
I am just looking for a simple toaster that will toast both sides without burning. I tried both lower selections.
"You have to use two hands when press or release the button. Product is too light and not stable, but it works."
"I love how this toaster looks on my counter and doesn't take up space, but it burns everything, even on the lowest setting. How hard is it to make a toaster that works? Don't they have toasters in China? I am tired of cheap China-made products, and Im not going to take it any more!"
The bread holder on one side broke after 6 months of use. Very disappointing. Don’t recommend.
NOT AS GOOD AS MY OLD ONE BUT IT DOES TOAST OK ON LOWEST SETTING
"I bought this to replace an ancient $10 off-brand toaster that still worked but looked awful. This one matches my other appliances but that's the only good thing I can say about it.Note the photo of the bread in the slots - yes it's thin bread but notice one of the ""holders"" doesn't move - I've been using my fingers to physically move it every time I use this toaster and I still get inconsistent browning. In the toast photo, the one with a brown upper-right was actually in the ""good"" slot (I don't have to move the ""holder"") but I want that color of brown all over the toast, not just one corner. If I turn it up, the top of the toast burns before the bottom of the toast is brown.  I looked inside while toasting - hard to get a photo of this, but some of the heating elements are NOT turning red.I am in bad health and live a long way from the nearest post office, so returning this is more trouble than it's worth, but I'm done with Hamilton Beach. Shame. I've had their stuff in the past and it was good, but not this time. Probably because previous stuff was made in USA and this is made in China."
"Not as good as my old one, which is same brand.  I kept the old one cause I like it better."
I didn’t realize until after my return window closed that this toaster is only heating on one side. The other side only heats on the edges. If it wasn’t for that this toaster is otherwise nice and simple which I appreciate.
I bought this based on the stars but now regret it because the most annoying part is having to hold up the lever up each time to get the toast out. 🙄
"The toaster was order from a wedding registry. It arrived in only the original box. No protection for the box. It is dirty from being shipped. The shipping label is stuck to the outside of the box so if I try to remove it it is going to rip the picture on the box of the toaster. This is suppose to be a wedding gift not something I picked up at yard sale. The box is dirty, torn in areas and not what a wedding gift is suppose to look like. Very disappointed there was no protection from the elements."
"Not thrilled with this product. The bread goes cold within seconds of being done, whereas my last toaster of a different brand never had that problem. Wouldn’t recommend, but I guess it does the job 🤷🏻‍♀️"
Received this and it didn't work right out of the box
"Chose this because it was highly rated by Consumer Reports. I have no idea why. Sometimes it doesn't take the bread down all the way, resulting in the top inch not getting toasted. The first set of toast might come out all right, but even on a very low setting, the second set does not pop up and is on the verge of burned."
"I bought the Hamilton Beach because I wanted an inexpensive toaster to occasionally toast bread for sandwiches.  I recognized the brand.  This toaster will only toast one side of the bread whether it is set on ""bagel"" or not.  It also toasts very unevenly.  I have to turn the bread around and flip it over to toast it.  It also does not pop the toast up when it shuts off.  I unplug the toaster after using it because it does not seem safe.  If I hadn't let the time for return run out before trying it, I would definitely return this poor excuse for a toaster."
"Contrary to the description, the crumb tray does not come out.  You turn the toaster upside down and open a hinged door.  Then the door is smaller than the area of toast.  Then, if that weren't dangerous enough, there is a ledge around the bottom of the toaster to catch the crumbs.The reason for the crumb tray is to remove the crumbs.  If they build up they can become a fire hazard.  This was a serious problem with the original toasters.Second, the cord is short and comes out the front. Toasters, and all heat emitting appliances should not be left under cupboards as they will cause problems with cupboards above them.  The short cord, shortened further by the location, makes that a problem.The cheapness of the toaster was evident from the start.  The insides rattle because of sloppy fitting.Nope.  The fire hazard is going back.  Unused.  I used a Hamilton Beach for 20 years until the lever broke.  It toasted perfectly.  The tray was 90% the side of the bottom and slid out.  It was all plastic body so you didn't burn yourself."
I had issues with this toaster since buying it. First the prongs would not slide down-eventually they began to. Then they just wouldn't raise at all. Not worth it sadly.
"I like it's simplicity but am disappointed that it doesn't brown toast, or english muffins very quickly. As others have stated; I have it set to the highest setting, and it requires toasting it twice to get it to look toasted."
"Pros: its cheap, it's small (I dont have a lot of counter space so this is a pro to me), bagel setting is a nice feature, and the slots fit most bread slices in terms of thickness and length.Cons: The smell is awful, like burning chemicals, not super strong but bad enough I always check to make sure the stove isn't leaking gas. The toasting is uneven (passable, just annoying). Also, when I press the lever to toast my bread, I have to push my bread down manually with my fingers to get it all the way down as the lever leaves the bread sticking out an inch or two.Overall it's not an awful toaster, its decent for the price, but I feel like if I had spent $5-$10 more on a different toaster, I wouldn't have as many issues. Basically, so long as it doesn't die, it works for my current situation but I won't have it for much longer after that."
The toaster I received did not toast on both sides evenly.  I find I must wait for the first pop-up then turn the slices around and toast another 20 to 30 seconds to get the 'backside' a little browner.  As I am not in a big hurry most of the time it doesn't bother me to wait those few seconds!!
"I needed a basic toaster and thought Amazon Basics would do the trick. It's impossible to clean well, but I was okay with that. However, it just stopped working after 6 months of low-moderate use. Maybe I got a lemon, but it's not a good deal when you have to buy again in under a year."
"Toaster works fine. However, the electrical cord's placement is odd. If you plug it in, the cord comes from the right longer side. So if you have the buttons facing out where most convenient, the cord is strangely growing out of the right longer side. It makes placement of the toaster on the counter strange looking."
I have been having trouble tosting with this thing. It tost at the lightest setting even though I have been setting it at higher and higher settings. Right now I have it on the highest setting. If that doesn't work I am going to try the frozen setting. If none of those doesn't work I will go back to toasting my moffens twice. It does have the tray that pulls out on̈ the bottom.
"It's easy to operate, but it's interesting that it takes a longer time than usual to toast and then it doesn't heat on both sides.  One reason why I purchased it was because it was smaller than the others, and I was able to find a toaster cover to fit over its size."
To get the tasting desired I need to use setting #5 and #6.  Should be #3 or #4.  But! It's only 20 bucks.  A good deal though not a great deal.
"The only thing a toaster has to do at all well is to brown both sides of the bread relatively equally.  This toaster hasn't quite got that one down.  It works pretty consistently, pops up at the right time, but one side's always a little too light or the other side's ""toast""!  It also helps to paint a small red dot with some nail polish on the temp control.  Shame the factory didn't think of that necessary functionality.  Oh well!!(3 and ½ stars ?? o.k.)"
"A toaster is a toaster.  This model performs reasonably well, although bread on one side darkens faster than the other.  Also, the temperature setting dial lacks any clear marking to point to the desired temperature.  I solved that with a dab of nailpolish.  The drop-down crumb tray on the toaster's bottom makes cleaning easy.  At its low price, this unit is a bargain."
"Had it a month or so. The lever does not go up all the way.  So when toast is done,  you either push up lever manually or dig in and get your toast.This toaster does toast evenly.I do gluten free bread and once u figure out the right time (max heat + frozen),  then all is well."
Okay for the price.  But it doesn’t heat the same on both sides.  I don’t really care cause I just flip them and toast a little long.
"Worked great for toast and bagels for 2 years. Then toast would not stay down to be toasted. Then holding down, would only toast one side. RIP 😒"
"Okay, but wouldn't buy again. Browns unevenly and must continualy tweak the time/darkness adjustment dial. The built in system for, say, bagels vs. regular toast, is pretty useless. Really flimsy and cheap as well. You get what you pay for."
"It stopped working after 15 days , another negative side  I turned it on, a burning smell was coming from it.This toaster doesn't cook evenly at all. The outer heating elements nearly burnt it, while the middle heating elements barely toasted the bread."
"Worked good for a while, but broke after about a year and a half, toasted uneven bread and lever stopped moving up"
"I liked the clean lines with basic chrome and black exterior. I liked the price. And at first, for plain old white bread toast, it did the job. It has a dial for adjusting how toasted you want bread, but no specific setting for bagels, so the dial sort of works ok, but isn't great. But as time has gone by, even though it's not had frequent or heavy usage, it's taken longer and longer for the coils to heat up and, well, you know--toast. (And the popup mechanism is annoyingly loud--it sounds like it's going to launch the bread, although it would be helpful if it actually raised the toast higher.)A big drawback to cleaning is that the bottom doesn't have a clip so you can drop it down to clean it-you have to unscrew the entire bottom--not recommended, empty crumbs, and then replace the bottom screws. I found leaving a paper towel under it on the counter and shaking it over the sink did a pretty good job, but how much simpler if the bottom could just be easily opened for cleaning.Frankly, I bought a used Proctor Silex at Goodwill; it had all the features that would have improved this new toaster, and it last 15 years before I had to replace it. That's why I say this is ""just ok."""
"When I first used it, I had to slam the lever down to get it to stay down. After a few uses, it is working better, now. I don't know what the lighter settings are for, as I am having to use setting 5 (out of 6) to get a decent toast/color on my bagels. (I bought this toaster specifically for bagels as I have a 70-year-old toaster for toasting regular bread. It works great, but the slots are too narrow for bagels.) The nicest thing about this toaster is that it toasts the bagels so evenly. No light areas, no burned areas. It toasts uniformly across the surface of the bagel. You wouldn't think that would be too hard to accomplish, but this is the first modern toaster I have had in many years that does such a good job in this respect.HOWEVER, LATER...  I finally got around to trying this toaster with, well, toast. That didn't go so well. The best description I can give is that the toaster seems to be stuck in the 'BAGEL' mode. The toast is very well toasted on the side that faces the center heating elements while the side of the toast facing the outer heating elements is hardly toasted at all. I am going to return this toaster, and may order another one, hoping that this one I have may just be defective..."
Worked well for 2 years. Loved the bagel toasting feature. And now today lowering the lever and it's not sticking down. But it is turning on.  Would expect a toaster to last longer then 2 years.  Thus the 3 stars.  I may buy another. I may not.
Easy to use
"You've got to beat it like it owes you money to get it to stay down. Other than that, it makes toast."
Didn’t last a year and a half but was the perfect size and did everything we needed while it lasted!
Liked that manufacturer listed power (900 Watts) but when toasting a bagel it wouldn't pop-up
This toaster has the basic settings which are nice. However it does not toast evenly one side darker then the other and doesn't toast all the way to top of bread.
Takes to long to brown toast. Does not get hot enough b
The toasting/browning is not equal on both sides.UK
Looks good works ok size is good for smaller space
"""Basic"" is certainly an accurate description!  Many bread sizes won't fit in the slots longwise, and must be sliced in half.  Quite cheap construction.  Ugly enough that it's stashed away in a cabinet when not in use."
Nothing fancy.  It toasts.
"Pros: The Amazon Basics Toaster offers a lightweight and compact design, accommodating one or two pieces of bread or bagels simultaneously. Its matte black and chrome finish provides a sleek appearance. The toaster features multiple setting options and a convenient cancel button, allowing you to end the toasting process at any time.Cons: The toaster's performance is unsatisfactory. It exhibits uneven toasting on bread sides and initially emits an unpleasant odor. You will need to use the toaster with no bread in it several times to get rid of the unwanted smell."
"Looks nice enough and kinda works okay, but not really. Some of the heating elements are not functional. Items are not toasted evenly - they get significantly darker on the bottom and are not toasted on the top. The frozen feature leaves items both burnt and cold.  Waffles don't fit easily and come out both burnt and cold. The bagels were mostly cold with an uneven toasting on one side. The kitchen oven works better than this toaster. Like I said, I think the toaster I got is defective... you can look inside it and see that not all the elements are on. It's probably going back."
Very lightweight and flimsy. I don’t expect it to last long. Took awhile to figure out settings until I wasn’t burning toast.
"I don't think it's characteristic of all units, but our particular toaster stopped working after a day or two (the slider wouldn't stay down). Refund process was very smooth. . . . Otherwise, it seemed to be a basically good design, though its light weight might suggest to some that it is less sturdy.  Wide slots are a plus over our 1980s toaster!"
"Purchased another toaster we returned and Amazon offered us this one.  This toaster only toasts one side and you have to make sure you watch it or it will burn if not on correct setting.  Then when you flip the toast around the first side you toasted usually burns.  You just can't put a slice of bread and walk away.  VERY UNEVEN TOASTING.  WIsh I could return this one now too.  Not happy with their ""replacement""."
"The toaster never worked right out of the box. The lever would not stay down when it was pushed all the way down. I tried to return it. I had an open return going, but it required me to put it in the original box which required me to go buy packaging tape. I ran out! So, thinking I was being smart, I cancelled the return so I could reopen another return request to just take it to a UPS Store and have them do the boxing, etc. Oops! Cancelling the return changed my return date to the day prior. So now I am stuck not only with a toaster that never worked, but Amazon's return policy needs changing. If you give me to the next day, don't change it to the day prior to ruin my chance to return it! What a joke. I guess it might be time to cancel my Prime account. One would think being a Prime member I could at least access customer service. Not happening!Update...a few hours later. I had to dig deep to find a small screwdriver to take out the screws as it has triangular head screws holding it together (security screws!).Here is a link to do a repair on it if it if the lever won't stay down. I followed this and toaster works!https://imgur.com/a/amazon-basics-toaster-b072p11h8l-repair-heating-elements-work-lever-wont-stay-down-vwIKX8E"
For the price I kept it. But it is not perfect. On the plus side you can toast multiple things back to back without it getting hot and under toasting. On the negative side it is hard to get it to toast just right. Often a little under or over done. But for $25 it works well enough. I don’t know if you can do much better. All toasters seem to have some problem. The other plus is it accepts reasonable size things like bagels or larger bread slices.
It lacks in making things golden brown like toast and English muffins and if I try and raise the heat it burns it instead of making it golden brown. There's nothing on the description that says if it makes things golden brown and I wish I had known it didn't work like that ahead of time cause I would have gone with a different brand. I bought it thinking it would be better than our old toaster and it's not it's exactly the same. Highly disappointed. I was hoping that if I used it more I would figure out how to get it to do what I want but unfortunately it doesn't want to do that it's almost as of you designed it not to do that in the first place.
"This toaster is cheap. It’s very light in weight and cheaply made. That’s what you get for the price. If you toast something the first time you put it down, it’s not done, you put it down again & it’s burnt. Save yourself the headache, don’t do what I did and cheap out, buy something better. You will be glad you did. Now I need to buy another toaster."
I bought one of these. Nice toaster but only toast bread on one side so I returned it and bought another one thinking it could be a fluke. I received the second one and it worked ok at first but after a few weeks it had  the same problem. By this time the return window had expired and could not return it.  I won't try a third.
Toaster has 6 heat settings but doesn't work properly. Too hot no matter what setting it is on.  One side lighter than the other and toast will burn on the bottom and off to one side a little if I don't manually push the cancel button. I can start with a cold toaster with a low setting of 2 and it will still toast unevenly.
It works good but it isn't cool touch so the whole thing gets hot. Also set you setting lower than you might think you need. 3 burned it. That was my go to setting on my old toaster. Nothing to brag about just seems to be a decent toaster for the money.
Works ok I mainly make english muffins and normally 3 works fine on this machine I have to use 5 (btw the numbers are minutes ) it does look nice though
"The bagel button does indeed only toast 1 side of the bagel. It worked on the first try, the lever stayed down, the elements heated up and it popped up when done. The sides stayed cool enough to touch but the silver on top was way too hot. I’ll have to use tongs to safely remove hot toast. The crumb try is an actual slide out tray, on the back of the toaster. The power cable comes out the front and can be hooked so it is off to the side. Directions state to store the cord after cooling, so coiling the excess cord underneath while in use would be a safety hazard that is NOT indicated. The little rubber feet are insignificant and don’t prevent sliding, so it’s a good thing the sides stay cool. Don’t touch the hot top!!!  I’ll keep looking for something better, and keep this one in the camper."
"Firstly, why would anyone design a toaster where the cord extends from the front of the toaster.  Secondly, I've had the toaster for jiust over a year and rarely use it but it functions poorly now.  One side of the toast will be barely toasted and the other side will be nearly burnt.  Very disappointed."
"Since I store it under my cupboard, I like the fact that it doesn’t weigh too much. However, it doesn’t toast evenly on both sides"
"Both this Feb 2024. This toaster wasn't the best.  It was a bipolar toaster that would never toast the same level no matter the setting.  It finally died today, as the latch to hold the toast failed."
Tried as soon as I received the toaster and it toasted only one side of bread. Gave it away since Wholefoods is too far for me to return it. I'm looking for a toaster that will toast a whole slice of bread and not just 3/4 of the slice. This is definitely not a good toaster.
Not a great toaster and was disappointed in quality and toasting.  Only toasts one side with the other side barely toasted.  I usually find Amazon brands great but not this toaster
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The toasting of each side individually is very good, but only the inward facing side is toasted enough. The outside one is always too light. To get proper toast you need to manually flip the toast midway through (2 full short cycles are too long).When using the toaster for the first time, the instructions recommend running 3-4 cycles outside because there is indeed a wretched, caustic smoke that comes of the toaster when you first buy it. If this wasn’t bad enough for something you’re expected to eat out of, I still had the smell for another 10 or so cycles.If you buy this toaster, run it at least 15 times to be safe. There’s no way that vapor isn’t toxic for your food."
"The toast doesn't toast the same on both sides.  One side is just right but the other side is hardly toasted on the 1st setting, then if you put it on the 2nd setting the toast is burnt on the one side and just right on the other side.  But if you put the toast in one slot and toast it then put it in the other slot and toast it, it come out evenly toasted on both sides."
"I'm on year 3 and this thing already needs to be replaced. Not worth it even as a cheaper appliance.No longer heats evenly so it half burns something, doesn't toast the other half.Great when new and  if you don't care if it lasts"
"Don't buy this thinking you're getting a deal. It's cheap, and you can tell, and you are getting what you paid for. Anyone claiming otherwise is either a shill, confused, or was the lucky recipient of the one single toaster made by these people that actually measured up. This thing does make toast though, so there's that. I was able to find a setting that didn't turn my toast into a charred mess. Most of the 'temp' dial is useless, the first 1/3 of rotation is about all I can use without creating cinders. One 1/32"" behind 'the' line where decent toast happens, the bread comes out mushy. The toast is uneven, darker on one side. Honestly, I don't care enough about toast to return it, the thing toasts 'well enough' for my needs. But if you are looking for 'good toast' - this ain't gonna do it. I suspect it will break within 6 months. It feels too cheap to last. The power cord is very cheap, super plasticky and too stiff to ever straighten out.  The eject spring is too weak for heavier breads but it functions, for now, with my usual breads. It's better with heartier slices, it'll burn Potato bread so fast it's not funny - gotta turn the dial almost 'off' to toast that stuff. Will not buy this one again, that's for sure."
"Unfortunately for my co-workers, I brought this to keep in my office. I cannot make this up: As I am typing this review, my colleague arrives and as he is opening his door across from mine says, ""You must be toasting again. I can smell it all the way down the hall.""Sometimes when I read Amazon reviews and someone complains about a product, I assume that person must be exaggerating. Let's face it,  humans like to complain. Therefore, I assumed that when I read the reviews about this toaster saying it ""smelled bad"" that there was likely a mild smell, but it could not possibly be that bad. It is THAT BAD. And before you go telling me to ""read the manual and follow the instructions,"" know that I have and I did (I am one of those annoying people that almost always reads a manual in its entirety before using something for the first time).I have yet to put actual food in it, because it still smells terrible...like chemicals that you certainly do not want to breathe in, much less allow to contaminate your food. The instructions indicate that you have to let the smell burn off and you can do this toasting a whole bunch-a-nothin' for several toasting cycles. I have done this. I have had this toaster for a couple of months and almost every morning, I walk in to my office and push the toaster button down, hoping that it will FINALLY be free of the terrible smell. To be completely transparent, I have not done it every single day, but for the sole reason that I am trying to avoid pissing off my colleagues or alarming people with the smell (the first few times I used it, a couple of people in my office were worried that something was on fire). But, it is fair to say that I have toasted a whole-buncha-nothin' at least a few dozen times and the smell is STILL HERE.Bottom line, if I still had the box, I would return it. Save yourself the trouble, and the smell, and just spend a few more bucks to get a toaster that doesn't smell like the inside of a chemical factory. Because I cannot return it, I will continue to try to use it (assuming I am not fired in the meantime)...I will report back if the smell finally stops, but I am not holding my breath on that one (although, perhaps for the benefit of my health, I should)."
Does not toast both sides evenly but the side it does toast is even. Better than the other two toasters I bought. Most seem to be junk like most things you buy today. Don’t work right and if they do they don’t last.
"This toasts bread fine, but like the other cast-off model I am donating to charity, this doesn’t have enough firepower for bagels. It toasted the bagel but did not get it heated or at the right interior texture, even on level 4. (My opinion.) So I just bought a 1300 watt toaster, an established European brand, and have higher hopes of achieving my NYC bagel Nirvana."
"Bro just don’t buy this one and spend $10 more on a toaster. It looks fine and operated fine for me, but I literally threw it in the trash because crumbs would get EVERYWHERE. If you just moved it on the counter an inch you’d have crumb city. The “tray” didn’t really catch all the crumbs. Buying a better one in the future."
"This toaster had great ratings which was why I purchased it.  But after 2.5 years it now only toasts one side. So I have to turn the bread and toast it twice. Perhaps I have too high of expectations, but the toaster I had before lasted 10 years so a quarter of that time seems fairly short. Guess it is back to reading reviews and hoping I get a longer lasting one next time."
I bought to replace my 20 yr old toaster. It was looking pretty rough. This one takes so long. You have to put on 4 and push down twice to toaster an English muffin. Not recommended 😕
"This is as basic as it gets, and not worth the price for it. I found name brand toasters at stores after buying this that I wish I had purchased. The price would have been roughly the same.It was obviously designed by someone who does not use a toaster. The middle elements are not shielded from the other toast slots, so if you have 1 piece of bread in it, one side is much darker than the other. This is common in cheap modern toasters, so I am not complaining about that. Very uneven toastingThe cord is not 37 inches when routed out the back (as was stated in the product listing). The cord is at the front bottom of the toaster, not the back end. You route it out underneath and you lose 8-10 inches off of that length. No one puts the cord on the front of a toaster design, except someone who doesn't use a toaster themselves.Finally, like a lot of cheaply made modern toasters, the crumb tray catches less than what falls out of the sides around it. There are ALWAYS tons of crumbs under toaster and very few on the crumb tray.I would not recommend this toaster except for someone who has no other option. It does toast bread. It is a toaster. It is just not a quality one."
would not but again seems all toasters suck
"This toaster toasts inconsistently, sometimes under toasting and sometimes burning, all on the same number! So if you love Russian Roulette toasting, then this is the toaster for you!"
"I keep adjusting the level of toast darkness lighter, but every time it’s darker, at least 10 times. Obviously the control is not accurate. Last time one side of toast was perfect, the other side burned!! It is faster. But I do not recommend this toaster."
"I did not like this toaster, I have used it for a a few months and it toasts unevenly. I will need to purchase a new one."
"Nice little toaster, but it toasts more on one side of the bread than the other. Not a deal breaker for me, but it is a bit annoying. Not sure if it’s just the unit I received or a design problem."
I like the looks of it and it's affordable but doesn't toast both sides of bread. I've tried all the settings and same thing...one side toasted.
I should have used it more often when I first bought it as it is probably too late to return it. but it never worked right.
"In less than 18 months we found ourselves having to order another toaster.  The toaster no longer clicked into hold the toast in position to toast.  Disappointed. The top of the unit is not heat resistant, often burned fingers while removing toast."
Toasting is great is pretty even. Slots are wide enough for bagel. But slots are not long enough for standard (Whole Foods etc) sandwich bread! Very frustrating.
"This worked fine, but never thought I'd need a new one after just three years. The mechanism for holding down the bread no longer held and needed to be manually held to continue toasting. A toaster should last much longer than this."
"My only complaint is that the toaster can only take thin items, no bagels etc."
Good value but even low setting still burns have to check constantly while toasting
when I am toasting a slice of bread one side is dark and the other side is hardly toasted  very nted!!!disappoi
Worked well for 2 months now the spring in the toaster will not stay down to toast bread. A waste of money
"Very light weight, cheaply made but makes good toast.  I don't know how long it will last but I'm keeping it."
Good toaster.  The problem was the black knob.  There is no contrast color arrow on the knob to show what number you're on for toasting.  I had to paint white nail polish on it so I could tell what number I like.
It burns bread on the lowest setting (1).Omg! I would return it but it’s more of a hassle!
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Besides the box arrived looking like it was returning home from a fierce battle, after removing a layer of dirt and dust from the ""used-like new"" toaster I plugged it in only to discover not all the elements heated up. I am going to guess this was the reason the item was returned in the first place (you could see the toaster had never been used). But the Amazon Return department clearly did not test the toaster to ensure it actually worked before offering it back up for sale. VERY disappointed as this is the exact toaster/features I was looking for. So bummed. And brand new units are out of stock with no estimated time for being available."
Hared to regulate toast shade! either to light or way too dark almost burnt! Don't recomend!
"This toaster does not brown each side the same, one side light the other almost burned."
"This is the worst  toaster I have ever  had, it never toast the same and I could not change the  bagel settingAmazon gave me a full instant  refund"
"This product toasted the bread items just fine. Nicely actually.The problem being that the crumbs just drop right on through - all over your counter.No need to slide out that tray to clean up, it all ends up in a big mess.I will be returning this product because of that and continue my search for a decent working, reasonably priced machine.Hopefully I find one that worked like the one I had for 20 years..."
"didn't toast both sides evenly. again, didn't live up to reviews.  bagel setting didn't work well. wouldn't buy again!"
My rye bread slices  don't fit all the way.
"Bad quality, did not not serve what it was"
"The issue I have with this toaster is it doesn't or it delivers the bread 🍞 one side almost burned & other sideLightly toasted.. I read the instructions on it it's did address these issues, I'll try to complete the resetting of the unit.. I don't think that will fix the issue, my old toaster did the same type of thing maybe it's just these inexpensive toasters? Hum' 🤔"
Toasts only 1 side of bread!
Worked great the first 12 months.Did not adjust heat well.  You had to keep it really on one spot on the dialBut at month 13 just after you think - this Amazon one might be more reliable than the last one I got made in China that failed after a year- this also breaks.The heat is apparently too much for the board the wires are attached to.  So with a higher than 3 dial setting for longer than 4 eggos the board cracks under the heat.You might think that is the feature they would design well. Unless your goal is to sell more new toasters.Bit sure for $22 take your own chances
"The toaster worked okay for a little over a year. My only complaint was that it wouldn't accommodate over-sized slices of rye bread, and there was no trap door on the bottom for cleaning.  Today, when I started fixing lunch, the lever wouldn't stay down.  It's not worth fixing, so I'll have to order a different toaster."
"I leave the setting the same every time I toast, but it toasts the bread differently some of the time. What's worse is that if I only have one piece of toast, it will burn it if I use the same setting that I use for two pieces.The bagle setting hardly works. I have it at max and my bagles will still be luke warm on the inside."
"After having retrieved a piece of toast that wedged itself under the moving metal arm that pops the toast up, I discovered the entire part had bent to the left. It’s just not well-built. Worked well for years before that."
"It toasted 2 slices just fine, but the end result with one slice was unacceptable. It burned on one side, but didn't toast thhe other side."
Looks nice but burns my toast. I have tried different settings and different kinds of bread and it burn them all.
"I like this toaster.  It is simple, easy to use, and cheap.  Temperature control seems to be good in limited usage.  However, it has a fundamental design flaw that I discovered the hard way.  The slot is wide, but the basket bottom covers only a small fraction of it.  That means when you are using something narrow (Pop Tart in my case), it can fall off the basket and go all the way down to the crumb tray.  Not only is this unappetizing, it is very difficult to get things out.  For wider things like thick-cut bread, buns, bagels, etc., this should work fine, but do not try your Pop Tarts in it."
Only toasts on one side.
only post on one side
If you are looking for a piece of nice evenly toasted ... toast? Bread? Whatever... this is NOT the toaster to get. It toasts very unevenly all the time. The slots are a bit narrow as well and bagels struggle to get in. Will probably exchange and if a replacement model improves I will update thus review.
THE LOWER HALVES OF TOAST OR BUN GETS SLIGHTLY BURNT. THIS IS AT ABOUT A 2 SETTING
"This toaster worked fine, until it didn’t. I have to apply a rubber band to keep The handle down In order to toast, my toast. It’s not that big of a deal but little bit annoying."
"As other reviewers have stated, the outside heating elements work well while the interior-side heating elements bearly heat. Thus, you get bread that is toasted on one side but barely brown on the other side. If you want one-sided toast, this is the toaster for you; if you want both sides toasted, look for another model."
Really lightweight and feels cheap
"Based on the generally positive reviews and the 'Amazon Basics' appellation I took a chance on this cheap appliance after problems with a much more expensive 'Name Brand' toaster. I should have known better! The most obvious issues out of the box were its' light and flimsy construction and the vulnerable and extremely easy to turn temperature control knob poking out on the front...so easy to turn that, without realising it, a very gentle brush with a SOS pad while wiping the counter top had spun it to the end of its' range giving burnt bread on the first use following! Despite all that, the toaster generally worked well...for a while, but after a couple of months it started giving erratic results. A setting just below #4 had initially given good, even browning but suddenly started becoming uneven and variable. A quick look at the heating elements told the tale as several areas were not coming up to temperature. Evidently this is a common problem with all cheap Chinesium toasters, dozens of which are currently on offer, and it's a crap shoot as to whether or not you happen to get a good one. Back to toaster shopping!"
"This works great, heat-wise. Two issues: One, there is no baking pan, I use my old oven's pan on top of the grate. Two, any crumbs that might spill onto the door will simply dump out onto the counter when the door is closed. My last x-brand oven had a baking pan (that fit in the slots) and the door dumped crumbs into the crumb tray. I'd give it another star if it had a 60 min. timer as did my x-brand one."
"I wanted a small toaster oven to fit an area in my kitchen. However, the entire unit gets hot when turned on to bake or toast which adds heat to the kitchen. Toasting bread heats up the area, baking time is only 30 minutes then you must reset. Shelf doesn’t come forward when door is opened. It’s cheap and you get what you pay for. I expected better from B&D!"
The dial that acts as a timer has the option to turn it past “off” and then it puts it into a “stay on” mode. Several times we have smelled something burning to find that the toaster oven is extremely hot and smoking because someone accidentally turned the dial too far. I think I’m going to toss it out before it burns my house down.
"I use my toaster oven almost every day. Pros - it gets hot quickly so the toasting happens fast and you need to stick around to monitor the toastiness level.  Cons - toast will burn if you don't know exactly where the dial needs to be set. Definitely have to turn knob right, past all levels, then back left. But its pretty hard to tell 'where' as there are no lines to mark the right place. Cons - the whole toaster gets hot.. like every possible surface so don't put anything that could melt near it. Cons - personal preference is to open the door & have the surface tray come forward w/the toast. But the surface tray isn't connected to the door. If I'd seen this in a store, i would not have purchased it. It works, but its tricky."
"I had an earlier model of this that was 20 years old.  Worked great until the element burned out.  This newer unit is harder to read and set the timer for toast.  I wish they would do a better job testing the usability of products.  You must turn the timer all the way to the end first, and then turn it back down to the time you want. otherwise, the timer (used for toast) will pause while the heat is element is on."
"I got this to replace a model that was basically the exact same thing, that I'd bought at Big Lots about seven years ago and the cord went bad. That one toasted bread great. This one starts burning the crust before the center of an average bread piece even starts getting dried out. I don't know why it works differently than my previous one. I use this for toasting more than baking, so it's annoying."
"Working well, except of tick-tack noisy sound while it’s baking …Very tiny and suitable for the small space!"
"Had high hopes for this toaster oven, but unfortunately it was all scratched up. I will be returning it."
1-  The electrical connection to the toaster lever soon petered out — trying to toast bread became a series of frustrating fails.2-  All the slices of toast popped up with the top inch excessively bent downward — trying to pat it down in line with the rest resulted in breakage.Had to return it.(I am now resolving now to read both + and - reviews)
"My manual/instructions say it IS ""convection,"" but it isn't."
"An inexpensive toaster oven that toasts fine. No bells  no whistles. It gets hot (duh!), but higher end units put heatproofing on those spots that are likely to burn you. Not here. Have to be careful where your hands or digits go, or it will bite you! Will it make toast? Yup...sure will.You pay a little, you get a little. My advice? Spend more, get more! Easy concept."
"I have only used this unit for toasting.  And, while the ""how toasted do you want your bread"" dial rotates about two inches total, the zone between ""this is not toasted"" and charred/dried out is literally like a millimeter.  Maybe that whole dial would be useful if I intended to bake something for 30 minutes, but, it's horribly designed for my toasting purposes.  Also, my last toaster had multiple rack levels to it and multiple heating elements (which created more of an even heat), and this one has only one of each.  I guess I didn't catch when I bought it that this is a more basic unit."
"I loved it when it was working, but it quit within 3 months"
I like the concept of a small and stylish appliance.I do not like: 1) too small to cook meals 2) misleading (to myself) product description 3) it's not useful for making actual entrées. 4) it doesn't 'rapidly cook' foods.
"I have not used this item much and getting used to it-- I had real problems with burning thing when I was not baking them just heating them so called customer service and was told to set the temperature lower because instructions are to ""add the 10 minute warmup for baking to the time"" but then set the time too long and overheated the item.  So now have instructions written down as to where to put each dial -- bake or toast and how to time it so think I now have a handle on it  The dials are hard to see and so pictures are good.  As with learning to use a microwave--  I know I can always cook it more but cannot cook it less!!  Good advice to keep in mind."
"Toaster oven toasts and bakes and even broils, but be careful opening the door. The handle does not get hot, but it's small and your hand may touch the top or bottom of oven door. There is also no way to get the crumbs out of the very bottom mid oven even though there’s a crumb tray. But the worst part is the tiny print that says “bake” or “toast.” You have to get extremely close to read it and get nearly on top of the dials to see the words “toast” and “bake”. Too many times I did not reset and used bake to toast and toast to bake — not successfully to say the least."
"It's very difficult to to turn the timer to ""stay on"", a few times it has looked like it's there and starts but it's not. I had a B&D toaster oven for about 20 years and I loved it, perhaps it was the age of it but it caught fire...but I kept using it until I thought I should get a new one."
"I had a similar Black & Decker toaster oven that I bought in the late 1990's.  It lasted 24 years and technically still works, but the automatic shutoff stopped working, so I decided it was time for a new one and bought this model as it seemed the closest to the model I was replacing.  Now, first off, the timer on this model is mechanical.  You can hear it ticking as your toast is being made.  It's rather annoying, especially in the morning.  The timer on the old model used some sort of internal timer and a magnet switch to shut off the oven when the toast was done or the door was opened.  It was completely silent.  I doubt this cheap mechanical timer is going to last 20+ years.  Also, this timer doesn't automatically turn off the toaster when the door is opened.  Next, I don't understand the point of 3 knobs.  The old model had just 2 and it did everything this one does.  The middle knob they added is to select between baking and toasting.  On the old model, you didn't need to do that.  Just pressing a button turned on the toaster and the oven was controlled by the upper knob.  On the old model, the bottom opened up for easy cleaning.  This model just has a tray at the bottom you can take out to clean, but if there are crumbs on the bottom of the toaster itself, they are hard to get out.  Finally, the door keeps coming off at the hinge and I keep having to fix it.  The door NEVER came off the old model.  It still works perfectly after 24 years.  I have been a long time fan of many Black & Decker products and many of them I'm very satisfied with, but this toaster oven is not one of them.  I'm very disappointed.  I wish they made the old toaster oven from the late-1990's.  I would buy it again.  Please stop cheapening your products, Black & Decker.  Don't fix what isn't broken!"
"Just didn't seem to be what we expected, or work the way we wanted."
Opening for tray door drops no spring to hold it. and to small
"This oven worked well enough, a few times a week for different settings for about three years. Roasting began to stop working in its fourth year and stopped entirely. In its fifth year, broiling is failing and oven power has also gradually faded.Would not recommend."
"Confusing directions, phrasing, typography, and poor layout of too many words, symbols.. etc. Neeeds a good art director. The three control knobs are poor — the top nob is so loose it doesn’t seem to be connected to anything (and maybe its not!), while the third is so stiff I have to use two hands to move the slippery dial. Bad quality control.. I expected much better from Black and Decker, since reviews were generally excellent. I’m returning it for refund."
"I liked my old B&D oven better. I don't like having to reset four knobs everytime I make toast instead of just flipping one lever and has a little less interiorroom. It's an attractive unit, seems to bake well although toasting time isquick and hard to determine. Be attentive. It's very stable, easy to see whatscooking and easy to clean. Good for limited counter space and 1100 watts isgood for only one circuit in my kitchen, refrigerator included."
"It does toast but difficult to adjust toasting between not enough and too much,"
"Seems very lightweight, smaller than I’d expected. I’m not sure food on plates will clear the top inside."
"toast function shuts off sometimes in the middle of toasting and takes too long to turn back on;  also timer knob very stiff, almost impossible to turn if hands even slightly slippery."
"Knobs are different, dimension are different 9 1/2""D, 15 1/2""W , 8 1/2"" H. Checked box and model # on box matches description. Tested it with a piece of toast and although both sides toasted, the top and bottom  only 1/2 of it was toasted. Both elements working fully lit.  Maybe just a placement issue. I am hoping these are the only issues."
"My toaster oven took several minutes to ""toast"" a piece of bread. It had to be reset several times to get the still-not-right ""toast"".  The oven took an extra long time to heat to the correct temperature set and was still lower than the set according to a reliable oven thermometer.I called Black & Decker to explain the problem. Without hesitation the representative agreed that it was not operating properly, and is going to replace this one with a brand new one.Very good customer service."
Worked ok but I used this regularly for 3 years and was difficult to clean.
"When I received the unit, I I received no Warranty Card, owners Manuel nor any little pans for it. Should I have??"
"The timer broke not long after we bought. We can still use it, but you have to watch your toast or it will burn. And you have to manually turn it off which feels like a fire hazard. Disappointed in a Black and Decker product."
I bought this to replace a Black and Decker toaster oven I had for a number of years. The quality of B & D has really gone down hill. The unit is flimsy as is the broiler.pan. I cannot recommend this product
"When first using the toaster the chemical smell was very significant and very objectionable. I was told by their representative that this was normal. NO WAY. We've had several toasters and NONE of them created such a strong and long lasting smell. Only, after over two hours of it running in toast mode over several days on our porch, did the smell reduce to acceptable in-home use. Let's hope that the rest of it functions better in the years (hopefully) to come."
Cannot get the oven to heat over 350 nor will it stabilize at temperature. A safety issue when heating food.
Like this oven but not best innovation. Toast burns VERY EASY. even at low settings rack fall out easily too.  Bought this one because it takes up small space. An OK ITEM
When we received the item it wasn’t even in the box it was advertised as going to be in. We proceed to open box and item has a dent directly on the back and the front was falling off. We spent money on an item expecting it to come not dented or messed up. It works but who wants to purchase something and it comes messed up….
"It took a long time to heat up frozen food like nuggets ,tenders and fries.I used it less than a handful of times. I was better off using my oven. I dont think it saved me anything in electricity.  I had to put in on double the time to heat or cook something."
I like Black & Decker and have had many of their toaster ovens  and been pleased. Not so much this time. Although it's external dementions are a decent size the inside much smaller. It also lacks that feature of when you open the door the tray slides out. The last feature that is the worst one I missed in the spec's was the fact that the timer only goes for 30 minutes! I've never heard of such a thing .  I  wish I I could return it but I've used it several times before I learned about the time limit so my advice to you is be sure you read the spec's carefully before you buy.
"I know it's cheap, but I didn't think it was meant to be that disposable. Only last 18 months before it stopped clicking to off from the timer. My MiL almost set the house on fire when she fell asleep with bread in the toaster and it never turned off.If you are just looking for something to tide your over for a short period of time, it is a fine simple machine and was good while it lasted"
"Good product, the only thing is it's very small inside.  I didn't realize this when I first got it, and cooked Taco shells. Because of the smaller size inside, the Taco shells burnt and caught on fire (because it was too close to the top) and I fortunately was able to put out the fire, though I did get burned.  So be Wary of this if you purchase this❗ ❗  One more thing, the times eventually didn't work so it actually burnt the food because the timer button stuck and didn't turn off, very dangerous❗Thanks for this product❗"
"Most will need a magnifying glass and a training course to understand the dial operation.  For example, the knob direction pointers are so faint that nobody can be look across the kitchen to be certain the device is set to ""toast"" instead of ""chaude"" or to ""toast"" and not ""120ºC"".The toast shade selection requires hairline precision.The instruction sheet says ""Turn the TOAST/TIMER selector to the OFF position"" but while all three dials say ""toast"" the word ""OFF"" has been left off.The top surface gets hot enough to fry an egg, disastrous around casual clutter.The instructions specify ""unplug appliance when not in use""!  Who does that with a toaster?  This is a red flag that the business entity shirks responsibility.However this oven cooks perfectly fine if its the only item on an empty counter with an experienced user who, if toasting, can stoop down and use a flashlight while maintaining eye contact with the toast before it burns."
"My other BD toaster oven was similar but this seems less sturdy and takes longer to cook items. Maybe it's breaking in, but wish I would have ordered the other model."
This toaster oven takes very long to heat up and the toaster elements do not heat enough to toast bread.  That is probably because they turn off before the timer finishes.  I don’t recommend this toastet oven
"Temp is really inconsistent. Temp setting is at 275 F but thermometer inside oven is at 250 F for a few minutes, so I bumped it up to 300 F and thermometer is still at 275 F. If you’re using this for clay, you must keep an eye on it. Tried taking a pic of temp knob and thermometer."
"Controls seem very old school, hard to not over toast aka burn it.You have to spin a dial past 10 minutes and then force it back to pictures of toast.My carbon footprint got larger while I figured out where to spin it..."
"Pros:  ok if cooking a lot of flat, quick, very small dishes.Cons:  much too small.  I can just fit a chicken leg quarter, no room for vegetables or anything else.  At that, it's a tight fit in all directions.  Takes a really long time to cook chicken leg quarter and skin only crisps when I switch to broiler feature. I've had many toaster ovens throughout my lifetime and this is my least favorite.  Getting rid of it and getting a larger, better one."
I purchased this toaster oven a few weeks ago.I really tried to like it. But as I continue to use it it really did not work well at all. Firstly the knob settings had dual language on it. Spanish and English. That probably would have been good if this was a Spanish family who couldn't read English. But this was not the case. This made the knob writing so small that every time I want it to change the setting on it I had to pull out my glasses because I couldn't see the writing on it.I tried toasting. the first time it came out on done. And then when I added more time to it and burnt it. Granted you need to get used to it as to the length of time. So the next day I tried again adjusting the time on it and I came out burnt.I tried again and next day on a different setting. And it still came out burnt.I tried it everyday for a week. And it either came out on done or it came out burnt. Very frustrating.The second thing that I try to bake was chocolate chip cookies. I have to say that those cookies came out perfect . of which I was very happy. And was willing to give it a second chance.Then I decided to roast some pork which I have roasted many times in several different toaster ovens.Disappointedly the top of the roast pork came out burnt. This was when I decided that this little toaster oven was not for me and that's I had to return it.
"This oven is way too small for my needs. It's basically a glorified toast. Since I have used it, I will probably give it away or sell cheap."
"I've had this same toaster since college and it worked great for a decade.  Decided it was time to buy a new one after a fire scare, so bought the same one.  Unfortunately the new one does not get anywhere near as hot as the old one.  It is not hot enough to properly toast things, which is the primary function of a toaster.  Don't know what they changed or why, but it was really disappointing.  Guess some things in this world just get slowly worse over time without you noticing.  I shelved it and went back to my old slightly-scorched one.  Looks like it'll be me and old faithful til death do us part."
Disliked the knobs hard to turn.  I guess it will get better with use.  Wish I would have returned it!
"I went with the cheaper option that was offered on Amazon. It came with the front separated, as my pic shows, and the back has a dent. When it arrived, I’d just gotten off work, and was hungry. I took it out of the box, plugged it in, and it worked.  So, I used it. It cooked my supper good and hasn’t had any problems. So, I didn’t complain."
"It’s just ok, hard time getting the settings right, plus the lettering is so tiny, I wouldn’t purchase again"
It's very easy to use and cooks evenly
Did not like the features. Difficult to use.
smaller than I thought it would be and reading the temp setting is very difficult.
Disappointed. Doesn’t toast even top and bottom and also doesn’t toast evenly on one side.
"Temp Control, Timer etc. writing so small it is VERY hard to read."
"I dislike the fact that it is advertised as a 'convection oven', when it is not. It is merely a toaster oven. I used the exact same model for about 25 years, although it was not labeled anything more than what it was - a 'toaster' oven. I feel the manufacturer should not use the word convection in it's advertising for this product."
"DO NOT BUY! I bought as a quick way to cook pizza, cinnamon rolls, etc. It probably weighs less than 5lbs (a gallon of milk weighs more) and is very cheaply made. This is a very small oven despite the description.  It gets extremely hot on the outside, almost as much as the desired temperature on the inside...maybe you can make two pieces of toast on the inside and two on the outside. Yes, ovens do get hot on the outside, but with today's modern world they should all be heat insulated.  The heat from the thin, cheap metal can cause serious burns and be a fire hazard! The temperature of the inside does not reach the indicated temperature on the dial.  It is noticeably lower.  To add to the misery, the timer is extremely loud and ticks like a clock.  This product is potentially unsafe and in my opinion a waste of space. In today's economy, spending $50 on a product that is subpar is unconscionable.  Unfortunately, the time to return it has expired.  This is a lesson learned...make sure to open and try a product before the 30-day window expires. DO NOT BUY!"
"My biggest complaint is that the door hinge is already broken after 1 year. I expect a toaster oven to last longer than that. In general, the oven worked well. The controls (see the picture) are tedious, and if someone changes one or more knobs off of toast, you might not notice until you didn't get the result you anticipated. I find the controls hard to read even with my glasses on. We didn't like the controls for how dark you want your toast. It's a bit arbitrary. I would prefer numbers, or a definitive dial setting, so I know I'm always setting it the way I like it. The instructions were helpful and the oven is easy to clean."
I purchased this to bake my polymer clay earrings in and the twist knobs definitely made this a little difficult especially if you twisted past where you wanted to or wanted to turn something down.  I ended up returning and getting a newer model of the black and decker since it better suited my needs.
"What a huge disappointment for a product!  I have have been meaning to review for Black and Decker after using 10x or less.  I had hardly used it when I received, and the bottom element quit working.  It's sitting on my counter, and I don't know how to fix or replace.  I tried to take out the bottom element or rotate it to get it going again.  It's now a toaster oven which only heats/cooks on top making it worthless.  Save your money and do not buy."
I was looking for something a little more user friendly..Difficult to find appropriate temp to reheat foods....Does not toast evenly
"When our 14yo Black & Decker toaster oven died, we replaced it with this one. What a downgrade! The only pro I can think of is that it's at least relatively small and doesn't take up the whole counter. But the cons go on and on! There's not actually room to bake anything in this thing! In my old one (which was smaller on the outside!), I could bake 6 muffins or a 6"" cake. In this I can bake...literally nothing. The rack is so close to the top of the oven that there's no room. All this thing does is make toast, and that ""simple"" task requires setting three different dials. I hate it when wonderful products get ""improved"" until they're junk. I'd say choose another brand, but as far as I can tell, these days they're ALL junk."
"Heats ok, but I don’t think it’s very accurate. The timer counts down from 30 or less minutes and then shuts off. Can’t leave this one on for sure."
Looks good but toaster features of this product do not work at all! Barely gets warmNow I have to buy a toaster
It toasts darker towards the back of the oven. We decided to put the slices if bread towards the very back to get a more even toasting and it didn’t work. It just burnt the back half. We read & re-read the instructions and feel confident with the settings. And the other thing I should comment is the rack does not slide out when you pull the door open. I missed that when ordering. That’s something I would prefer to have instead of using an oven mitt or tongs to pull it out. And then watch out because it slides out all the way if you aren’t holding it.
I was not impressed with this item. It really could not hold my shallow baking pan or dish.
"Yes, the controls (3 of them!) are labeled but with 6 point words (in two languages) and bitsy icons so all that messaging could all be squeezed onto the front. Really, Black and Decker? I blew up an image so you all can use it as a reference should you buy one of these and want to toast."
I can’t figure how to use this properly even with the directions which are confusing and inaccurate
"I liked this toaster until two days ago. Smoke is coming out from all sides of it. I cleaned off the bottom heating element and its cover, though the top one I could not get to. It does not look dirty. I have kept my oven clean, so there wasn't much to clean off anywhere else. It puzzles me because I don't use it more than two or three times a week.Smoke is still coming out from the sides and top, so I do not dare use it anymore. It's puzzling because I have had Black and Decker toaster ovens before. Disappointing."
"Until today I would have given this thing 5 enthusiastic stars.  I've used it nearly daily for the past 3 years and if it had just died, I would have felt I had more than gotten my money's worth and replaced it with the same model.  But this morning as I was heating up a hot dog on broil/grill, there was a loud pop and the door glass shattered completely, blowing hot glass chunks (thankfully not sharp pieces) up to about 4 feet away.  Some glass ended up inside and some was even behind the unit.  This was under normal use, in normal temperatures, doing the same thing I've done many times in the past.I like this thing -- doesn't take up a lot of room, easy to clean, cooks a whole trader joe's pizza, pretty basic and (I would have said) not a lot to go wrong.  Great buy for the price.  But the glass shattering could badly hurt someone standing in front of it, which is a big deal.  I see that others have had the same experience, so it seems the company should look into this.  It also makes me wonder if the same thing happens with other toaster oven glass doors, though.  My bottom line:  don't ever stand in front of a toaster oven with a glass door while it's operating."
"i had a black and decker oven toaster for 20 years when i said goodbye to it. So i had this new black and decker hoping for its durability but skeptical on the features and operations. I am using this oven toaster primarily to toast bread. Occasionally, heating up leftover foods.PROS: Just one, easy to cleanCONS: 1. Not user friendly. You have to use the knob as toast temperature control and power switch. Once you miscalibrate the knob resulting for the bread to burn, you cannot turnoff the power right away from the knob. Kind of stiff. There should be a rocker power switch (on/off), as a FAIL SAFE DESIGN or something better, like the model that serve me for 20 years. I am having doubts on the durability, using the knob as a power switch.WARNING: Do heat food that may cause to splatter oil - To any oven toaster. This will cause a fire.I'm not sure if all oven toaster manufacturers have this warning."
"This toaster oven was smaller than we expected. It barely fits 4 regular sandwich type slices of bread. And only 2 medium size slices of pizza. The tray is too small for the oven and could be at least 2 inches larger. I'm not sure why they didn't make it to fit better into the oven. It would be fine for a dorm room or small kitchen. But if I could do it over, i would have chosen a larger oven. It does heat up fine and functions as expected."
small but works good
"BLACK+DECKER Toaster Oven, TO1313SBD  This device will toast and heat but is very inconvenient to use.  Like most toaster ovens the exposed heating elements are hard to get around for cleaning spills and crumbs, and the external chrome finish is easily spotted.  However, this unit is particularly hard to use because the markings for heating mode (toast, bake, warm) and temperature are miniscule, and not contrasty with the rest of the busy dashboard.  I have to use a flashlight to read the dial markings to use this unit."
Had one 7 years before it burned out. Worked really well for us. Bought another one and the door fell off within 7 months. Not sure if we got a dud or if the quality went down.
"They tried to fit in english and french on the control panel, so the font is TINY. Is it possible to get just english labels so the font could be bigger?"
"We bought this toaster oven because we liked the last one we had, supposedly the same one. After many years, the old one began to take a long time to toast. But, Black and Decker changed the design for the worse. Before, I would often take the tray out as soon as I began toasting something. On this new one, the tray is inside the oven door so it's difficult to get it out and it's hot. Also, we never burned toast before, now, we regularly burn toast. Trying to set the dial to the right amount is a random spin of the dial. That, combined with our overly sensitive smoke detector makes for unhappy times."
"I just received this product and was looking forward to the even distribution of heat from convection technology, but what is ""convection"" about this product? There is not a convection air switch and, from my experience with efforts to toast, the heat on the top is much higher than on the bottom.  The top turns brown and the bottom doesn't. So, is this really a convection product? I am basically getting the same results as the 30 year old ""non-convection"" toaster oven I replaced."
"My previous Black & Decker toaster oven performed flawlessly for many years (more than a decade).  When the top heating element finally died recently, I immediately purchased another Black & Decker as a replacement.  What a disappointment.  The lower left door hinge failed in less than a week -- just long enough for the product/shipping packaging to all have been thrown out in the trash, so a return becomes too much of a hassle.  The door no longer closes fully, but I can still toast an english muffin (so far), so I'll try to keep using it.  (That's why I gave it 2 stars instead of just one.)  What a cheap-a$$ piece of garbage, though.UPDATE:  The manufacturer (who uses the Black & Decker brand name under license for small appliances) sent me a replacement unit at no charge.  It has worked well so far, and the door hinge has not failed.  I've even started to get decent results with reasonably uniform toasting."
"Toaster works exept that the knob for adjusting the toast level is terrible, only uses about 1/10 of the rotation for browned toast, so it's really difficult to make fine adjustments. You either get no toasting or too much toasting."
Fit the space well. Looks fine but did not do the job.
I think this is a fairly good toaster but each time I purchase it it breaks after about 1 year at the most.It gets expensive to purchase a new toaster oven every year.
"I wanted to replace my Cuisinart, because it was unreliable temperature-wise and would, in theory, stay on forever if I didn’t turn it off.I was looking for better temperature-control and a max depth of 12”, and this one fit the bill.But ughh, its cooking space is so small!  It comes with this dinky little pan that will maybe fit a single slice of pizza.  What’s the point of having all of these cooking options if you can’t actually fit anything in it?  I will deal with the hassle of returning it because it’s totally useless."
Not very powerful and takes longer than a toaster to toast bread.
"Although it’s built well and easy to use , the heating coils - which are singular top/ bottom - do not distribute the heat for toasting well at all ."
"This did not take 4 slices to toast, the dials are not easy to see/read and the settings are not accurate, especially for the toast.  The timer is very inaccurate and although the instruction manual mentions an 'off' setting, there was none.  I returned this item and replaced it with a Kitchenaid Toaster Oven, it cost more but you get what you pay for."
Works bit after a few months the timer knob quit working. It gets stuck.
"This is a nice, simple toaster oven. I’ve only used once so far but do like it. However I’m disappointed because one area on the metal trim around the front is somehow bent upwards. It’s a fairly minor thing but it’s noticeable and frustrating when I literally just took this out of its box - and threw away the packaging. It definitely makes me feel like the budget friendly = just cheaply made."
Won't shut off.  When timer runs down to zero minutes it won't shut off filaments.  HAVE TO UNPLUG THE TOASTER.  Only 5 months old.  Not heavily used
"It works as expected, but the print is too small to read because they chose to write it in three different languages! I would have noticed that in the ads pictures, but again the print was too small to see clearly!! Very bad/cheap and irritating marketing ploy to save a couple pennies!!! Wishing I had bought another brand"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            this is supposed to be a brand new toaster oven. I ordered it same-day shipping. It arrives in a sealed box. It is brand new, but has no baking rack or grill to actually assemble and be able to use it.. Either somebody has taken the parts out and return this item prior to me purchasing it or black and Decker is really falling off of their game. Big waste of time and money"
"This is a nice toaster oven. Good looking, lots of controls (three dials instead of two—not sure it makes a difference), easy to clean, compact.Seems great as an oven but unless you're standing there watching your toast, it burns nine times out of ten. (Well, ours does, anyway.)It's a design flaw, imo... the area on the lower dial for toasting is so small that you can't set it with any precision. It's either undercooked or burned. And if it's not toasted enough and you put it back, it gets burned.I am aware that you have to turn the dial past 10 and back again—doesn't make a difference.I'd recommend something more simple if you just make toast. Again, as an oven, it seems to do a great job. Very hot and very even heating."
"I’ve been using this toaster several times a week since May 2023, taking good care of it and cleaning as instructed. For the last 2 months, however, i’ve noticed the timer knob reaches 0 and does NOT turn off the heating element. I always make sure to twist the knob PAST 10 as instructed and then set my desired time (reasonable, although admittedly kind of annoying). This is the second of these machines i’ve owned and the same issue happened the previous time. Since i had owned the previous one for ~5 yrs i figured this was an acceptable time to failure and just replaced it. Now that it’s happened again and that i’ve seen this has happened to other owners, it’s clear that this is a major design flaw. I would recommend staying away from this toaster as its longevity is unpredictable and constitutes a considerable fire hazard for anyone that owns it. I would not be surprised if it’s already been responsible for a couple house fires by now. Hope they recall these units before someone gets hurt."
I use this mostly for making toast. So far it works nicely. Don’t like the space the drop down door takes up.
DO NOT BUY THIS!It's a scam product. Here's how it goes: I buzz the delivery guy in to my building but never see him. I hunt for the package around my building complex to no avail. Package is marked as delivered in my order history even though it never shows up. Customer service supervisor (I end up with her because the initial agent thinks it sounds shady) tells me I can only get a refund because now the product is unavailable & they can't just send a replacement. I say it sounds like a scam & she agrees. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!
"This toaster oven is a total disappointment. Too bad Black and Decker does not guarantee customer satisfaction. Now I am stuck with it. I bought it to replace another B&D toaster oven that I had for years, but this is more expensive and a complete downgrade. (1) The print on the dials are too small and unreadable. (2) The unit is cheaply made and feels flimsy compared to my previous unit. (3) The inside tray has only one level and cannot be adjusted rendering it useless as a small oven for many items such as baked potatoes. (4) The only way to clean the inside of the unit is from the front, so you must work your way around the heating component. My previous unit had a door on the bottom of the unit that could be opened to clear out debris on the bottom and then clean the unit. (5) The oven did not come with a user guide, only a foldout piece of paper that is also too small for me to read. Even the pictures of the dials on the paper are too small. I may give this toaster oven to Goodwill and buy another, but it won't be from Black and Decker nor from Amazon's website."
"Listen - if you're limited for space for whatever reason and like toast or whatever - rather than using an air fryer - this will do the job with minimal fanfare. TBH, I plan on picking up something a wee bit larger later, but for now it does what I need it to do."
I wanted a small toaster oven- should have spent a little extra for a better one. This one is cheap looking and seems to take a long time to even toast bread. Disappointed.
"The look is very nice.  Im just not sure on the quality of its function yet.  For Bread seems fine.  Only used once for bagel, that seemed to have been fine.  When trying to use it for frozen waffles it seemed to have cooked unevenly. Like the idea of it being a touch type product. Like all the options for the functions.  Just not sure its working in all the areas that the description states it does yet."
Probably one of the lightest toasters I have ever owned.  I actually thought the box was empty!
The item arrived quickly.  The toaster is lightweight and I need something sturdy for multiple users.  I would advise using this product for sparingly usage.
It’s ok but nothing too special.
"This is great looking product, I have to say the digital display kind of hooked me, I thought it would be really cool. After using it for a few months, I can honestly say I've had cheaper toasters that toast more consistently. Maybe I just got a middle of the pack version of what this is supposed to be. But from my perspective, it's very hard to get things toasted correctly in this. I can put two slices of bread in it, set it for a certain time, and they will come out barely toasted. I'll have to put it down another time and pay attention or burn them. I can then take two more pieces of toast, 5 minutes after that, put them in and it will toast them completely differently than it did the first two slices. Oh well, like I said it's a toaster. I'd probably just buy a cheaper one next time."
"No matter which setting I use, the toast is darker on top and most times burnt."
Easy to adjust for different breads & toasts very evenly. Really like the count down timer. I use the Bagel button for one sided toasting a lot. The reason for only 3 stars. I toast bread with lots of seeds and crumbly English Muffins. After 18 months something got stuck in the mechanism that holds the toast down and pops it up when finished. I had to take it apart and shake it out to clear the problem.
"Since day one i have not been able to get an even toast - see the picture. In addition, the steps between the 7 toast darkness settings are 30 seconds. I wish they were 10-15 seconds for better control. It could work with some breads but not with all."
It ok for right now thanks
"Perfect for toast, perfect for autistic people, or people who like simple picture based touchscreen Devices rather than try to remember numbers of toast levels, problem is when it comes to bagels or English muffins they won’t pop up, the spring is not strong enough, but we didn’t buy it for that. We bought it for toast, we have the four slice model, the two slice model may be slightly better for this The surface area is less in the spring might handle it better"
"I wanted a medium quality toaster that would last through average wear and tear. This toaster is thoroughly disappointing. The metal piece on the bottom left side bent after maybe 3 uses, so it’s a fight to get the bread out of that side every time I use it. It also doesn’t spring up when it’s done toasting, which I thought was one consistent feature for all toasters. Cheap plastic finish all around. I wish I bought a more expensive toaster because this one is not worth the price."
"Not sure how you can manufacture a bad toaster, but after purchasing two different brands, I can tell you that it definitely is possible!  The upside on this toaster is that it does taste like toast after you butter the toasted bread, although it (unfathomably) does have a dried-out taste (even w/butter).  This is on setting 3, which is a ""light"" toasted look.I don't know where the manufacturers are getting their engineers, but come on . . . the cord does NOT fit neatly underneath the toaster and the bread tray is difficult to remove.  :/  That is why I'm rating it as a 3 -- adequate only.  Will keep, but I sure miss our 20-year-old KitchenAid (they don't make them like they used to anymore either); and I will continue to hunt for a much better toaster!"
"I really wanted to like this toaster. It gets two stars for styling and design. It gets one star for efficiency. I read all the directions first. I had frozen bread so I selected bread, defrost, setting three as suggested in the instructions. I put it in the slot for single slice as instructed as you see it burned one side and the other remained uncooked, although it was thawed."
"I used the first setting and my toast was very dark. I can’t even imagine anything beyond one. I think the quality control in the toaster industry needs work. I wish the consumer could manually manipulate the time the heater elements stay on to toast besides just the little knob because, well that just doesn’t work well enough. I know I’m going to sound old saying this, but I don’t remember in the old days having so much problem making toast. It just wasn’t so dang complicated and toasters didn’t have so many bells and whistles. I don’t know if it’s because where they’re being made nowadays or what and how they’re being made I mean it shouldn’t be that complicated. It’s like reinventing the wheel. And it’s not just this company. It’s like three other companies I have tried. They’re either too late or too dark. Even the toaster I have now I have to re-toast the toast like two or three times to get it right because it’s too late. I can’t quite get the setting right. I just don’t understand it."
"I have purchased several Chefman products that I have been very happy with but this one disappoints.  They tout several temp settings but my toast is inconsistently toasted, comparing sides.  The setting is 2.5.  I can’t conceive why anyone could use settings 4 thru 6, smoke alarms would activate."
"This toaster is just ok.  I dont like the rim on top, tends to catch crumbs.  It toasts bagels nicely, but the toast is soft on the inside."
"If you like surprises with your toast this is the toaster for you.  We use the third setting, which is an average doneness for toast.  The first round is typically fine, but if you place another couple pieces in on the same setting soon after the first you will get VERY done toast.  Why not four at a time?  Because the unit will not take four pieces unless you're using the customary sandwich bread such as Rainbo, Bimbo, Roman Meal, or other.  We like Orowheat (Arnold) and other larger slices, so we can only do two at a time.  Having said that, sometimes the ""toast"" comes out as warm bread on the same setting.As far as consistant browning is concerned the same outcome can be expected with bagels.As always, it boils down to country of origin, if you know what I mean.The main take-away is keep looking."
"I returned the first toaster due to the inadequate toasting level. Even at level 6, toasting both english muffins or sourdough bread left us with a lightly toasted bread. Upon receiving the replacement, we ended up with the same result. We kept this second unit although we are a little frustrated that we must continually add toasting  time in order to get an adequate browning level. We enjoy the ease of use and overall toasting process, however the lack of dark enough toasting is annoying. We will continue to use the unit with the hope that we come up with a toasting procedure that will ultimately meet our needs."
"This review is for the model with the digital control.I like Chefman in general as being a tad better than most, but this toaster is an abject failure.  The digital control was a great idea but ultimately the 7 fixed settings fell far short of what is actually needed.  The problem lies in that the settings are 30-40 seconds apart.  1 is 90 seconds, 2 is 120 seconds. 3 is 150 seconds 4 is 190 seconds, 5 is 220 seconds, etc.  I have to toast my favorite bread on 1 because it burns on 2, and then manually toast for another 20 seconds.  In reality, the spacing should probably have been 10 seconds.  I find it difficult to understand how this product could even be released into the marketplace.  There seems to be almost no cost savings in doing it this way.  Shame on Chefman management and marketing.Everything else about this toaster has been great so far.  I've had it a month.  It just has this one flaw that makes me want to take it outside, swing it by the cord and see how far it will fly."
Bought this toaster twice hoping the first one was a defect. Nope. The color indicators do not correspond at all to the settings cooking effect. The very light version yield an actual cook color of day the middle setting.
"I purchased this toaster 2 months ago. I had tried several other brands, comparable funcionality, and this promised to be what I was looking for.  Yes, the cord is much too short for those with limited space available.  Yes, the cord exits from the side instead of the rear or front of the toaster, which is awkward depending on the socket availability.  I have made adjustments for those problems.  It is very easy to clean, a big plus. On the minus side, the pop-up function barely pops up.  No matter the size of the item toasted, it's still necessary to use an implement to remove the toast.  I have found the toasting temperatures inconsistent.  One side toasted, the other less so.  Sometimes there is a variation in the intensity of the toasting using the same number.  Here's what I've decided: they must don't make them like they used to - none of the manufacturers of this price level toaster appear to get everything right.  I still am using the toaster & take what I get."
We don’t use the toaster much but by month 8 it is not toasting one side of bread have to flip bread around during toasting if you want both sides toasted.
"It doesn't toast evenly, doesn't seem to toast the bottom of my bread at all. It toast unevenly, notice the almost burnt bread vs the decently toasted bread. Both slices were toasted in the exact same cycle. And neither of the bottoms is toasted at all. If your looking for a quality toaster. Look elsewhere."
"I’ve never had more perfectly toasted bagels, BUT the arms designed to hold the toast upright in the slot aren’t capable of holding a Pop Tart straight up and down, so the top edge will always burn.I’ve seen reviews complaining that the lowest setting was too dark. If you’re looking for a way to make dry bread, this isn’t your product. For me, setting 2 made golden brown toast, which is fine — the heating elements in most toasters get weaker over time, so maybe I’ll get a few more years out of this one."
"I am mostly happy with this toaster and would give it 5 stars if I had a power off button.instead, the toaster has a 20 minute time out before going to sleep and only leaving the glowing cancel button (you press this to wake the toaster)I am thrilled I can easily make my preferred level of toast now.I'm in a house with people who prefer warm bread and I'm tired of having to fiddle with the knob to toast my bread - and having to toast it several times because someone has reset the knob again.I won't mind needing to plug and unplug this unit to use it because I'll be able to see the doneness I need immediately.for the price, I expected a power button - or a more electricity saving 3 or 5 minute auto turn off - but unplugging will have to do."
"The photo on the right is setting 5 and the photo on the left is setting 6 (highest setting). It took over 4 minutes for setting 5 and over 5 minutes for setting 6. As you can see it doesn’t toast evenly. I will say it did a better job on plain toast, but again very slow. For me it just isn’t worth the money (over $50.00)…but sadly companies don’t value a quality product over planned obsolescence any longer."
the indention around the slots catch crumbs and I find that annoying.
"The issue with this toaster is that there are heating elements ONLY on the external side of the toaster slots.  The internal sides of the slots do NOT have heating elements. The result is that one side (external) of your toast is done perfectly, while the other (internal) side barely toasts at all."
"the slots are big enough  for Rye bread but it burns the bread toward the middle of the toaster not real happy with this unit, great for regular bread. but Bagels too tend to not fit right!"
"Toast sets a little low in the slots, so if it's smaller bread it can be a hot time! It also doesn't brown evenly - one half will be darker than the other. So, it's a toaster. Eh, just dealing with it!"
"We bought the toaster 8 months ago. It worked fine, until this morning. Now we can't get the thing that holds the bread to stay down. It's useless."
Smells weird when turned on
"This matches everything in my kitchen nicely and I haven’t had any real horrible issues with its use. I’m not entirely convinced the options for bagels,  etc really make a difference, but eh? Toasting time is slow and sometimes bread will burn on the same setting where it did not burn the previous time, so that’s a little confusing, but ours does not get a ton of usage, so it does what a toaster should do. Stainless is stainless so fingerprints are obvious but clean easily with stainless steel wipes. Have not had to empty the crumb tray yet, so not sure how well that works."
"When I first bought this toaster about a year and a half ago, I was really happy with it. It looked nice on my counter, it was easy to use, and it toasted consistently and evenly. The defrost and bagel settings were great features. It was a bit of a challenge to clean but not worse than most toasters, and better than my last one.However, after about a year of use it started to malfunction. The handle became wobbly and hard to push down. It began to pop up early sometimes during toasting. It also began to stick in the on position sometimes while toasting, which would cause the toaster to overheat and burn bread. I tried thoroughly cleaning the toaster multiple times to see if that would help with the sticky handle issue; it didn't. The problem just kept getting worse. Today the handle became completely stuck while in the on position, and the ""Cancel"" button would not work at all to turn the toaster off. I had to unplug the thing to prevent it from catching fire.Really I thought about making this be a one star review given this turned out to be a fire hazard! But I added the second star because I did actually love this toaster for a good year before it went bad. Given that most reviews of this toaster are positive, I hope I just happened to get a dud, but I'm honestly afraid to buy a second one of this brand to try to find out.If you buy this one, keep an eye on it . . ."
"It has a lot of inconsistentcy. Using the same settings it can either give a nice toast, burn it, or have to go down longer. It fits bagels and larger slices of bread nicely but I absolutely hates how it can be on the low setting and it will turn the edges of the bread black. It's definitely wasted a few slices. Overall looks nice, came with a small dent, not a huge issue I just wish it worked better. Might be returning this one."
Even on lowest setting one end of the bread (in the Middle of the slot) is almost burnt and the other end (towards the outside of the slot ) is barely toasted. And as another review stated it sodesnt cook even on both sides either
"Update:  After using for a month all works as it should except that if you only want to toast one slice of bread you should reduce the darkness setting.  Otherwise you will get a piece of toast that is much darker on one side than the other.  The outside of the toaster remains cool.  The so-called ""lift"" lever feature is useless for something like an English muffin so watch your fingers here!I buy a ""Natures Own"" bread available in many food stores that barely fits in the slots in this toaster lengthwise so, buyer beware.  And, like many toasters now, the temperature control is the cheapest kind of resistance type control that simply won't last long and will not remain consistent over time but, I expected that.  I settled on this toaster simply because it received fewer bad reviews than the rest and it's not too pricey.  Once you read through some of the reviews you'll realize that no matter which product you choose you will probably be disappointed so don't set your sights too high.Consumers used to be able to count on appliances in America to be reliable and nearly bullet proof - not any more."
"Nothing toasts well, I even put it to the highest and it doesn’t even get brown."
"I wouldn't buy it again. Darkness levels on bread is great. Same level on English muffins, doesn't brown it at all. Only choice is bread and bagel."
"I've had this toaster for over 4 months now, I wished I had returned it. It toast unevenly and very dark. Even on shade setting 1 which is the lowest, you'll get burnt edges on one side. I was thinking the toaster would adjust, that it was just new and needed to burn off the initial smell (which it did do that) and it'll get more consistent...it did not. I hate this toaster. That said, it looks nice and the touchscreen is nice. But that's all, it works lousy."
This Chefman toaster seems to be exactly the same in every detail to the Brevo toaster which is no longer sold on Amazon. The Brevo I purchased in 2018 died in 4 years of light use and I thought I would get a different brand but ended up with the essentially the same toaster.  It is a very attractive unit and toasts reasonably evenly.  The biggest problem is that it's lifter doesn't lift far enough and you end up with burnt fingers if you use smaller pieces of bread.  Eventually you buy wooden tongs to get the toast out.  The crumb tray is not that useful.  It is easier to simply shake out the toaster upside down over the sink.
I've given this product a 2 star review.  While the controls and function of the toaster are great.....note my 5 star review for those I am giving this product an overall rating of 2 stars.......here's why:I purchased this for it's sleek and contemporary aesthetic.  Yes....a toaster should function but the appliance should look good too.  That's why I purchased it.  It has a flaw in its design......the electrical cord is located on the side of the toaster......the front side.  When you plug it in the cord is very visible and there is no way to conceal it.It would have been so easy...EASY...for the manufacturer to have that cord exit from the back of the toaster.That location would have made the cord much less visible.In the marketing photos of the toaster no where does it show the cord.  NO WHERE.  Based on my previous toaster and small appliances the electrical cords typically are located at the backs of the appliances.....and for good aesthetic reasons.I'm puzzled.....the manufacturer/designer took some effort to make this appliance look nice....modern and with a fairly minimal design.  Then.....they totally wrecked the design by locating the cord where it is ......toward the front and exiting the side.  Not good.If you want a clean looking toaster stay clear of this one.
"Love the digital visuals, but not a great toaster.  Set at 4, Toast overdone on top and barely tan an the bottom of the bread. Reverse side is light as well.  Will return."
"I like that it is light weight and comparatively easy to clean but it browns only one side, consistently. So pretty much you have to flip the bread and do it once again or settle with a toast that has been toasted only on one side"
"Earlier this year, my decade-old toaster died. I dreaded having to replace it after hearing about how bad all toasters are these days. After comparing reviews for about half a dozen toasters, I opted for this Chefman. At least none of the reviews said it spontaneously combusted.Well, reader, I should have just given up on a toaster all together. This toaster toasts -- but it browns way too fast before the bread actually gets crunchy. There is no way to fix this, because if you turn the dial past level 2, your toast will burn. (Photo of bread attached was toasted at level 2, the lowest level.) And it doesn't get the edges of this normal-sized slice of white bread either. So if I use this toaster, I'm stuck with mushy toast. I would have returned it had I realized how fickle it was before the return period ended. It just sits taking up space on my counter, and I toast my bread in my air fryer and my bagels under the broiler instead. A waste."
"Has a lot of good functions on front, but outside heat seems to be hotter than inside heat coils. Does not toast evenly on both sides."
Item needed to be replaced after 3 months and contacted manufacturer who stated that there are not any available right now and offered me a lower model for replacement. Why.??? Now I must wait until it's available and it's been over 1 month now. I'd stay away from this manufacturer as they are not willing to help out their customers
"It burns to the center of the toaster. Everything else is toasted perfectly fine, except edges near the middle. I guess that you get what you pay for. This happens on toast or bagel settings. 😞"
"Does not toast exactly the same on both sides, but not enough to be bothersome."
It’s okay. Feels a little cheaply made. It’s also awkwardly long lol.. IMPORTANT: If you’re using thinner bread make SURE you use the lightest setting first… the 3rd setting turned my toast black lol.
"So it looks nice, and I really liked the simplicity.  In theory you select the picture that is the toast color you want and ....well that's as cool as you'll get, because it doesn't toast well....  it also takes a LOT longer than any toaster I've ever owned.  On average 6 to 7 minutes for golden color.  Not sure I'll keep it."
"Why bother making 6 settings for this toaster?  In the picture above I used settings 1,2,3, and 4. I then cut the toast in half so both sides can be viewed.  I used the same bread, and the same slot in the toaster. Each slice was toasted after it cooled down.  I bought a different brand toaster from Amazon, and had to send it back for poor performance (it was delivered in the toaster box with no padding inside). I expected this brand would be better. It was delivered in it’s original box, and it did mace formed styrofoam for protection…sadly I’m yet again  going to return a toaster.  I will buy a new toaster at a STORE vs online because I think the shipping is too hard on the delicate wires in a toaster."
"It's REALLY boxy and oversized in appearance. Despite that it's mostly clad in stainless steel, it's thin and looks and feels a bit on the chintzy side, and it's a REAL magnetic for fingerprints and smudges. But more importantly, it works. It doesn't brown as evenly as my old Oster toaster but it gets the job done. The reheat and bagel settings are useful options. The toaster is surprisingly lightweight for its size and doesn't particularly have a solid feel so I hope it will last for a while."
We got this toaster because our cuisenart toaster toasted unevenly.  We initially really liked this toaster except on end would burn.  Now after a couple of months both ends get done and the middle remains white no matter what setting we put it on.  Very disappointed and regret buying this toaster.  It toasts very thin bread without any issues but my sliced sour dough or rye does not toast in the center.
"When we first got this toaster it worked great, we loved it. We even ordered a second one a few months later for my niece. Now though I must report that we are VERY disappointed. The inside heating mechanism quit working. So now our bread only toasts on one side ☹️. This happened with out much of a warning. I would say I noticed it seemed to be toasting a bit different right before it malfunctioned but nothing significant. So do waste your money."
Great display and function-Uneven toast-why is the power plug not in the rear.Very Disappointed.
"When placing something smaller into the toaster (such as a Poptart or a strudel) there is no way to manually raise it back up, after it's finished toasting.  Leaving you no choice, but to reach down and pull it out with your fingers while you hope and pray that you don't touch any of the toaster surface and burn yourself.  I honestly thought this was a standard feature in toasters, until I used this one.  I wouldn't buy again, for this reason alone.  Otherwise, it toasts - so it lives up to its name."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Burns one side of bred every time, no matter  how many slides I put in there!"
It toasts too high and tends to burn the edges. But I decided to keep it. But tonight when I was cleaning it there is a trench around the slots that gets full of crumbs and is difficult to clean. I went to return it but the return window closed yesterday. But I would look further for another one.
The setting is In correct if you use in 2 times in a row it will burn your toast if you only use it for the 2 slices and stop it’s ok
Toaster is all banged up. Disappointing.
"I’ve had the product for nearly a year and it works great, but I’d love to meet the genius designer who thought it would be clever to have the cord come out the side near the front. It’s a fairly short cord anyway so this really limits how you can use it from the nearest outlet."
Never used it but it does look good aside from the huge dent.
"As usual with toasters they don’t get used all too much in our home, so it was sad when it was actually time to use it it WILL NOT WORK! It keeps popping up with an error messages. The only way I can do anything is on defrost. Disappointed to say the least!"
It does not matter which setting you choose; it will over-toast/burn your bread or barely make it warm. I used it about 20 times and gave up. It's also past the return date because I only make toast about 3 times a month. Frustrating ... and I paid for that frustration. Can't win 'em all.
It's a toaster. . It's not anything super amazing. It had a bit of a smell for about the first week of use. It's also.not super consistent... sometimes it cooks the toast perfectly  right about at a 4 and then the next time it will burn it.
Good until it stopped working at one year.  Does not toast. Not worth it if you didn't replace every year!
"Purchased in March and now the inside coil isn't working.  Also, will burn one side of the bread or bagels."
Had it for a couple months now and it’s starting to burn everything no matter the setting I choose
"It’s ok. Should have gotten the one I really wanted. But, ok with this choice."
This toaster was fine though it tended towards a stronger toast so we’d always have it on the lowest setting unless toasting frozen breads. Then after 6 months it started the burn toast on one side. I’ve communicated with the company and they haven’t been helpful in securing a replacement. Don’t buy.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Looks nice with wide and long openings. I can now toast those longer bread.Downside part of the bread is burnt using shade 4 of the 6 available.
"Been looking for a 2 PC toaster and bought this one based on reviews.  There is no difference in shade no matter what shade you choose.  I like my toast lightly done.  Nope!  Toast comes out the same no matter what setting you choose.  Even on the lightest shade it comes out black in spots and gets it WAAAAYYYY over toasted.  My son uses it mostly and he seems to like it so I'll keep it and probably give it to him when he moves out.  Overall VERY disappointed!  If you like over toasted this will work for you but if you're looking for a lightly toasted setting, look for something else."
"Beside the inconvenience of setting the dial every time, the toasting leaves some of the bread almost untouched and the bottom of the slice burned. I missed the return window because I kept trying different dial settings to make it work. It’s now in the trash. Two stars is generous."
"All a toaster has to do is stay down and toast bread. Well, if it doesn't stay down, it's not going to toast. 'Nuff said."
"The middle burners stopped working on this toaster months after use. There is a 1-year warranty, however, it takes DAYS for Chefman to even read the warranty request, and that doesn't count how long it takes them to process, ship, and ultimately replace the orig unit. It's a problem when this was not the cheapest toaster and this is something my kids use every day. Not thrilled."
I have burned myself so many times on this junky toaster.  It does do anything well.  I am contantly trying to clean out the debris to keep it from flaming up inside the toaster.  The outside of the toaster gets so hot it is hard to believe it safe to use.  I cannot wait to cut the cord and get rid of it.  I am always cleaning it and turning it upside down to get bread stuck in the bottom. Nothing seems to end up in the crumb tray so it is of little value.I would not recommend this product and won't even donate it for fear of someone getting burned.
"Received toaster timely and in great condition. Yes, watching  toast is boring but you have to with this toaster! My last toaster turned it to medium and received medium toasted color bread.  Unfortunately this toaster dialed to number 2 and had to cancel halfway through the cycle to get “medium”."
This toaster browns more on one side than it does the other. Don't know if this is a flaw or just the way it toasts. Usually have to turn the toast to evenly toast the bread.  Disappointed in it.
"You would think that if you paid more money for a toaster you'd get a better toaster.  I was wrong.  Inconsistent and uneven toasting, bagels and muffins constantly getting stuck were just part of the problems I had with this very poorly engineered appliance.  Now, after 7 months of putting up with it, it's in the trash.  Thanks a lot Chefman."
All I can say is that it doesn't work as well as my old one. Digital display may draw you in but it is very inconsistent on toasting.  Just gave it to my granddaughter and when back to my old one!
"Prouduct damaged in the banged up manufacturers packaging that was taped up like it was open prior. No bueno, returning"
Good toaster#4 does not work on my toaster.Can company help to resolve the problem?
One side of the toaster stopped working… It is used a couple of times a week for 6 months…Customer service is useless because they don’t answer the phone…
Totally uneven toasting.  Who is in charge of QA at this company?  Should be summarily exited.
We had issues where the bottom edges of the bread were getting burned even at lower settings and after 6 months the middle resistance stop heating. Not the quality I was expecting. Wouldn’t recommend.
"This is a terrible toaster. I have tried numerous settings and it almost burns one side of the bread and hardly toasts the other side.  (This is on the normal toaster setting, not on the bagel setting). Very disappointed"
"BUYER BEWARE!! TOASTER CANNOT HANDLE HIGH HEAT, IT WILL CRACK THE PLASTIC! I purchased this toaster in July of 2022 so could not return it to Amazon. I contacted Chefman and they informed me that the one year warranty covers replacement only, HOWEVER, they will not mail a replacement to Hawaii or Alaska! What good is the warranty then?!! I repeatedly asked for a refund so I could repurchase another one on Amazon, however, I was denied multiple times. Chefman's solution/recommendation is to mail my toaster to a friend or relative in the lower 48 and have them mail it to me. :0(On top of all that, Sofia, the customer service representative, stated that ""The toaster should not have cracked due to heat."" IS SOFIA CALLING ME A LIAR?!! This is terrible customer service!! Sofia, please know that I am NOT a liar and I take offense to your statement because it DID crack when I turned up the heat, I heard it!! If you want to take your chances with Chefman, go ahead but I will not EVER purchase anything from Chefman ever again!"
"A few of the elements don't even heat up, I wanted a smaller toaster, that I like but it is a poorly made CHEAP model, I guess you get what you pay for.  My other toaster was WAY better, but was to big and took up to much space."
"I love that the toaster has 2 long slots vs 4 short slots, a bread & bagel setting, as well as the visual toasting darkness setting. HOWEVER, the lever will not stay down on its own and requires it to be manually held for 3+ minutes and that is just not feasible. Horrible quality. I’d return it, but I threw away the box, so I’m chalking this up to a BAD purchasing decision."
The toaster is modern but 2 months after barely using it only 1 side literally toast.Does not toast evenly at all.Not happy & I can’t even return it
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This toaster is permanently on bagel mode and what I mean by that is it only toasts one side at a time. This toaster set off my smokr alarm on setting 4. Setting 1 does not toast the bread at all but settings 2-6 Burn it. There is no in the middle. The photo above is on setting 1 and 2. DO NOT BUY AT ALL COSTS
"I ordered this returned and refurbished toaster for slightly less money than a brand new one. I've had it a few weeks, and now only the bagel button works.This is the 2nd time this toaster will be sent back as it's not working appropriately even after refurbishing.What a waste of time!I recommend you find a different brand toaster and rethink buying refurbishes from Amazon. I hope they aren't planning on selling this toaster again."
Pros: I love the look of it and the layout of the selections of this toaster.Cons: I don’t how it is for others but anything thicker than Texas toast bread gets stuck. Try getting a ciabatta role out of it… not easy.
Can't use past level 1 or it will burn the toast.
"I got this toaster because I liked the features, but after only 2-3 months of occasional use, the toast will not stay down at all. I tried contacting the company and the seller with no help or response at all."
"Has many features, including the shade level. I find they aren’t always accurate.Overall decent toaster wouldn’t repurchase."
Sometimes works great .. sometimes heats up slice of bread on one side ... I should have listen to those reviews lol
This device does not toast bread evenly. Debating returning it but I’m lazy and will probably resign to eating half burnt toast.
"Toaster elements do not heat equally top to bottom so even a small piece of bread isn't toasted evenly. Just tried to use the ""bagel"" setting. Doesn't work at all. Bagel overly browned on BOTH sides with a #3 setting.  The unit's construction is not sturdy at all, poor quality compared to what they've been in past years.. I've purchased B&D toaster many times in the past, I won't again."
This toaster toasts well but it is difficult to get mini bagels and smaller slices of toast out of the toaster without using a knife to pry them up and out. The toast lever can be pushed up a bit to elevate the bread a little bit but not enough to prevent burning fingers or having to use a knife or other utensil.
It is just your basic toaster. Nothing special. I didn't want to purchase the cheapest or the most expensive. I was aware of the Black and Decker brand name. It smelled horrible the first time I used it. Like burned plastic. I am thinking it is not very safe as far as the environment goes and not BPA free. It gets the jobdone and toasts the bread.
This is a gift and it arrived to our shared house in its own brand box with a huge picture and product details for all the world to see. So much for the surprise. All items should be shipped in amazon boxes during the christmas season.
"I have had this toaster for just over ten months -- its a decent toaster, worth the price.I've had better performing toasters in my life (more even toasting, don't scare the begeezus  out of me every time its done and pops up) but they all cost much more."
"The first time I used this toaster, it smelled like burnt plastic. I didn't see anything burning but was really concerned it would do that any time I used it, hence contaminating my air and, possibly, the toast. However, it stopped doing that after one or two uses. However, I am not happy with its performance as a toaster. First, I have to re-toast the bread 2x, sometimes 3, before it is adequately toasted. This is starting with frozen bread, as I always freeze my bread. Still, when you put it all the way up, you'd think it would toast the bread a little bit in all that time. However, it doesn't, so it takes quite a while on repeat. It also has a very short cord, making it difficult to move out from under the cabinets. Since a LOT of heat comes out the top, I am concerned about all that heat hitting the underside of the cabinets and warping or drying them out or whatever. I don't think it is a fire hazard but I would be much happier if the cord were long enough to pull the toaster all the way out. My final complaint is that, although it has nice wide slots for big bread, it is not really quite deep enough for big pieces so, if you are trying to toast something other than a small, square loaf, some will stick out the top and not get toasted. Overall, I am not very satisfied with this toaster. Luckily, I only bought it to tide me over until I found a sale on a good toaster over, which I have now acquired, so I don't have to use this dumb thing anymore.Summary: If you want a toaster on the cheap, this is good enough. Just be aware you may be waiting a while for your toast!"
"It was a design meeting in which someone pointed out that having the cord exit the machine from the same end as the controls is not ideal, because such a design means that in order to achieve maximum distance from the wall, and out from under cabinets, the controls would be facing the wall, thereby becoming difficult to see or operate. This person was likely ignored by a person with more power, but less intelligence, and talent. Why did they do this? My guess is that the side where the controls are doesn't get as hot, and fixing that issue would cut slightly into profits. Notice the difference between the photo of our old toaster (stainless steel) and this Black and Decker. I rest my case."
"I read the reviews indicating that the plug in cord is short. I didn’t think it would be that short, but it is. Make sure you have a plug really close by. The settings seem to be inconsistent, so I need to check my toast/bagels often to make sure they don’t burn."
"After years of having a serviceable toaster it finally failed and i needed to replace it. I buy almost everything from Amazon and headed for the website. I reviewed the various offerings and found the Black and Decker which happened to be Amazon’s recommended toaster. Money was not a factor. After two weeks of use i can say the toaster is very light weight and does not feel like a substantial product. It toasts, but not evenly. Far worse is the chrome rim which surrounds the top of the toaster. It has a gap in design which allows crumbs to gather inside nearly every time what you are toasting pops up. How can a company as large as Black and Decker manufacture a product with such a stupid design flaw. After every couple of uses i have to disconnect the toaster, take it to the sink and shake the crumbs out. It is so stupid it actually funny. I can’t return it after a couple of weeks of use and no box. I’ll use it until it annoys me enough to throw it out and purchase a different brand."
I bought it because it was Black & Decker and I like Black & Decker! This one makes a lot of noise when the toast pops up almost scares you if you're not ready for it! Bad form Black & Decker
I was disappointed. The toaster is too large for my counter.  I'll still use it for awhile only because I dont feel like returning it. I do not recommend. Looks really out of place.
"The cord on the toaster is too short, and it connects to the toaster at the point where you push down and engage the toast. The cord should come out of the other end. Poor design."
"My one big problem with this toaster is that it toasts the bread extremely unevenly.  Some heating elements in the toaster heat up just fine, but many either do not heat up at all or heat up significantly less than the others.  One side of the bread is much darker/harder than the other, and even one side is browned very unevenly.What is the alternative to this toaster?  Maybe there is none.  I looked at the video reviews for a number of the other toasters and they all toasted the bread just as badly, even the more expensive ones.  Maybe there's a really expensive toaster out there somewhere that toasts bread evenly..."
It gets the job done.  Super short cord and also… sharp edges where you put in your items.  Was not expecting to be cut by my toaster.  Won’t be buying this brand again.
"For the time that the toaster worked, it was a great toaster. We bought it on Amazon in August of last year, so it’s only a year old. We attempted to repair it but it seems to have a fuse issue. I’m hesitant to buy the same one again for fear of the same issue."
Bad design open edge around toaster top that fills up with crumbs
"This toaster works nice overall, but the bagel feature does not work properly and this is the second one like this.  Disappointing..."
"Looks, toasters are something that have been around for a long time. It shouldn't be too hard to make a basic toaster at this price point that would last decades and work perfectly.Can't report on decades of use, but I kind of doubt it will last too long with regular use. Timer works ok as a new unit, but it doesn't toast evenly. I'm not too disappointed, it's ok, but I've sure had better toasters in the past. It is really light in weight, I hope it holds up over time."
"I'm picky about my toasters because I don't want to wait forever for my bread/bagel/english muffin to toast, and I want it to get very dark brown without having to run it twice.I was hesitant to buy this toaster since it's the 2 slice model of the 4 slice toaster my employer has in the breakroom, and that toaster's bagel setting doesn't do anything, requires 2-3 full runs on the darkest setting to get it even dark brown, and takes forever for each run.  The toaster this was replacing was also an older Black & Decker non-cool touch model, and that required the max setting be used twice to get things dark enough, and also took a really long time for each run.The Good:This toaster definitely has no problem with the power/darkness of what it produces.  The dial goes from 45 degrees down to the left, around to 45 degrees down to the right (270 total degrees), and I won't set it more than 2/3 through it's range. It cooks the bread/bagel/english muffin quickly also, so the overall time spent cooking is amazingly short.  I'm also happy about the width, length, and depth of the slots.  They're wide enough that a thick bagel doesn't have to be smashed down to fit into the slots.  The length of the slots is enough that a wide piece of homemade bread easily fits in the slot.  The depth is good enough that a large bagel has no problem dropping completely below the top of the slot when it's depressed.  The automatic centering (or whatever they call it) doesn't crush thick bread products when depressed, but does hold it in place well.  The cool touch feature also works well.  The plastic exterior doesn't melt when using it, nor does it get hot.  You still wouldn't want to put it away hot since the edges around the slots are still metal and get hot, but the rest of the toaster barely even feels lukewarm.  The rise when pushing the lever up works well also.  The old toaster we had the trays would get stuck when you tried to lift the lever to bring the bread higher out of the slots after cooking so you could grab it, but this works smoothly and flawlessly to bring it up high enough to grab comfortably.The Bad:The problems the toaster does have are numerous though.  The obvious one is that the bagel setting doesn't do anything.  They provide a button labeled bagel, and they have little icons pressed into the metal of the spacer between the slots that indicates how you're supposed to position a bagel, but doing as instructed cooks the outside and inside the exact same amount (it's supposed to cook the outside much less than the inside).  Also obviously they had someone design the toaster who didn't know much about how toasters work.  Even though the bread products depress well into the slots, the bottom half is the only part that gets cooked.  Consistently everything coming out of the toaster, regardless of size, shape, or darkness setting is less than half as toasted on the top as it is on the bottom.The list of pros is long, and the list of cons short, but the biggest failure on this toaster is the critical one.  All I ask is that it cook somewhat evenly, fit normal size bread, not take 10 minutes to cook, and be able to get dark enough in a single run."
She no likey. Doesn't toast evenly.
Cord is too short.
"So, I've only had this toaster for a short while, and it's sorta doing its job--it toasts. It doesn't do a spectacular job of toasting ( a bit uneven toasting across the surface of the bread), and it's sort of difficult to calibrate the degree of toasting. Also, the buttons for bagels and for frozen items don't seem to be doing much. Having said all of this, I must keep in mind that it is low priced, and thus warrants an average rating. So, if you are considering this toaster, be forewarned....Addendum to the above: This mourning I toasted a bagel, utilizing the Bagel button on the toaster, which I previously disparaged. Well, the results were wonderful! The exterior of the bagel was just slightly crispy, and the interior was tender and nicely heated! So, maybe I was harsh in my original negative assessment; don't think, however, that I am going to change my three star rating! In searching for this posting, I noted the listing for other toasters, and many of them were lower priced than the Black and Decker toaster! Since part of my three star rating was based on the low price, I feel mildly deceived in characterizing this toaster as being 'low price'. Thus, I should lower my rating to two and a half stars. Fortunately for Black and Decker, I'm feeling magnanimous today (probably due to the Bagel I enjoyed at Breakfast...)."
"Good size, good price. However. it does not brown evenly. It doesn't accommodate rye slices so that part of the slice doesn't brown since it sticks up out of the toaster."
This toaster is like any other. It toasts unevenly and more on one side than the other just like every toaster I have ever owned.
Toaster slots too short for a wide piece of bread.
I can't tell you how many toasters we have been through in the past five years.  They certainly aren't made to last like the old heavy metal ones.  This one is black plastic and looks nice but seems to take forever to toast a regular size Orowheat multigran bread.  The bottom of the bread toasts nicely but the top of the bread is barely toasted as it doesn't go deep enough into the slot.
"For the price the  toaster is OK, not great.  Have only used for toast, not bagels.  Most of the settings are too light for my taste.  One side of the toast comes out darker than the other and uneven.  The cancel setting works quickly."
"It's a toaster, it toasts thing, does a decent job of that. What annoys me to no end is the short, short, power cord it has....  if you're going to place it somewhere where there is a power outlet literally right next to it, you'll be fine. Otherwise, keep looking..."
"OVERALL, if you just need cheap and easy this one works super great. Honestly no real complaints! Major annoyances however, there is no real way to clean out the crumbs on this one and there is a slight plastic smell the first few seconds still after repeated toastings!"
"This toaster was great for a while. Suddenly after about a year and a half, it started smoking. We cleaned it out to make sure it wasn't just some crumbs burning, but there is clearly a malfunction. We have to throw it away and get something else."
Was so looking forward to having toast for the 1st time in 8 years. Got it out of the box and went to plug it in only to discover the cord was far too short; requiring me to purchase a 3ft 12 Guage extension cord (never buy an extension cord that is less than 12 guage). Add 2 - 3 feet to the cord and it'll be fine. After I get the extension cord I'll update to let you know how good of a toaster it is.UPDATE:  I  AM  HAPPY  TO REPORT  that with the toast darkness set at 3.25 it made perfect toast the very first time. Very happy with it.
"The black toaster looks nice on the counter. It’s not too big, doesn’t take up a lot of space.  Sometimes one of the toasted breads pops right out of the toaster on the counter. I don’t have a problem with that, maybe the bread is too lightweight. It does make good toast on both sides of the bread. Happy with my purchase."
"Note : I am writing this review a week after receiving this toaster. Purchased based on reviews... big mistake. I enjoy a toasted bagel with cream cheese most mornings. Bagel setting is no different than regular setting. After my first attempt to toast a bagel resulted in toasting on both sides I tried regular white bread on the bagel setting. Sure enough both sides of the bread were toasted in a similar fashion. My understanding is that a bagel setting should warm exterior side or at least lightly toast the outside (yes I placed the bagels with split side towards the interior and uncut side at the outside position).As far as regular bread toasting it is uneven. Top section of bread hardly toasted. Setting on anything over #2 resulted in bread being overly toasted. Can't imagine what higher setting would result in!Called their product support line and was placed on hold with a message that I could opt to be called back rather than stay on hold... chose this option but no call back.Unfortunately, I threw away the box before actually using the toaster so no return to Amazon."
Toasts fine but bagel function doesn’t seem to work. I returned the first thinking it was a bad toaster. Second one does the same. 🤷🏼‍♀️
The toaster is easy to maintain.  It does take a much longer time to get the bread toasted even at the highest setting.
Couldn’t repurchase my previous toaster: no longer in production.  Controls on this one hard to use.  Toast time knob is sloppy if you have any moisture on your hands at all and it’s hard to gauge the right degree of darkness.  Also the pop up is located in the back: not very handy. Nice looking but if purchase my previous brand over this one even though it’s more money.  Convenience of use a big issue for me on this one. Thumbs down but because it works I gave it a three star.
Cannot fit a slice of Pepperidge Farm bread in completely. Doneness varies from slice to slice.

Good product except the cord is very short.  Needs to be lengthened.
"A little more lightweight than expected; not the old B&D quality. The coils do not heat up evenly so toasting is a little uneven. But, the cancel button is useful. You get what you pay for so I'll use it until it breaks and then order the one I really wanted that's $130.00....."
This toaster does what it is supposed to. It was cheap and B&D is a good name. When the toast pops it is LOUD. It sounds cheap too - the components rattle. It takes a tad longer to toast than toasters I have had in my past. I can’t complain about the browning. It does so perfectly and thick breads or bagels too. Perfect for a college student or a first apartment.
I find this toaster is just okay.  It toasts unevenly.  I never seem to get a nice uniformly brown color as I did with my prior toaster.  It is not horrible but I was hoping for better toast.
"Makes toast great, but not the best when items are frozen... it will burn the outside and leave the inside still very cold... I tried to unthaw items first but then it will be all bent on the bottom..."
"Well, it was a good price. I need to try different settings, my first attempt left a burn line across the bottom of my toast. It's pretty big, my toaster covers don't fit it. My main complaint is the cord, it's So Short. Be prepared to spend more money on an extension cord. I know appliances have short cords for safety but this is ridiculous. Returns with Amazon aren't free anymore if you can't get to a drop off place (transportation issues is the main reason I even use Amazon) so I'll keep it but I can't recommend it."
What's with the short cables on toasters?Cable on the toaster is 3-5 inches too short to the outlet. Cable sizes matter!
I have to turn English muffins around while they are heating up or they will get burnt on the side facing the bottom.
I bought this to use in my RV.  I don't have much counter space so I needed something compact.  Love the B&D brand so I was happy to find a 2 slice toaster at a reasonable price.  Sadly it will be returned since the cord is way too short.  I literally had to put it on top of another item in order for it to reach the outlet.
"I bought this toaster in April and have had to buy a new toaster today.  This toaster has never worked right.  Bagels get burnt and bread does not get toasted.  I put the toaster on a higher setting and nothing happens, the bread still comes out white.  And the same is true for bagel setting, use the bagel setting and the toaster doesn't toast and if you use the bread setting it gets burnt."
"We don’t use a toaster every day - maybe four out of seven days. Bought the toaster at the end of February & it was t used over the summer. So now, after four month of use, both outside elements are dead (I presume they’re on the same circuit). I made sure the bagel setting isn’t on (which would run both inside coils anyway). For $23 the toaster worked reasonably well, but I would have hoped for at least a year of service. This one was the latest in a string of toasters which either don’t work properly, are way overpriced (and fail anyway) or are too short lived. Doesn’t seem like toasters are made to last anymore."
"When my 20 year old toaster was only warming English muffins and toasting them slightly on one edge  on the darkest setting, I decided to buy a new one. I chose the Black and Decker 2 Slice because 90% of the customer ratings were 4-5 stars. When I use the new one, I smile because it isn't much better than the old one. I have to turn it past the medium setting to get the muffins to toast, and only part of an edge shows any browning. I watch closely as I saw reviews that said it burns bread. It might toast better if I use the bagel setting, and I am experimenting with it. When the toasting is supposedly done and the handle pops up, you have to use a fork to get the bread out of the toaster, and that annoys me. One feature I like is the Cancel button, so you can stop the warming any time you wish. I will continue to experiment to see if I can get English muffins toasted the way I want them."
"To be fair, the product description for this toaster clearly said the body is plastic. Impulsively, I assumed that anything Black & Decker manufactures would be high quality and I'd be happy. I am not. The plastic looks cheap to me. On the other hand, so far the toaster works well and have decided not to return it. I will get something nicer looking in another year or two."
"I just bought this toaster to replace an older Black and Decker. My last toaster lasted me well over 15 years. I was surprised that the entire encasement on this new model is cheap plastic, which may or may not have PBA's in it. It's easy to use but other than the plastic encasement, there is a minor design flaw. The cord is super short and instead of coming out the back (bottom) of the toaster, it comes out the front (bottom). so your toaster will need to sit on a weird angle when toasting depending on your electric set up. I used it this morning and it worked well (maybe my other toaster was dying longer than I'd like to admit) but for what I paid for it, I expected a better aesthetic design. This is more like a $10 toaster you can get at the dollar store and doesn't reflect a multi million dollar brand. Does it work? Yes, absolutely. Does it cost too much? Yes, absolutely."
"We bought this toaster back at the end of 2017, and honestly it's been a good little toaster for the last 4 and a half years (even if the dark-toasted side of the dial obscenely overtoasts to the point of asking why is it even an option??), but recently we ran into a problem -The other day I made a poptart, ate it, and went about my business. When I went into the kitchen hours later (4 or 5 hours, honestly) I heard a popping noise (the sort that hot electronics make sometimes), looked over and saw that the heating element on the toaster was still on, even though the pop up element had engaged when I had toasted the poptart hours earlier. I waved my hand over the top and it was *HOT*. I had to re-engage the popping handle in order to shut it off, and then I unplugged it and thanked the universe that our house hadn't burned down - who knows what would have happened if I hadn't caught it right before I went to bed.I had hoped it was a one-off, as it happened a few days ago, but it happened again this morning while making toast and because I wasn't right next to it when it popped the toast was burnt to a crisp. Twice in one week is not a one-off. I searched the internet for a way that I might repair the toaster, but all I can find are ways to fix heating elements that *don't work*, not how to fix ones that literally won't shut off and so create a fire hazard. I attempted to contact the seller/company through Amazon, but because of the return window being closed that is no longer an option.I searched the questions and reviews and did not see this mentioned, so I thought I would put it here (for posterity) just in case someone else has had this issue, hopefully BLACK + DECKER takes these kinds of things seriously. In my research I did come upon a recall of a different toaster brand for this same exact issue, but not for this toaster, so for anyone wondering - it can and has happened with this toaster."
I’m a fan of this brand but the wire construction inside seems to snag my toast more oftwn than not. It does brown well however. It is too late to return so am shopping for a replacement. Difficult to remove those snagged bread pieces but if you don’t you will get a burning smell with your next round of toast due to these left-behinds.
I've been using this toaster for about 4 months. All great until recently. The pop up feature is no longer working very well. I'm having trouble getting the toast out of the toaster. That's a little discouraging as I tried several awful brands before getting this one and had hoped I'd found one that would last a few years without problems.
"The toaster toasts :) Changing the settings works. It's not easy to clean - I haven't seen one that is! The cord is WAY too short! I can barely clear under my cabinets so the heat isn't trapped. Maybe they were trying to make it fit to wrap under the toaster, but that never fits. That's where this falls short."
"I wouldn’t buy again.  I toast bagels or English muffins everyday and this doesn’t have an even toast.  One side is always more toasted than the other.  Difficult to get everything bagels toasted properly, even with bagel setting it would either burn the outside seeds or not toast all the way through.  You can get it almost all toasted which isn’t what I’m looking for."
"I toasted nothing a few times to help rid the chemical smell by hopefully burning it off. The smell will surely ruin the taste of any thing toasted in there. I can't speak to anything else, will update after sometime."
"The toaster looks nice and pops up well. However, the plug for the cord fits weird into wall sockets. I have to push and wiggle to get the prongs in. It's like they're oversized. I've also had it for about a month and though it doesn't get used regularly, there's always a burning plastic smell when I'm using it. The food tastes fine, but I'll probably get a different toaster in a month or so."
I just received my toaster yesterday and could not put it where my old toaster was unless I used an extension cord.  Needless to say this was very dissapointing since I have limited counter space.  It doesn't seem to be as well made as my last B&D toaster.
"So it's easy to use and clean.  Toast comes out too dark along the top edge, hardly toasted along the bottom edge.  Both sides of both slices are the same.  Tried cleaning out the crumb tray, but there was almost nothing in it, anyway.  Wish I could return it.  I'll try another brand."
Seriously this is the shortest cord on any appliance I've ever seen. It makes it awkward to even try to use this toaster but I'll push through and keep it with the cord is ridiculous I wouldn't recommend it.
I researched and bought this because it was listed as the top rated toaster. Not so much. The part that is toasted is fine but there is a quarter inch rim around the whole piece that is not toasted.
"At first I loved this toaster as it is efficient and easy to use. However, recently it has toasted light on one side and dark on the other. It seems like this happens with a lot of toasters..."
"As many people have said, the design has some flaws and the power cable is super short. Also. this toaster is not a really reliable product. Mine suddenly stopped working after a year and I didn't use it a lot. I'm single and live alone, and probably used it twice a week."
"I downsized my four slice toaster to a more basic 2 slice toaster, choosing the Black and Decker model as its name typically stands for quality and durability. Bought this for its low price and its basic functions-larger slots and a bagel toasting button. The good news is the toaster does a fine job of turning bread into toast. It toasts evenly and quickly and releases the bread for easy removal.However, the bagel button is basically useless. Here are the two directions for it in the same instructions. Even the manufacturer isn't sure how it works. It reads:Note: During the BAGEL function both sides will toast to the shade selected.NOTE: The Bagel function warms the outside of the bagel while toasting the cut side.Now, for a bagel you want the inside to be toasted while the outside is just warmed. That's not what the toaster does despite one of its claims saying it does that.  So if you just want a piece of toast, this is fine. Anything more than that, keep looking."
The only thing that was good about this was it was it looked good and was cheap. Hated the chord in the front making it even shorter. The crumb tray in the back. Can’t just leave the toaster in one spot. Had to turn it around after every use to remove the crumb tray. It did actually toast evenly and used less wattage than my replacement but I had to cut my sourdough bread in half. Also does not pop the toast up very far. It was one of those cases like some car models: make the product look sleek and appeal to women.
"Not a bad little toaster. Works well. A bit hard to clean, and the cord is too short. But while it worked it toasted well."
Toaster only toasts top half of one side leaving the bottom halfunder toasted while other side is even lighter toasted than the opposite side. The bagel setting still toasts the outside crust. The settings are sensitive and uneven while burning the bread with just a small incremental changes.
"3/23/24Pros: wide slots hold bagels very nicely; controls easy to see; seems to toast quicker than my old one; toasted bagel cut side but not back which I prefer.Cons: Did not toast bagel evenly so may require some popping up, repositioning and toasting more.Will update when I do toast and English muffins. For a cheap basic brand name toaster I’ll say it’s a good deal."
"Power cord comes out of the bottom of the toaster but way towards the front of the toaster, and it’s incredibly short. Make sure an outlet is directly behind where you plan to keep/use this toaster. Had to return immediately without use because it’s impossible to use in my kitchen."
Needed to replace. Good for the price but the cord is very short.
Don’t seem to toast evenly but didn’t pay that much.
Not super high quality but it does the job.
This toaster is kind of slow but the biggest problem is that the slots are so deep you can't get regular slices of bread out without using a tong or fork. For this reason I do not recommend.
Difficult to toast bagels
"Like other reviews mentioned, the cord on this toaster is incredibly short. We bought it for our RV and the cord cannot reach the outlet on the bottom of our cabinets above the countertop.The real problem with the unit we received however, was immediately upon turning it on, the unit started emitting noxious fumes that smelled like poly-vinyl chloride mixed with burning plastic. I immediately unplugged it and when I picked it up, the exterior plastic was too hot to hold for more than 1-2 seconds. I have serious concerns about whether this unit would have caught fire if left to run a full toast cycle. I cannot see visible melting or burn damage however, so I wonder if there is some chemical coating or residue on the heater elements that started burning off. The noxious fumes were so strong that it gave me an instant headache that lasted for several hours and also took more than an hour to fully evacuate from the house after opening all the doors and windows. The morning after we can still smell the chemical smell in the kitchen. The unit has a sticker than says it meets UL requirements, but doesn't say it was actually UL tested or approved. Saving $20 (was 48% off) isn't worth burning my house down or tolerating any possible health concerns from smoke toxicity. Even at $22 this is not a bargain in my opinion.Also, did anyone mention this thing is huge? Our 4 slot, wide-slice Cuisinart is almost smaller than this thing."
This is a very stylish toaster. In my opinion it is much larger than it needs to be because of the stylish body.  My other complaint is that the slice slots are too deep. I always have to use a knife to get the toast out.  I would not recommend this toaster.
Has side grooves net to the toast openings that crumbs get stuck in
"I found this Black & Decker toaster just okay.  It was not remarkably good or remarkably poor.  I make frozen waffles with this toaster every day.  It cooks quickly , and the toast quality is decent, if you use 1 piece of toast per slot, both pieces are equal width, and you choose a good setting for the cook level, which is controlled by a dial that varies from 1-6.  The latter is more difficult than it sounds since the optimal cook level varies for each item.  For example, I use a setting of 4 for Eggo Thick & Fluffy Original.  This setting of 4 will burn Eggo Thick & Fluffy Cinnamon & Brown Sugar, and it will heavily burn and curve Eggo Original (not thick and fluffy).  This relates to why both pieces of toast need to be the same width, which can make manually cutting a bagel in two awkward.  The bottom of the toast may also get overly cooked if it is not removed quickly.The first few times I used it, there was a burning electrical smell, and I needed to press the frozen button several times before one would take.  I've seen these issues mentioned in a couple of the other reviews. However, for me, after a few days both of these issues never occurred again.  My other complaint is with the power cord.  The cord is the correct length, but it exits from the front bottom, rather than the back bottom.  So if you plug in in the back (like nearly everyone does), then the cord can't stretch far from the back of the unit . This is mostly an issue if you place it on a counter with deep cabinets above and want to have the toaster out away from the wall, so there are not cabinets above."
"As they say, you get what you pay for.  Not a bad product, but over time (i.e. past return window), it is beginning to toast inconsistently.  Some edges burnt while main piece of toast stays light."
Had to return due to a ridiculously short power cord. Don't but this if you have undercabinet power strips.
The plugin cord is way too short and on the wrong side.
It was nice while it lasted but now only half of the burners work and the slots don't stay depressed on their own. RIP Mar 2024-Nov 2024
Way overpriced for a crappy product. Bottom 1/3 of the bread never toasts. If this toaster was $9 I wouldn't complain. Cannot recommend wasting your money on this.
"I knew that the slots that the bread goes in, were extra wide, but this is crazy . I dropped an english muffin in there, and watched as it disappeared down into the abyss . it was so far down, that I had to unplug the toaster, and use a knife to retrieve it . and this machine is massive . I have no where to store it, as it won't fit anywhere, and leaving it on the counter, leaves little room for anything else . also, I have to watch the toast or it will burn, as the timer doesn't seem very reliable . I bought this because of the Black and Decker name . yea, well, it is black, but not as good as any power tool that I have bought from this brand . oh well, I guess that i'll get used to it."
"I was not looking to have the Cadillac of toasters when I ordered this.  Don't get me wrong, It looks good and toasts great, but the plug for this toaster is super short, if I could've returned this, I would have done it immediately.  No room to move it or the plug will come out of the wall."
It lasted 2 months.  Customer service was too complicated.
"Can't plug this in, unless I put the handle in the back next to the wall instead of in front, and shove it right next to the outlet to heat the cable.The power cord is *very* short, and comes out of the wrong end (handle side).Normally, we place the handle away from the outlet, but with this toaster it means the cord now has to go under the toaster and about 30% of the length is waster there.I'll return this and buy a different brand."
This is a piece of crap. If you want to leave it in until both sides are toasted one side is burnt.turn if over and upside down about half way. They had the perfect toaster last year now this is not worth having
Cord is comically short and comes from the front. So toaster has to sit turned weird to plug in.Toaster is almost double the size as the older model I replaced.Doesn't evenly toastI'm sure you could find a better cheap toaster
"The cord is much too short.  Features are good, however.  Need better instructions."
This toaster has been good for larger portions. It has been toasting unevenly. Dark on bottom and lighter on top.  The temperature adjustment is sensitive. Still playing with getting the right settings.  Don’t know if it’s just this item or if is common to all.
Just a little perturbed since it took forever to get the toaster shipped out; someone dropped the ball.  At least Temu gives me $5 credit when I don't receive my order on time.  Amazon should do the same.
"The slots are too short, makes normal size bread curl and burn in spots"
"Toast fine but not your typical toaster sizeIt clutters my counters, I prefer neat and clear"
"The toaster works well, but the cord is extremely short!  It makes it difficult to use out away from the  wall socket.  This would definitely prevent me from ever buying one again."
im not happy with that💀
"Liked it while it was working, which sadly was only 1 year. Would not recommended."
"Very cheaply made, I don't feel this toaster is made to last. The buttons are cheap. The toasting level isn't consistent."
Product description shows a bagel setting but instead there is a reheating setting?
It does not toast bread slices or bagels well. Not sure it heats up enough
The toaster works ok but the lever to put the toast down is awful! Feels very cheap and weak and has a scratchy kind of feel. Wish I returned it. In the past I have kept my toasters for many years until they finally die. With this toaster I am counting down the time I have to keep it to have made it worth my money since I didn’t return it in time. Would never recommend this to anyone.
"Purchased this item based on general comments.  The description said that it did bagels.  It does but only because it has wide slots  It has no separate function that shuts off two of grids.  So, it burns the crust side of the bagel while under toasting the bread side.  This is the same as the toasters of 50 years ago.It does a credible job on bread toast.  If that (or pop tarts) are what you're looking for, this would be an adequate toaster."
Toasts well:  however is somewhat lightweight and also smudges easily with fingerprints
"My other toaster died and I needed a new one. I have a fractured tibia so isn’t really convenient to go out shopping. So my shopping is on Amazon. I bought this to bagels are great. But the bread doesn’t taste one side is pretty much off-white and the other side. The top half of the other side of the bread is brown the perfect color, while Bottom on that side is much lighter than the top half of that side. I would return it, but since I can’t drive that isn’t convenient either.  So I just toast the bread several times to make a good slice of toast."
Poor quality. Replaced same brand which lasted at least 15 years but it was a much better product.
"This toaster was ordered to replace a Cuisinart four slicer toaster which was getting really old and not functioning. I use a lot of Hamilton Beach products and I felt this model would be just right. It just doesn’t perform as well as I expected. It is not a bad product, but it just doesn’t live up to the Hamilton Beach quality level. I’m sorry. It was not  very expensive, but I would recommend spending a little more money for a better quality product."
Very basic small toaster. Settings are good. For regular sliced bread — nothing 'exotic'. Not a warmer. Just OK even with the price cut.
I bought this specifically for bagels. My old toaster was going so I thought I'd replace it before it quit. I was really jazzed about this. It seemed to be exactly what I needed. It's a name brand so I was sure it would work well. It did not work well and burned every single bagel I put in it even on the lowest setting. It's as if the bagel function was not working at all. I used my old toaster for hamburger buns on the bagel setting and it would toast one side and come out really nice. This one burned both sides on the low setting. The toast I made was fine but not one bagel or hamburger bun was not burned. I had to send it back because it was not functional for what I needed.
"I ordered the toaster after looking locally and not finding a basic silver toaster. The Hamilton On Amazon had 4 1/2 stars, so I ordered it.There was the initial smell of chemicals when toasting, so I ran some toast through and threw the toast away.Shortly after getting it going, I noticed that one side barely toasted the bread slice. I decided not to return it, because ...where's the box? Did the recycling get it already? and because I didn't want to be without toast while waiting for delivery again.Now a month and a half later, it barely browns my toast. It is turned all the way to dark.Maybe, I have the LEMON or this Hamilton toaster just doesn't work!"
I'm liking this toaster a lot. I do recommend it.
"The bottom line of this toaster is that does not toaster evenly and often pops early even though the setting is consistent. Also the bagel feature for which I made a point for my purchase to have, does not work at all."
The toaster doesn't brown evenly on both sides. One side will be very dark and the other barley toasted.
"Looks nice if you ignore the dent, toasted bread to a nice golden brown on a little over the 2 setting. Seems to cook a little more in the inside edge than the outside. Why put the cord on the side?Other than the dent it seems to be a ok purchase, will update later if anything changes"
While it hasn't set my house on fire yet it smokes every time but you get what you pay for
"Honestly, if my husband hadn't already recycled the box, I probably would have sent this back. It seems to work OK, and it is very stylish. My annoyance is that because the lightness/darkness setting (like ALL settings on this particular toaster) are electronic, they reset to the default every time you use it. This toaster has 7 levels, and fortunately, they put the default brownness setting in the middle, at 4. So you never have to go TOO far in either direction. But I happen to like the ""6"" setting, so every time I put in a piece of toast, I have to adjust the setting up from 4 to 6. (Again, I'm really glad it doesn't start at 1!)My point is, were this a regular old toaster with old-fashioned knobs, I could find my favorite setting, turn the knob there, and leave it there. The digital controls actually make this LESS convenient to use, and that's a shame."
It was all good while it was working. But stopped working a week ago. Usually Toaster of this brand has lasted 5 years on my house.
There’s one section right in the middle that burns the toast at the edge if I leave it in the whole time. I have to stop halfway thru to flip the toast.
light weight an toasts bread well  Not so for bagles
"When it worked, it was great, but expected it to last a lot longer. One heating element just stopped working."
Slots on toasted bit wide enough for rye bread
"For 1 1/2 years it worked fine. Then suddenly it started making clicking noises and the temperature setting display went on and off. It didn’t toast as well either. Rather than risking it, we tossed it and replaced with a basic toaster."
So far it seems to be a good product. I did have to buy an extension cord because the cord on the toaster was very short in my opinion.
On the darkest setting you have to do it at least once more
"The old saying, "" You get what you paid for,"" is true with this toaster. I always research a product before I purchase them and this time with the toaster was no different.First, my wife and I like our toast to be lightly toasted. However, with this toaster, we have had to set it to a high number to obtain our desired toast. Furthermore, each time, we have toast with different doneness. Using the same setting on different bread gets different doneness. I have attempt to return this product but it not worth the hassle.My previous toaster was a Black and Decker which lasted many years. I should have stayed with the same brand.So, if you like playing a guessing game with your toast, then, by all means, purchase this toaster. But if you want your toast to be the same doneness each time, spend a little extra money and purchase a better toaster.Bon Appetite!"
"My old toaster was looking run down, so I ordered a similar looking one from the same brand on Amazon.  The package was delivered without any damage. The first thing I did was to compare the dimensions to the old toaster (from Hamilton Beach), that is also mostly steel exterior. It is surprising that the slots in the new one are shorter and narrower significantly. Then I compared the crumb collecting bottom tray size and that is shorter and narrower than the one on my old toaster. It covers only half of the width of the slots, it may result in stuck and burnt pieces. My old one toasts bagels fine and this new one I got looks too small for anything other than standard bread slices. Other reviews mentioned how this model toasts unevenly.Before you throw out your old toaster, please compare the dimensions of the slots and the bottom tray. If a brand name like Hamilton Beach cannot be relied upon, it is discouraging to consumers. You will not be able to toast bagels with this one and you will be left with a toaster with stuck crumbs due to the narrow slots.Hamilton Beach, what have you done, penny wise and pound foolish apparently. Zero stars for this toaster. Needless to say I will be returning it.I did find another toaster from the same brand with plastic sides, but with longer and wider slots with a proper bottom collecting tray for $39 on Amazon."
They claim it handles thicker bread but it really doesn't.
Bought this to replace a Cuisinart model that couldn't toast evenly. Guess what? This is the same toaster with different exterior. Both have the same problem: uneven cooking. One side is always darker that the other. How had can it be to make a toaster that works properly? This isn't exactly new technology!Will be returning and trying a more expensive model. Maybe.....
"Bought this toaster thinking it was like others, I was very diapointed is  only bagel toaster and quit flimsy"
"I needed a toaster for use at work with bagel mode function.The first toaster I received dd not have the bagel button, despite the item description and the actual item box showing the button and mentioning the mode. It had a different button, I guess the wrong model was packaged at the factory.The replacement toaster I received did have the bagel button, but it does not function the way a bagel mode should work. It does NOT disable two of the heating elements, so you can toast only the inside of a bagel.If you need bagel mode, look elsewhere."
"I had such hope for this toaster. It's a good-looking toaster with lots of features. I would give it a better rating if only it would TOAST! Seeing that it is made in the USA, I was hoping that it would last longer than the cheap toaster I bought at Walmart a few years ago. That toaster, at the end of its life, worked better than this one new. It just doesn't toast. At its highest setting, it slightly browns some areas, does nothing to others and burns at the very bottom. Can't we make a freaking toaster in the US anymore? My mother bought a Kenmore toaster back in the sixties, and we donated it when we cleared out her place in 2012. Sixty years old, and it still worked. I'll bet you could find toasters from the 1930s that still work. Shame on Hamilton Beach for making this doorstop. I wonder if they do any type of quality control. It's just unbelievably sad."
"This toaster replaced a very expensive one which hasn't worked correctly in 2 years.  I needed one fast and this was available to ship quickly and was a name brand because I will NEVER trust anything electrical that is not sold by a name brand.It's okay, does not do bagels or english muffins well on the one side.  The toasting coils are few and far between, especially towards the middle.  It can burn the edges before the middle is toasted but again, it was inexpensive and served my purpose for hosting guests.  I wouldn't buy it again because Hamilton Beach cut too many corners to save money on it so I would expect any other of their toasters would be the same.  Honestly, do they think people won't notice the shoddy workmanship?"
"This is a cheap imitation of a good toaster.  Has very few settings.  Only four choices -- I too low, 4 can burn the bread.  2 works for me, but it's somewhat difficult to push the handle down.  It tends to pop up, so an extra try is needed.  This will do for now, but I would not buy this product again."
Does not cook bottom of taste as even as top.Top will be brown the bottom will be white.
"I was excited to receive the toaster and immediately toasted two pieces of bread. The side of the toaster was hot, and the top near the opening was too hot to touch. You would have to be careful when touching it or getting the bread out. This was unacceptable. I have returned it to Amazon and bought from Amazon one that was highly rated and plastic."
"I had really high hopes for this toaster and was excited to see it at a lower price for black Friday. Unfortunately, the toaster and the manufactures box arrived significantly damaged. Because the shipping box was not damaged it was clear that the toaster was sent knowingly damaged. I originally figured I would just return the toaster for a new one but the price went up $10."
"We bought this toaster to replace the same Hamilton Beach that we bought 3.5 years ago, because it stopped toasting evenly. We literally used it three times and it quit. I'm pulling the old Hamilton Beach out of the garage and I'll just manually rotate it halfway through the toasting process until I come up with a better and more sure purchase."
"I bought this toaster because I previously had a Hamilton Beach toaster and it worked great. Unfortunately, this one doesn’t work that well. It toasts unevenly. The top half of the English muffin or bread gets toasted but the bottom half not so much. I have to turn it upside down and toast again.  I should’ve sent it back right away! First world problems….."
"This toaster - advertised as coming with a bagel setting - DID NOT.Also, the adjustable dial for toasting does not work well. Setting it on a 4 will barely toast my bagel one day and the next day (same bagel size/type) will burn it. Save your money."
I'm extremely disappointed! I bought this toaster thinking I was getting a good dependable brand. 2-1/2 months later this toaster completely fell apart. The slots are really small. No way a bagel will fit. It burnt on every level.
The first couple uses it smells like melting plastic. It also seems to be stuck on bagel mode because no matter what I do it only toast one side of the bread. This thing is useless!
I’ve been using this toaster for months now. Not sure if mine is faulty or what but it is extremely inconsistent. Toasting on a level 5 out of 6 will either burn what I'm toasting or barely lick it with heat. Ive been using toasters all my life and have never been frustrated by a toaster. Until I met this one. Don’t bother!!!!! Look elsewhere.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            There is absolutely no plastic anywhere near this or on the inside but I plugged it in the first time to use without any bread to try it out- something told me to do this. It smells like burning plastic and was EXTREMELY hot even on the lowest setting. Of course others are right in the buttons all are plastic cheap and like it will not last anyways- unfortunately will be returning this and have to buy a higher quality one.
As you can see the middle button is labeled reheat and should be Bagel.On this Toaster the center button will toast a Bagel to perfection even though it is labeled Reheat??Very confusing!!!!
"1. At 5'10"" I'm too tall to see the light without stooping. It needs to be at the top.2. Cannot set temperature first before lowering the arm.3. If toasting a shorter item I have to hold the arm up and use tongs to extract it."
Received this on the 4th and was going to use it on the 7th at breakfast and it does not work!  It did work for the 2 days prior to the 7th!
"I wish I'd bought a better one. This is fine, but it isn't great. Here are my 2 main gripes: 1) when you push the toast down, the slots are not deep enough... resulting in the top part of the bread or waffle to be toasted. 2) There are bars that hold the toast in place. But, those bars prevent that part of the toast from browning.But, it still browns my bread and waffles... just not fully. The buttons and temp settings are fine. I haven't burnt anything yet. I still give it 3 stars because it does what it was designed to do. I just think it could do it better. It's like a ""C"" student. Still passing, but room for improvement."
"It’s a nice toaster. Does an adequate job, but the pop-up spring is very weak. It makes it difficult to remove your bread , bagel, etc"
Doesn't toast evenly
This product is cheaply made I reccomend avoiding it and buying something of higher quality. The lever that you push down to toast bread broke within a month of use…
When we got this toaster it was fine. After 3 months though we have had to change the setting from 3 to now 6 to get a decent lightly browned toast. The Bagel function stopped working completely. Also it shows every fingerprint….And of course we are past the Amazon return window. Now I am dealing with the mfg warranty…Spend a little more money & get something better….
"Toaster worked great for 1 month and all of a sudden, decided to stop working. The l push down bouton would not stay down, and trued everything. It stopped working one week past the return date. Would not recommend this toaster."
"This is my first unhappy review.  This is a very nice toaster but the slots are not big enough for most bagels, especially if you buy from a bagel shop. I replaced my old toaster with another toaster that is too small for bagels. My mistake."
"I noticed when it arrived it seemed to be very cheaply made but I kept it. It worked for 12 weeks then the 2 center elements stopped toasting.  I looked for a return on Amazon but was sent to manufacturer. Also, no return option offered from the manufacturer only troubleshooting suggestions, none of which worked.  I am stuck with it.  Will have to trash it."
If you don’t remember to turn down the set number every time you insert a piece of bread it comes out too dark.  It is automatically set on 4.  Which it too dark …. I must always remember to turn it to 3 or it will burn my toast
"I don't know how a manufacturer could mess up a toaster, but these folks sure did.I'd ordered a similar toaster from Amazon a few years earlier, worked great.  Ordered this one - total failure.Temperature control was wildly inconsistent: either barely toasted the bread or burned it black.""Bagel"" setting should toast only on one side.  More often than not toasted both sides, usually burned.I didn't have the heart to dump this on someone via Goodwill, so after one month I threw it away.Poorly made piece of trash.  No more Hamilton Beach appliances for this kid!"
I have to turn the bread and let it brown on the other side. I should have sent it back
"Looks great! However, it stopped working in a week. The toast couldn’t be pushed down (it was like the toaster was unplugged) but it wasn’t…"
"This toaster came with beautiful broken parts. They were so shiny and adorable how they rattled inside the toaster before they fell out. I especially loved the dents. The manufacturer box was all nicely banged up and taped and placed into a perfect Amazon box that didn’t have a scratch on it. Hmm? Isn’t that odd? Almost like someone purposely bleep me a perfect toaster. I couldn’t have been happier. I sang songs and danced as I went all the way to the up’s store. The toaster heated up real nicely. Sarcasm except for the perfect amazon box. Let’s see, can I post my review this time?"
This review is for the Hamilton Beach 2 Slice Toaster w/ Defrost Function. I thought the first unit I got was simply defective and unable to evenly toast both sides of frozen bread (see 1st 2 pics). So I returned it for a replacement ... that misfunctioned exactly the same way (see pics 3 & 4). Finally I tried to toast thawed bread without using the defrost function (see pics 5 & 6). Guess what - same uneven result. Maybe the Amazon warehouse where these two toaster came from simply had a bad lot but I cannot recommend this toaster. Returned for refund.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The most basic use case for a toaster is to toast but when half of the elements don't turn on it doesn't work. (right out of the box).Also if you have little kids be warned the entire top and sides get super hot enough to burn.
"FAILS THE BASICS!!!Too small for wide pan bread. Misleading advertising!!!  I HAVE TO TRIM BY HAND the slices of a Kroger loaf of wide pan wheat bread. Also, you cannot adjust the temperature/toast time UNTIL you have inserted the bread. Waste of money. It is NOT functional. I only toasted muffins for a few weeks. Now that I've purchased bread, it is too late to return this product, so I am screwed!!!"
"June 24, 2014Purchased this Stainless Steel Toaster a few months ago,it's used about 2/3 times a week for toast.A few days ago -- noticed that smoke was coming out of toaster while in use..not a lot but noticeable! Immediately unplugged (scary), put the toaster on a glass surface, it was red HOT!! There is def. something wrong here--it's only a few months old..Also, the slots are not that wide.. Good for toasting bread...bagels have to be sliced thin to put in there.I would not recommend this product, especially if you have kids that may use it! Scary."
The  toasting is very uneven. It will toast only on one side. Very disappointed.
This is so cheaply made it's laughable. Regular bread or an English muffin is fine but forget anything larger as it does NOT fit.  The toast it makes is ok if you run it through twice at the darkest setting on the flimsy dial. The worst product that I have ever purchased and I thought Hamilton Beach had a good rep. Why they sell this I will never know. Buyer beware as it has a lot of good reviews so it's up to you.
I’ve used my toaster under 10 times and it broke- no longer working
"This product looks nice, but it gave my husband a strong electrical shock when using it. We had to toss it."
Would not buy again
"came with small dent, I guess I can live with it"
"We have been very unhappy with this toaster. The movement of push-down lever is very rough, like two pieces of metal rubbing together. So much pressure has to be applied that the opposite side of the toaster starts to lift up unless you hold it down. Sometimes the lever has trouble latching, too."
"If I would have written a review right when I received the toaster, I would have given it a 5 star rating. However, after about one month of infrequent and very gentle use, when you push the handle down to toast, the insides of the toaster won't go down, making it unusable. It is past the return date so I guess I'm just put in the position of adding it to the landfill and buying another toaster. Not happy."
"Should've returned this right away, but anything toasted will be 1/3 black,  1/3 toasted and 1/3 untoasted"
Does not toast well at all. Cannot recommend.
Does the job but is not a high quality product. Doesn't seem well made.
I bought this toaster because it was a Hamilton Beach toaster and a brand name. After a couple of months it started to develop rust dots on the outside of the toaster. I do not live in an area of moisture like the beach. Very disappointed in this product and will look for another brand.
I wanted this for the bagel feature
"Even when the setting isn't changed, the toast comes out differently; some perfect, the next can be burned using same kind of bread"
"We bought the toaster October of 2023 and were very happy with it until recently when we started to notice a burning smell whenever we use it.  We have been very good about sliding out the tray and cleaning crumbs every single time we use it, but found that crumbs and gunk still collect at the base of the inside of the toaster and it is impossible to reach in there to clean it.  So it looks like we are going to have to buy another one with a better design for cleaning.  oh well..."
"I bought this toaster because I am familiar with the brand, I thought it would be a safe bet.  But the metal sides get SO HOT when toasting I could feel the heat 2 feet away.  I feared for things placed next to it on counter. I lightly touched the side and got burned. You could fry an egg on the side during toasting. I returned it immediately."
"This toaster felt lightweight and cheaply made. I had expected better quality for the price. More serious, the metal exterior gets quite hot when the toaster is in use, making it a poor choice for families with small children or disabled people. The stainless steel look is stylish but I don't want to start the day by burning my fingers. I ended up buying a bright red two-slice Oster. The metal sides curve outward, away from the heating element so it gets slightly warm, not hot. A heavier, more substantial appliance with a good user manual. It was also slightly cheaper."
temp settings  are very undependable. One time on same setting it may burn your toast or nor hardly brown it at all
I toast maybe once a week. Sits on my counter otherwise.Suddenly stopped working. Last less than a year. Buy something nicer. Toasted fine when it worked.
I just used this toaster for the first time today. I'm not trying to be nit-picky but shouldn't the lever  be higher when there's nothing in it? It is on the box. Mine is nearly halfway down. It makes me wonder if this was used and returned for some reason.
Toaster did not evenly brown on both sides.
The bagel feature on this toaster does not do anything at all. The button lights up but the slices keep toasting on both sides. I'm not sure if this is a malfunction or if the button is there for decoration. Contacting customer service resulted in a very cryptic response by someone who obviously doesn't speak English very well. Will be returning.
"I bought this toaster specifically for toasting bagels and buns. When you press the button for that function, only the inner light should stay on. With this one, both sides continue to heat the bread. Also, the bread, of any kind, does not come up enough when finished to take it out without using the lift function. What is frustrating is that we threw the original boxing away and can’t return it. If you buy this product, make sure to test all the settings before you throw away the box. Lesson learned."
Not a very good toaster… Doesn’t toast evenly does not eject and when you’re trying to get it to eject the slider sticks. Would not recommend this item.
"I bought this because it had a bagel setting. Bagel toasting calls for ONE  sided testing on the inside. GARBAGE!  Bagel setting toasts on both sides. Don't buy this product if you care about that. Amazon, please give me a zero review option."
"Nice toaster, I like that it's digital.  The problem I have is that it has no memory on the setting you have it on.  The analog ones stay where you left it.  This one after it's off for a few minutes, it resets back to 4 every time, pretty annoying actually because I always want it on a different setting.  Probably going to get rid of this one because of that annoyance."
"After less than two weeks and maybe 5 uses, it just quit working.  It’s very unfortunate because we can’t return since we no longer have the box.  It is a complete waste of money."
"Nice counter top appeal, ez to use, but.... I expect uniform toast.  This delivers as expected on only one side of the bread.  The other side is nearly burnt in the middle.  This toaster fails to deliver on its #1 requirement - perfect toast."
I don’t expect much from a toaster but somehow this one finds new ways to let me down. It can barely fit a standard slice of bread. It seems to toast differently every time. Anything under setting 5 out of 7 is hardly toasted.
Very uneven toasting. I’m going to buy something else
"Unfortunately, the reviews about it not toasting is true. It will burn the brad but not toast it at all. It’s so random and so weird. I love the way it looks and the ease of the toast but I wish it was consistent."
"Was very unhappy with a Cuisinart toaster that was purchased several years ago.  It toasted unevenly and was generally a poor product.  I was looking for something that just did a better job.  This toaster is somewhat better, and somewhat less expensive.  Still not outstanding."
The above picture of toast was on the 2nd setting. The 1st setting barely toasted. I tried the bagel setting and it did nothing. I have another Hamilton Beach and it is very slow to toast but at least it doesn’t incinerate the bread. We are buying another one for our RV. This is the third one we have bought and returned.
Burns toast on 1 side.
It's quickly apparent this is not a well-manufactured device - It just feels 'tinny'. The slots are a bit short for wider bakery bread but are adequate for store-bought bread. Once the heat adjustment is conquered it makes decent toast. The sides remain cool during operation but the top metal part gets quite hot. I guess what it comes down to is that it does the job adequately and is reasonably priced.
It’s cool how light and small it is for being a 4 slice toaster but I don’t like how you can’t pop it up early without nearly breaking it. I feel like even on high I had to toast it twice then obviously it burns if you don’t pop it up before the second time is done. So I have to fight the damn thing and nearly break it so I’m nervous it’ll break after a few months:/
"It does a good job toasting but as my husband says, you can start your coffee, go to the bathroom, make your coffee and it's still not done.  Otherwise it does a good job if you have the time.  For us, retired even, it is not worth the wait.  We will get a new one."
"It does the job of toasting. However the quality of the entire toaster is very poor. It is so light that it jumps up from the counter when the cycle ends. Children find that entertaining. The sound at the end of the cycle can be heard in the bedroom. When simply sliding it along the counter 6”, it falls over. Shame on Black & Decker for using such substandard materials, which I assume were chosen to increase the profit. May they spend that profit well giving back to their employees! Don’t trust that Black & Decker means quality today as it once did."
"The whole unit is pretty lightweight, and not in a good way, feel like it will break or stop working if fell solid on the floor.The knobs to control the bread's different toast shades seems very poorly built. Feels extremely very fragile and again lightweight and not solid control knobs.The ""Crumb Tray"" is a very simple design, not reliable to ""lock in place"", but in a rather simple slide lock design you slide back and forth, but seems like the one I have keeps unlocking by itself 80 percent of the time, if you tilt or move the unit around.Toaster is usable but far from a quality build."
"Bought this toaster to replace one that  was 10 yrs old. It's not as heavy as my other B & D 4 slice wide toaster. Seems like they are making it as cheap as possible. And, why have the electric cord come out the front of the toaster instead of the back?? Makes no sense. Bottom line. It does toast the same as the old version and has all the same features. Just really disappointed , as with all newer electronics, they don't make them like they use to!."
"Looks nice but feels cheap and is lightweight.No matter what setting you use, the toast or bagel will not be evenly toasted.And the part of the product description where they say the swing out crumb tray keeps the countertop clean is a huge joke.Most trays slide out. This one requires you to unplug it, carry to the trash can, slide the tray back and let the tray flip open and dump the crumbs into the can. And the tray is only held in by two small tabs. If you slide the toaster around on the counter and the cord slips underneath the toaster it will unclip the crumb tray leaving you with a mess to clean up.The shell of the toaster is made of plastic instead of metal. This is probably why the bread is not evenly toasted. Metal reflects the heat back towards the bread while the plastic absorbs it and causes the outside of the toaster to get very hot.Do yourself a favor and spend a bit more money on a better toaster with a metal case. You will be much happier."
"Toasts evenly but, slowly."
"I’m not sure where all these glowing reviews come from, other than people giving a review after using the toaster a few times. I purchased this toaster in early October. It doesn’t evenly toast, leaving the top part barely toasted, even soft & still “bready”. Just another once well-made American product that has taken the route of manufacturing products outside the US to give themselves a break in costs & making products that are “disposable”. What happened when not so long ago, a basic toaster lasted a decade, an oven & microwave outlived their original owner? I’m giving it 2 stars because it still partially works, & appreciate the defrost feature, which does work. I’ve not used the bagel feature so cannot attest to that function."
"Heat control knobs are not marked making it difficult to set from toast to frozen. Left heating is weaker than right, again making it difficult to set."
"First off, the User Guide does not contain a diagram of the product identifying each function, neither does the photo on Amazon for that matter.  The crumb trays do NOT slide out.  You have to turn the toaster up side down and the crumb tray FLIPS down, getting crumbs all over the place if you're not careful.  Finally figured out how to stop the toasting process and manually eject the toast.  If you to press in the center of the temp dial.  Quite the guessing game."
"It toasts ok but it's plastic and where there is metal, it is very thin. It seems very cheap. Not sure why it's got so many high ratings. It replaced a solid Hamilton Beach toaster that lasted at least 15 years. The Hamilton Beach weighs probably twice as much as this thing.We'll see if it lasts."
Barely toasts the elements only seem to glow faintly. I bet it doesn't last a year. Very disappointed.
"I trust Blavk+Decker products, but this one disappoints. I use the toaster primarily for bagels and guess what? The bagel button does not work. It is supposed to turn off the heating elements on one side for the bagel so you can actually hold the bagel in your hand to apply toppings. This is very simple technology and they blew it. I had a Hamilton beach toaster for 18 years and the bagel button worked flawlessly. I picked this one because the width of the slots. Heating things like Kaiser Rolls is better with the wide slots, This is why it earned 2 stars instead of one.  I expect more from you Black+Decker."
The bagel button doesn’t shut off the burner on one side. It will toast both sides
"Value priced, toasts well, but very flimsy, and the non-contrasting, knob settings are very hard to read! Time will tell how long this featherweight toaster holds up."
Won't accommodate the size of my favorite rye bread.Won't accommodate the size of my favorite rye bread.
"I had to stop using this after a couple of months due to a rancid smell that comes from the toaster each use. It's not even a burning smell, but a strong chemical smell that stinks up my whole apartment. I tried cleaning it, running the toaster without toast a few times to burn anything off, etc. and nothing has worked. Disappointing since the toaster worked well otherwise."
"It toasts well and is consisten as it should be for a basic toaster.Biggest complaint are the control indicators, or lack thereof. You really have to take a good look to see what setting you’re at. Sometimes it looks like a shadow and you second guess.Speaking of guessing, the bagel and frozen buttons don’t indicate if they’re active or not. There’s a clicking sound, but did I turn it on or did I just cancel it? Tough to remember when you haven’t had your coffee yet.Oh, and did you spot the cancel button? Neither did I the first time around."
Toasts bread
The toaster toasts but the frozen and bagel setting have no indicator if it's working or not. I pressed the bagel setting after putting toast in there and both sides came out toasted normally. Are we supposed to press before or after putting in bread? The buttons just click but nothing else on the toaster physically changes to show that it's working...Besides that the normal toaster setting works fine. Sometimes the top of my bread doesn't get toasted as much as the bottom so it results in uneven toasting but it's not bad and works fine.
The cheap materials is a change that u don’t like. No sturdiness like the previous model I had for 9 years. But it does work properly.
"Toaster functions are nice. The only thing I find wrong with it is that it doesn't toast evenly. Unfortunately, this is the most important function of the toaster. Side to side aren't even as well as top to bottom of one side of whatever I'm toasting. Wish I would have gone with a different one."
Works ok. Does not toast evenly. Does not toast very strong either.
"The black exterior is made of thin plastic that heats up and gets almost soft while toasting.  Some of the heating elements get red hot some don’t. I have no idea if it will toast evenly because I returned it the moment the plastic got hot. Also, why does the cord come out the front?"
"We don't eat a lot of toast but needed a new one when the old one died.  I studied the reviews and this model seemed to have a very large number of positive reviews and was inexpensive.  We received the toaster in June and it has gotten some use.  Each time we used it the crumb tray would pop open spilling out the crumbs when we went to put it away.  At first we thought that we were hitting something accidently.  But when my son visited at the end of September and used it daily, he complained  bitterly.First of all, the crumbs went everywhere.  We finally decided to study the bottom and see what we were doing wrong.  After trying everything, the tray will not stay connected when you pick it up to put it away or bring it over to the trash to empty....by the time you get there, it is cleaned out.  But what really frosted my son was the poor toasting.  One side of the bread was nice and toasty brown; the other side barely tan.So I dug out the paperwork and found the 800 # to call.  I called and the woman at the other end told me that they ""don't handle things like this"" and to take it back where I bought it.  Now in the paperwork it specifically says NOT to take it back to the point of sale, but the call this number.  I then asked to speak to a supervisor and was put on hold for 67 minutes  (timed it) before my call was dropped.Now I am mad and have emailed.  When I have something that I need to sit and do, I will also call again when I can put the phone on speaker and while away the time.  Very disappointed.  Now I have to shop for another toaster.  Think I will look for one in a higher price range because this bargain wasn't one -- just a piece of junk.UPDATE  10/3/2018  --  Just got off the phone with a wonderful customer service representative from Black + Decker.  Michael was most apologetic (not expected since he wasn't the one responsible for my poor experience).  As I suspected  B+D subcontracts the customer service and this is not what they as company expect.  They are sending a replacement toaster and just asked that I cut the electrical cord on the current one before disposal.  I suspect that I got a ""lemon"" which can happen even in the best of companies.  Very pleased with Black + Decker's response.  We own a number of B+D products that we like very much, and this is the type of response that we would expect from a company that values its customers."
My other toaster quit on 1 side. Thought would give black and decker a try. Big mistake. Not worth the money. Too late to send back so will figure out what to do with it. Got another 4 slice toaster that has digital read out and time readout. Not that more expensive.
"02/02/2021 updatei have solved the problem of the buttons. although it is unclear in the instructions, what you have  to do if you want to do a bagel or defrost is to put the piece of bread/bagel in the toaster & before pressing the main  lever you hit the button you want.  i don't do bagels but it defrosts beautifully.  then to toast you just press the main lever down at the setting you've chosen. (you don't have to change this for defrost. i've upgraded it to four stars.  the crumb tray is still a problem and i give it 3 stars for this reason..xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx01/31/2021i got this toaster a couple of days ago. i liked it's retro look and i wasn't expecting a great deal given the price. immediately out of the package it became apparent that the drop down crumb tray had a defective latch and would drop down when one lifts the toaster or moves it or even just pushes down the toast lever. i thought it had a pull out try but that was my mistake. the toaster description made it clear that it was drop down.  i have found a way to deal with this and am now ""testing"" its performance on other matters.  i use it for 1 slice of toast daily. the defrost feature is good.  it seems to toast pretty well except there is a much darker stripe down one side of the slice. i will update this review in a few days."
"Works fine, but definitely not made to last like the toasters of old. Its lightweight, seems flimsy, but seems to get the job done"
"I bought this toaster because I liked the look and size, but it has been a disappointment and we will be getting another brand toaster soon to replace it. The heat settings are undependable, so everything comes out under- or over-toasted. Also, the slots do not fit something as common as a bagel. The crumb tray design comes loose every time the toaster is moved. Would not recommend."
"I've made toast and bagels in all 4 slots  I tried one bagel using the button and one not.  It is pretty slow, the elements heat up very slowly I noticed,  and by the time you get good color on your item (I like mine pretty dark), the bread/bagel is pretty dried out and really hard. Yes you butter it,  but you have to cover every little bit to keep it from cutting up your mouth. Pros: it is very nice looking and slot sizes are great for regular bread and bagels."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            When putting away this toster the cleaning lid falls open, thus possible lid damage.This is a nuisance and a very poor design.I DO NOT RECCOMEND!UPDATE: When I reach out to the seller they did reply very fast ( Great customer service ) and thy did offer to replace the toaster. It was shipped very fast, however I did have to pay shipping cost.The replacement toaster seems to work much better and the bottom cleaning lid does not just fall open."
"Bagel button does not light up nor can you tell if it is on or off. It just clicks when you press. It does not look or feel depressed after clicking. I even looked inside when i clicked it and both heating elements are red on both sides after clicking it, restarting and clicking again."
"I rarely leave reviews but I hate this toaster. First off the buttons don’t show their activated or on when you use them (bagel). And the design on top to be so low and close to the heat, makes it really hot. I accidentally touched the outside too and burned my finger so bad. I’m returning."
"It looks lovely and is the perfect size.  However, it toast unbelievably slow, and I have to keep turning up the darkness to get a good ""toast"", and I still have to keep putting to toast back down to get a good color."
I thought there would less plastic.
"One side toasts at a different level than the other, even if both dials are tuned to the same number. Easy to use, but not sure if the bagel setting works. Overall, it's a toaster and it gets the job done but is inconsistent with ""toastedness"" between the 2 sides and between uses on the same side and settings."
the toast will cook more than the top.  The dial for adjustment to have lighter or darker toast was more visable.  wish I returned this item after first of couple of uses.
"Seriously, I am not a picky person... Some discriminating connoisseur of everything. You know the type...those that feel they have to act as if nothing is up to their standards...they've always had better. When I bought this toaster, I was practically ready to give it 5 stars for actually being red. I'm easy to please.... Unfortunately though... I have used this a few times and it is starting to get my ire up. It has two buttons that you have to put your reading glasses on to see which is which. One is pressed if it is a bagel and the other says frozen. But what the hey!?! They both depress a 16th of an inch and come out immediately a 16th of an inch. There's no light, bell or anything really to indicate whether it is in or out, on or off. Either one. And the toast pops up level with the top of the toaster... And as for the lift up lever... You are going to need two hands.. Because you lift it up and let it go and goes right back down. Don't they all function that way? But this kind of showcases that feature as something special. Sorry, I am lazy and would hope that this one armed fugitive, would not have to use two hands. Why can't it just pop the toast up an inch above the top in the first place... Does it toast? Yeah, but don't they all do that? You don't buy a car because it can move forward."
The thing heat up but the slide won't stay down.
"I love the looks of this toaster but the metal top part of the toaster gets very hot,  I burnt my thumb.  I had the exact same toaster before this one and the top part was warm,  not hot.  I called the company to see if they changed something,  he said no that's just how it is.  Not happy,  so I will not purchase this one again."
I wish it had a light indicator showing which button you selected but otherwise it is great. Definitely turn it down low the first few months or it will burn your bagels and toast
"This is the third time I have purchased this for my 89 year old mother.  She really wants a red toaster and this is one of the more affordable ones.  She seems happy with this one.  The first one lasted only 2 years and the second one made it 3 years.  This is with only one person using it!!  Personally, I would not buy this for myself based on longevity.  Mom usually get what she wants."
"Works well, but there are no instructions on how to use the bagel and defrost buttons.  There are also no indications on the toaster as to whether the buttons are engaged or not."
"Love the way this looks in my kitchen, but as a functional appliance, I’ve had better. Temperature control is iffy and the ‘bagel’ and ‘frozen’ buttons aren’t very useful. Have always trusted Black & Decker for quality appliances. They missed the mark on this one."
"Although it certainly is a great value for the money, if you toast a lot of bagels, you might want to consider it very carefully.  It is a bit small for the local bagels, and the tops of them protrude slightly when the toaster is in the toasting position.  This results in white tops of the bagels and brown lower regions.  One must rotate the bagels to retoast the lower parts nicely.  Very easy to burn these areas of the bagel when you do this.  Very easy to burn your fingers, too!  The bagels are hot, but the real caution called for is the chrome bezel (if that's the right word) around the top of the holes.  It gets hot enough to burn you!  Also there is no indication if the bagel setting is working or not...I certainly can't tell when using it.I love the looks, the light weight and price of this item, but it is a pain to toast bagels with.I find it is just too small and toasts the bottom of anything while leaving the top still untoasted.  I have to stop and turn anything 180 degrees to get an even color.  The bagel setting does nothing at all as far as the wife and I can see.  Not a good quality item.  We're looking for another toaster."
"There is plenty to like about this toaster. I liked the red color, and I liked the bagel toasting function. And I liked the toast that it made. Ultimately, however, I can only give it three stars because it broke after two years and three months. The bread no longer stayed down because the cheap electromagnet that holds it down failed.So its plastic will get recycled and the electronics will go to an electronics recycling place and get shipped around the world to a country that is willing to take it, and the rest will go into landfill.And for what? So that Fortune 500 companies (in this case, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.) can keep making profits by selling the same old shoddy toasters to people whose previous shoddy toaster failed after a year, or two, or three. Why can't we buy toasters that can actually be maintained and repaired? Because capitalism does not favor that model, that's why. If our toasters lasted 20 years with the occasional need for maintenance, Stanley Black and Decker, Inc. would be out of business and the Dow Jones would be in the toilet. But we'd use less steel and oil. Plastic does not grow on trees, you know."
"I love the look of this toaster and appreciated its small footprint on my counter.  But it simply fails to produce uniformly brown toast and often requires two rounds of toasting for the bread to turn crisp.  More problematic is that the lift lever does not allow bread to rise up high enough above the slot, and I kept burning my fingers on smaller slices of toast.  Finally, the crumb tray is NOT removable, making cleaning a pain.  All in all, I had to send it back for a product that didn't have these flawed attributes."
"It does the job pretty basically. I cant figure out if the ""frozen"" button actually works. It doesn't feel like it engages at all its such a tiny movement. I bake my own bread that is not as tall as commercial bread, so the ""lift"" feature is useless to me. Still have to fish slices out with my fingers...hot...hot...It feels cheap and light, but it was cheap, so as long as it basically toasts, I got my money's worth.12/26/21 UPDATE: I'll be spending the extra $ next time to get a toaster that is not a cheap, tinny waste of space. I really don't think the toast level dial has any purpose at all. Its on a timer that seems to keep the same time no matter where you put it. I've decided the ""frozen"" button is completely useless and as of the last couple of weeks, the ""Cancel"" button is too - which is what alerted me to the ""frozen"" button's status. There's no way to stop it dropping ALL the crumbs on the counter - you'll have to put it on a large plate or something to catch it all. Overall, you can do MUCH better for a few bucks more."
"Used twice.  First time with some bread slices that when placed in toast position the tops of the bread poke out the top.  Second time assuming the bagel select would only toast one side of my bagel.  Nope.  Look in the directions and it states the bagel select toasts both sides.  It suggests it warms the one side but I can confirm it did ""toast"" both sides of the bagel.  Operation and heat from coils is great but I couldn't recommend."
"There is a button for bagel and also for frozen, however no indicator light or anything to know if it is actually ""on"". Very cheaply made, spring is too weak to even lift a slice of bread."
"Kind of cheaply made, slots are not deep enough, and it toasts unevenly. Plus, the power cord comes out of the front rather than the normal rear, which is a pain and a little dangerous. Don’t know why the designed it that way. Wish I spent a little more money on a better toaster.I do not recommend."
Shame On Black & Decker. Selling Cheap Garbage Items. This Toaster stopped toasting evenly and consistently no matter what number setting used. Less than 8 months and it's JUNK!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS ITEM. I have lost faith with Black and Decker. Build them like you use to Made to last . My original toaster lasted 20+ years and was used several times a day and toasted evenly no matter what number you used. I'll try some other brand toaster made better or maybe I'll go back to my original Coleman stove top toaster...not plugged in just used the stove burners. Bring Back Made in U.S.A. Everything! Built Better and Built to Last.
Looks great on countertop but seems very slow to toast.  Bottom crumb try isn't the easiest to get undone to get the crumbs out.
"Third toaster in a month, different brands. This one's cancel button is non functional. I'm just going to keep it, tired of returns. Everything is junk these days."
this is a cheap piece of plastic garbage.  sorry I bought it.
"I suppose I can't say I bought this toaster with particularly high expectations.  I find it to be slightly flawed in a few manners.  It does in fact toast items, and a normal sized bagel works.  It seems to toast evenly.The problems lie within the simplicity of the machine.- There are no lights to indicate usage of the toaster including pushing the bagel or frozen buttons.  This makes it difficult to determine whether you push the buttons prior to pushing the slices down or after.  I love simple reminders that I'm doing something correctly.- The outer shell is cheap plastic.  I guess it didn't take a rocket scientist to discover this problem, as it was sort of expected.  I'd grade it one step below an average hard plastic shell.Overall it is functional and served it's part time service, but I am in the market for a better machine at the moment.  I'd recommend for lighter duty, but think it would be better to spend a couple more bucks to get a quality high function toaster."
"I bought this toaster as a Christmas gift, for my mother, to go along with a red Black and Decker coffee brewer. The first toaster broke after only one use. We hope that it was a defect to begin with. I ordered a replacement which my Mom has been using for about three weeks with no issues thus far.The wire racks that hold the bread and move it up and down are quite flimsy on this unit. When compared to our stainless steel Hamilton Beach toaster this is a very cheaply made product. (they were the same price) It is made almost entirely of plastic. I found the tray to clean out the crumbs to be difficult to open and close. I'm not sure how long it will hold up. If it breaks again, I'll update my review.My preference would have been to move on to another brand, product, or model but the choices were few during the holiday rush and my Mom had her heart set on this toaster so I let her make the choice. She loves the bright red color and the fact that it is very easy to use. She doesn't make toast every day, so I hope that this will meet her needs and serve her well. It sure does make her kitchen pop when paired with the new coffee maker.If you are looking for a red toaster that is sturdy and will stand up to every day use, I'd look elsewhere. This one will make toast but I'm not sure how long it will last. I'll update if something changes."
"Toasts well, esoecially frozen items. Does not have a crumb catcher and crumbs abound on the counter!"
"This toasted is VERY light weight compared to my previous Black & Decker toaster.  I suspect it'll break within 2 years.  Aside from the light weight plastic construction, you'll find that the heating elements do not toast evenly.  Worse, they are too close to the toast/muffin/bagel so even on a low setting the surface gets scorched.  (It's not a low or high heat setting, the control just shortens or lengthens the timer, so the heating element is either too hot or too close to the item you're trying to toast.)  Lastly, when your toast is ready and it automatically pops up, it doesn't pop up enough, leaving you to have to manually lift the arm so you can retrieve your toast.  Maybe the light-weight spring is insufficient to support a slice of toast.  This model needs to be re-engineered."
"Doesn’t toast evenly, one side well done, one very light. Don’t know how it got so many positive reviews. Overall felt cheap.Also I had to pay for return postage so I’m not happy with service."
"Not happy with this.  The slots are very short and I hate the flip crumb holder.  If I could return it, I would but is threw away the box it came in."
"For $40 I had fairly low expectations for this toaster but it was a Black + Decker, so how bad could it be?  No frills expected, just a toaster for bread and bagels and yet this product is disappointing by even that measure.  First, the power cord comes out of the front of the toaster.  Why?  Second, the bagel and frozen functions do nothing to alter the intensity of the heat.  Finally, the look, quality and feel of this product just screams cheap.  I recommend avoiding this toaster."
"Just to let people know, The noir toaster is glossy black not matte as shown. Fingerprint magnet. Main problem is bagel button does absolutely nothing! It still toasts on both sides. Why the hell is button even there. Returning!"
"I'm not crazy about this toaster.  It feels very cheap, and the cord comes out the front bottom, instead of the back, making it harder to plug in than it needs to be (unless you face the toaster to the wall, which would make using the toaster pretty tough)*.  I'm not a toast expert or anything, but I had a bit of a time finding a setting that really toasted my break thoroughly, and even then, it seems to favor one side over the other, and be pretty light around the edges.  I'm not sure how much of that is normal for any toaster (I never really paid much attention to toast or toasters before now), so maybe take my comments with a grain of salt.* It's possible I could remove the bottom plate and try to move the cord to the other side, but I'm not too inclined to start taking this thing apart.  It doesn't feel all that solid, and I'm not convinced it would ever go back together correctly."
we had this toaster for years - it works and still works but it is the slowest toaster in the world - you have to plan accordingly - so if you are making eggs put the toast in before you start cooking - i though black & decker was a good name - we finally got a different toaster - hopefully it will be better -you can grow hair waiting for toast - it works- but SLOOOOOOW
Received this toaster on August 1st. Used approximately 4 times. Lever will not stay down. Tried to get replacement or refund. Amazon says I only had till September 1st. 30 days. This product should have lasted more than 2 months. Very unhappy with Amazons standing behind their merchandise  and policies . What has happened to customer satisfaction?
"I want to replace my old  toaster of 10 years black and decker same model, but unfortunate it was defective,"
"The defrost and bagel buttons are each no different when depressed or not, so it’s impossible to tell which mode you’re in. Bagels heats extremely unevenly with one end brown while the other white.Going to return it. Perhaps it’s just a defective unit, but why gamble on the same model. Either they’re all bad or only this one is bad due to poor quality control. Why gamble? Going to order a different brand."
This toaster only toasts on one side of the bread.  Sent it back.
"This toaster has a cord that is on the same side as the lever. It is very awkward to use. When I went back to look at the description and pictures, there was only one picture that showed a small section of the cord. No other pictures showed the cord at all! I would not recommend this toaster, which is too bad. It is cute and toasts fine, but there are others that would be better. In the pictures or description, be sure to check where the cord comes out of the toaster. And no, there is NOT a notch on the bottom to run the cord to the back."
"Weeks later - had to update --I previously gave this 5 stars but have altered it to 3.It no longer seems to work evenly -- see attached image.The two waffles shown in image were toasted at the same time for the same length of time.One is burned and the other is hardly even toasted.#######################################This is a good toaster, works well and toasts evenly.The one thing a bit confusing are the ""frozen"" and other buttons.I believe you first add your frozen item to toast, then depress the lever to activate toasting and finally press the ""frozen"" button.  However, nothing really lights up or shows that the ""frozen"" button has been activated.It's not really a big deal though and my frozen waffles do come out very nicely toasted.All in all, it is a good value for the price."
"I loved this toaster for the 3 years and a few months that it served us.  It toasted well.  It was a great value at the $17 purchase price.  I guess I should be happy that I only spent $17; however, BLACK & DECKER, it should have lasted a lot longer than a little over 3 years.  The warranty is 2 years.  I guess I should have bought the extended warranty, but 3 years?  Come on, you can do better than that.  The toaster is super light, plastic, and feels of low quality; however, it always worked great (until it didn't).  I guess you do get what you pay for, but I still feel that I should have got more than 3 years out of a toaster; hell, I can get that out of a toaster that I buy at the dollar store or even goodwill.  The problem is that one day I put my toast in, pushed the lever down, and, well, the lever never came back up.  It remains down and will no longer even warm up to toast the bread.  Funny thing is it worked fine up until that moment and I used that toaster every week.  I don't know if it's any better to spend your money on another brand as this is probably the 6th toaster that I've owned in the last 20 years (I guess I love toast).  I just want you to know what to expect and what I experienced.  I guess it's like most other appliances these days--another disposable product that will die out much sooner than its ancestor appliances did."
"It is a beautiful toaster, and has a good brand name ay a reasonable price. And that would be great if all you wanted it for was looks. Shortly after I started using it I noticed one side wasn't browning as well in one of the slots. That got worse, then the other side started in. Then the top browned more than the bottom, so when it popped up I would take the toast, turn it upside down and rotate it so the lighter side would be on the side that browned better. I did this for almost a year and a half until the other morning it popped up, wouldn't go back down and it seemed to have no power and there was a burning smell. It had tripped the breaker. I tried it on a different outlet and right away I noticed a burning smell so I quicky unplugged it and took it out to the trash. Yes, I could have returned it at the start when it didn't toast evenly, but I was lazy and figured it did work somewhat. But it really should have lasted longer than it did."
"First, the bagel and Frozen button do not light up. So there is no way to know it is actually doing what it says it is? You push down the level and push the button and nothing shows it is doing anything different than regular toasting.My biggest complaint on this is the bagel function in itself. A bagel function on most all other toaster is to toast on only one side (the inside of the bagel and outside does not toast or is at a lower level). There are even pics on the top of this toaster to show you how the bagel is to be put in. But guess what? That is not what this toaster does. In the manual, the bagel function still toasts both sides but just adjusts the length of time it toasts. What the hell is that? if that is the way it works then it needs to say that in the description."
"OVERVIEW:  Upon first inspection it seemed a bit light and flimsy but for the price in comparison to other 4 slice toasters I figured that'd be the case with the all plastic outer shell. What I found instead was a plastic shell that was floating around the metal, able to move around rather freely. This toaster does not shield heat... AT ALL. The plastic after one cycle at the highest setting was very warm to the touch, and the front face of the toaster where all the controls are mounted was also very warm to the touch. Being that said, I have a large family (household of 6 people) and it's not uncommon for the toaster to run 2-3 cycles back to back as everyone is getting their breakfast for the morning. After a second cycle the product was hot to the touch where the controls were located, and the outer plastic shell was almost pliable due to the heat.PROS:+ Appearance. Nice looking product. Comparable in appearance to products twice or more it's price.+ Controls. Simple controls that look and work as designed.CONS:- Lightweight and flimsy. Doesn't feel like a sturdy and durable product.- Thin power cord. With the amount of power draw this thing can do from the wall (1300w) you'd figure the power cord would be thick. My prior toaster (Farberware) had a heavy duty three pronged power cord, where this one was a thin two pronged power cord.- Gets hot to the touch. I trust myself not to touch the outer areas when it's been used, but with children in the house that want to be independent and make their own breakfast, it's definitely unreasonable for the controls area to be hot to the touch and will definitely pose a safety hazard."
"OK, I bought this because of many reviews and they said it was great, well I must say and it also stated it was  METAL. Well, the only thing metal is the internal part where it toasts. Mine toast is somewhat better on one side than the other,  it does not indicate if you are pushing the button that it is being used for FROZEN or Bagel or any such thing. I may have to reheat things 3 or 4 times to get it to the proper toasted preference on any given day or it may work the first time. Its like it has a mind of its own! This is a surprise to me for a B&D product.."
"I have now had a few weeks to use my new TR1278 toaster.  It works as expected.  It takes longer than expected to toast simple white bread which can indirectly suck the moisture out of your bread. I was surprised when I saw that the finished toast product is pretty even.  Do your research before purchasing.. This would be great for a small household.  If you have a family of 5, it will take 30 minutes to serve them toast.. I think it was worth the $18 that I spent on it but not a value.  I will likely replace this with a more expensive one at some point in the next year.  I haven't tried but I don't think it would handle a bagel too well.  If you plan on using it frequently, spend a few more bucks and get a more serious product.  This is for sure an entry level toaster."
I bought this toaster last month. I don’t use it every day and when I went to use it this morning it does not work. Do not waste your time or your money on this terrible product.
"I ordered this for my grandparents.  The toaster they had had for the last 20+ years had finally gone on the blink.  They wanted a simple inexpensive toaster, & I was hoping this one would work for them.  Granted, this is on the cheaper end of toasters, but really does a toaster need to be expensive just to toast a slice of bread.  The first toaster I got in didn't toast the bread on one side, & ironically, it was the side that was supposed to turn off w/ the bagel function that worked.  The replacement that I got works better, but still not terrifically. The bagel function does not work at all.  We have never tried the frozen function, but to be honest, I doubt it would work.  It does an okay job of toasting bread, but I will not be surprised if it needs replaced in couple of years."
The best thing I can say about the toaster is that it still toasts after six years of service. But it never toasted that evenly and it traps a lot of crumbs. The crumb tray doesn't really help. It also tends to burn anything that is a teeny bit too large so I don't really feel that confident using it.
"Love the color, but that's about it. Temp control is a joke, toast comes out the same whether on min or max setting, and there's no cool zones, the entire toaster gets hot as He**"
"We have had this toaster for about 2 weeks now. It looks great & does the job.For those of you who freeze your bread, you need to crank up dial. I need to put this onto 5.5 & defrost for the toast to have any sort of color. We've tried a few different combo's of settings & weather or not to use the defrost button but we found that 5.5 & defrost works the best. We've always had frozen bread & this is the highest setting I've ever had to use with any toaster. Usually I can get away with it on 4 & no defrost. Not this time!Some people in previous reviews said that this toaster does not have a crumb tray, it does but it's more of a flap. You have to hold it over the sink or trash can, flip it upside down and undo the silver flip plates at the bottom, then flip it again to shake it out."
"This was a serviceable toaster up until a couple months ago, when the timer function stopped working. Now it simply does not stop toasting, making for a very dangerous product that sets fire to bread every time. Buyer beware."
"The toaster is not worth the 20+ dollars they are asking for it. I've owned this toaster for quite some time now (way over a year) and while mine has not broken, it has never toasted as well as it should. I replaced a 7 dollar toaster with this one and the cheaper toaster generally provided better quality.There is no appreciable difference in toasting when you use the ""frozen"" button. There is no way to tell if you turned the frozen setting on or off as there are no indicators and the button doesn't stay depressed so you can't tell. Useless feature.The bagel setting provides no discernable difference in toasting either.The toast is either burned or not cooked all the way through. No matter where you set the temp it seems to make it's own choices and you have to go all the way left or right on the knob to get any change at all. Once you get a setting that is good, don't change it!The cord comes out the wrong end (front) if you don't want the cord out in the way you have to wrap it underneath the toaster. Total waste and idiotic design choice.Looks great on the counterWhen this one fails completely I will not purchase again.Sidenote: The 7 dollar toaster lasted me over 5 years."
"Slice didn't fit in the toaster slots,  it was to short"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I ended up calling Black and Decker, because I discovered this issue, past the return window for Amazon (it was in my furnished rental unit; I found out about the defect from my guest).The spring-catch, for the lever, is faulty. Which means bread or bagels won't toast unless you manually hold the lever down.I see that Amazon keeps accepting these returns, and selling them as a discounted warehouse item, without checking the common fault of the toaster lever not staying down. The spring-catch mechanism for the lever is a common fault in this model, as you can see from several of the other videos on Amazon. Shame on Amazon for accepting these broke-a-f units, as returns, and remarketing them for cash. It does the consumer no good, and erodes trust.Thankfully, Black and Decker is taking care of me, even though mine was is out of warranty (due to Amazon reselling it, who knows how many times). Black and Decker is sending me a like model, that does not have this issue."
Nice toaster but if you want to toast beagles on just the cut side buy another toaster. The instructions say to just push the lever down and then push the beagle button. Did that several times on the right side and the toaster still heated all of the elements. Tried on the left side ... same thing.I thought I just didn't understand the instructions but after talking to customer service they said I was correct and I could send it back to Amazon and buy another model that the beagle mode supposedly works and cost $10 more OR I could cut off the power cord and they would replace it. I'm in Hawaii and that would mean we go without toast for 2-3 weeks .... not an option. We'll do beagle the old fashion way ... under the broiler.Otherwise it toasts bread nicely just like the one we bought in 1950.
"CHECK ALL BUTTONS!! I have learned my lesson with this toaster. First, let me say that overall, the toaster is a good value and certainly would be at least a 4 star item, if not 5 for the cost, if the few functions it had actually worked. I ordered this toaster about 3 months ago and have been using it since and it works as a toaster should no complaints there. However, one thing I failed to do is test the Bagel and Frozen buttons. My wife happened to mention to me yesterday that she didn't think they were working. After testing it, it is very apparent that neither do anything at all. Several other reviews mention the same thing. Now I am sitting here with a toaster that doesn't work to its full feature set (and probably never has), past the return date and will have to get in touch with B&D to see what they can do to replace it, or if they will. I should have tested all features the day I got it and this process would have been easier.Bottom Line: IF all of the features work, this is a decent toaster and a good value. However, since it is so simple, it doesn't take much to significantly reduce the rating."
Disliked all of it.
"I like the color of this toaster.  I am surprised at how lightweight it is compared to the previous toaster we had.  There are two buttons on the side of the toaster to push for different things, but there are no lights and nothing else to indicate that you have actually activated anything.  I don't know if they really do anything or not."
"Makes toast. After almost a year of use it's still toasting, but I really do wish I spent a little extra on something with an indicator light on the toasting options you're using. Does pressing it a second time turn the option off? I could read the instructions, but will I remember every time I make toast? Do I have to keep the instructions by the toaster for reference? And how many times did I press the bagel button? Was that first time a double press? It's a little surprise when ever your bagel pops. Is the outside going to be toasted, or just warm like you like it. Maybe you should just pop it and start over. That little indicator light solves so may issues in the morning before you even have your coffee. Next time I'll know better."
"I believe toasters should work longer than that, based on my personal experience with other models, so this speaks of the quality of the product and its reliability.  The lever is no longer being held down after you press it down, which is something that makes it useless."
"I am disappointed in this toaster.  The bagel button does not just toast the cutside of the bagel.  That is what I  thought a bagel button was supposed to do.  Instead this one seems to toast my bagel or English muffin darker then the setting would usually toast.  This should be explained in the description.  If it had been, I  wouldn't have purchased it.  It seems to me the frozen button and the bagel button do the same thing - increase thectoasting time.  Also, it doesn't seem to toast evenly no matter what I'm toasting.  There always seem to be areas darker than others."
"Our previous toaster was whatever was on sale at Target about 15 years ago.I must've previously had a cool-touch toaster and I didn't realize it.We keep getting burned fingers from the metal top of this new toaster.This toaster has optional buttons for frozen and bagels, but no indicator light showing that the buttons have been pressed.I notice no difference in operation after pressing the frozen or bagel buttons.My previous toaster had a crumb tray that could be slid out from the front using its cool-touch handle while the toaster was sitting in its place on the counter.To access the crumb tray on this toaster you need to lift up the toaster and move it around to get the tray out.  It seems to just drop crumbs all over the counter when I do that.I suppose this toaster works okay at toasting things.  I bought it for the added feature of the frozen button which does nothing.It's red.  That's fun.If I had saved the box I would definitely return it and look for a cool-touch toaster instead that doesn't have useless buttons on it."
"I like the size and the look, but it doesn't toast evenly,  bottom of stuff is burnt to n is great."
"Ok, the thing does toast bread, so I'll give it at least 2 stars. But as many have said, it is slow. And then, I read reviews saying the bagel button doesn't do anything. I sort of couldn't believe that. But, yep, hitting the bagel button, both sides are toasted. So what the heck could the button even be doing? I'm tempted to take the toaster apart just to see if the button has any wires hooked up. I scanned through the instructions it came with, and right there in black and white where it is talking about the bagel button, it says that both sides of the bagel are still toasted when pressing the bagel button. But it doesn't say anything about what the darn button does! What's the point?!Lastly, the buttons have no indication that a sort of mode or anything is on. There is no light or anything so you press them and have no idea if anything is going to happen. Is defrost mode on? Was I supposed to hit it before I pulled the lever down? Should I hit again? Will that turn it off? I'd like to find the product designer for this that removed the LEDs and lowered the wattage to make 30 more cents of profit and smack them around."
"O.K. Here's the deal....I am sure this is a lovely toaster.  I have no problems with the product.  Although I have not opened it yet, I am sure it is fine.  I have to say though, with the HUNDREDS of purchases I have made on Amazon, this is a first.  It arrived in the manufacturer's packaging WITHOUT A SHIPPING BOX!  So I come home from a funeral, and my daughter says, ""Hey Mom...your toaster came so I brought it into the house"".  Guess what?  It was supposed to be a Christmas gift for her!  SURPRISE...MERRY CHRISTMAS (NOT!)  You MIGHT want to rethink that shipping policy, at least this time of year..."
I bought this toaster because my old one was only toasting my bread on one side and this one is doing the same thing so I’m kind of disappointed
"Had an older metal bella toaster and it worked pretty well. This one I got to replace it, but they put a sticker right on the front and it left a bunch of goo I can't get off. It also seemed to toast great, for like a day, then after week of using it, it started toasting uneven and it has only been used less than 10x. I would go with a different model."
"The toaster is quite literally radiating burning heat on extremely high levels (the way a burning stove flame would) which is a HUGE safety hazard that could cause a fire easily. It continues to smell like burning plastic (is it even safe to eat the bread with burning chemicals???), and the bread becomes black by level 3 instead of level 6 as advertised. ...!!?! Quite unsure if this is a abnormal, defective product that was sent out or whether this is the norm for the product. I really wanted to like it because I want the full matching kitchen colors set but... this is genuinely a health and safety concern. If the seller could replace this potentially defective individual item, that would be great but if this is typical... be careful everyone please."
"Was looking for an affordable toaster.  This one had good reviews.Ordered it.  Took it out to try it.  NO TOAST!  The lever you push down has to lock at the bottom to start toasting.  Well, this one doesn't lock.  It won't turn on.  USELESS!  Sending it back."
"This worked great at first. Now, it works well for bagels and frozen waffles, but I can't get bread to toast properly. It seems very uneven. I do like the pull out tray."
"After our 15 yo DeLonghi toaster started to fail, it was time for a replacement.  This one had mostly good reviews, so I thought we'd try it.  Several of the reviews talked about a toxic smell when they first tried toasting.  So, I first put the toaster on (empty) under the hood fan in our kitchen.  Even with the fan on high, there was still a strong, noxious odor.  I ran the toaster through a couple more cycles - same result.  At that point we decided to return.  When I was packing it back up, I noticed that the toaster slots, although wide, were very short.  So I measured them.  Our old DeLonghi had slots 5.6"" long, this Proctor Silex had slots only 5.1"" long.  Making it unusable for some of our favorite slices.  Another reason to return."
"The toaster toasts bread, but a new setting has to be used with different slices of bread, e.g. White, wheat, rye, sourdough. It might have something to do with the density of the bread. It works well once you get the settings worked out."
Does not toast quickly like previous one we had. Not high quality
I'd spend more money get a better product. This is just ok.
Cheaply made
"Length of Slot: 5.5 inchesIf you only toast kids square sandwich bread, then the width will work perfectly fine. A slide of bread is around 4.5 inches.If, however, you want to toast a more artisan slice, nothing fancy just your average supermarket next level bread, it will not fit. The slices are 5.5 inches so you will need to squeeze the slide into the slot. Its works but its a tight fit.Width of Slot:Yes, as advertised it is wide enough for a bagel. It works.Depth of Slot:Once again, if you try to toast your kids square sandwich bread, the slice will sink in. The top of the slice is about level with the top of the toaster. That means you need to get your fingers down into the slot to grab it and lift it out.Functionality:It toasts perfectly evenly and otherwise performs as one would expect.The toaster toasts the bread evenly"
"Replaced a 7-year-old Hamilton Beach, a basic (inexpensive) toaster with bigger slots. Wish I could've gotten a few more years out of that one.THIS toaster does not toast evenly, the cord is awkward because it's attached at the front where the controls are, instead of the BACK like any normal appliance. Why?? Nuts.And after 2 months of using it only occasionally (because it doesn't work all that well) we can't pop the toast up manually in the middle of a cycle. That is pretty much dangerous. Have to unplug the toaster to stop it.I realize I didn't pay all that much for it, but I just wanted a basic toaster that works reliably. This is NOT that. Next time (very soon) I'll buy another Hamilton Beach. Their products are pretty much reliable for the tasks they're built for."
"It’s a basic toaster.  Few annoyances.First, It takes a lot of force to push down the lever. So much, I usually tip the toaster over, rather than successfully push down the lever. So it actually takes two hands. One to keep the toaster from tipping and the other to push the lever.Second, it’s super deep. I thought the feature where it pushes up the bread would be great so I didn’t need to use a fork to dig out my bagels like with my last toaster. Nope - it much deethsn my old toaster. The “lift feature” still leaves the smaller bread or bagel or whatnot, well below the top of the toaster.Third, the cord is still super awkward."
It gets the job done only problem is it toasts uneven.
"Like:  It doesn't take up much room on the counter and the slot is wide, great.Dislike:  I have to push down the lever twice to get the bread to toast even though I had it at the highest level!  Not good, but I'll keep the toaster.  Also, no fail safe, you have to unplug the toaster instead of turning it all the way to the left to have it pop up.  Not good.  Would I buy it again or recommend?  Nope."
Cheap!
"The black dial on the black background is very hard to to see and set.  It is VERY tinny and rattles. The pop up black button is on the black dial. I thought I would get a reasonably good product from Proctor Silex, but is nothing but more cheap junk."
"This is a basic, low cost toaster so I wasn’t expecting much. But for one year it worked fine. Unfortunately the internal heating elements died this week, slightly over one year after purchase. Now only one side of the bread gets toasted. The other side comes out soft. I can’t recommend purchasing this toaster."
It worked well for 2 years and then died
Cheap bendable metal bars are used to support and eject toast. It frequently jams and you have to use a fork to get the toast out.
"Good price, sleek design almost retro, uncomplicated controls, would be perfect except a slice of bread from an ordinary grocery store brand, is too long and will not fit in the toast slots.  Have to cut each slide of bread in half before toasting.  Bagels or English Muffins fit well because slots are wide enough.  Just not long enough for ordinary commercial sliced bread."
"Sorry for bothering my coworker, but I brought this to the office. I must tell you this: while I was typing this review, a colleague came in and said as he opened the door across from me. You must be toasting once more. I can smell it from the other end of the hall.. ""When I read Amazon reviews and someone complains about a product, I often think that person is exaggerating. Let's face it: people like to complain. So I read a review of this toaster that said it had a ""strong smell"" and assumed it would have a mild smell, but it didn't. That's not good. And before you tell me to ""read the manual and follow the instructions,"" please know that I did. For the first time, I'm one of those people).I haven't put any real food in yet because it still smells horrible...like chemicals that you don't want to inhale, let alone contaminate your food. The instructions state that the odor must be removed. This is accomplished by toasting A-Nothing several times. I completed it. I've been using this toaster for a few months, and I walk into my office almost every morning to press the toaster's button, hoping that the horrible smell will go away. It wasn't, but only so I wouldn't annoy my coworkers or startle people with the smell (I used it the first few times, and a few people were horrified) what is burny. However, I've roasted the whole thing with nothing at least dozens of times, and the smell isn't exaggerated when I say it still smells.Finally, if I still have the box, I will return it. Save yourself the trouble and smell by spending a few extra dollars on a toaster that does not smell like the inside of a chemical plant. I can't return it, so I'll keep using it for the time being (assuming I don't get fired)... I'll let you know when the smell has gone away."
Slots to small for larger bread
How weird that the electric cable/plug runs from the front of the toaster underneath and out the back to be plugged in . Haven't used it yet but the routing of the cable is STRANGE . A 2 right now.
It looks great.  I have to put it on maximum setting to get a light toast.
"I keep looking for a toaster that toasts both sides of the bread, and the third one I have purchased after I returned this one works only reasonably well in that regard.  I used to have a GE open-face toaster that worked so well, but apparently is no longer available."
"This is a first.The toast does not pop-up above the toaster; I must pull it out.Also, it has this tinny sound when toast is done.SIGH!Another never ever to purchase again.So, I will just persevere with the annoying sound and with pulling up the toast from the slot until it dies."
Only toasts on outside. I wanted something simple like last one i had. The price is low but you get what you pay for. Also cant fit bagels in unless you shave them thin. Meh. It toasts toast...on one side
This is a product of Hamilton Beach and that toaster lasted less than a yr. I was not aware of this until i received the toaster.
"dislike the fact that it does not fit pan bread, because the slots are not long enough. since that is the kind of bread l usually use. l am very disappointed in it."
The whole toaster moves just to press down the lever
...before we had to start holding down the lever as it kept popping up
"Need i wider slot for rye or sourdough, made for wheat or white, also when mashing down doesn't always stick...."
Doesn't evenly toast the bread
I like the cool touch exterior but the cord enters the toaster on the same side making it inconvenient to operate.
"It toasts very slowly, and mostly just on one side. Both sides are lit up when you look into it, but with one job to do, it does it poorly."
Not  real sturdy. Feels a litt Cheap.
"You get what you pay for mostly.  This toaster was on sale , that's what drove my choice. This toaster has no Bagel setting like many toasters.  Doesn't do bagels was well as my last toaster which had an actual bagel setting. Other than that it toasts bread just fine. And does have the ""cool touch"" sides.....but I would not purchase this one again.  Next time , I'll get one with a Bagel setting."
"For weeks, i only used this toaster for english muffins. On the highest setting, sometimes I had to do at least part of another toasting cycle. When i finally tried bread, the full cycle was way too high. Lesson learned. Here’s the top thing to know: this is a great toaster for the money (it is a single tasker… the only thing it does is toast). BUT, if you have kids, the metal (silver) part (the entire top of the toaster) is hot enough foe you to pull away, and fir achils to seriously burn their hand. 🔥"
Pros: Famous brand. Pullout crumb tray. 3 year warranty. 🙂 Cons: Weak toaster.  700 watts only.  😐 Comment: Thanks to Charlie's invention 100 years ago . Save time! 🥸
Stopped working after 3 months of very minimal use. Warranty is still good but the purchaser is responsible for all costs associated with returning the toaster and them returning a repaired or replacement toaster back.  Would cost more than the price of the cheap toaster to begin with. I'll spend more and get a better brand.
"Not a good toaster, only heats on one side, would not recomend"
"As others have noted, gives off a bad chemical smell when powered on; one can only guess at the toxic brew of carcinogens burning off this unit and the cancer toast being eaten by ProctorSilex' hapless customers. DO NOT BUY. POISON. Lesson learned. Get a used toaster from the thrift store."
"Some popular bread brands (like Orowheat) may have to be cut in half to fit.  Does not toast bread evenly - edges get browner than center.  Would not recommend.  If there was a better way to return items from here in the boonies, it would be returned.  At least it wasn't very expensive."
First off I hated that it didn't have a crumb tray so you have to flip the unit upside down and shake the crumbs out of it which I'm not sure is good for the unit and I feel like doing this could assist in the heating element breaking.The cord wraps around the bottom but when you do this is doesn't store away neatly because it won't sit flat.Toasting was always inconsistent. The lever button always had a hard time staying down.I got two years out of it with inconsistent use and inconsistent results.
"Toaster used less than one time per week, heating elements stopped working and toaster ejects toast as soon as pushed down. Only have had toaster for two years."
"It was inexpensive; however, average quaility"
Cord is so short that I have to turn the toaster around to inconvenienced position with controller is on wrong side.
It’s ok
"I purchased this toaster in June 2022. In April of 2023 the toaster was being used, it started smoking and making a ticking sound. The lever to push down stopped working and the toaster itself started sparking. Toaster lasted only 10 months, it was used maybe a few times a wk if even that."
"Does the job and makes toast.  However, it is flimsy and not sturdy. When you press down on the button for your bread to go down, the toaster wants to flip over.  You have to hold it down"
"We liked the toaster, but the slots were not always wide enough for bagles and burger buns.  It only lasted for one year, but we did use it a lot."
Terrible. Cranked up all the way to 7 and still just barely toasted and only on one side. Returning it.This was to replace a much more expensive toaster that had exactly the same problem. I am thinking these manufacturers get the heating elements from the same low quality source.
"The length of the slots is shorter than my last toaster. I have to bend the bread slices a little to get them in. Then, as I push the handle down, I have to press each slice all the way down into the slot. It's lightweight & tips forward when you press the handle. Cheap, poorly made."
doesn't hold large slices of bread. A quarter of the bread hangs outside the toaster.
This toaster doesn't seem to heat up well. I put the dial as high as it will go and it barely toasts the bread. I usually have to toast my bread twice.
"I never realized toasters came in different wattages, I guess I should have researched a little more.  Well, the toaster works fine but takes a quite a while to toast.  It's very lightweight and stores in the cabinet easily."
Everything works but don't believe this will last too long.  The noise it makes when the toast pops up is loud and sounds as though something is getting ready to break..Only used if for a few weeks.WIll update with any changes.Recommended.  fornow.
"The old saying you get what you pay for is true when it comes to this item.  I would not recommend it.  Yes it is functionable, but it would not stand up in a household of 4.  Thankfully, I am not in a household of 4."
"Bought it as a gift for my 80-year old mother and it died a week after the 30-day return policy expired. Still looks brand new, but looks don’t make toast.Amazon doesn't offer a refund. The manufacturer will replace the $17 toaster if I pay $12.49 for the replacement to be shipped, but they do not offer a refund."
Nice affordable toaster but only toasts one side of each slice of bread. So….  I suggest you try another brand
"The slots aren't  long enough for many bread slices to fit in.  I put the slices in side down to make them fit and then the ends stick out the top.  I've never met a toaster that wouldn't fit sliced bread.  Baffling.  Still, it works ok.  Bread gets toasty, hence the 2nd star.  If you just want to toast english muffins and bagels then maybe get this.  If you are a normal human being and want your toaster to make toast then jog on."
"Get what you pay for. It works well.Had my last Proctor Silex for 20+ years.Don’t think this will make it past  5 years. The pusher handle is sticky and takes 2 times to make it stay down. It toasts just fine, though.I give it a “C”."
"The “extra wide slots for bagels, aren’t."
"It was delivered 1/24. It worked fine at first. I don't have toast every day, so it would sit unused sometimes several days. Yesterday, the bread I tried to toast would stay in the toaster for several minutes, but when it popped up, it was just slightly warmed bread. Tried it again this morning with the same result. I looked down inside the toaster as best I could while it was on with bread in it. I could see there were whole sections where the heating/toasting element  just did not come on at all"
"The slots for bread slices will only fit very small slices. For example, we buy Trader Joe's 6-grain whole bread and I have to push the slices to fit, and they are even taller that the slot (the tops do not heat well). Only buy if you plan to eat Wonder bread or similar sandwich, highly industrialized types."
Slots  not wide enough for Dave's Bread and doesn't hold cauliflower sandwich rounds-they fall through.
It came wit roaches inside of it had to throw it out
Couldn't fit my bread in slots; one bread slice was too wide and another too tall for the slots.  Toasts uneven.
I either got a lemon or it is just not a very good toaster. Put a piece of bread in slot and one side burns while other side is toasted the way you like. I have had to scrape one side several times because of it burning. The other side is fine. Turned temp down still get burned on one side of bread. It will be regulated to basement as soon as I can get a new toaster. Until them will just pull my four slot toaster out of cabinet and use. Wanted a two slot toaster so I could keep on counter.
Not even 1 month old and it does not work.  Handle will not stay down.  Would like a refund
"Are you kidding me is this what we consider a deal these days? $24 for a burning plastic smell, uneven toasting slits and the outside looks like it was kicked across the warehouse floor? Come on. The smell alone is insane my whole house smells like plastic,  right out the box it smelled like toxins. I'll be returning this to get a metal one. And what's with the price? That's insane for a toaster even these days,  especially of this caliber."
It was a cheap toaster.  Wish I would have spent more for one that's of better quality.
seems to be a mediocre product and  just worth the low price.
"Would not recommend this toaster. It doesn’t have enough elements in it to do a good job. It takes a long time to toast a slice of bread so it dries it out more than toasts it, AND one side is always darker than the other. If you want to turn your bread slice halfway through, I guess this would work for you but I am not impressed."
My dislike is one side burns quickly in either slot
"I don’t like hard toasted bread even on the lowest setting it’s too hard I’ll buy a new one, of a different brand."
Owned this 3 Months Now I can hear the timer going as it is toasting .AND it is not toasting evenly .  Not a happy customer !
I don’t know who is writing good reviews on these but they must not be using them.  Temperature and toast time are totally inconsistent.  You often get burned removing the toast from the toaster.  There’s a reason these are cheap.
"The power cord comes out of the front, directly under the toaster controls.  Every other toaster I've ever seen the cords comes out of the back witht the toaster congtrols in the front.  This is a bizarre design."
Not even 1 year and most of the center eating elements have burned out and do not work would not recommend
Down button is hard to push
"The toaster works fine, but creates a burning plastic smell. I do not know if its because its new and you need to use it a few times or its just how it is. But im not a fan of that"
"I replaced a Cuisinart brand with this Proctor-Silex because the former did not toast both sides evenly.  Unfortunately, we have the same problem with the Proctor-Silex."
This toaster is not good for bagels even thought the description says it is. The slots are not wide enough.
The sides are not large enough for a regular size bagel! I hate this toaster
Too small for some breads beagles need to be turned to toast the whole thing. Kinda pricey for what it is.
I don't feel like I'm toasting particularly beefy bagels.. Occasionally a ciabatta bun.. But this still isn't wide enough for me to fit the top half of the bagel in there without shoving it down and then it can't pop up when it's done and it gets burnt in there - the whole ordeal.The struggle continues :(
I should have paid more and gotten a better toaster. This one is not good at all.  Will purchase a new toaster as soon as I can.
The slots don't fit large pieces of bread like rye or whole grain.
"Bought this in October, lasted 6 months, and broke, the springs broke, the temperature gauge quit working as well. Prior to this had a toaster that lasted 20 years. Quality today is awful"
Bought in April stopped working in September. Tried all suggestions..
Stopped working after 7 months
"The toaster worked fine for first 3.5 months, although be aware that the metal top of the toaster gets exceptionally hot and the toasted item cannot be pushed up very high, so be careful when removing toasted items. Then the product made a popping noise one time when initiating a toasting cycle (nothing out of the ordinary about the item being toasted) and then the machine started buzzing. After unplugging, cleaning crumbs, plugging back in, the machine still buzzes and does not seem safe to use. Update: Hamilton Beach did replace the toaster under its limited warranty, however, I would still encourage the buyer to beware given the short lifespan of my initial toaster."
I have had this item not a year yet and I need to replace it as it is not working properly anymore.  It used to work well.  At the moment it makes a noise and does not toast the bread correctly anymore.
"I rarely eat toast, so in the handful of times I used this toaster over the last 5 months, it has started to not stick/stay down when I pushed it down. I tried everything. Now it does not stay down at all. Very disappointing."
Came in an undamaged amazon box with a horribly damaged manufacturers box inside. I like the size and undamaged parts. Going to have to return this for a refund and order a new one at full price because this is the toaster I want. This product was too damaged to sell again... shame on you amazon warehouse!
"Half of the toaster elements stopped working after 8 months, only toasts one side. Piece of crap. Don't buy, pay a few extra bucks to get something more reliable."
Inexpensive but no cancel button
terrible toaster.  wasted $$$$
"So I have a few different opinions on this item.Likes...Large capacity, locking lid, powerful control options.Dislikes..Its plastic and its extremely hard to keep clean (doesn't clean up as nice as glass)  The blades are not meant for smoothies, they're more like food processor blades and they don't  chop the ice up as fine as I'd like. I haven't done salsa yet but think it would be perfect for that.I missed the return window on this one but would really not recommend."
I’ve purchased several of these the past 10 years and they do a great job for my daily shakes/smoothies. I would have had to purchase one in that time if the quality of the plastic container was decent. They easily crack — assuming from the heat of the dishwasher — and charge as much for a replacement as the entire blender assembly. My last two have cracked within about 3 months. Just bought a different brand.
I love this blender but after a few years it will start to crack and leak.  It says dishwasher safe but don't do it. Heat causes the acrylic to crack faster.  It's cheaper to replace the whole thing than the pitcher. It's a defect that ninja won't help with. Base is stellar but lid will leak and hold gross water in it so don't submerge it.
"It’s a great blender, but 2 years in, the lid broke due to the springs breaking, so it won’t lock anymore. And since it doesn’t lock, it won’t blend. I bought mine on sale for $79 at the time."
"To mix well enough I have to add more liquid to smoothies than I'd prefer. Chunks will spin around the top indefinitely unless the smoothie is thin. As for breaking down the pieces, it doesn't work as well as I'd hoped.For 80 bucks it's fine. It's a very mid range experience. I run it on medium or high for a minute to two and there are still pieces that crunch from frozen fruit.Easy to clean, though water does get stuck in the lid between the pieces of plastic. I drain it out but it will never fully dry which could cause mold but it's an external only area so not too concerning.I'd hoped for better blending, but I didn't want to pay for a top tier blender so this is good enough."
"Nov.2:  I have downgraded my rating from 5 to 3 after daily use. I am very disappointed. The ""cons"" I listed before have become deal-breakers and I will have to buy another blender. Again, I only use it for thick daily protein smoothies. #1: WASTAGE. An unacceptable amount of ingredients are wasted stuck to the column of blades, and at the bottom, very difficult to salvage with a spatula, difficult to clean unless IMMEDIATELY used in the blender with DW liquid.  The lid is impossible to clean in a sanitary way if anything splatters, especially in the area of the pour-spout, even if the spout is not used, and easily accumulates ""crust"". #2 Design issue: the spout is very small. Only a liquid ingredient could be added through it, no protein powder. My protein powder needs to be the last ingredient added, preferably while the blender is operating and has a vortex. The good safety feature of not being able to lift the lid while the blender is operating backfired for me.  I have to stop and start, and protein powder unavoidably sticks ""unmixably"" to the blades, further waste. #3: Powerful, but perplexing variability. It does an excellent job with frozen ginger and turmeric, even raw carrots - but strangely, kale and blueberries are blended but not really smooth. Small, uniform but distinct pieces visible no matter how long blended. I think I read this in a previous review but thought, ""Nah"". One lesson learned - do not review something during the honeymoon!Aug.27 I have been using it daily for 6 weeks exclusively for thick smoothies. I just shove vegetables in, no pre-cutting except for frozen chunks of ginger and turmeric.  This has power (300 W more than anything else) and killer blades.PROs: 1. Power, power.  It does not need more than the 3 buttons it has. 2. Multiple safety features, very necessary. 3. Very sharp column of blades. 4. Easy to clean BUT see below, for why I down-rated itCONs: 1. You must use a rubber spatula to force materials past the very sharp blade column in order to blend  2. If making very thick smoothies, as I do, a non-trivial amount of the product gets wasted sticking to the multiple blades and the lid. You have to be very, very careful getting this off and into your receptacle.3. Once this is done, easy to put water at dish soap in and zap it to clean.  I am sure you could do this without scraping off what sticks to the blades, but I do not like to waste my ingredients"
"So i did all my research around ice-crushing, and this Ninja seemed most promising. And it delivered on the ice crushing, I do admit. It crushes ice and blends my smoothies very well.BUT.In my rush to get my ice crushing machine, i neglected to analyze the physical parts and i am finding it very bulky to store. Firstly, the lid has a handle that won't lower unless it's 'locked'/ snapped onto the blender pitcher. I have a thing about not putting anything away closed air-tight b/c I feel things get smelly that way. So now i'm stuck b/c I can't store it loosely with the handle sticking up- it's too tall and bulky! Currently i store the base in one cabinet, the lid in another, and the pitcher on its side (see below) in a third place.Also, water condensation forms at the bottom of the pitcher and inside the handle when you wash/rinse it, so i have to find zany ways to  leave it to drain/ air dry (like on its side in my drainboard or balancing awkwardly on a tilt so the bottom isn't flush with my counter.)And lastly, there's noise... and then there's noise... Crushing ice in this Ninja is LOUD. New family rule- one must holler out for all to hear ""I'm turning on the blender! One Two Three NOW!"" otherwise everyone on the floor will JUMP from the startling sound. Which I guess is dangerous for the heart, but jumping is good exercise so they counteract each other."
"Review for: Ninja BL610 Professional 72 Oz Countertop 1000-Watt Base and Total Crushing Technology for Smoothies, Ice and Frozen Fruit, Black, Blender + Pitcher.This is a pretty nice blender. It works well for my smoothies. It is powerful enough to blend frozen strawberries. My battery powered single serve blender can't handle frozen fruit. This blender has 3 speeds and a pulse. This is sufficient for my needs. Everything fit together well, but I wouldn't call it professional quality. The plastic doesn't feel real cheap, but it is not thick and rigid like I think it should be. I guess to be fair they say professional power. My biggest complaint is that the height in the description shows 15.94"". It is not. It is 17 1/4"" plus the height of the lid release button. I measured my cabinet height before purchasing to make sure it would fit under them. At 15.94"", that would be no problem. My cabinets are 17 9/32"". This blender will not fit under my cabinets. I have to take it apart to be able to stow it under the cabinet, against the wall. This may not sound like a big deal, but it is to me. Amazon or Ninja, you need to put accurate information in the description. Would be 4 stars if not for the incorrect description information."
Sam’s Club had this blender for $79.99. I bought 3 from them.
"I give this five stars in my first review based on how robust it's built and well designed and how powerful it was when the first time I used it. However the power seems to decline it's not high isn't as powerful as it was and it's it seems to be steadily declining.It doesn't sound nearly as powerful as it did when I first operated it and made a smoothie. And honestly I think it's getting Even slower with each use. I know I got a froth a air filled froth the first time I used it and with my smoothie it was so that I had never gotten in fact when I after I drank it I it made me full like half of it it's a protein shake and I burped and ate the rest of it cuz it was so fluffed and full of air. It never did that again I've never been able to using the same ingredients in the same blender get that effect again and I think it's because it's not as fast as it used to be it's not as powerful. So basically it's foony garbage just like  a $20 Black& Decker. Now it's not making either a better it doesn't seem to go any faster I mean it was loud and strong and now it's not it's making mild I've only had it a month or two. And it doesn't it only did that fluffed up frothy smoothie one time and the power is steadily declining this is phony garbage just like the it's no better than the Black& Decker after a couple of months, power wise. But it's like three or four times as expensive. Yet at this point after having a couple of months it's not making any better a smoothie than the Black& Decker I had made."
This blender has a lot of blades but it still doesn't move the food around very well and even with the blades at the top you still have to push the food down into the blades. My last blender turned very fast and the motor was half the power of this one but it could blend a smoothie in half the time. Not impressed
"3rd purchase of the same blender. Plastic tabs that hold top in place have broken after 10 months each time. I understand the sales motivation behind continuing to sell a defective product/design, but I will not be purchasing a new one."
i wa excited for this product and when i was getting ready to use the main blender i realized that the lid was missing and couldn't use it 😔😭
"I so badly wanted to like this blender because of the many 5 star reviews, but this is the worst Ninja product I've purchased.I use the individual cups daily for a work smoothie and the lid with the blades for the solo cups is a terrible design with a deep groove which is hard to clean. The inside of the small cup gets smoothie all the way to the brim and the threads for the lid are on the inside of the cup so when you put the regular lid on, it seals your lid to the cup with smoothie, and smoothie squishes out the top. To avoid that, you need to take a paper towel and clean the inside upper part of the cup before putting the lid on. When blending with the individual cups, you have to press and hold the blend button for the duration of the blend.The large pitcher is bulky and the 6 blades are not easy to clean, especially the deep hole that sets on the inside of the pitcher to hold it in place. The lid to the large pitcher has so many moving parts and grooves, again, not easy to clean. I've only used my large pitcher twice so far and there is already a crack on the bottom. I am unsure if it came like that or not.It seems like customers bring up the loudness of this blender the most as a con, and while it is loud, all the negative cleaning aspects of this blender are way more annoying to me than the noise. I wish I would have returned it."
"I noticed the gasket around the lid gathers gunk. I took it off to clean, and then I couldn’t get it to stay on at all! I also noticed that the blades have a hole where it stands on the rod, and it is full of grooves that can’t be reached to clean. Poor engineering. The blender works great, but since it is so hard to clean I’m going to replace it with something I’ve actually looked at so I’ll know whether it can be cleaned properly."
"Worked fine until earlier this month when a frozen berry cracked the pitcher. Replacement can only be found through Ninja directly and is $75, which is what the entire machine cost us a year ago. The lid has also been hit or miss. Sometimes the locking handle will not lock and you have to hold it in place. Blenders tend to be ""throw-away"" appliances but this should have lasted longer, or at least had a cheaper replacement pitcher."
"It does the job, but in such a way that my 50-year old Oster was preferable.  This Ninja is loud, plastic, and very difficult to clean.  Lot of waste, and a dangerous blade that makes it hard to get all of the food out of it.  Next time I buy a blender, I'm going to have to try it in person first."
"It was great while it lasted. Unfortunately it broke after just 3 weeks of use. The blade itself is tricky to snap on and the blender will not turn on unless you twist it in tightly. Overall, there are better blenders out there that may be more pricey but ultimately are more functional."
"This is the second one I have owned. Each needed replaced after about a year. I will need to either order another or get a replacement  pitcher at almost the cost of a new one. The pitcher does not hold up. The two I have owned, both pitchers cracked and started to leak at about a year of use. I use it once a day for iced coffee using crushed ice. I feel like the second one didn't last as long as the first one I had. It blends very nicely, but the plastic pitcher is not made well. Additionally, I don't put mine in the dishwasher regularly in an attempt to make it last longer. I wash it out daily with Luke warm water after each use. Love how it blends, but the leaking pitcher is a real pain."
It’s great but was expecting it to be glass and not plastic. The power is very good and not too loud. Easy to clean but kinda scary cause of the blades.
"I can blend my smoothie on high and I still have to chew the ice, spinach and chia seeds. I would rate it a one star for smoothies."
"I've had to replace the pitchers on two different Ninja blenders. On the first one, the bullet, the pitcher leaked. On this one, again, the pitcher leaked. The power just tears the pitchers apart. Currently, this model is a little over a year old on the second pitcher, and the lid and blades are both broken, haven torn themselves up from normal use. The pitchers now cost more than the whole blender to replace.If all you want is a product that will last until the end of the warranty period and ultimately destroy itself, them it's pretty good at blending, but it's not at all built to last."
"This was our second Ninja in 5 years. First one, the plastic blender cracked. The second one, we noticed one day through the clear plastic on the handle, mold, food and moisture in the handle. The handle cannot be removed easily if at all. We threw it out for that reason and got a new blender for half the price.Another con for me, the suction cups on the bottom are annoying. You can't slide the blender. If it was stationary, that wouldn't be a big deal. But, we store it next to the toaster and it has to fit under the upper cabinets. This blender has about a 1/4 inch of room since it's so tall. That means you have to pick it up, while the suction cups fight you, then carefully place it under the cabinets while avoiding the suction cups from sucking. Once stored, it's nearly impossible for the suction cups to release due to only 1/4 inch clearance. So, it's always a fight using this thing. It would not be a problem on an island or a counter where it would never need to be moved.Otherwise, it really blends well. Maybe the best blending I've ever seen in a blender."
"I am so disappointed in this blender.I purchased my first Ninja blender about 10 years ago making smoothies 5 days a week. It worked great. I would put in my ingredients and in 60 seconds I had a perfectly blended beverage. After nearly a decade of service it finally gave up the ghost.I was excited to get my new Ninja blender, I was sure that in the intervening decade they would have made advances in their technology.I was wrong.1. Backwards compatibility. When I opened the box and began to set everything up I noticed major differences in the drive and locking mechanisms. I still had all of my original cups and blender. Nowhere in the description did it say it was not backwards compatible. They also did not sell compatible single serving smoothie cups. Which left me trying an aftermarket bullet adapter that did not work.2. Performance. Not only is this machine much louder than the old one it's far less effective. My original machine blended a smoothie in about 60 seconds. This one takes three to four times as long and I often need to scrape the sides to get everything blended, adjusting speed from medium to high and back again.3. Quality. As noted in the attached photos, the carafe is already broken. I have been using the machine for less than 6 months. That is simply unacceptable.We have several ninja products in my household. This is the first one that has left me so disappointed. I regret buying it. Unfortunately, because of my faith in the company I threw out the warranty information so any recompense from ninja is unlikely.I do not recommend the purchase of this blender."
"Purchased the blender 18 months ago.  Used it only on the easiest of tasks - i.g. making milkshakes and making oatmeal pancakes.  Motor and base are still working fine, but the plastic jar has completely fallen apart - parts literally broke off making the blender unusable.  Getting a replacement jar costs $5 more than the blender, so you have to replace the whole thing.  Feeling very unhappy about this, especially since I had recommended this blender to others.  When it's in one piece, it's great.  When it's not, it's useless."
The product description states it is made of glass and plastic. The entire blender is plastic.
"I am very impressed with the blender itself - lightweight, slim profile, powerful - but I am disappointed that I was sent the wrong size pitcher, which is a smaller 64 ounce capacity, rather than that 72 ounce that I ordered. I have removed two stars for this. It would be more trouble than I'd like, to send the whole blender back, just to risk getting the wrong size sent a second time. Other customers have had this issue, with receiving the wrong size pitcher as well."
"No matter which speed I hit, I get the same speed (full)."
"All I wanted to do is liquify frozen strawberries to make smoothies or thick treats like the frosties at Wendy's. I've used it twice and had pieces too big for the straw. I do like how you can just pull the blade assembly right out for easy pouring. The overall machine itself is, in my opinion, too big. It's way bigger than my other blender. If I would have seen this in a store, wouldn't have bought it because of the size."
"The plastic pitcher keeps breaking after about a year. I use the blender twice a day for hot and cold smoothies. Is it maybe too much use? Is it the cold/hot alternation that weakens the plastic? Maybe. But why does the pitcher cost ($80) as much as the brand-new blender? And it is not just opportunistic third-party sellers. It is from Ninja itself! They know the pitcher will degrade soon enough, and that's where they make more money. I will avoid Ninja from now on and get my hands on other brands with glass pitchers, or I will be mindful of the pitcher cost as individual parts in case it breaks. 2/5 stars.`"
"I hmmed and hawed about buying this. I'd had a Ninja blender before that I had won on a talk show of all things. Since it was free, I didn't complain. I even cut my thumb on the blade once while cleaning it, which required 5 stitches. But I chalked that up to being my own fault, however, I vowed never again to buy a Ninja blender. Well, after 4-5 years, the motor gave out and I was back looking for a blender.I ended up purchasing Ninja again because a. Vitamix was triple the price and b. I had some Amazon gift cards to use towards it. I thought the blender may have improved over the years and I liked that it had the one-serve attachment.Well, I am almost 6 months in and I regret this purchase. It has the same wicked blade attachment and same awkward installation. The same method of chopping- not really blending- so it ends up being somewhat of a coarse mixture when blending anything that had any sort of texture to begin with. Even strawberries stay lumpy. I hate how you must remove that wicked dangerous blade with your fingers!! and if I find I need to blend more, which I almost always do with this blender, I have to pour it all out into another container, rinse, and start over in order to re-insert the dad-blamed blade apparatus.The lid is crazy-making. It only works when on a certain way, with the ""pin"", I get it, safety, but when storing this monstrosity, it never wants to close when on the vessel, so you are left to store each component separately: a. a huge, heavy platform with a cord that has no way to wind neatly, b. that deadly blade, c. a cover with a flap open and won't go back on top of the vessel. This results in the 5-inch deadly blade rattling around in some cabinet ready to fall out and slice anyone unfortunate enough to be within striking distance.To say I hate this blender with a passion is an understatement. It doesn't even blend well. Forget about smooth sauces and purees. Ain't gonna happen. And it didn't even come with a chopper attachment- I have a separate mini Cuisinart for that. So a cabinet full of half-useful, dangerous, and heavy/awkward appliances- I still have my old Oster and I'm really thinking of chucking this for that one- it actually made blended smoothies far better than this Ninja.If you are considering this, keep looking."
"Not bad, not the best"
"I purchased this back in late 2016.  So at current date it's about 20 months old (give or take).  The machine has worked beautifully for about the first year.  I use it, on average 2 or 3 times a week to blend smoothies.  So mostly cutting up fruits and ice together along with other semi-liquids - peanut butter, etc.  So not a significant chore and I'll say the blender cruises through the material today as good as it did during day one.  A couple things I'll point out at this point that keep me from being above 3 stars.The pitcher is not scratch resistant.  This is relevant to cleaning.  If you use an abrasive cleaning utensil (rough side of a sponge, etc.) it will leave the glass looking foggy.  Not a huge deal, but certainly makes an otherwise new pitcher look aged quickly.  I used the dishwasher for the pitcher, blades, and top 90% of the time.  This may be counter to what the manufacturer recommends, but for real life, I just don't think it reasonable not to use a dishwasher on a pitcher for an appliance.The bigger problem with the machine has been the durability of the pitcher and associated lid / latching mechanism.  Over the past number of months I noticed the black outer part of the handle on the pitcher was coming apart from the clear acrylic portion of the underside of the handle.  I figured it wasn't a big deal, just kind of annoying.  Perhaps it's due to the multiple dishwasher cycles (hot water / heated dry) - I'm not sure.  This became a real problem recently when the part separated enough that the lit would not fit down properly to engaged the safety switch that runs up the handle due to the handle separating.  Instead the two plastic pieces (the lid latch and the separated handle) came into contact, preventing the lid latch from making contact with the lock mechanism that runs up through the handle.I was surprised/disappointed to find that this year warranty is expired (and I've seen numerous reports that the pitcher isn't covered anyway, completely) and the cost of a new pitcher is within about $10 of what I paid almost 2 years ago for the entire unit.  I think I'll be more discriminating in the next blender I buy, and not sure I'd trust in Ninja for the next purchase.  When dropping the kind of money they expect for these, I'd hope for at least 3-5 years of usability.  In full disclosure I didn't call the company to complain or ask for a new lid.  I may later, but for now I made a temporary fix myself that will get me through for a little while longer I hope.  This entailed very intensive craftsmanship made up of zip ties to bind the handle back together and a dremel tool to zip off the hanging lip of the lid latch to prevent it from hitting the handle.  (Even with the handle zip tied together, I couldn't get enough pressure to prevent contact).  I've attached pictures to indicate what the issue was and my rudimentary (but effective, for now) patch job."
"OVERALL: A solid blender that unfortunately requires a lot of hassle to create a smoothie - without that hassle, you end up with froth rather than smoothies.THere's a lot to like about this blender:motor seems solidvery easy to clean with the way the spindle holding the blades comes right out of the jug.AWESOME pour feature in lid - why don't all blender lids have this?pulse mode plus three speeds - all manual (no timed settings)WHY NOT BUY RECOMMEND THISTHe challenge - and why i would not buy this model again - is that its very different blade configuration seems to create more froth than smooth smoothies.THE BLADES: There are two sets of blades on a spindle that sits in the middle of the jug.THe typical bottom of jug blades, but then an additional set half way up the spindle that reach about the middle of the jug.FROTH RATHER THAN LIQUID (TOO MUCH AIR)In making a smoothie - with frozen and fresh ingredients - liquid of choice - any protein/supplement powders (or not),what seems to happen is that if you spin this up long and hard enough to get all the bits shredded into a smoothie-like state, what ends up happening is that so much air is also brought in that you get mainly froth. Like what you would spoon on top of something, rather than drink.To make this blender work, i would have to do two spins:1) spin one: add all the solid bits and a bit of liquid, then spin these into blended state - almost a paste2) spin two: add the liquid to get to a drinkable level and carefully spin in the liquid on low cautious not to over do it and go quickly from more or less smooth to froth.This two part approach worked - sort of - buta) was a hassle andb) still did not get the fruit/veg to what you get with a regular blender.I'm guessing the dual blade approach is the issue in terms of creating more form/froth than smooth liquid - as having used a variety of blenders this froth issue is not anything i've encountered. WHo wants to put this much attention into monitoring a blender?If your requirement is to make snow from ice - like a lot and all the time - this is an awesome device. But if your focus is smoothies, this thing may be too intrigued for its own good - unless perhaps you like froth? and like to do your smoothies with a spoon?But in terms of a bog standard smoothie, this is alas a thumbs down.Again - some great features - the removable blades are nice - but the best thing is this lid that lifts up from the corner so you can pour without having to take the lid off and have that drip all over the place like any other blender. This feature is fantastic for testing if the drink is blended enough, needs any flavour adjusting. But alas, the lid greatness doesn't make up for the problems with the reason for this thing in the first place - at least in my experience with it."
"I am so disappointed with this blender. Whether it's soup or a smoothie, this blender adds so much air to the mixture that everything comes out foamy. For example, I sometimes make my kids a simple banana ""shake."" It's just milk, a few ice cubes, and banana. Even if I blend it the absolute minimum (just enough to crush the (maybe 3) ice cubes in it, it comes out so foamy that's it doubles in volume with every glass giving you a mouthful of foam (except maybe the bottom inch of the glass)."
"Product works well, but seems to easily fall apart overtime. Began leaking, seal of the lid tore and plastic connection between the lid and the picture broke. Blender wasn’t used that often and was carefully washed. Just thought it would’ve held up better given its cost."
"This thang so loud. I’m sure my neighbors are mad asf ! It does an amazing job though, but super loud. No doubt about it. It’s literally a food processor, blender, and everything. Suction cup feet. Everything perfect. Just loud as hell."
"Worked okay for most blending, like soups and stuff. But for frozen smoothies in the smaller cups it was terrible. Then the handle snapped apart in the dishwasher after two years of getting used maybe a few dozen times."
"I've had this unit for just over 2 years now, however, in just under 2 years, I noticed a small crack at the bottom of the plastic pitcher.  I've read other reviews where people have cautioned about the cheaply made plastic pitcher.  Naturally, we look at the overall reviews and we still buy it, or don't believe other people.  Well, there is now a small crack in ours and when I make drinks in this thing, a drop here or there will leak out of it.  I'm sure it'll get worse.  The funny part is that I haven't by any means used this very much.  If these guys sold replacement pitchers for $20, then it might not be so bad, but they don't.  Checkout the prices for replacements, at least here on Amazon, then if you believe me and some of the other reviewers, decide if it's worth it to buy this unit and when the cheap plastic pitcher cracks, have to pay almost the same price as the entire unit for a replacement picture.But if you think about it, it's pretty brilliant.  Sell the entire unit for (currently) $119 with a cheap plastic pitcher, and then sell replacements for not too far from the same price."
"After 2 weeks an essential plastic piece broke, bad design. Register your product ASAP, they replaced it immediately. I liked my Ninja Nutri Pro better."
"This was a replacement for old Ninja, that finally died after multiple daily uses, for 7 years. This new one, while it looks the same, most DEFINITELY does NOT perform as well, as my old one. I think they tampered with the motor, and made it different since making these new ones. Now, when I turn it on to mix my protein shake, it starts smoking very easily and quickly, and smells like the motor is burning up. I am not overloading it. Its just ice, almond milk and a scoop of powder. A 1100 watt motor should handle that with ease, but this struggles. I have ZERO doubts, that this product will last more than a year or two. So, sadly, I don't recommend it. I would just save the money, and purchase a Vitamix. It may be more expensive, but in the end, it will last many more years than this puppy. I do like that you get additional cups with this model, as they can be upwards of $20 each. The problem lies in the motor of the base. Also, the little rubber ""nubs"" that are down inside the base of this, tend to just pop out for no good reason. I would look down, snd they would be missing. I finally just super glued them back into the base. You can use it without them, but you risk moisture and liquid getting into the internal compartment where the actual motor is. It can also strip the grooves in the blender cups. As a user of this product for over 12 years, I recommend to people, NOT putting the blender cups in the dishwasher. The heat breaks down the plastic, snd causes it split, as well as it will warp the opening of the cups and then the blade attachment will not fit properly, and they will start leaking everywhere when you turn the blender on. If you are only a casual user of this product, this item will be fine for you. However, if you are a heavy user, like myself, where you blend shakes at least 2x a day, every single day, save your $$. It is extremely convenient having the to go cups w/blender attachment. And I have yet to find another blender that can blend to the perfect consistency that i enjoy, which is no slivers of ice, etc. Bottom line, it appears that the actual Ninja company has started cutting corners during the manufacturing of these models, or either has re-outsourced them to someone different and they are made more cheaply on the inside."
it seems to be a common issue that the pitcher will most likely crack eventually when ice is addedthe powerful torque or the motor slams the ice into the sides hard enough to crack it and this seems to be a common problem.called sharkninja they  replaced it but  costs 15$ for shipping and now the new one has a hairline crack in it not leaking yet but will likely start soon
"I LIKE IT BUT WHEN I PLACE THE SMALL CUP, I HAVE TO PRESS BUTTON TO BLEND UNTIL IM DONE"
"First, I should note how I use blenders. I use one every single day to make smoothie bowls or shakes for breakfast and sometimes for sauces and blended soups ... and the occasional frozen cocktail. I'm gentle with my appliances and never put anything in a blender that would cause it to work too hard. The only solid things I ever put in it are frozen fruits (always in small chunks), and occasionally some ice - pre-crushed by my refrigerator's ice dispenser - and always with adequate liquids to keep things moving smoothly.Now that you know my typical use, I can explain why I will never purchase another Ninja product again. This is the second Ninja blender I've wasted my money on in the span of two years. The first one (a different model) broke between the base and the blade assembly. The motor ran, and the drive stud would spin, but the blades didn't.  That happened within 9 months of using it. I returned that to Costco (and got a refund, thank God) and did my research and, against my own better judgment, bought this one. After LESS than a year of use, this one also broke. One day it just decided it randomly didn't want to spin anymore. I'd push the buttons and all I'd hear is a click - no motor spinning. This would happen intermittently, but more often than not. I contacted Customer Service at Ninja and told them about the issue. They had me video chat with them and show them what was going on. Of course, during the chat, it worked fine. They offered to send me a new blade assembly. I told them I didn't think that would fix the problem, but they said it would be the first step in fixing the issue and sent it to me anyway. Ok, fine. When the new assembly showed up, I attached it and, sure enough, the blender still didn't work. Surprise, surprise! (giant eyeroll). By this time, the blender had completely stopped working. I called to tell them it still was not working and video chatted again, this time showing the clicking/not spinning. I said I thought the problem was most likely an issue with the base and asked if they could send me a replacement. Because they sent the assembly to me ""for free,"" they told me that sending a new base would require me to pay the shipping price of $20. Ummm.... that's 1/4 the price of a whole new blender!! AND IT WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY. Because of my first experience with a Ninja blender, I purchased the Amazon extended warranty when I bought this one. Sadly, because I reported this issue while the blender was still under Ninja's warranty, Amazon's warranty would not cover the defect. Live and learn, people. Live and learn.Needless to say, I stopped purchasing these cheap garbage blenders from Ninja and splurged on a Vitamix instead. Don't waste your money on Ninja crap, folks. Save up and get a blender that lasts more than a few months and from a company that offers a warranty with no out-of-pocket costs.Side note: I never once used the blender carafe - only the two individual serving cups that the blender came with. When I pulled the carafe out of my cabinet to donate to GoodWill because it had never been used, I noticed it was cracked at the bottom where the blade assembly is, so it probably would have leaked if I'd used it. It still had the tape on it from shipping, it was still brand new, but it was cracked. Horrible, horrible QA at Ninja. So that went into the trash, too.  Look at photos from other reviews and you'll see that cracked carafes are a recurring issue."
"Comes with a 1 year warranty and mine cracked on the bottom after 1 year and a couple of days.Overall I've liked the blender and gotten a lot of use out of it. The design makes it a little difficult to load things like spinach without it jamming in big clumps part-way down the blender. The blades can sometimes fall out while cleaning or pouring, and the lid's spout stops staying propped open after a while. And you need to be careful handling the blades, of course. But it works well and has good capacity, so I'd buy it again, I'm just not happy with the lifespan on this one."
"After some research, bought this to replace an ancient Hamilton Beach blender that I inherited from my parents which finally died after probably nearly 50 years. Good luck finding anything that lasts that long... but I digress. The blender looks nice, it came with a 64 oz container, not 72 like the description, but it's enough. It is probably 72 oz if filled to the very top, but 64 oz is the top line for measure.Power seems a little anemic. Certainly less than I was expecting after so many glowing reviews. Smoothies turn out okay but only after running it for longer than it seemed necessary. Certainly longer than my old Hamilton Beach.It has a complex lid with the standard ""protect us from ourselves"" safety features which keeps the blender from turning on if the lid is not completely closed and locked. The plastic does not feel very high quality and how long it will last before breaking and rendering the entire blender inoperable remains to be seen. Despite ""locking"" It unfortunately does not seal from leaking. Even when locked, stuff will still seep past the spout (which also has a lid) if full and on high power. The complicated lid is also hard to clean. Lots of nooks and crannies. The multi-level blades are also a little harder to clean for the same reason.So, it's okay but not great. I unfortunately don't hate it enough to return it. It's doing the job, but I think there are probably better blenders for less money, or one more worthy of the higher price. Your mileage may vary..."
"First off, be extremely careful when unpackaging and assembling. I reached in the box to start taking pieces out and I didn't see that the blade was not covered at all. It sliced the top of my hand down to the tendon. I was afraid to touch it for a week after that, but once I got around to it it was very easy to put together.I ended up returning it because it didn't blend my smoothies ""fine"" enough. I use spinach, kale and ginger, and no matter how long I blended there were still large chunks of leaves and ginger."
Purchased in Aug last year. I use it 2-3x per week. It recently started leaking on the bottom. I bought a replacement pitcher and that one was cracked on the bottom. Do a little research and find out it is a common problem with these pitchers. The question is how long will it last before it starts leaking. It’s also super noisy.
"I guess the jokes on me because I didn't really check but I expected a blender that calls itself ""professional grade"" to have a pitcher made of glass not plastic. I thought I would upgrade my blender because I use mine every morning to make my nutrition shake and thought this would be a no brainer but the blender I already own which was half the price is made from glass which is definitely what I prefer and will continue to use. This honestly blends way better but i feel like it's a cheap toy having a pitcher made from plastic. I'm sure that I'm not the only person who feels this way."
"I was very excited to get this blender, thinking it would be an awesome purchase.  In the beginning it was.  I've had the blender now for about 11 months.Something odd happened right after purchasing where the pitcher developed a crack in the dishwasher.  I didn't think much about it, and we received a replacement pitcher.Just recently the lid has stopped staying locked.  One of the features I loved was being able to put the lid on and walk away to do other things while my smoothie was processed.  Now I have to stand at the blender and hold the lid onto the pitcher (otherwise it stops spinning).  I contacted customer service and the only response I got was to buy a new pitcher/lid.  The blender was about $110 and the pitcher is $65.  I will now be looking for a new blender, hopefully one that doesn't fail after less than a year of use."
"This is a good blender, definitely better than my previous one.  However, I purchased this in November, and periodically, it is making a really loud grinding noise.  Some days there are no issues, but most other days, it makes this very loud sound.  Not sure what that is all about.  That is why I changed my rating from 5 stars to 3 stars.  Other than that, it blends really well.  Gets the job done and easy to clean."
"I thought with the brand name and the extra attachments that this would be a perfect smoothie maker, but the cup attachments don’t really work. It does not have enough power to blend with the cup attachments attached.  It’s just a plain old blender, nothing special. I do make excellent ice cream shakes though."
"Pros and Cons of this blender:Pros:1) Blends great in a short time.2) Holds a large quantity - 64 ounces (8 cups).3) Fairly quiet operation compared to other blenders.Cons:1) Lots of places food can get trapped.  Not very easy to clean in those tight spaces.  Especially the end of the blade shaft.  There's no way to clean up in there - I even tried a toothbrush.2) shaft has three sets of blades on it.  They are very, very sharp. There's no easy way to hold the shaft and clean the blades.  I'm here updating my review and have been cut three times.  Tonight I got cut pretty bad trying to wash this thing.  You can put it in the dishwasher but I don't run the dishwasher every day and if you wash this by hand, I promise you will eventually cut yourself no matter how careful you are.3) Instructions say it's not suitable for making hot soup.  I used my previous blender for making hot soup and now I have to buy a second blender for that purpose.  I wish I'd known before I bought this one."
"Its really powerfull, I have not used it a lot, but it seems that I am going to like it. But it came broken. As soon as I took it out of the box, I noticed the rubber on the lid is torn. Ninja will replace it, but I had to pay usd 15 for shipping - a new one on amazon costs usd 23...Considering this, I am not so sure about the product quality/durability."
"I recently switched to a vegan diet/lifestyle for health reasons and needed a powerful blender to make my own salad dressings (no oil!) and other sauces. Smoothies too. I was excited to get this new Ninja blender, but I soon noticed that my smoothies, no matter how long I blended them, still had chunks of dates or strawberries. I couldn't get my sauces silky smooth. I broke down and got a Vitamix, since the blender is so important in my daily life. That does MUCH better at making smoothies smooth and sauces smooth. My salad dressing no longer has chunks of walnuts at the bottom. This Ninja blender is fine if you need stuff mostly smooth but still a little chunky. Avoid it if you're looking for a more uniform, smooth consistency in your liquids. (Yes the Vitamix is much more expensive, but it's worth it, IMO.)"
I had this Ninja BL660 Professional Blender previously and it worked really good for a very long without any issues. With the same hopes and experience i bought this product. I felt this is may be a faulty product It only worked once and then it didn't start. So I returned it.
"When I first laid eyes on this slick blender (inspired by the Fruit Ninja iPad game?) my attention was immediately drawn to its impressive blade armament. Imagining that they were like mini Katanas I envisioned my morning fruit smoothie being completely destroyed by a whirlwind of miniature ninjas inside. As I came out of my daydream, realizing that the ice cube video had long ended, my mouse pointer darted adeptly and swiftly for the ""buy now"" button while a ""HIYA!"" inexplicably left my lips.Since we've had some package thefts in the past I then proceeded to monitor tracking information and swooped in on the delivery the moment it arrived without the mailman even noticing my presence. The Ninja blender took almost no time to setup, and it looks just as slick as in the advertisements. I did notice the additional safety feature of a locking lid that must be in place for the blender to turn on. This made sense for this blender, since you would not want the mini ninjas to confuse your fingers with the enemy (the fruit).And... to get me in the mood for christening our new Ninja blender, I played a few rounds of Fruit Ninja to create a mind meld with the creators of this beautiful product and get connected with its roots.Then came the test... a frozen banana, blueberry, strawberry, and date smoothie with some flax seed and kale (if you're wondering why dates, just try them in your smoothie, they are awesome, and have a ton of health benefits) + water.So the first thing that happened was interesting. The blades seemed to sort of ""whack"" the frozen banana and chop it into slices, which then proceeded to violently collide with the walls of the blender. For a moment I thought it would crack the blender walls so I turned off the blender and proceeded to cautiously use the ""pulse"" feature to see if I could sort of manually hit the slices of banana (which would probably be great for making banana chips, future note), as they slid down the sides of the blender. This seemed to work. So after a bit of that I turned the blender on high for a while and let it go, and it seemed that everything had been successfully blended so I poured myself a drink.However, it turned out that after all that, the dates had not been blended, but were merely chopped into chunks... Needless to say, after all the anticipation, and seeing all those blades from top to bottom, I was disappointed. How could this blender with all its blades not blend the dates??So I spent some time meditating on the experience in a bamboo garden and I realized something. Ninjas are, at the heart of it, highly trained to do two things. One, ninjas slice their targets, and two, ninjas chop their targets... however Ninjas, generally speaking (AFAIK), are not optimized for blending their targets. If you think about it it makes sense because that would be really inefficient since that target was probably neutralized long before reaching a state of ""blended"".So, in a sense, this product sort of perfectly does what Ninjas do... but unfortunately, that's not the function of a blender. Also, the blade array is harder to clean (safely) than the small ones in run-of-the-mill blenders, and not being able to open the lid to add stuff while the blender get pretty inconvenient over time. So anyway, major points for beauty and innovation, but at the end of the day, you really want your blender to blend (and clean easily if you use it on a daily basis)."
"The coupling point of the transmission and the blade in the pitcher started getting stripped and now it has less torque to actually blend, on top of making a grinding noise when its on. Apparently frozen strawberries are too much for this ""professional"" blender. Plastic trash, would not buy again."
"I was between a 2-3 for this.  The product works great for everything except what I purchased it for.  I needed something to handle frozen fruit and it didn't.  It only blended everything on the bottom.  I even tried adding more water, just to try and help and it was useless.  I ended up emptying the whole contents and blending it up in four small separate batches.  Not what it described as being able to handle.  Highly disappointed for a Ninja product."
"Buyer beware of the ""warranty"" and of how Ninja renege on their customers, denigrating their brand in the process.I bought this Ninja blender on May 26th, 2023. On September 10th - 107 days after purchase - the blender broke as the plastic plate came detached from the bottom of the blade assembly whilst I was using it. (attached picture)When I called Ninja, the representative explained that the blender jug and blade are not warrantied and that any damage like mine is considered ""wear and tear"" by Ninja. They would not replace it but would sell me a replacement blender pitcher and blade for $64.95 + $15 = $80.90 total.I strongly complained about this and the company eventually backed down, but they explained that this was a ""one time exception. Had they not acquiesced they'd have been quite happy to not stand by their product and make another sale, leaving me with an unusable product unless I spent near the total renewal cost to replace the blender pitcher and blade. Someone with less of a tendency to push back would get a rough deal from Ninja.I bought a blender, not a motor assembly. Any company that cannot stand by its product for the normal, home use that the product was intended for, is both 1) a crap company and 2) needs to check on the quality of its products, the components used and its manufacturing processes.Were this product purchased in many EU countries this practice would not be allowed because the product (a blender, not a blender base) needs to be of merchantable quality for the purpose for which it was intended, i.e. blending.The accountants at the firm would be well advised to pull up a spreadsheet and run the numbers of properly honoring their products with decent warranties. If the percentage of such claims is high, Ninja has a terrible product and they need to redesign it. If it's low, factoring in the small additional cost or making less profit will pay dividends. Small electronics margins are tight, I realize, but Ninja needs to find a way to do the right thing.This type of corporate behavior eventually ends up fostering such ill will in its customer base that no manner of social media posts will fix it and the brand will suffer a steady, incremental degradation."
"Purchased from Amazon to replace 12 year old KitchenAid blender.  Reviews on the Ninja blenders were quite mixed, as are most reviews on Amazon.  People seemed to love them or hate them but the balance of reviews seemed positive.  The price for the unit seemed quite reasonable.  Machine was used generally once daily to blend a few ice cubes with some greens, fruit and a protein powder supplement.  It is certainly powerful and can turn ice into fine snow in seconds.  It does not make extra-smooth ""smoothies"" as the 3 levels of very sharp blades seem to go as far as dicing up the greens into very fine grit evenly spread throughout the drink. The old KitchenAide machine did better with the blade at the bottom of the pitcher creating a vortex and creating a smoother blend.  I'd have been okay with this as I'm not bothered by a mild degree of grittiness.  The reason I returned the machine and received a refund from Amazon is because of a noticeable squeal after the first few weeks of use.  The machine is easy enough to clean and it was kept meticulously clean after each use with a drop of dish soap in water/spin/rinse/wipe dry.  Despite this the machine developed a louder screech upon start up and shut down. The motor base seemed to have excessive resistance when turning by hand, making the same sound.  Also the spindle in the pitcher seemed to not spin as freely as it should.  While the machine continued to work at the time i returned it, I felt dubious that this machine was going to hold up for very long."
"This ninja works like a charm, it is extremely powerful and But when cleaning or handling the blade beware you will get cut. I was hospitalized and had to get my finger glued shut from a cut from this blade twice . It cuts very deeply . The first timeThe blade slid out of the blender while rinsing and I tried to pick it up the second time it was in my dish rack when I brushed passed it and cut myself. Watch out."
The product was strach bad on the outside ofthe blender.but was mostly unhappy with Amazon they made me wait thirty whole days before I can get my money back because went I sent it back it gotten caught up some a here so t hey made be wait to get my refund whish was over a hundred dollars would they wait a month to. Collect that from us .no no Mon e y no sale. .shame on Amazon
The way blender was designed to make product work was a little to confusing fat least for me. I had. BlendTec for years that I prefer.
I’ve been drinking veggie fruit smoothies every morning for years. I’ve never had a machine that left kale crunching in my mouth. It’s weird. It semi-liquifies most of what I put in but there’s always crunching involved after three cycles on high. The blades are super sharp but somehow the veggies at the top don’t get pulled down. I have to start and stop until I can get everything pushed under the top blade.  It also has suction cups on the bottom so forget about shoving it under overhead kitchen cabinets. I hate to say it but I was happier with a cheap Oster blender. I’m still chewing on my smoothie as a write this.
"This was advertised as glass, it is not. It works as it should, just not a mind blowing difference from my Hamilton beach one I’ve had for 20 years! (It has a glass pitcher too)"
"I first bought this blender in June 2017 (for $100) and used it to make a smoothie and it did the job well! I used yogurt, jello, dry oats, blueberries, bananas, kiwi, mango, and carrots with honey and everything came out with no pulp. I cannot comment on the noise level as this was such a long time ago, but in general I recommend wearing ear protection around blenders, lawnmowers, vacuums and more anyway. Also when I took out the blades to clean them they were sharp enough that a cut seemed but a hair away! I may one day use the blender again but it certainly made for a great first impression. Overall the “Ninja Professional Blender (BL610)” gets a serviceable 3/5 stars!"
Bought this less than a year ago after thinking that I found an ideal blender. Have only used it a handful of times since owning it and it has a crack in it. Blends really well but now I have to find another blender which is a little frustrating
"After I unboxed it and looked at it, I realized it was some thing that did not appeal to me. It was large and bulky. It only has three buttons, and it’s heavy even though it’s plastic. That was another thing that bothered me I would rather of had glass I’m not that fond of plastic for the money it really might not have been worth it. I used it one time and it was kind of complicated to get it to work. You have to be real careful that the top is tight, and there were instructions that I wanted to leave on the top of the lid and obviously they interfered with a locking Mechanism. I made eggnog and I use the low speed. It seem to work great but it’s just so plain I don’t know if I want it in my kitchen. I’ll use it one more time but I am thinking of returning it I’m not pleased with it. It’s not a bad machine, but it looks like it’s something for a little kid, I should’ve known that the word “Ninja” was not going to give me the most sophisticated kitchen device. So I guess it was my fault for purchasing it. I wanted something more sophisticated that had more uses and more attachments, they said nothing so it has so many blades if you want to do less for your different mixes you can’t switch out there’s only one blade device which is a set of five blades. The blender operated as advertised. It’s just that once I got it so how big and bulky it was, I knew I wouldn’t like it. It really takes a lot of room up on your countertop. And it’s not something pretty and sophisticated that you would be proud to display like you see on the different kitchen shows. That is what I’m looking for. It’s really a plain Jane device but it does work well."
"I HATE this blender. It is REVOLTING. When you wash the lid in the dishwasher, dirty dish water somehow gets stuck in some invisible crevices in the lid (who designs a lid this way?! how did this not get caught in the testing phase before the product was released?!), so you either have to air dry it (and make sure to tip it up on its side to let the nasty water drain out, knowing that you're just drying the dirty dish water into a filthy film inside the lid), or you have to be ok with having dirty dish water come pouring out of the crevices of the lid when you pour your smoothie or whatever you've blended. Also, somehow old food has gotten inside the handle, and it's impossible to get out, so enjoy watching your old food scraps rot before your eyes over time inside the clear plastic of the handle. Time to break down and get a Vitamix."
"Just switched from a nutribullet, thinking this would be better. The single serves are smaller than the nutri bullet, so I have to mix in the pitcher. That and I still have big chucks of spinach after mixing for a quite a while. Doesn’t blend as well as my nutri bullet."
"The container wouldn’t go far enough down on the base to twist and lock. Upon further inspection, I noticed that  drive gears were lose and not screwed (twisted) on all the way, preventing the container from properly seating on the base. I tightened both gears, and it seems to function fine now. I can only imagine how many people didn’t figure this out and returned the blender."
As Described
"Wanted to love this, and liked it a lot for a few months. I bought 1 for home and 1 for a rental property. They both ended up cracking on the underside of the pitcher around the spinning part, exact same thing, right after the warranty expired. It's common on reddit and other Ninja reviews too, the pitcher can't handle the power of the spinning blades and the plastic cracks and radiates out, and your margaritas leak onto the base, the table, the counter, everywhere. Happened twice exact same way. Sorry my Ninja it did not work out."
I was so excited about this purchase because I have several ninja brand kitchen appliances I love. However this blender couldn’t have disappointed me more. It’s as good as your typical 20 dollar blender. I would say I make pretty generic smoothies - just with frozen fruits and some leafy greens. Anytime I blended kale or spinach little particles would remain- same goes for seeds like strawberry or chai. Also the blade doesn’t reach the top and it has a difficult time powering ingredients down so you have to constantly open and push ingredients down towards the blade.On top of all that- the lid wasn’t closing so now it won’t even work.I never ever ever write reviews - in fact this is probably my first one. Do NOT waste your money on this!!!
"I love this blender, EXCEPT this is the 2nd pitcher that cracked and caused it to leak. Apparently, they only warranty the pitcher part for 90 days. I had it for 7 weeks and it cracked!!!!"
I have loved all of my ninja appliances. This blender is the exception.  The pitcher is plastic and does not just sit on the base. You have to line everything up correctly and then click it into place.
"I purchased this blender after my old Ninja finally died after about a decade. I assumed the product was still of equally high quality. I was wrong. Three months after purchasing it, liquid has started leaking out of the bottom of the blender with every use. The lid of the blender stopped staying closed, and then just this morning, a piece of it broke off entirely. I reviewed the warranty information, and while one exists, the company makes it so that it is not worth  your time or energy to use it. You have to pay to ship them the blender. They recommend insuring the package just in case. Then, if they decide it is defective, you have to include a check for $20 in that package to pay for them to ship you a new one. At this point, I will have spent half the cost of the blender in shipping alone, and god knows how long the whole process will take. I'm very disappointed and will not be purchasing another Ninja product in the future."
"Has a very distinctive smell of cheap electronics overheating while it runs. Smells like burning phenolic. Still working for now, but not very confidence inspiring."
The blender is great however my credit card has been charged multiple times for this item.
"Worked great for eleven months then the base just stopped working. Had to buy a whole new one.It works well I just would have thought it would have lasted longer with the 'professional' label. how many professional establishments would be happy with using a blender once per day and having it die in under a year? not many i should think...also beware when making smoothies because it will very quickly start to leave scorch marks on the counter. seems sort of dangerous but, hey ho."
"I got this item to replace my old blender that I purchased at wal-mart. My main purpose for blending is for smoothies in the morning (yogurt, greens and berries) and for making salad dressing or other cooking liquids.First off, you'll notice that the blades in this blender run all the way up the middle of the unit. They are VERY, VERY sharp. I scratched the side of the pitcher the very first time I took them out just trying to clean the unit. The blades also just ""sit"" into the unit, being secured by the lid before the blending can start (and it will tell you if the lid or the pitcher unit are not on correctly).This thing shreds through anything you'll give it. Frozen berries, whole cups of greens at a time, or even lots of ice. Once things get to be cut up though, I've found that the blender has a hard time really ""blending"" though. For instance, it's great at chopping up berries and greens for a smoothie, but sometimes the smoothies come out very thick, and still with big pieces of greens that haven't been cut, even after leaving the blender on for 45 - 60 seconds. With a blender this powerful, I don't think that should be necessary.Also, this blender will sometimes become much louder in the middle of the blending process, and the first few times I thought something was wrong, or that the blender was having issues and was going to break. I'm still not sure what the issue is, because it does not do it every time it's blending, and the time period for when it starts to become so much louder varies every time it happens.Lastly, the two smaller travel-sized blender cups are very nice and convenient. They don't hold enough volume for me to make my breakfast smoothies with, so I have to use the full-sized pitcher, but for salad dressing or other uses (like shakes or individual margaritas), they are very nice and easy to use.3/5 stars for some of the issues I've mentioned above. It's still light years above anything I've ever used, but for the price it seems to have some flaws."
"It might be that the pitcher isn't as dishwasher safe as advertised. The handle has started to separate from the top of the pitcher and the lid safety tab is now unusable. The whole design of that safety mechanism should be rethought. To purchase just a pitcher is almost as much as a new blender. On the plus side, the blender is very powerful."
"This is my second ninja blender. The first I had for 4 years and used almost daily. I recently ordered this one. Within 1 month a tiny part responsible for “clicking” into the base broke off. Unfortunately this mini-plastic part is responsible for tripping the mechanism that allows the base to start. Without this part, you cannot start the machine. I have had to rig the base with paper towels and packing tape. The base also leaks. I am making simple smoothies with water, protein powder, spinach and ice - not using a ton of tough ingredients. To top it off - the lid broke this week when a spring popped off! Now it won’t close and the blender is useless! I am just shocked that I’ve had this unit for 6 weeks and it’s completely broken in 3 places. Very disappointed! Going to contact ninja and see if they will resolve this issue. I will update my review if they do! I know sometimes there are lemons out there."
"This has great blending power. But, our lid and pitcher broke in less than a year from normal every day use. The replacement pitcher/lid cost as much as I paid for this blender. Very disappointing."
"This blender wasn't bad out of the box - lots of power - although the blade config and the square shape jar caused partially ground items to accumulate in the 'corners' of the jar.  In order to get a fully blended smoothie, I always would have to stop the blender part way through, and then use a wooden spoon to push this 'corner accumulation' back down to the rest of the mix.  It would eventually blend quite well due to the power, but this is a moderate annoyance.Btw, I don't know why they chose a square jar with obviously circular rotating blades.  Didn't they play that round peg / square hole game as children??So why the 1-star?  Well it has to do with the single serve jars, which I used to blend coffee drinks.  These are poorly made, and the top would frequently pop off when you insert it into the base - and given that this is an 'upside down' jar design, when the top pops off, everything pours out directly into the blender base (!)It happened several times, but I managed to stop it from dumping the entire cup of coffee, partially because the jar top didn't pop off fully.  Today however, despite my securely screwing down the jar top (with blades), when I inserted it into the base, the who l top popped off COMPLETELY, dumping 12 ozs of coffee/butter into the blender.Now it won't even turn on.  And my 1-month return policy expired TWO DAYS AGO!  How about that?!?How do I get a replacement for this poorly-designed and constructed unit that broke on me due to no fault of my own after 32 days of use???UPDATE - Apr 19thUpdating to 3 stars as after 24 hrs the blender decided to work again.  Maybe it just needed to dry out.So it seems pretty well built, but the issue with the lid popping off the single serve jar remains - be very careful inserting this jar into the blender or just use the main jar and perhaps you can avoid this problem.And of course the corner accumulation issue remains - kind of a pita, but again the blender eventually blends well with some assistance pushing stuff down.  Wish I didn't have to do this though..."
"I did not like this blender at all. My old one broke and so I figured I'd splurge on this because so many people seem to love it.I think the only thing I liked about it was the size of the pitcher, but then even that was hard to enjoy because the blade takes up so much space in the middle. And due to the size and placement of the blade, it would catch food that I put in and end up not getting blended in at all. I frequently make smoothies with peanut butter, and if you didn't aim just right when you dropped it in, some of it would end up either high up on the wall of the pitcher or the top blade and not even get blended in.  The blade itself isn't secure. Out of habit, the first smoothie I made, I dumped the pitcher completely upside down to get all of it out only for the blade to come tumbling out with it, cutting my finger. So if you're making thick smoothies and want to get all of it out, you either have to take it out or hold one finger on it to keep it from falling out. And my smoothies always ended up with some chunks that didn't get well blended, including ice and whole pieces of spinach.  It was so much more of a pain than it was worth."
The media could not be loaded.
"For some reason, no matter what kind of liquid I use for fruit smoothies (water, oak milk, almond milk, lactose free milk, regular milk, etc), this blender incorporates air into the materials and makes everything very frothy. 2 cups water, a handful of strawberries and a small banana becomes 6 cups of fluff. I still use it to puree vegetables for soups/broths and stuff. I've tried different speeds and it doesn't really matter."
I bought this blender a few weeks ago and after using it for about 4 times i noticed that it started cracking at the bottom of the picture in 3 places and was leaking fluid. Returned it & bought another one thinking it may have been just a fluke. Used the new for a couple of weeks & noticed it leaking again. This time the cracks were worst. Cracked in 5 places. Ninjas are usually great products. Never had one do this before. I only used it to make ice coffee & smoothies. Buyer beware. Purchase at your own risk. I'll never buy this particular product again.
"I purchased the other Ninja set ""master prep pro"" a while ago. I love it, use it a lot, but decided I wanted a tall blender. Of course I picked the Ninja. First of all, look at the price and watts on this!  1,000 watts for soooo much less than the Vitamix.  The newest Vitamix is 2.2 HP (1640 Watts) for over $600! Yikes. Don't get me wrong, they are a great machine, but for those of us who don't need programmable timers, hot soup and ultra silky smooth baby food, this Ninja is the best out there.This does just about everything the high priced one does.  I use this for smoothies, this can take anything you give it and blend it right up. I make frozen fruit yogurts, (add the frozen fruit to fat free yogurt (I use home made almond milk yogurt). I use it for banana ""icecream"". Whip up frozen banana pieces, takes a couple seconds with this, then add peanut butter, chocolate, nuts, whatever you want. (I use Betty Lou's powdered fat free peanut butter).Of course you have to be careful handling the ultra sharp blades. I remove the blade assembly by the tip and set it inside the sink. I continue to hold just the top tip and use a bottle brush to clean the blades. I carefully set it back in the clean blender and let it air dry. It doesn't rust.I also make my own sauces and dressings. The grand kids like the ""snow cones""  this Ninja makes. I use diluted, sugar free Torani, and DaVinci coffee syrups, (brands Amazon carries).I especially like the simplicity of the buttons. Low, medium and high. Full speed and pulse. What more does anyone need?  You just can't get a more powerful, quality blender than this for the price.Update: Well, it did blend the soft frozen fruit (banana, strawberries and blueberries), but I later tried mango and pineapple. Not so good. Chunks no matter how long I blended. I guess it has limitations."
They didn’t make the lids with closures on the spout like other ninja lids leading to spills.
"Older versions were much better, this is not as well made"
I do not like this blender bc of the long extremely sharp blade you must remove each time you use. I cut myself just opening the box!
But it stopped working in less than 6 months…
"This is our 2nd Ninja blender. We also bought ninja air fryer, we just love Ninja brand.  After it arrived we didn’t use it for few months and it stayed packed in the box. Later when we started using it, we noticed something which we didn’t realized for so long.The blender, unfortunately, does not seem to run continuously on its own. In order to keep it operational, I am required to constantly press and hold the power button. This has resulted in a less-than-optimal user experience, as it restricts my ability to multitask in the kitchen and use the blender efficiently.I kindly request your guidance and support in resolving this matter. It is my understanding that the blender should be able to function without the need for continuous manual input. I am unsure if this issue stems from a technical glitch, a misconfiguration, or if there is a specific operational procedure I am unaware of.Could you please provide me with instructions on how to ensure the blender operates seamlessly without the need for constant button pressing? Alternatively, if this appears to be a malfunction, I would greatly appreciate your assistance in arranging a repair or replacement.Your prompt attention to this matter would be highly appreciated. I look forward to your guidance on resolving this issue and enjoying the full benefits of the blender.Thank you for your time and assistance."
"I had a couple major hangups with this blender. On the pro side, it had a plenty powerful motor and the 72 oz pitcher could hold anything I had any interest in blending. However, where the 16oz cups were fine for my standard protein shakes that are based with 8oz water, they were useless for my husband's fresh fruit based smoothies. If you think you're going to use anything more than half a banana, 2 strawberries and half a dozen blueberries with all the usual smoothie things (yogurt, ice, water/milk/protein powder) think again. It didn't even come close to fitting in the 16oz cups. So I see Ninja makes 24oz and 32oz cups. Except they are not compatible with this blender...you have to have the AutoIQ variety blenders for those puppies. So return initiated.My last gripe is literally, the box. Not to be fussy, but if you are going to create packaging that is exact fit, you need to label the compartments how they fit together. I applaud the effort to minimalize packaging, but prepping it for the return felt like I was putting together a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle. Make it easy for us, please. Or, buyer beware, as you take things out of the package, take an extra moment as you unpack and do what Ninja didn't do for us...label the box slots.And do note, the stack blade of the pitcher is a pain in the neck to clean. I won't call it a total con but blech...If you want a blender that can whip up a pitcher of margaritas, this is great. But if you are a daily smoothie/shake like us, the 16oz cups are too small and the 72oz pitcher is too big.  It wasn't the  worst appliance I ever bought but was disappointed that it was that dysfunctional for our daily needs."
"Thought I would love this blender — I like the capacity of it, but difficult to wash and dry especially.  The water gets into the sealed/closed areas — so you can’t dry it fully. I’m afraid that it will get mildew inside those areas when I store it back in its box.  Nothing like a REAL glass blender container.  This one is cheap plastic.  Not so happy with it."
"I don't like this thing! Blender is not good for mixing your protein shakes. I have to mix multiple powders to make my shakes, the powder gets stuck under the shaft as a paste, does not mix well! The shaft sits on the spline very sloppy! There is to much space at the bottom of the shaft, allowing the powder to get stuck up the shaft internally! I also don't like the lid! If you put it in the dishwasher, water will get in the lid parts and leak out all over the place! This lid has to many parts!The only good thing is, that it has 6 blades, great for chopping through ice."
"Quality is good but expensive, Costco has a better deal, now I understand I should never shop such things on amazon."
"This blender works great at making my fruit smoothies.HOWEVER, I use crushed ice from my fridges ice maker. So the blender doesn’t even need to work hard by crushing large ice cubes.Bottom line: the bottom of the plastic pitcher already has a crack running from the blade tower to the outer corner.  And Ninja wants $60 for a new pitcher.I will not buy another one of these blenders. Spend the extra money and buy a blender with a “GLASS” pitcher."
I returned this product because within eight days I found the same product for $90 cheaper
I couldn’t afford a new vitamix this time around so I researched a lot and decided to go with a ninja. It does the job but it does not blend well. I always have chunks. I feel like the container is pretty thin and cheap. I’d say if you’re coming from a vitamix don’t expect it to work nearly as well but it’s fine for making smoothies.
"Blends my smoothie’s good, but when I add spinach it does not blend well. Also be careful when cleaning the blade, it’s very sharp and it cut my finger easily. The blender is a little loud, so when I blend I put a towel under the blender to mask the sound. It’s still loud though. Overall it’s an ok blender. Would I buy it again… No!"
But for some reason just stop working. I'm so sad I can continue doing my monthly smoothies. From July to October last.
"This has been a great blender for our morning smoothies. We’ve never had any issues with it not liquifying what we need, so the smoothies always come out smooth. You also get a lot for the price, blender, 2 smoothie cups with lids, and the attachment to blend the drink directly in those cups, which is pretty cool.One big con that I read in the reviews that I can confirm is that the plastic blender jar does chip and crack easily, almost immediately, which is why my review is only 3 stars. That’s a pretty big deal to have plastic shards mixed into your smoothie. It happened the second time we used it, and put a nice little crack in the side about an inch long.My only other very minor complaint is that it’s all too tall to fit under the top cabinet while sitting in the counter, so it has to sit disassembled. Not a big deal though."
"The blender worked great, but after only 3 years the bottom of the pitcher has cracks so that liquid leaks out. Even before that, the lid broke but I was able to put it back together well enough to keep using it. The base is still in great condition but a replacement pitcher costs almost the same as a brand new blender. And I only use the blender a couple of times a month and never with hard things."
"We really liked this blender at first. We use it almost every day and it has been performing well. It is good at chopping up frozen fruit for smoothies and smoothie bowls. However, after about a month, it has started to make a strange whirring noise while blending. It almost sounds as though the plastic piece with all the blades is coming a little loose from its holder in the top lid of the blender, affecting the rotation of the blades. The blender still works, but we are disappointed that this issue has occurred so soon. We are unable to return or replace since the window has closed. We tried troubleshooting per the instructions on Amazon, to no avail. Lastly, we tried to go to the manufacturer troubleshooting website as provided on Amazon but it says page not found. Just be wary if you plan on using this blender heavily."
It’s mid.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            First of all, the height of this blender is good, which fits under the counter well, which I really needed. Good.It is advertised as 1400 w, so I was expecting it to be very high speed. It's not. In my video you can see that on the highest setting, in the mode to make smoothie, it chews up the kale, but it never really opens up all of the cell walls. So if you look closely on the video you can see that the kale is in tiny bits but it never really gets blended like my last blender did at a much higher speed. Not good.Next, with the three layer design of the blades, first you put the blade in, then you put your stuff in, which tends to get stuck halfway in the jar, because the blades block the stuff going all the way to the bottom. You basically have to put stuff in and with your hand rotate the blade back and forth to get the stuff to fall to the bottom. It's not that I can't do it, but I preferred the single blade on the bottom better because of this. In addition, the blade needs to be taken out and washed without cutting yourself, so I got a brush with a handle to perform that task. In addition, the bottom of the blade assembly has a deep hole in it, as you see in my picture, which requires you to make sure to get in there with your finger and water to get everything out. Not good.This unit is reasonably silent. I guess that's because the RPMs are low. Good and bad I guess.The lid design is complex, because it holds the blade assembly in place, which requires you to lock it in in a special way, but all of these bits and parts require you to wash the lid very carefully and brush and get in all the corners and layers. Not good.the construction of the unit is spectacularly good, one of the best actually, nothing to rust or anything. Very good.So there it is. The Good The bad and The ugly. For the price, this is not a bad lender. I'm keeping it. Unfortunately it lost two stars because of the issues. Maybe someday it can work harder and get the stars back. Never know :-)"
"UPDATE: Removing 2 stars for poor durability. The motor has performed as advertised. 9 days after the 30-day return window closed, I discovered several cracks in the blending pitcher. The unit was used maybe 20 times since purchase, mainly for small smoothies.  The toughest material was frozen strawberries, maybe 6-7 times. Never any ice. Never anything hot. I am very disappointed in the quality of the pitcher and doubt it would be a good investment to just replace it.  I need a reliable blender to prepare special dietary foods on a regular basis.I bought this to replace a 3 year old Ninja Bullet that had started to make a scary-strong burnt electrical odor. So bad that the food being blended tasted very off.  I make smoothies several times a week, creamy soups often and sometimes need pureed foods for a medical condition.  Here are my observations after about 2 weeks of near-daily use.============Positives: This model has more power and capacity than the Bullet.  It is easier to scoop processed food out without a lot of fussing around the ridges in the Bullet jars. It seems quieter when blending. I like the processing options.Negatives: Maybe not negative, but the different blade system is taking some getting used to.  It needs more care to position in my dishwasher without cutting the rack or my fingers.  The blades are so sharp, I didn't even feel a cut, only noticed 15 min or so afterwards when blood started showing up on things I was handling. Using a rubber band to anchor the stem to the dishwasher rack seems to be working to avoid damage to both the blades and the rack. The lid seems to collect hidden water during the DW cycle that can surprise when unloading.  A good shake over the sink prevents a shower on the rest of the load. That said, the blade is very secure inside the container and not especially a hazard when filling with food to process.  Also, I may need to experiment more with settings--tiny seeds in blueberries and strawberries are not pulverized as with the Bullet. Unless blending contents are scraped down during the cycle, there will be small bits of unprocessed food. It's footprint is maybe 1/4 larger than the Bullet.Overall conclusions: This machine delivers for the money with power, its cleanability and ease of operation. Would I go back to the Bullet? Probably not. Though I loved the velvety texture of foods from the Bullet, I do like being able to process more soup/veggies at a time AND the fact that this unit is not likely to burn the house down anytime soon."
"I had a Ninja 1500 watt blender that I purchased on Amazon and finally the motor crapped out after 9 years. It was so powerful and I never had problems with it. I looked for the same model to replace it with but couldn't find it so I bought this one. It's such a disappointment. I make smoothies each morning containing chia seeds, and it doesn't break them down. So I can't put chia seeds in my smoothies or they just end up all in my teeth. Ended up returning it. I'm really bummed because my old blender was such a testament to Ninja quality. I realize that the old model was 100 watts stronger, but come on. A $100 blender should be able to break down chia seeds."
Product works like a charm!  There is however an issue with the design of the corners of the pitcher which when washed in a dish washing machine can collect tiny debris and is near impossible to rectify.  To clean the corners where the debris can get into you would need to soak the pitcher in a bucket and scrub with a pipe cleaner.  Of course this is not inside the pitcher and so there is no food contamination possibility however it doesn't look appealing nor is it  sanitary to have tiny bits of food debris rotting somewhere in the kitchen.
"If you do some digging through Ninja blender reviews, cracks in the base of the pitcher are a surprisingly standard defect (feature?). The blender does a good job blending, but because of those cracks, if you use any thinner liquids than fruit, kefir, etc., such as water or alcohol, you'll get drippage down into the rotor that controls the blades, and moisture buildup in between the plastic pitcher housing and the rotor gear on the pitcher's underside. This buidup also happens when it's run through the dishwasher."
"Purchased this item on sale, as my last blender the plastic container melted, even though it said it was dishwasher safe.  I thought since Ninja is supposed to be the best in blenders, it would at least have a glass container, so hope it lasts in the dishwasher.  It is also so tall that it would not fit under any of my top kitchen cabinets so am very disappointed in it for that reason.  At least it does a good job of blending."
"I had mine for 8 months and now the food leaks out through the bottom all the way to the counter. It worked fine until it wore out. Considering I was making sunflower butter, I had to question if the lubricant in the base leaked upwards into my food and if that lubricant is harmful to my health.  I threw out $!0 worth of sunflower seeds that I used this Ninja to turn into sunbutter and threw out the Ninja.  I will not be ordering another one.  I have decided to just spend more money on a commercial food processor.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I now read a lot of other users having trouble with this product.  I wished I had done my homework better before I made this purchase."
"Works well, but they  will not last more than a year of regular use.And they keep changing the blending picture cups just enough so you have to buy new pitchers every year because last years style will not work.It does an excellent job - while it lasts. Which is about one year.Make no mistake about it. It has a built in obsellence and you will have to buy a new blender in a year and all new pitchers every year."
Way larger than expected. May well be a good investment however it is made for a permanent install on the counter vs an appliance you may easily put away. Keep this in mind.
"Bought this blender brand-new and the box was fine, it showed no signs of rough handling. After unboxing the pitcher I noticed 2 cracks in the bottom of it, starting in the center where the blade mechanism attaches, and spidering outward. At first glance I thought they might be scratches, but I could feel the cracks with my fingernail from both inside and outside the pitcher, so they had gone all the way through the plastic.Really has me thinking twice about buying another Ninja (this was my first), or any blender with a plastic pitcher for that matter. It definitely appears to be an issue with the manufacturing. Be sure to carefully inspect yours straight out of the box if you buy from this brand."
"Do you like products that last less than 6 months? Yes? Great. This is the blender for you.Do you like having to call support on the phone and spend an hour waiting to talk to a representative to file a warranty claim? Yes? Great. This is the blender for you.This blender worked fine. It made a passable smoothie (after running the smoothie function twice...). I had a professional grade oyster previously that lasted over 5 years - this does not make as good of a smoothie, but that can be expected considering it was a third of the cost. I thought I would give it a shot. A couple of weeks ago the lid stopped latching - which results in the person using the blender needing to hold the lid down while blending.This sounds like a completely first world problem. Oh no! You have to stand there to hold down the lid - how terrible is your life! Honestly having to explain to your family about how work around the problem is the worst part. Regardless, you realize that you're within the warranty window. Thanks the heavens! All is not lost.You navigate to the Ninja website. You manage to register your blender. Great. You would think that the next step would be to fill out a form to submit a warranty request. Nope. Okay... is there a support email that I can reach out to file a warranty request? Nope. Okay... there's only a phone number that you have to call. I have been waiting on the phone for over an hour and still have not talked to a representative.As a consumer, this tells me two things about Ninja. First, they don't don't care about the customer past the point of sale. Second, they don't stand by their products. They know that if (more likely, when) their products fail, most people are not going to go through the intentionally convoluted process of filing a warranty claim.This is not a company I will be supporting in the future.**update** I got off the phone with support. The lid and the pitcher are NOT covered by the warranty. The replacement pitcher and lid (because the lid is not able to be purchased separate) is 90% of the total cost of the blender. They offer a 50% discount because the item is under warranty - reducing the replacement to 44% the total cost. This simply reinforces my points again about Ninja not caring about the customer past the point of sale and not standing by their products.**update** the new pitcher came. Not even a week later the base stopped working. The lights come on, but when you make a selection the motor doesn't run. Are you kidding me. I called the warranty number again, THANKFULLY I was connected with a representative immediately. He was able to get me a new base under the warranty. But I mean come on. I've had so many problems with this thing."
"Does everything very well. Base stays put on counter.  Motor is exceptionally loud, so loud I have to wear noise canceling earbuds/headphones to protect my hearing."
"Product would power on, but wouldn't work.  I did return and received a refund, so there is that."
"A nice enough kit for the cook in the kitchen.  Does the job.  But why use suction cups for feet?  You cannot move the motor and mixer assembly around on the counter top because it is stuck to it.  Rubber feet would have been fine.  Rather then send the whole package back I am working on a way to replace the feet.  I tried stick on pads, but because the suction cups are silicone, they won't stick.  Jeeze..."
"Purchased blender in May. Started using in June. TBH, I love the functionality and design of the blender. However, after 7 months of usage( using maybe 3 times weekly) it stopped working. How can I replace it ? Do I need to contact ninja?"
"It did its job as far as blending well and quickly. But when you take the lid off it drips everywhere. You have to remove the blades, which drip everywhere and are scary to handle. My husband cut his finger on one of the blades - too easy to do! I found another blender that blends as well, or better, and isn't a mess to clean up and the blades are attached to the base. Buy at your own risk!"
"I bought this mainly to make smoothies and to replace my Nutri-Bullet. Ice has to be somewhat melted/ soft in order to blend right away, so I find myself removing container three or four times to stir ingredients for smoother blending. This is same problem with Nutri-Bullet, so Ninja is marginally better because shape of blade is different. Motor is incredibly loud on any setting, so this is also annoying. I think it is better to use as blender to make drinks for large group (versus containers for individual smoothie). It gets job done with lots of manipulation, and I am disappointed because it has such great reviews."
Do Not Buy From Ninja!!I purchased this unit 1 year and 9 days ago. Today the gear housing on the food processor felt weird when I tried to seat it. After inspecting it I discovered that all four of the mounting location were completely snapped off. The entire gear house simply pulled off in my hand.I contacted Ninja. They said that all they can do is offer to sell me s new food processor bowl- for more than 1/2 the cost of a new machine!I understand being out of warranty but this is an obvious design flaw. I “asked Rufus” about this issue and “Rufus” said that there have been reports of this part failing.Sorry- but an expensive product should last way longer than a year. My first Ninja lasted 12 years and performed perfectly- the blades finally just got to dull to use- hence the replacement model last year.Do Not Purchase if you value longevity and good customer service!
"The food processor doesn’t work that well to begin with, but after just over 1 year of relatively minimal use the base broke. Not normally the type of person to leave a review but replacing the food processor unit costs ~$70. Just buy a new actually good food processor for that price, one that won’t break after a year."
"UPDATE: I had a major problem two days ago as I was making plain peanut butter. About 20 seconds into the third 1-minute cycle (Pause in-between each) There was what sounded like a minor 'explosion' and the unit stopped. I unplugged the unit to take a closer look. There was a white milky-looking substance covering the bottom of the processor bowl and top of the base. I assume it was a lubricant. All four of the screws that attach the geared part at the bottom of the processor bowl had broken at the pieces they screw into. I had not expected the mixer to last forever but I had just purchased it in June, 2022 and have used the processor bowl about a half-dozen times, only to make nut butters. I just submitted for warranty replacement and will post results. So I just got off the phone with Shark Ninja and have to say, what great customer service! The motor/base unit has a one year warranty but my broken piece does not. I knew this but due to the quick breakdown I thought I would invest in phone call. Glad that I did. No hesitation at all...while I was on the phone they ordered the replacement part and sent me an email verifying it was being sent. I am as big a nut about good customer service as I am a quality product so I am 100% satisfied with my interaction with Shark Ninja's customer service department, though a bit disappointed that the processor broke after less than a year and very little use.  ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS...It is not intuitive but it did not take me long to read/understand the instructions. I have made almond butter, pecan butter and just used the blender to puree some Goldenberry fruit for marmalade. Much nicer than the cheap typical blender that I had used over the years and though more expensive than a cheap blender it works effortlessly and as far as I am concerned, well worth the extra dollars."
"This is our second Ninja blender, same model - both with the same issue (cracks forming in the base of the jar).  The first one developed cracks at the bottom of the jar a little over one year of owning.  We thought it was a fluke.  Since a replacement jar cost more than the whole unit on sale, we bought a new one.  After about 9 months of infrequent use to make smoothies (once every two weeks or so), small cracks formed at the bottom of the jar again.  Called Ninja since it’s still under warranty.  The jar is not covered under the warranty - only the actual base - so we have to purchase a replacement jar if we want to keep using it.  Ninja offered a ‘special price’ of $37 for a replacement jar.  Sounds like a deal, except I don’t want to purchase a new jar every 9 months.  You’re better off spending more up front on a higher quality blender - it will be cheaper in the long run!  Or, a cheap blender for $30 that you replace every year - also less expensive in the long run.  Avoid this blender at all costs - it is not well made or built to last."
"A great blender but, Amazon sent a used item labeled as new. Box was damaged and the blender had food still on the blades."
The food being processed gets caught in the square corners and you constantly have to manually stir things to get a constant blend.
"This new blender hasn't even lasted five months. It was a replacement for an older model Ninja blender that lasted nearly five years. This new model is nearly ten times as loud as the previous blender AND it smokes. It started when using the Extract setting. It smells like plastic is burning. The cup gets hot even though I am blending frozen fruits with kale and oat milk.  Even though I used to be a fan of the Ninja brand, I would not recommend this model."
"I have a couple of issues with this blender. First one is that the blade for the cup has already bent after just a week. It hasn’t  seemed to effect performance yet but pretty disappointing. I have just been using some frozen fruit veggies and not over filling the cup so idk. A bigger issue is that after about 2 days of using it once or twice a day, I started to smell some funk around the silicone seal on the blade assembly for the cup. I had been washing the blade very well after every use, but the seal is deep in a groove around the outer edge of the plastic part of the blade assembly and it’s impossible to clean it well. I got something small enough to get into the groove and pulled the seal out and there was smoothie residue on the sides and underneath the seal causing the smell. I don’t have a dish washer but I don’t think that would be enough to get into the groove and around or under the seal to get it clean. I had to bake the silicone seal in my toaster oven for about an hour to sanitize it and get the smell out of it. This is a big health issue, so I have been digging the seal out after every use to wash it and the groove and I would advise that you do the same if you get one. Ninja should design a better system similar to Vitamix which has an o-ring seal on the outside of the blade assembly and is easily accessible to clean. I don’t think I can live with having to use a tool to dig the seal out everyday to clean it, plus at some point the seal is going to start getting torn up from digging it out over and over. Anyways I guess I need to look for another blender and I would suggest to avoid Ninja."
"I can't try it be cause it comes broke, I will return it, is not the brand I think it was the carrier that didn't has to care the package, as u can see in the picture when I open amazon box I see the second package was damaged, but sometimes is only the packaging and product didn't, but in this case was both, I had instantpot blender but it stopped to work so I decide to try this ninja brand, and the cup is not heavy as is the instantpot there are so many difference be cause instantpot blender you can boil a soup in there literally it boil it, so the cup is a heavy glass, but I didn't use too much that option, so that's why I was trying this and  the cup is not glass is plastic, so it is very light and also you can wash it in dishwasher you can take out the blades and wash it separately I will see if can find it at store I think was a good option to buy  here because you save time to go at store but sometimes carrier didn't have the care to deliver the package"
"At second week of use, lights started flickering and stayed like that. Only works on smoothy."
When it runs it omits an awful smell. I keep it in the garage
"I have had cheaper units that were more powerful than this one. I use it pretty much just for smoothies so we’re talking kale cucumber, cabbage, etc. I don’t like it being clumpy or choppy so I wanted to be completely liquefied. Other cheaper blender did great job of that, but this one just couldn’t do it Even let it blend for almost 3 minutes and it still clumpy. Maybe this works good for other stuff but for this type of smoothie that I make it just didn’t liquefy it."
"Works pretty well, however certain smoothies definitely have a grainy texture, showing that the standard blender isn't as powerful/fast as someone of the other options out there. Works fine if you use the smaller smoothie cups, but if you plan on making blending anything for more than 1 person, you'll ha e to go in batches."
"Have had a ninja blender for 5 years. Pitcher eventually couldn't handle the high torque and it broke. This was almost the same price as w replacement pitcher, so I thought I'd give it a shot. Not only does it not duty with the original food processor and single cups, overall it's just a weak product. Plastic is flimsier. Can tell it's much cheaper plastic than original. Motor is weaker. This auto IQ Isa stupid setting. It turns off on its own before the smoothie is fully blended, even if I put it on a regular, non-smart setting."
"The Pitcher melted in the dishwasher, they should have better materials for an expensive blender."
"overall, the blender and attachments seem very good but I was disappointed to see that the motor is only 1200 W and not the 1400 that the product page details. I almost bought the 1500 W mega model, but I decided on this one because of the features and that it was only 100 W less. but 300 W less than the mega is a huge difference, and may very well impact the longevity of the unit."
"I came to my purchase history on Amazon to remember when I bought this Ninja product and it was Nov. 2022. Few months ago, the connector that connects the processor jar to the base/machine removed so it wouldn’t sit in anymore and it was difficult align them together. I stopped using it. Shortly after, the blender jar won’t lock in anymore. I had start holding it down myself so it can work (no more hands free). I was really sad this didn’t last as long as I hoped."
"Giving this item a 3-star rating, but really it deserves a 1-star, as more people are inclined to read my experience with this item. I bought this blender less than a year ago, not aware that it had a poor limited warranty if something went wrong with it. Used 1-2 times per week blending healthy drinks. Maybe 300 minutes (5 hours) total use time over a year on the unit. Hand-rinsed and cleaned after each use. Now I've discovered that the pitcher's handle is cracked, rendering it worthless. I called customer service and discovered that everything from the base up is not covered under warranty. Customer service is poor, and they are eager to sell parts but do not stand behind their warranties. You won't have much help getting it replaced either and will most likely have to replace the entire unit. There are other design issues, such as the blade mechanism not cutting well and producing gritty drinks. The cost of replacing a broken pitcher is $64.95, while the cost of purchasing a new unit is $109.95. Ninja does an excellent job selling its wares, but shouldn't a blender last longer than a year?"
"Purchased this about 18 months ago. Started out as the most amazing thing ever. The bearings in the blades went out at 11 months. The blender has now started making horrible noises, and broken black plastic parts are coming out of the fan holes in the base. For $200 and 12-mo warranty this blender is not worth the price vs durability. We replaced an Oster blender that lasted 10-years before having issues."
"My family's story reads similar to other 1-star reviews.  We did a lot of research.  Ninja sounded like the best product, so we bought the Ninja BN801 in November 2020.  The blades are super sharp.  It's easy to use and clean.  The blender and the smaller cups work great.  However, THE FIRST TIME I USED THE PROCESSOR BOWL, IT CRACKED.  And let me preface, we didn't use it for several months, so really, we'd only used the other components for a few weeks when the bowl broke on its virgin use.Now, I'm starting to see a lot of reviews on this product page and on the pages of replacement processor bowls on Amazon that warranty doesn't cover the bowl (even if we still had warranty), replacement bowls are expensive (I agree from what I've seen...as much as $80+), and more than one review says that the bowl needed to be replaced more than once.  With the warranty being only a year and the bowls being so flimsy, you're sure to lose money eventually.  A lot of products have a 1-year warranty, but most don't break right after a year, esp. when it's a name that's supposed to be as well-respected as Ninja.  No matter how well everything else functions, for such an essential component to the product's function to break so consistently and the manufacturer to be so cavalier, is not only disappointing, it's disrespectful of the customers.  My mother and I feel like we were robbed.  We will keep it as a blender so it's not a TOTAL waste of money, but I refuse to keep lining the manufacturer's pockets with the cost of overpriced replacement bowls.  We will find another processor that doesn't have such cheap, poorly made parts.  I hope mine and other customers' reviews save someone else from the same bad experience.  A lot of people are struggling during the pandemic.  No one has money to burn, esp. now.Don't buy this product.  Maybe it will break and maybe it won't, but there's a lot of them breaking, too many in my opinion for a $200+ appliance."
I would pass on this product. It’s so loud that you can’t stand near it while it’s running.  Other than that it does blend.
"I love Ninja products. I have two other products (a Foodi instapot/air fryer combo and a coffee maker)  This time I was looking to replace a single serve blender with something bigger I could use as a food processor as well so I bought this. I will say it works but it's bulky and it doesn't blend the single serve containers as well as my old one. Grainy things get stuck between the blade attachment and the cup. Also the food processor bowl doesn't work well. Trying to make hummus and it doesn't chop things all the way. My hummus remains chunky. So for me, this Ninja product is a fail. And it takes up way too much space for a small counter. Even the attachments are huge and take up too much space in the cupboard. I should have lived with the single serve blender."
After few months it start to make bad nose and not keeping a container in place locked.and it’s not just a one container I’ve tried few of them same thing. I’ve been using Ninja for over 8 years and love their products but that specific model is not durable and I am very disappointed with it. Will try to replace let’s see if it will help
"My last no-name blender was heads and tails a BOSS when it came to making smoothies, and all of my drinks came out nice and green and SMOOTH. THIS blender doesn't seem to do a good job at all with breaking down the frozen kale I put in. Despite multiple tries, I am left with a ""muddy"" drink filled with the sediment of unpulverized greens. I was so excited to use this blender, but it's a major disappointment (in this area, anyway). The picture on the left is about three tries trying to blend a green smoothie. It took SEVEN tries on High speed to get the image on the right. This is completely unacceptable. The other thing is the smell of burnt rubber when it's mixing. I also found something small and hard in one of my drinks, and it sounded like something was breaking down as it was blending. I thought it was the kale. Now I wonder if it wasn't something else.And as someone said in a comment, this IS a 1200 watt motor, not 1400. Check the bottom of the base and you'll see.Although I enjoy fruit smoothies and the idea of making frozen drinks, ""nice"" cream and sorbets, one of the main reasons I got this blender is to be able to make green smoothies. Unfortunately, it does a terrible job of that. Between that and lying about the wattage, I don't recommend this blender at all. Also, be aware that there's no tamper and the blade comes right out of the pitcher for cleaning. That makes it an incredibly dangerous piece of equipment, if you're not careful. I'm sorry I realized these aspects of this machine too late, or I wouldn't have bought it.I will make the most of it for now, but will be saving for a Vitamix or Blentec, instead."
"I have only had this blender for about three months.  I used it every morning to blend a protein smoothie.  My smoothie contained some crushed ice and three frozen strawberries so the blender should have been able to handle those few frozen items.  I always blended on the Smoothie setting.  At about the two-month point, I started seeing cracks in the pitcher (see my photos), but it didn't seem to leak, so I kept using it.  Just in the past week, when I was in a hurry, I filled the pitcher with water after using it to soak in the sink.  I have never washed this pitcher, blade or lid in the dishwasher, only by hand.  When I came back to finish up my cleaning job, all the water had leaked out through the bottom of the pitcher and into the sink.  I called the Ninja warranty line and was told that only the motor was under warranty.  They wanted me to purchase a replacement pitcher from them right then or to go online to their website.  I went online and the pitcher and lid replacement (couldn't buy the pitcher and lid separately) was only $20 less than my original purchase price for the whole unit.  My advice would be to purchase a unit with a glass pitcher, not one that is hard plastic that can crack and leak.  I'm disappointed that they did not stand behind their product."
"I liked this blender.  Used it for 11 months almost exclusively for protein shakes.  Now the plastic pitcher is cracked and leaks.  Paid roughly $100 and a replacement pitcher is ~$75.  Going a different route with my next blender.  Wish the quality of the pitcher was better as now I have a perfectly functioning motor and accessories, but a busted pitcher."
"I bought a second Ninja BN751 when I noticed cracks in the bottom of the pitcher. They were getting bigger every time I used it, so I figured I would buy a second although the current one is about 1 year old.When I recieved the second unit Just thought I would look at the same area before I threw the boxes out.Well you see in the oitchers what I saw, and this is without any use.After I googled this issue and see that many report similar crackes in theirs after short use.Other than this I like the unit.My first pitchers is not leaking yet but the cracks are getting pretty long and I only use it to male a hummas which I suppose is too thick to fit through the cracks.It is a shame."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This thing has no release for the suction cups. It is replacement for my last IQ Ninja, and I fully expect that the mixer bowl will break loose on the bottom and I will have to replace that one twice as well. I just like having fewer appliances taking up counter space.It looks like I'm going to have to stick this sucker down to a tray."
"I bought this as a birthday gift to myself while traveling to the US in April. I was so embarrassed and disappointed when, in June, the bottom of the main blender broke off! I am trying to figure out how to return it. I bought it to power blend my smoothies, thinking it would have amazing power like a blender for a smoothie shop. I am not exaggerating when I say I have had to go back to my simple Hamilton beach blender. The capacity on this is great but it has been a SORE disappointment. Not markedly powerful, and what a flimsy blade."
This blender broke the 2nd time I used it. I used it first time with no problems. But when I plugged it in the 2nd time the power would not turn on. I plugged it into other outlets in my home and still no power. I contacted the company via the number in the instructions Manuel and they are replacing the base bc it is under a one year warranty. Be advised about this issue and keep the instructions. You will need to register the appliance to get the warranty coverage.
"At first this was a 5 star review. Then after just 4 months the plastic on the pour spout cover broke. I don't even know how it broke. I couldn't find the broken piece anywhere. I don't even use the pour spout so I only open/ close it when washing it. Additionally, since I've revisited the page today (3/22/24) I see that the pre discounted selling price is far lower than advertised when I bought it. I thought I was getting a fabulous black Friday deal. But they just marked the original price way up at that time to make it look like a good deal."
"It’s a beautiful blender, extremely powerful, hard to clean and so far can’t find a recipe book for it. Ninja website is useless and no help at all. If you want it for alcoholic drinks, it’s great I guess. I should have bought a small blender for smoothies."
"The lid of the mixing pitcher has an opening to pour in ingredients as the unit is mixing - but, the opening in the lid is too SMALL and in the CORNER (see photo), so when pouring in granular ingredients, like protein powder, it never mixes completely - because the ingredients stick to the sides of the inside of the pitcher.Purchased another blender with a LARGER opening in the MIDDLE of the pitcher."
I recently bought this product and notice I used it a few times and the pitcher next to the handle cracked and leaking smoothie when it blends
"I used this blender for the first time today, and the pour spouts leaks really bad.  Was not even close to the liquid fill line.  I had 40 ozs, and lost more through the spout that was left in the jug.  No matter what I did, I could not stop the leak, and YES I will be looking to send this back.  Again, DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM !!!!!"
"Loved its chopping power, but as soon as I used it and went to put it in the dishwasher... didnt fit!"
"This is a horribly designed blender. It claims to be dishwasher safe and to be honest, with the 3 levels of blades, you really need to clean it in the dishwasher to avoid cutting yourself.Things wrong with the design:- When the pitcher is placed upside down in the dishwasher the 3 black feet and the handle collect dirt and dishwasher soap. The 3 feet can be removed without affecting the operation, but the hollow handle is part of the locking mechanism to ensure the lid is in place before the blender will work. You're just stuck with more & more gunk collecting in the handle- The lid has a lever and safety locking mechanism. There is no way to take the lid apart for cleaning. Placing the lid in the dishwasher will cause it to accumulate crud & dishwasher soap inside of it until this eventually jams up the mechanism and prevents it from working.Based on my experience I'd recommend everyone avoid Ninja blenders.They are just a poor design that clearly wasn't tested in a dishwasher before they started selling them.The motor, controls, and pre-programmed routines are all great, but without a workable pitcher & lid, what's the point?"
"This is my very first time leaving a comment on Amazon, however I had to , this ninja set I purchased is awesome 👌 very much powerful.... I only plugged it in to try the moto with one of the small cups I try it on low and wow it's powder for money...  I hope it's lasting.💯 reason for 3 star 🌟  is that I haven't started to use."
"It's powerful and blends great, BUT...The ""auto-off"" feature TURNS THE BLENDER OFF after only 60 seconds with the manual programs. (You can't bypass this.) You have to restart it every minute. It's inconvenient if you're making a milkshake that takes several minutes to blend. It's washable in the TOP rack of a dishwasher but IT'S TOO TALL for the top rack, even an adjustable one! The bottom of the blender container is shaped like a cup and is *not removable* so would collect dirty water even if it could fit on the top rack. At nearly 18 inches tall, it barely fits underneath standard kitchen cabinets. (The standard height for upper cabinets from the counter is 18 inches but can be as little as 15 so measure first before you buy a blender!) Quite disappointed with it."
"I really liked this blender.  Best I have ever had.  After maybe 10 uses, the pitcher wouldn’t sit properly on the base to latch into the lock mode.  After attempting several times to align the pitcher onto the base in the diamond position it wouldn’t turn to lock. As if it was stuck, it didn’t smoothly click into position. Trying to get it into position underneath two parts of clear plastic broke off.  To make things even worse this was on a family movie night with kids and my mother in law who came in town 🤦🏿‍♂️.  But I got the milkshakes done with the cups 🥴.  I really like this blender, I want to exchange it for another one hopefully, I do t know what happened but this experience was a bummer."
"Pros: Powerful blender, and it has a safety design whereby the blade will not move if the lid is not on tight.Cons: Because this is a square shaped blender, food at the 4 corners does NOT get blended."
"Product looks good and works fine, but it’s missing the lid. Please someone get in touch with me and send me the missing part. Thanks."
"My son loves frappes and milkshakes. So at least once a week I make him one. We use ice, ice cream & milk. Tonight I made him one and as I was cleaning it saw giant chunks out of the plastic of the pitcher, from the ice. We use small ice cubes that are semi circles, not even the big ones. This blender just isn’t powerful enough to handle ice it seems. Can’t find a replacement pitcher anywhere, not even from the company itself. So I think we’ll be getting a Vitamix instead, we’ve heard good things about those, and from what I read they can handle ice!"
"We picked this up on Amazon Day deep discount and were really disappointed.  We blend smoothies every morning and normally use a Vitamix, so admittedly are a little spoiled.  We thought we would try this out to see if any different and quickly went back to a Vitamix.  The chamber size is good, and the noise is about what you would expect for a fairly powerful (which it is) consumer blender, but the real problem is how it blends.  It uses a tall center column with blades up and down the shaft.  This takes up a lot of space and is awful when you go to pour your smoothie.  About 30-40% of the time the column comes loose when you are tilting the jar to pour/empty your things out.  Causing quite a mess and splash.  Ironically, all those spinning blades did not blend nearly as well as 4 small blades at the bottom of our old Vitamix.  We tried for 2 weeks to make sure it wasn't just how we poured and there was no way to secure it more tightly into the jar.  This also makes it more complicated to clean.  Overall, did not like."
"I love the 24 oz blender cup and you get two! The biggest drawback for me - is the Blades. There are three sharp blades. They are loose, and you have to be super careful to avoid a nick or cut when handling them. I put up a sign to remind myself and I stored each one in a steel pot to avoid any mishaps. In any professional blender, the blades and the wattage do the work. I get it, but it's not for me. Gotta keep looking for a balance of safety and great smoothies and extractions. If handling the blades isn't a problem, I say go for the Ninja Professional. Less expensive than Vitamix."
"I was excited to finally splurge and purchase a ninja blender, but I’m really bummed with its performance. The food gets caught in the corners while blending and I don’t feel like it fully purées the herbs and fruit when I add them to my smoothies. It’s also ridiculously bulky and has a lot of plastic nooks and crannies to clean."
"[EDIT: Ninja reached out to me after my complaint and agreed to replace pitcher, as a one time deal] Purchased Feb 8, 2022. Use it sparingly. Noticed leaks where the pitcher sits on the motor a few weeks ago but thought maybe I just spilled a little. Didn't see the cracks until today. I am the only person that uses it, no small kids or clumsy adults. I wash by hand, never put it in the auto dishwasher. Its been well cared for. I called Ninja and their warranty does not cover cracks in their pitchers, but they will sell you a new pitcher kit (?) for almost $70 (I paid $100 for the whole thing). Just letting people know. Thanks for listening."
Got this blender just over a year ago based on all the great ratings. Worked great for first 12 months and then the handle lock broke. When I googled this seems to be a regular occurence. When it breaks you need to hold the lid down for the blender to operate. Now it is leaking from the bottom. When I got it the unit felt cheaply made and it is. Not worth the money
"I purchased this blender in June 2021. For the past 2.5 years, it worked great. Blended well, wasn't super loud, and I liked the preset modes. However, the auto IQ feature in the motor base malfunctioned and now I'm unable to use the single serving blender cups at all, nor any of the smoothie settings with the pitcher.  Their warranty only lasts 1 year, so just keep that in mind before purchasing. Very frustrating."
This blender has a triple blade which is extremely sharp. It is difficult to make a milk shake because the 3 blades get in the way of putting ice cream into the blender. It would be difficult to make anything else because of the position of the blades. A bottom blade blender would have been better. It is not easy to clean like a glass pitcher. The removable blade is not safe around children and difficult to clean because of the 3 blades. I should have purchased a different blender. Not as good as I was expecting.
"As much as I like this blender, that lid will NOT lock and it won't turn on!  Returning it soon!!!"
"I've had this for 4 months, used it maybe 12 times total. It powerful, though super difficult to clean; when pulling it out of the dishwasher, there is always water and gunk in the many nooks and crannies in the lid and bottom of the pitcher. The pitcher itself got a significant crack at the bottom and leaked, and you have to call Ninja to create a warranty claim. I was informed the pitcher is not covered under warranty (just the base/motor), and I'd have to buy a new pitcher for almost the same price as the blender. After arguing, I finally got them to give me a new pitcher for the cost of shipping, which was still super high. Wouldn't recommend for the price or hassle."
"when I first got this blender and cleaned it I nearly chopped off the top of my finger the blade was so sharp and I was being careful after reading other reviews of people saying the same thing. It has been three months and the only thing I have used this for is smoothies and the blades are as dull as a butter knife. My smoothies had been getting progressively less smooth haha. When I took the blade and put a piece of paper next to it to see if it would cut it like it had when I first got it the paper just bent. I then very carefully touched it and the blade was not sharp AT ALL!!! It was so dull the only way it could possibly have been cutting anything at all was with the speed and the fact that the blades were in the way. Even the spinach in my smoothies is not all blended. I can't be more disappointed in this and have left a message on amazon and hope to here back. This was a birthday present and it is especially disappointing when a present stops working. Ninja, I thought your blades were supposed to be so sharp, what happened here? Please make this right."
"The instructions for cleaning say that lids and other parts (other than the base) should be washed in warm soapy water or the upper rack of the dishwasher.  I purchased this because I wanted to be able to wash the lid and containers.  However, in just one washing (even before use) water droplets were stuck in the handles of the blending vessels, and the lids continued to drip water after a couple of days air drying and repeated shaking.  I messaged the facebook group for Ninja, and the dialogue didn't make much sense.  They stood by their washing instructions, but also said that getting water inside the parts was inevitable.  They also gave an alternative suggestion of wiping with a moist cloth to avoid the problem.  NONE OF THIS was in the manual or other instructions.They also said there is NO WAY to get the water out of the handles and lids, once it gets in.I'm not afraid of a little water inside plastic parts, but I suspect that in the long run, this moisture can cause bacterial and fungal growth that will be impossible to clean.  If you read the facebook group, this seems to be a pretty common concern."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I regret purchasing this Ninja blender, as it’s proven to be a complete waste of time and money. Upon setup, I found that while the base would power on, the blades did not spin. After reaching out to customer service, I was informed that the pitcher was the issue and required replacement. However, I was disappointed to learn that the warranty only covers the base, meaning I’d have to pay out of pocket. The pitcher alone costs $68, plus additional shipping fees totaling over $80. It’s frustrating to face such a costly repair on a relatively new appliance"
"I bought this in 2021.  Less than a year later, the blender pitcher melted (changed shape from heat) in my dishwasher despite being advertised that all pieces are dishwasher safe.  I called customer service and was told a replacement for just the pitcher was almost the same price as brand new so I had to buy a new one.  I’ve had the new one less than a year and the bottom sunction piece stuck to my counter and came off.  It is lopsided and I can’t get it back on.  I should have never had to buy a replacement since it states with pictures that ALL pieces are dishwasher safe but the guy in customer service told me I had to buy a new one. This blender does work but it’s made cheaply and can’t even last a year!  I DO NOT recommend.  I called today about the bottom piece and was told I needed to replace the entire part and pay for shipping which was almost $70!  I said absolutely No way since I just bought a new one replacing the prior one bought less than 2 years ago!  First bought July 2020 and second bought June 2021!!!  I finally after saying I was going to write a horrible review and make sure to tell everyone I know not to buy this product was given a ONCE in a lifetime replacement at no cost.  I will NOT buy another of their products again.  My last blender lasted almost 2 decades.  Ridiculous!"
"I use this almost every day to make smoothies.  I love that I can set it and put everything away while it blends.  I usually use a frozen banana in my smoothies and it blends this up well.  When I tried frozen berries, i was disappointed to find out that it does not grind up the seeds very well like my old blender did.I also am disappointed this is not made with a heat proof blender cup so that I could have the option to blend up hot soups, or drinks in it.  But, I don’t use that option very much so it wasn’t a deal breaker.Since the blade is not attached, it is much easier to clean…however I must always be careful not to forget it isn’t attached and accidentally pour it out and risk dropping it on the floor/toes."
"I have always heard this was a good brand blender, but I just don’t like it. The center blade goes all the way to the top which makes it hard putting fruit in. Spinach doesn’t completely blend up in a smoothie either.So far, I regret that I bought it and know now to look at how far the blade goes in the blender. This blade takes up the whole blender.Also, the plastic is cheap. It looks like it has cracks in them in certain places that look like it’s tried to be repaired. Very cheaply made.I’m not sure I understand what all the 5 star reviews are about, especially with fruit smoothies. It does not blend up well."
It has less power than expected. Blades seem to dull fast. Only use it on precluded ice and fruit.
"I am very disappointed with this blender’s  performance. It breaks very easily to the point of not functioning at all. The first time the cup got stuck (less than a month new) and we couldn’t get it out. Then we replaced it and now the motor went dead. I have used this one just a few times. This product is cheaply built to break so easily. It’s a waste of my money. I hope the company can replace it for free. If I don’t get a replacement or my $ back, I am never buying anything from them ever again."
Have not been able to use it. Arrived damaged. My last blender I broke the container. To buy just a new container was too expensive in my opinion so decided to buy a whole new blender. Guess what arrived damaged. The 72-ounce containe!
I absolutely loved this blender at first. I loved the way it worked and I bought it because it had the portable blender cup option also. But I had only used it 2 or 3 times and the blender pitcher cracked. As far as I know we did not do anything to crack it. I hadn’t even washed it in the dishwasher. I had hand washed it. I have contacted the seller through Amazon and not received a reply.
"It blends, but due to the blade structure it doesn't really blend like other blenders to the ultimate blend.  If you like bits of stuff, that's fine. Also, obviously don't have one if you have kids - the blade is incredibly dangerous.It is very easy to clean - assuming you don't get your fingers near the Klingon inspired blade. Many blenders are actually impossible to clean the underside of the blades. This does not have that problem.Also, the inner cylinder is plastic, and it seems to scratch easily."
"""Ninja"" implies stealth.  This is absolutely the least stealthy item I have ever had in my kitchen.  The cats leave the house and I have to use noise-cancelling earphones with it.  I admit it does the job but OMG!"
"I primarily bought this to create green, coriander chutney that we frequently consumer. However,  my ears and head hurt with the overpowering noise this little machine created when I tried using it. Even the coriander stems get wrapped around the blade and there is nothing you can do except take it all out and put in another machine or manually chop all the leaves and stems and hope that it magically works the second time around. Not what you would expect from a $120+ machine.It does make smoothies fine but then I'd just use a $30 machine for smoothies instead of this pricey piece of junk."
"For hardcore blender users, this unit may be a great bargain. I'm writing from the perspective of an average middle-aged woman who occasionally needs a blender.I like to make fruit smoothies with my daughter in the summer. My 7 speed, 700 watt Hamilton Beach died last month, at 24.5 years (I know precisely because it was a wedding present.) I had no idea that blender purchasing had gotten so complex in the intervening years. I wanted something that was at least as powerful as my retired HB, multiple speeds, pulse, reliable, not overly expensive. Oster seemed like the best bet but I didn't like that they don't sell replacement parts. The HB models that were in stock were mostly lower wattage and got poor reviews. So I went with this one, thinking it was an upgrade but still practical. And it was on sale at the time.I have to admit I packed this up and returned it without ever turning it on. I'll trust others to attest to its power. My first reaction was that it's huge. Too high to fit under my cabinets with the jug in place, and twice the footprint of my old HB. And something I didn't see mentioned in any review - there are suction cups on the bottom. I suppose they hold down the relatively light blender when it's working at full speed, which sounds good, except my intention was for this blender to live under the cabinet and be slid out when I wanted to use it. The only way to get the suction cups to let go was to get my hands around the blender on both sides and stick my fingernails underneath them - not practical with my limited, crowded counter space. Also, that blade looked deadly. Not good for a clutz like me, or a tween learning to ""cook.""  I was also turned off by the number of parts that comprised the jug and lid, which would need to be disassembled to wash, unlike my HB (unscrew the top and bottom and good to go.) Finally, the plastic jug parts seemed cheap and I was concerned they would easily chip or break.I sat the blender on the counter for about 30 minutes to try to get used to it, but I was totally intimidated. I realized that I would find myself avoiding the blender because it represented ""too much bother"". Back in the box it went. I purchased a 950 watt Hamilton Beach blender with similar accessories that took a few weeks to arrive, but it's much more user-friendly :)."
"I have come to expect a lot from Ninja. This product, although newer and supposedly more powerful than my last, was so disappointing. The very first thing I noticed when I turned it on... LOUDEST ONE YET! OMGz! No using this puppy early in the morning where I live! I live in an apartment and my neighbors were not amused when I attempted my smoothie at 0600!Although it is supposed to be the most powerful that I bought so far, it is nots so wonderful with nuts. uneven and some of the nuts were left untouched, no matter how I tried to get them in hereI would not buy this again, nor would I recommend it!Weird choices there Ninja!"
"The power is strong, when it works. It seems it is a fickle item.  We replaced one of the 7 fin blades when it came loose and began leaking.  Once, when making a smoothie, the motor slowed, and the blender began smoking. I contacted customer service to let them know. It was not a good experience. I had to send multiple pictures and answer tons of questions as if I was being dishonest about the experience. So, customer service does not get high marks. After a long conversation, they agreed to replace the unit.  I went to pack it up and return it but decided to try it once more to see if the first failure was an anomaly and it began working again.  Fast forward several months later and averaging making about one smoothie per day, the unit is not blending well again.  It goes very slow as if the motor is giving out and you need ear plugs when you turn it on because it is incredibly loud. For the price, I would not buy another one and my customer service experience was not very good either. This is my experience and I leave fair reviews. We were very excited about getting this in fact it was my Christmas present, and I can say I prefer less prestigious blenders that are more reliable."
"I loved this until yesterday. The middle blender no longer works. I use this item to make shakes for my husband 3 times a day. For what i paid for it, it should not be broken. I believe it must be a mechanism within the middle blender as the other two work. I am new to Amazon and am not sure how to take care of this. I want the item to work. Unfortunately i just threw out the box last week."
"The big pitcher is not great for smoothies, unless you like a ""grainy bits of food"" type of smoothie. I am coming from a 30 year old Vitamix, and this does not make a  smoothie that is creamy like smooth in texture.  It's probably great for crushing ice and having margarita's but we thought this would make a great smoothie for our family..  The smaller cup is better but still not that great.. and it's too small for our family .. This machine is has great diversity but my main priority is daily smoothies and we were disappointed in the texture.  Even blending for like 4 minutes or more.. it's still not the same as the Nutribullet or Vitamix for a creamy smoothie."
It’s funny how this product has a year warranty because three days after your purchase date runs out and starts to mess up. I would not recommend this product due to the warranty.
"Nice blender but I can't use it. First time my wife used it since we purchased about 2mos.ago,she was blending some salsa ingredients and noticed a leak. Looked at the pitcher and noticed it had cracked down the side. Now I can't seemto find a replacement pitcher and I am past the 30 day Amazon return. So it is useless now and I am out the money. First and last NINJA purchase I make!"
"Both of the pitchers developed cracks in the bottom within the first few months and they started leaking. I contacted Ninja about getting them replaced under warranty.  Ninja refused and said that the pitchers are a normal wear item so they are not covered.  I explained that this is obviously not a wear issue, but a manufacturing defect.  We had a video call so I could show them that the cracks weren't caused by wear.  They still refused to replace them, but offered to give me 70% off of replacements plus shipping.  I then asked if they would warranty the new pitchers if they cracked within a few months of purchasing them and again, they said now.  I explained that I will never give Ninja any more of my money if that is their decision.  I guess I should have just bought the Vitamix that I really wanted in the first place."
I was expecting a more robust piece of equipment for the price. It does the job but the construction of the blender itself looks like one piece of plastic from a mould. It doesn't look or feel like it will last more than a year or two. Next one is going to be a non Ninja brand.
I bought this back in November 2023! Not even a year old! Maybe used it 20 times! Never used more then 15 mins in one uses!  Well the motor has made a grinding noise and smells of burning wires  no smoke! Not happy that I paid over 100.00s for this! Because it’s been over the 1 year it doesn’t qualify for repairs or replace! There are no small appliance repair places that can get part for ninja small appliances!
"I waited a few weeks to write a review after seeing reviews about cracked accessories that aren't included in the warranty. The crushing pitcher and stacked blade assembly are the ones I use daily, and I have checked for signs of cracking. I am happy to say there are none thus far, and I am using it to crush dog kibble. I am giving only three stars, because the replacement pitcher, when shipping and sales tax are added, cost more than half the price of the food processor. A three-month warranty would be appropriate. When the pitcher wears out, I will likely replace the whole processor with a good coffee grinder to do the same job. I won't spend money replacing a ridiculously expensive plastic pitcher."
Looks great but arrived shattered. Would like a replacement but only saw an option to return.
It is a nice package…. Lots of ways to use the different jars/containers.  But after a month i noticed that the rotator “teeth” were losing shape (two have “chipped”).  Noticed when the blender started making more noise than usual (it was loud at first so imagine).  Bit annoying bc the sound is alerting that something is not gripping properly anymore.  Only used the cup extension. Disappointed but too late to return.
"I thought it could chip raw chicken legs/thighs….  It worked about 5 times, then the blade shank must have stripped, and it wouldn’t turn for even the lightest job.Blades are razor sharp.  Very difficult to hand wash without getting cut.Fancy locking lid, but the design creates a bunch of hard to reach areas and tiny recesses,  which makes the lid hard to clean.Not worth the price, when a regular blender does same job."
I'm overall a fan of the Ninja... just brought a new system from Costco as the pitcher I was sent was defective and I missed the widow to return the item. Check and return defective items as soon as you see it. My pitcher is not able to lock shut... so it won't blend unless I pull the handle open and press the little button manually.
"I’m working out of town for a few months so I bought this is an inexpensive alternative for my Vita-mix. It doesn’t pulverize quite as well and my smoothie in the morning seems “fluffy” like there is a lot of air inside. Directions say it’s supposed to be a good food processor too, so I’m looking forward to trying that aspect of it."
"I put the usual ingredients in our new blender to make a smoothie. Hit the Smoothie button. The automatic setting worked the mixture way too long. We couldn't drink the smoothie because it was all foam, filled the pitcher. Had to remake the smoothie using a different blender. This model is worthless as a smoothie maker."
"Idk if the blades are stainless or not, I feel like they advertised stainless blades, but I got rust on the blades after maybe the 5th use. Not cool. Machine is very loud but crushes ice like nobody's business. The auto iq function seems to work consistently"
"Decent blender, but it sounds like there's a lawn mower in my house."
"Couldn’t do kale , seeds and even after running for 70-80 seconds- 1. All you get is Warm Smoothie 2. Still smoothie is not smooth/easy to drink."
I like that it is easy to use but the smallest one can’t blend small things like garlic or chill very well.It works good when you add liquid in to it. It is perfect for making smoothies
"While the blending feature was exactly what I wanted, the quality of the pitchers is a horrendously poor. I used both pitchers twice within a week of my purchase. After the 2nd hand-washing I noticed cracks all throughout the bottom of both. I’ve included pictures and circled some of them, but if you look closely you can see many more. Since I do like the blender I called Ninja support directly and asked if they would offer to send replacements for the pitchers. They told me that the warranty doesn’t cover “accessories” and that include all the pitchers. I am not sure how the company could only guarantee (and even then it’s partial warranty) the machine- what good is the machine without the pitchers? Extremely disappointed in Ninja. I will never buy their products or recommend them to anyone. Save yourself a return trip to the post office and DO NOT WASTE your money on this product."
I've had a ninja in the past and it was very durable. I purchased this set last year in August for my husband and the blender is already cracked. I think they changed the design but it's poorly made now. Would not buy again.
"No clue what is wrong with it but something is wrong. At times when I use it, it makes a horrible screaming screeching noise."
"My unit stopped working after only 6 weeks. I was Beyond Amazon return period, so I called Ninja. I explained that I purchased this blender to prepare food for my 3yr old son that has an eating disorder and he is 100% dependent on tube feedings. Ninja told me that my unit had to be replaced and it would take 2 to 3 weeks for me to receive a new one. I asked what was I supposed to do for that extended period of time for my son. The supervisor told me it was nothing that they could do to get me a unit sooner due to Ninja's policy and made it sound like I should be grateful that he gave me free shipping!I had to go out and purchase another blender so that my son wouldn't starve because Ninja clearly didn't care. They could have replaced my unit with a similar model they had in stock."
I bought this as a replacement for a Ninja that wore out. It wasn’t nearly as good as my old one. The plastic blade for mixing doesn’t get at the ingredients & you end up having to do it by hand in a bowl. I like to have my appliances do more than one task & this isn’t the one.
"Unusable. Had to order a replacement, hope it works."
"Box was received in terrible condition, the mixer was damaged - crack in base and it had food debris inside.  This product should not have been shipped to a customer in this condition.  As this was a gift for Christmas I was extremely disappointed and feel that any box that damaged on the outside should not be shipped and a  check should have been made before shipment."
"My wife decided to give this a trial because we have been having issues with blenders we have tried in the past. We bought the blender for household use due to a recommendation from a friend in February 2023, we were satisfied with it when we got it but the blender stopped working on July 29th,  2023. We just noticed some smoke started coming out of the engine and it stopped working. The blending power too is not the best, all we blend is peppers, onions, and Tomatoes"
"I have had this for just about 18 months when I started noticing a brown metallic residue collecting under the blade cap.  Has worked quite well for daily use, never put under strenuous load.  Such a disappointment from a ""high quality"" brand when cheaper ones have lasted for years."
"I bought this blender 9 months ago. It gets used maybe a couple times a week to make smoothies. I started with the small pitcher as it’s just me, but the lid stopped latching after about 4 months….and if the lid doesn’t latch, it won’t turn on. I couldn’t find a replacement lid anywhere…moved in to the larger pitcher and now that lid too will not latch. Found a replacement lid for $75!!! Half the cost of the entire system.  Oh, and warranty doesn’t cover lids. So very disappointing as the blender itself works really well.I will be replacing my blender but definitely not with this brand."
"I received this item December 1, 2022. It will blend then randomly shut off, so I have to stand right beside it and push the button three or four time until my shake is blended properly. Now granted it has worked well up until a week ago but something that cost this much should last a little longer than five months. Amazon wouldn't help me because it has been too long....don't waste your money."
Ninja used to be a fantastic brade with fantastic quality. This scoured after only two rounds of making breadcrumbs... I can feel the grooves and see the difference. So where is the strong plastic that is supposed to withstand blending and processing? ...it must be in my breadcrumbs. I don't see how that is safe or healthy. Choosing a different brand and buying glass.
This is extremely hard to clean you will never be able to clean it properly and the seal leaks after a few uses.
This Item it’s look like kind of returned or refurbished because there’s a rust all over underneath in the motor Chamber!
"The large cup broke the first time being used. Very disappointing and the unit is loud, louder than the older model we were using. Overall I am not too happy with the product."
"The cup will not stay engaged on  the blender for the blending cycle, so you have to manually hold it down, and it takes some muscle work as the cup keeps trying to snap off. Got replacement cups with no improvement. No better than the old (and much cheaper) blender where I had to hold the cup in place the whole time and press the one “blend” button."
It was nice for about 2 weeks. Locking mechanism completly stopped working so now the blender won’t even turn on.
I was really excited for this ninja blender. i finally got to take it out of the box this morning and at first I thought there was hair in the bottom but after hand rinsing and hand drying i noticed they were actually hairline cracks. I havent even used it yet. I will be returning this ninja blender. its dissapointing.
When the item arrives and when I want to use it it won’t blend
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The product issue is not resolved I called the number but they send me one link that is not work.
Great blender. Til it wasn’t. It just won’t turn on anymore. Tried everything we could think of. A waste of $135
"This product arrived with cracks on the bottom of the big containers, twice now. So, I will just request a refund and not wait for a third replacement that will most likely be disappointing. This is ridiculous…."
Pitcher broke in 4 months and not covered in the warranty. Costs $65 to replace. Pretty much half the cost of the product itself
I bought this for the firehouse and it will not turn on . No power to the unit. What a waste
"The blender cup broke after 2 uses. Amazon refuses to help with an exchange because it’s been more than 30 days, so now I’m out my money. And I have to buy another blender cup."
I used this maybe 6-8 times in the two months I had it and it just stopped working. Still turns on but doesn’t blend.
NOPE. After nine months of use it stopped working this morning right when I was about to prepare my toddlers purée. Not worth the money. 😔
sorry too say when i unpacked this item the large mixing bowl is crack from top too bottom
Was cracked snd box dmashed
Terrible package and product was used and damaged
Came with cracks in it and customer service was trash
"I loved this Ninja, but the food processor bowl will crack with use regardless of how carefully you maintain it. I've gone through two replacements, but now Ninja aren't making any more food processor parts. If you only want a blender, it's still a great option, but if you were looking for multi-function convenience, this is a poor option."
"The motor isn’t powerful enough for tough tasks, and it struggles with frozen ingredients. The noise level is also quite high."
"I generally love Ninja products, but this one started smoking when it was turned on.  “No problem!” I thought.  “I’m covered by the Asurion plan!  Return, Refund or Replacement!”  I opened a claim, sent them the smoking unit and they refunded the purchase price, which was a bit more than half the current price.  I called them, pointed out that the Amazon page promises “Return, Refund or Replacement”, but they insist the small print states that it is at their discretion and they chose not to replace the blender."
"I've made 2 green smoothies and one strawberry smoothie in this.  Today I noticed a motor burning smell.  Reminds me of my last cheap blender when it was going downhill.  The texture is great on the smoothies.  I noticed a little more pulp on smoothie 3 than smoothie 2.....but I have no basis for quality of this blender va another one.  I've never owned a higher priced blender.  They are right about the blades, they are sharp! I cut myself the first time washing it and my sponge is sliced up, so invest in a long handle brush or whatever the manual says to do.  Also really rinse everything asap, the lid was almost glued on and was so hard when I went to clean it ""later.""I give this 3 stars, with the motor smell after 3 uses I don't think this will last long enough for me to give it 5 stars."
"It takes a long time to crush ice or frozen beverage. It's not as powerful as it says .Pls note It has no food processor blades like other food processors , I realized this very late. It's just has a stacked blade and it would blend your veggies if you don't pay close attention.Too many parts and hard to wash , the blades are so sharp !It's so noisy tooIt's aiit but not worth the price."
"Buyer beware! This blender is awful at creating smooth purées, sauces, smoothies and even nut milks. No matter how long I blend or what mode I press, every smoothie ends up with fruit skins, unblended nuts or chunky bits. Never does anything come out smooth. Same thing happens with sauces and it’s super frustrating. I had heard such good things about the ninja brand, but this blender totally puts me off."
