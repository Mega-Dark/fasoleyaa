"I bought this phone because of all the good reviews and that it was affordable.  I had had bad experiences with Samsung phones in the past, but I thought maybe they had improved.  I was disappointed.Within a couple of days, when I was trying to type out texts, I found that even if I very carefully pushed on a letter that I wanted, another letter, or number, or word would show up in the text box.  I would have to re-start the phone to get it to work again.  And that was not all.  Other times the screen would start jittering badly, or quickly shifting back and forth between two apps when I wasn't even touching it.This behavior has persisted.  Due to this problem, I have to re-start the phone on the average every two days, but there have been a few times whey I've had to do it three or four times in one day.Also, I'm not sure why the default setting for the screen is ""gestures"".  This was very frustrating because I could only remember a few basic gestures, so I could never do things like bring up the screen with all of the open apps, as well as having other things happen that I didn't want to happen when I tried certain swipe gestures. I finally got sick of this problem, and looked it up on the internet and found where there was a way to get three buttons at the bottom of the screen - one for ""back a screen"", one for the ""home"" screen"" and one to open the window allowing you to scroll through (and close) open apps individually - or close them all with one button.The battery saving feature takes a while to get it right.  This feature keeps you from over-charging it, and stops the charging when the battery gets to 85% full.  For the first few weeks, this resulted in me sometimes running out of power before my day was through.  This feature has some king of AI support, I think, and it has gotten better over time.  It still says it only gets 85% full, but it usually lasts a whole day unless I am using it very heavily.Otherwise, the phone seems to work well, but the screen problem is bad enough that I can only give this a two star rating."
Needed a phone to hold me over until i save some cash for a better device. It's... okay. Slow as heck but with some tweaks to the settings and animations settings you can make it better experience.But as a permanent device replacement for a year or two.. No way!
I don't like the fact that I have to apply pressure on the screen to get the button to select the response I want. Should be more user friendly. I would like to purchase another phone. But can't deal with the loss of this one. Cost factor is a problem I can't deal with. Any suggestions would be gladly appreciated.
"So far it's ok, but it's pretty slow to load things or go between apps. It has little glitchy things that happen all the time. I wouldn't purchase this phone again but I guess you get what you pay for!"
"I only got this phone as a temporary until I can get my z fold repaired. This has good memory, lots of features but the refresh rate is pretty damn slow. I guess I'm used to a fast refresh rate. This phone is slow to respond, slow to load pages. If you want a fast phone spend more than $400."
"Good screen. Phone has everything you need except for: Speed and good camera.It's Slow.  R---E---A----L-----L----------Y----------S--------L------------O--------------------------W.Camera produces blurry photos indoors. It's SLOW, low res, and glitchy.Video records with visual glitches.  RAM shortage is palpable.Apps take time to load. Switching between apps is a pain.Inputs from your finger are missed 20% of the time.Imagine being in a situation where you need to text your family, look up a thing or two online, and turn off your house AC. This will TAKE TIME.  There is a palpable gap between every action-reaction.  So, Great attempt, but the CPU should have been faster.  It's too much of a compromise at any price, really, for 2024.  The phone is good for users with lower than average knowledge of smartphones. It's visibly slower than any other phone you have touched.  I do not recommend it, but I thank Samsung for the effort. A 50% faster CPU seems necessary.  A faster camera as well.  But $200 is unreal.  So, do it if you have to, but don't do it :)"
This phone is good.  The only thing that bugs me is that the volume and power buttons are on the same side. Very annoying.
"The phone is in its best condition I'm sure, but as I have owned the phone I have noticed a lot more pop-ups and just weird stuff happening that didn't happen on my last Samsung S10. It's like the phone has TikTok embroidered into the software somehow cuz it'll constantly give me pop-ups."
Very nice phone but isn’t able to do ESIM.
Phone is slow and fingerprint sensor is really bad.  Cheap phone that serves it's purpose. Makes me Miss my Motorola 5g ace. I'll be looking for something different soon because I can't stand the hiccups this thing has. Annoying really.
"Why does Samsung have to add a bunch of junk on top of the very capable Android base OS?This really downgrades  the Android experience for me.Even the higher-end Samsung phones seem to suffer from the manufacturer trying to ""fix"" something that isn't broken by installing crapware.No more Samsung phones for me."
"When it's good it is very good. This phone requires a restart every 2-3 days to keep it getting a signal. Apps were a bit weird for a while and found it was user error.The screen is VERY sensitive to touch, and I hate to try and lower it. Just be aware it is real touchy."
Has a mind of its own sometimes.
"I wish I had returned the phone within 30 days, but I hated messing with all the passwords being changed again. I thought things might get better. The phone freezes, the screen jumps up and down, sometimes it won't respond to touch. I called asurion, and they told me I had to call Samsung. Samsung sent me to their repair store, and since they couldn't duplicate it at the time, they told me there was nothing they could do. They also said they did not have any parts on hand and had no idea how long it would take to fix anything they did find wrong. They told me that I need to use someone else's phone and videotape the problem when it's happening, then show it to Samsung. I sure wish I had just returned it the first sign of trouble."
"I've been using this phone for 2 weeks now and I am constantly frustrated by how slow and laggy it is.  From the time I press a call button, it takes 5 seconds for it to start calling.  Another thing that it's missing is the Always On Display.  So, in order to see if you have any notifications, you need to press a button to go to the lock screen.  I think this phone will be going back, I am so disappointed in it."
"Likes:- Good battery life- Long support and updates- 3.5mm jack headphone support- Expandable storageDislikes:- Huge, not small pocket or hand friendly- Slow and laggy- Charging time is about 2 or so hours- Fingerprint reader is 50/50 with or without a case. Had to redo my fingerprint just for that to not work really either...- Not sure if it's my phone carrier, but literally cannot text in a group chat if there's more than 10 people...- Color isn't what it says to me. It's supposed to be a cute, reflective blue and it doesn't even look blue in the slightest, but not too mad about it. Just a little disappointed.- Just my slight with Samsung phones, but I hate the voicemail setup. I much prefer Apple or Google's way of reviewing individual voicemails along with the day they were sent instead of having to listen through all of the menu options and voicemails with no way to tell when they were sent..Overall:I'm not sure I'd recommend this phone, at least not for $200. I tried out the Moto power 5g 2023 and I actually preferred it over this phone. While it was taller, it was slimmer and easier to hold. Faster too, just had too much bull crap on their crowding up the phone and home page. I regret buying this one and keeping it, cause I can't return it since it's past the return date."
"This phone is not even worth half the price they're selling it for. It is bottom of the barrel, cheap, slow, and with the most basic functionality. The buttons on it feel extremely cheap and fragile. The sound is basic at best. The responsiveness is extremely slow, as in: click an app, then wait 3 to 5 seconds for anything to happen. The fingerprint sensor works well, though, so far, which I can't say for the in-screen sensors I've tried on other phones."
"UPDATE:  After having this phone for months I have to say it's the biggest POS that I've ever had!! More glitches than I could list. I took 4 stars away because I'm so angry at all the glitches. Now I'm going to go back to my A10E, at least that was reliable!!I decided to wait to write a review because I was on the fence about keeping it or not. My previous phone was a Samsung A10E which is not a very heavy phone. The A15 is considerably heavier which I am (still) not very comfortable with. Comparing the 2 phones as far as memory is concerned is markedly different. The A10E has 32 gigs of internal memory. The A15 has 128 gigs of internal memory. Considering that I have alot of pics on my phone with several different albums, this makes the A15 a better product. The battery life is quite good. The appearance is beautiful. I purchased the light blue phone. I have a clear cover on my phone. This is my 4th Samsung cell phone. Samsung never disappoints with quality, durability and performance. I love the Samsung Smart Switch which makes moving your data from one phone to another fast and super easy. They don't provide a SIM card or micro SD card so you need to make sure to move your cards into your new phone. The software is similar to previous Samsung phone with a few tweaks. For example, to get a screen shot for the A15 you need to press both power and volume down button simultaneously. What makes the A15 different from any of my previous Samsungs is with the A15 you have to press each twice. There is a feature that would put a floating icon on your screen and open it and tap screenshot then you will get your screenshot. Now, what sold me on the A15 is a neat feature where, upon your approval, they will block all spam/scam phone calls. So no more annoying spam/scam calls!! It's a neat feature!! Like I said, I love Samsung phones!!"
"This is a pretty phone but it's slow it get late notifications and camera not great not good quality and it slow down alot ,also it freeze a little idk it's not great even the  keyboard ."
"So I'm coming from a Moto X. I switched for the camera which delivered but I'm not impressed with the operating systems. The auto correct, alarm, calendar etc. are all counter intuitive with more steps that I'm used to. Will buy another Moto when this one dies."
"Over the first few weeks of buying the Galaxy A15 5G, I became aware my phone would not ring or vibrate when three family members on my Favorites list called. The phone worked fine with other family members and friends on my Favorite list. All settings were the same. I called my carrier and it was not their problem. I then called Samsung support. I spent 65 minutes trying to translate a heavy East Asian accent. To make matters worse, he shared a room with, I'm guessing, 10 - 25 people. Between the accent and the talking in the background, it was very difficult to understand each other on both ends. I was asked at least four times the reason I was calling. Duh. At the end of our conversation it was left up to me to use the phone and see if the problem was resolved, and if not, to call back. Huh!? The solution? I have to keep both the Do Not Disturb and the Sleep features turned off in order for the phone to ring for those three people!!!  There might be more people who haven't called me during this first month that won't get through when they call. That remains to be seen over time. I'm two days past the Amazon refund date. My bad. There's a zero chance of my every buying or recommending ANY Samsung product going forward. You're welcome, Samsung, for my $176.00 donation to your bottom line."
"its an ok phone, nice looking, but still a bit slow, only 4GB but it works better than my old phone."
problems with answering phone and problems with downloading SOME APPS
Phone works alright.  It has a few quirks it will need to restarted sometimes to get sound thru calls on it. I also got it it was for my girlfriends dexcom which says it was compatible but when checking it was a different version. It didnt work. Get it for a cheap alternative to hold you over till you get a phone you want.
I had an LG Stylo 5 but it was old and I found out they were going to face them out. So I decided to buy a Samsung Galaxy A15. I had several Samsung's in the past and had always loved them. So I decided that's what I was going to get.  WRONG CHOICE!!! . This is the worst phone that I have ever had!!! Didn't have it two months until the screen cracked. Things such as alarms turn will  off and on as they please. And when I do have them set they don't go off. Apps come and go as they please. Things appear on your screen that you cannot get off! You can put it on do not disturb and set it to do not turn off until I say so. Well it turns off when IT says so!! I will have things on my phone and try to go back to it Well guess what it's been wiped out.  I will be right in the middle of something and it will knock me out and then not let me back in. This happens all the time. I can't believe all this is happening with the Samsung. I mean this phone is horrible horrible!!!!! Buyer Beware!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT HALF A STAR IF I COULD HAVE. NEVER AGAIN WHILE I BUY A SAMSUNG.
"We've had the phone for a week and it seems fine for my family member that doesn't do much but text, answer calls, and use one app at a time. My only issue with it is that it did not come with a SIM card and Verizon would not let us use the SIM card from her old device so we had to order a new SIM card, which took two days. Very inconvenient."
"The phone itself is very nice (which is why it has two stars) but there are several things about its use that I find disappointing.  First, the fingerprint feature doesn't work at all well.  I have supplied a new fingerprint half a dozen times and it just won't open the phone.  Another very disappointing thing is that the tweaking software made for Galaxy phones, Good Lock, is not available on the Galaxy store.  The substitute version, Fine Lock, is available on Google Play but the app is empty of modules.  A search online suggests that this phone is too low end for Samsung to include access to this app.  Ugh.  I am no expert on cell phones, but my last phone, a TCL, worked much better than this new Samsung.  The TCL had voicemails available without having to log into a voicemail center to retrieve them.  There are other dislikes I have but you get the picture.  If these issues are due to pilot error, I am glad to edit the review, but so far...disappointing."
"The only thing saving this phone from a 1 star is that it works. It struggles with any task, even the home button. The RAM can't handle regular use. I might buy another phone and give this one the office space treatment."
It does what I purchased it for but it could be less expensive.
Poor video and photo quality. Touch screen is also mediocre.
FYI. If you do not have a SIM card buy one separately when you buy this phone.We could not connect the phone to our verizon account because it did not contain a SIM card. This was a disaster since we needed a funtional phone immediately and had purchased the phone because it had overnight delivery. Just brought aware.
Extremely slow and laggy and only added 2 apps to the already existing apps installed
"I purchased this as my 2nd Samsung Tablet s8nc3 I loved the 1st. It was outdated, but got a long time out of it.VERY disappointed in the battery life. It doesn't last 1/2 as long as the one prior so I'm limited to a couple hours before it needs to recharge."
"I am convinced that this phone is either some kind of high-tech torture device or maybe even a practical joke by Samsung.  Every day I consider smashing it into pieces.  It's underpowered, even to run the GPS, which makes it dangerous to rely on while driving.  Samsung has it loaded with bloatware that can't be removed.  The screen turns off when you want it on, on when you want it off.  The settings are constantly being updated by either Samsung or Google or both.  My privacy settings keep reverting.  The AI is super intrusive.  The animations and texting features are obnoxious.  The Samsung spam is nonstop.  It freezes randomly and the only way to reboot is is to let it run out of power.  It doesn't tether to my laptop by USB for transferring files, I think because of a driver issue.  The phone comes with every single irritating option opted-in.  I spend hours in the settings trying to get this phone to just be a phone but the most important things are not settings.  I LOATHE this phone and I doubt I'll ever buy another Samsung after trying out this brand."
"I've been using Motorola phones (sub $200) and I've been very happy with them. I thought I might branch out and try a different model just for variety. This $200 A15 was not worth the money. It was WAY slower than my Motorola's. Every touch was met with a second or so delay. I would swipe with my hand to take a screen shot. 3 seconds later it would capture the screen. the problem was the screen would change and I could not capture what in intended to capture. I even tried to time my swipe with timing of the changes on the web page, but was unsuccessful.I'm not sure how much of the blames goes to Android 14 (vs 11 on my Motorola's). EVERYTHING took longer to accomplish. I spent more time swearing at the phone than actually using the phone. I'm returning the phone and buying a Motorola.UPDATE: I've returned to my Motorola One 5g Ace 128GB unlocked and everything is speedy and responses to my touches are instant again. What a relief."
Except has more GB. Otherwise would like to return. Far worse than regular android phone in only its half price.
"Very disappointed in product . NO Sim card or charger. Would not have ordered , had I known,"
"My phone reached incomplete, I only received the phone, the manual and the charger cord without the head. Not a good buy, now I have to purchase a charger head and that is unfair because I paid for a complete set, very disappointed, that is why I am giving it a 3 star."
"this phone was crappier than i thought it would be and the return process was terrible. weeks later, still waiting for my 200+ dollars back, going to try walmart+ for a few months"
I shutoff the Samsung browser and removed any apps that I don't want. Still have some apps that are automatically installed.  If I can't stop this I will be testing the phones ability to work underwater at the nearest river.
Keeps dropping calls
"i get about ~850mb of ram available, with no apps open, that aint nothing, when im listening to music, have google maps open  and then i get a call, goodbye youtube music it closed because ~850MB of ram is not enough. Sometimes google maps closes instead. having instagram open then switching to snapchat, big lag, gotta wait for the phone to unfreeze then for snapchat to load, since it uses your camera when you open snapchat, it freezes again, and again if im listening to music, with those Snapchat, instagram and Youtube Music/Spotify the phone freezes and closes a app. EVEN IF NOTHING IS RUNNING, ITS STILL VERY SLOW"
This phone has way too many issues going on with it. There's a software issue with trying to connect android auto with cable and even if you get a wireless dongle for android auto it still has trouble connecting. The limited amount of ram makes this phone barely usable. I can barely play any sort of apps. I didn't need a quality camera. All I wanted was basic needs like map and listening to my music or make calls handsfree. It fails at that half of the time.Lesson learn drop a hundred dollars more and get the google pixel.
"It's slow.  Can often not even tell if it took a finger press it gets wound up so often. It throws too many built in notifies trying to steal your attention.  A previous budget Motorola I had was much faster than this.The screen seems well made and is fine, visually."
I bought this phone for my daughter June 14th the phone was working she woke up this morning made a phone call on the phone and then the phone shut down and would not turn back on the phone was fully charged nothing wrong with the phone that she knew of it just went black and didn't come back on caused her to lose all of her information all her apps does she has to be able to get codes to be able to access and now she can't get codes to that phone number on that phone cost us $300 today on the spot to have to go buy her another phone because she has two babies and has to have a phone never again will I buy a phone off Amazon nor should you there's no warranty it was $216 wasted they have to spend another $300 today and this was just June 14th this is August 18th 2024 do not buy this phone from Amazon don't buy any phone that is unlocked this is what happened
"I had hopes, it's a Samsung, but apps cease working in the background where the apps have to be closed and reopened to complete a task. I wouldn't buy the phone again, for $200 there's better alternatives."
"I've been an Android and Samsung customer for many years now, having an S5 and S8, and now this A15.  Frankly, the A15 is always slow and at times unresponsive, so much so that it's hard for me to believe that this is a modern smartphone.  I do not recommend this phone.  I should have paid more for better performance."
"I've had several Android phones from different manufacturers and have liked all of them until now. I bought this Samsung about 2-1/2 months ago and the fingerprint scanner never worked well and has now quit working altogether - that's the final straw - I'm replacing the phone. There's more....the screen is soft as butter and scratched in the first week - I've never had screen damage on a phone before. The touch screen is not very responsive. I often have to touch it 3-4 times to select things, and it is not precise - often selecting things other than what I am trying to select. The camera is also far below par even for a low end phone like this. Beyond all of that, the WORST thing is that Samsung's swipe typing is laughably inaccurate. My last phone was a Moto G and swipe typing was pretty solid, but with this phone you just have to text letter by letter and remember the touch screen isn't precise so even that leads to endless corrections. Bottom line is that this phone is a complete waste of money and will make your phone life miserable."
"Before you can use this phone you'll need to purchase separately the charger and SIM Card. When attempting to create account with Samsung it kept not recognizing the password it automatically created and said I wouldn't need to record. I had to go through the process of creating my own passwords four times until it finally recognized the password. Anyway, it's been a hassle finding out I needed to purchase key components before phone would work so i could text and receive phone call. Finally able to use, I found the battery depletes rather rapidly while I was learning the features, reading email, Googling, etc. Keep an eye on the charge. $200 only buys the basic power nowadays."
"The phone looks good, but it is very slow. This is a far cry from the S series. I Will not purchase an A series phone again."
"I have had problems with this phone from the very beginning. Other reviews said that it ran a little slower than average, which I was totally fine with. However, since I've got this phone, it  has crashed multiple times, will start pressing buttons randomly (like phantom clicking) to where I have to try and restart it between the phantom button presses. It also just has significant and repeat technical issues, even though I have it set to restart and update daily. I'm pretty good with phones, and I have never had a worse experience with one before."
"The galaxy store which CANNOT be removed will push notifications for Solitaire game ads. There is nothing, nothing that can be done to disable the ads except rooting the phone.  Voice input is frustrating to use, as is the keyboard itself. The processor is frustratingly slow. Unacceptable."
I went with this Samsung phone because I liked that it will receive updates for a long time. I hate getting rid of phones that work just fine because they stop supporting them. But this phone is slower than the old pone I am getting rid of. I liked everything else about it. The Samsung One UI is cool. Screen is nice. But the processor is so underpowered it is frustrating to do anything on the phone. I ended up getting a new phone and I am going to sell this on eBay. You are better off with a used Pixel than this thing.
"The phones in good condition. Unfortunately it is annoyingly slow. Going between apps, homescreen, drop down is so slow. Loading apps takes way longer the any of my s version galaxy's. Currently looking for new phone"
This phone seemed to be everything I needed but it wasn't compatible with my Verizon carrier.
"Worked great for about 6 weeks,  after that freezes so often and doesn't ring at all among other issues  (No physical damage phone in new condition)"
"Bought this phone twice now and both times the phone started out great and then it just started deleting apps that came on the p hone like the camera and google chrome, pictures, messages over time and I only had the phone a couple months.. so I lost many photos and other things which I won't get back, I'm very unhappy about. Will not buy again."
"Not a upgrade from previous Galaxy, Won't stay locked, makes calls on its own. Opens up on its own, Get a call and it won't unlock. Large, heavy, bulky, reminds me of a brick. Hard to hold and use for a senior with arthritis. Owned Samsung phones and tablets for years, this model is junk!"
It keeps frozen all the time
This phone os hot garbage out of the new box.Takes way to long to reapond to touch inputs.Even longer to open Anything and Everything.Randomly loses sound.Randomly toggles between app and app management screens.Just cant rely on this phone.Will be looking to replace ASAP.STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!
If you want to feel Like It's 1999 again this is the phone for you. Slow doesn't respond to touch is hard to even open the screen. You can't close a window and open it back up the phone's intuitive features are just garbage. Save your money.
"I have had enough experience with Samsung now that I can confidently tell people to stay away from Samsung. Pay a little more if you can for something better, or go with Motorala, which is a good budget phone. This particular phone does not even have screen cast. This phone is so touchy that it will do its own thing sometimes. And it does not allow you to update factory pre installed programmed apps (that you can't uninstall) unless you create a Samsung account. Etc...."
"This can barely operate on an even basic level. Music crashes even when nothing else is running in every app I've tried. The system UI will dissappear for hours. Any keyboard will lag. I wanted a cheap phone because I don't use it often or for anything more intense than music, but it can't even handle that."
Shame that this phone does not have more RAM - otherwise it's a very fine phone.  It's infuriatingly slow even with the most basic apps.
"I've had a lot of different Samsungs, and phones in general. Im of the age that they didn't have smart phones until I was in my late 20s. And this is far and away the worst phone I've ever used. All the cool features they list have to be shut off or disabled just to get the stupid thing to work. Yeah, the battery life is great. But who cares if you can't use the thing without the screen glitching/being nonresponsive. The sound out of the built in speaker is like trying to listen to something on an earbud not in your ear. The one good thing that came out of this experience (I returned this phone) is I went back to my s10e and love it. By comparison it feels like a brand new phone because this one is such garbage."
"The phone freezes up, and it came with a ton of ads pre-installed so you have to first bypass the ads before you can even dial a number. Should have stuck with iphones."
"I had an A13 Samsung for 2 years and it started acting up. So I decided on the A15. Turns out the A15 has MORE problems. It changes pages, the screen locks up (can't swipe), screen starts to jitter, settings keep changing, etc.  I think the setting issue is the most bothersome. I use this phone for internet only so I can't say if there are any issues with that part."
From day 1 had nothing but issues with phone. Had spent 2 days on phone with customer support from both Samsung & my carrier to get thur the issues. We worked thur those issues with all helping. Then 3 day internet turns off & no matter what either customer support did it would not turn on & STAY on. Decide after  3days of frustration to just send it back. If it's new and having  all the different issues that kept coming up. I don't see the issue stopping. I will be turning the galaxy A15 phone. I put the service back on my other Samsung and the issues stopped. Clearly it was the Galaxy A15 phone. Disappointed that I had to return it.
"Chose this based on Wirecutter's budget Android phones review...yikes, they missed the mark big time with this endorsement. Extremely buggy migration process (Smart Switch). Noticeably worse performance than my years-old moto g play that was half the price. The display is bright and clear just like Wirecutter said, but good luck wrestling the damn thing to get anything worth seeing on it. Not worth the money."
This phone takes way to long to load anything. The reception can just cut randomly. It can even handle normal android gui animations. It's not worth the low price. Just pay a couple hundred more and get something that does t freeze all the time while loading simple apps. I timed 5 seconds for the keyboard to appear after tapping the google widget. That's bonkers.
This phone locks up constantly I have to shut it down an to get it to work sometimes in the middle of texting it just closes out and I have a case an screen protector an still the screen is cracked I don't recommend this phone!!!
"Purchased  a phone from this place and in less than 90 days the screen went Black. Went through Amazon to talk about it, Amazon got a hold of the seller, seller ends up communicating through messaging stating we could send phone back because it was less than 90 days, so it was still under warranty. Sent phone back and then they ended up sending it right back to me. stating the phone wasn't in original condition as it was when I purchased it. Hence the reason why I sent it back because it wasn't working. This is not a good company. Keep shopping. It's not worth it. They won't stand by their word."
"I really regret buying this phone. It's extremely slow. It took up to a minute just to make a phone call. When I plug it into my car, it's constantly restarting the maps and shutting down music and app. It's just a very very sluggish phone. The camera quality is pretty poor too. You can see pixels in the photos"
Audio problem happened. Speaker phone is ok but the regular volume is very low. I maximized all of the audio volumes but still the volume is very low.
"I've had a cell phone for over 20 years and this is the WORST phone I've ever had!No matter what you want to do, this piece of junk does whatever it wants! Do yourself a favor and get a different phone."
"This phone became so frustrating to me that I had to replace it a month later with a Google Pixel. The biggest problem is its RAM is so meager it cannot keep more than one app open at a time. So if you are in the middle of something important and you answer a phone call, forget about it...whatever you were doing is lost because that app will close in order to open the second app.Additionally the phone takes forever to power up and it cannot accurately record its location using GPS apps.There's a reason this is a ""budget"" Samsung phone. Never again."
Would give zero stars if that were an option. Phone advertised as an A15 5g it clearly is not. Phone is also listed as unlocked clearly it isn't. Completely false advertising all the way around the board! So now I've spent over 100 dollars on something that is completely useless to me!
The information for this cell phone stated that it had Wi-Fi calling and when I got it it did not!
This phone is super slow!! My daughter broke my Samsung flip so I decided to try and save some money and got this one. I'm thinking since it came out this year it would be more up to date. Boy was I wrong. It lags and doesn't allow alot simple features I thought were a part of apps and not the phone I had. Just horrible purchase😢
Where is the charger cord? I want one with the usb end so i don't have to buy new stuff to charge my phone wtf. We bought two these both with the same bs cord. And how about one longer that 2 or 3 feet.
"The phone seemed like it was going to work great until about 2 weeks in. It definitely has a mind of its own. One day my husband needed to call 9-1-1 to get help for me and his phone wouldn't let him make the call. Since then, it glitches all the time. It will not open apps or will open the wrong app than was chosen. It won't open files when needed. We have had to restart it multiple times. We are extremely disappointed in this phone. I wish I would have saved our money and just bought a quality one instead. My husband doesn't need a lot of fancy features, but he does need a phone that let's him make phone calls and open an app on demand."
"The phone does not come with a charger so you must buy one separately if you want to be able to use a wall outlet. Also, USB-C only connector is not compatible with automobiles that have built in the standard USB connection. This also means that you will not be able to physically connect this phone to a computer that does not have USB-C."
"I dislike this phone so much i actually waited 4 months to see if it was me or the phone. The key board is designed to be so inconvenient all three set ups, there is no vibrate unless you go to settings each time. The texting letters type the letter next to the letter you want so this message is taking double time. That word double i just typed in the last sentence took 4 different trys! 😠 I know its not the seller its samsung"
"i had to purchase separate charging cords, since the one that was included could not be used"
"I've been following OnePlus 's products since the beginning, just never had an opportunity to get one. It's a fantastic, smooth, and FAST experience. It's a quick phone, yet great battery life. It has massive camera lenses that poke out a little, which I'm not very keen on but they look very cool. Fingerprint scanner is on the right side which is fine, but the scanner is very sensitive. It will often unlock itself by accident just because I simply slid the correct finger over the sensor not-knowingly; not a big deal but present. The display is amazing, clear, bright, and responsive. The UI is also very customizable, it's pretty cool, The phone comes with a pre installed screen protector too. Theres this cool feature the phone has where you can also designate up to 4gb of onboard flash memory to RAM so you effectively have 12gb of RAM which is gnarly, this is the only phone I've seen that can do that.Update and revision: so my unit bent, and it did indeed have a case, a very sturdy one. The phone bent just above the finger-print reader and just before the volume rocker, and bowed it significantly. The screen didn't crack but it was visibly warped. It seems this unit may be fast but it can't handle the simplest of pressure, and I suspect there probably isn't any metal reinforcement on the chassis either; straight plastic and glass. The back panel is also prone to being scratched and scraped by literally anything that's semi hard. Sand, dust, just being slid across a table it seems. Not a big fan of paying almost 350 bucks for a phone that warps in under 8 months. I switched to a Razr flip because at least that's designed to bend."
"Initially I loved this phone. It has great performance along with great battery life to match, but I discovered the one major flaw this phone has that was a deal breaker for me and made me initiate a refund. It uses basic glass only for the screen which means the huge screen on this phone is going to be very prone to cracking if dropped due to the lack of protection that Gorilla Glass offers. The screen is HUGE and I feel like it's only a matter of time before I drop it and it cracks. Gorilla Glass makes a huge difference and it's a shame this phone is lacking it. It is otherwise a great phone, but I do not want to spend 300 dollars on something that will inevitably crack."
"This phone has some design issues. The power button and the volume buttons are on two different sides. And it design to use the power button +the volume button to take a screen shot. It will screenshot almost every time if you use your left hand to activate the phone.Plus, it doesn't recognize my micro sd card after one update. My sd card is working when I insert it on my windows, and my phone can not see it."
"Dam... A new phone. I gotta start all over again learning the functions of this phone. I had my old phone for 7 years, but I know that it will become 2nd nature after awhile. It's really a nice decent phone. Way more than what I had in the past... Just gotta get use to it...  One thing though. It does not have speed dial 😲... WTH!!!!  Won't buy another one for another 7 years hopefully.... PeaceAlso OnePlus Nord N30 phone need more options... Such as reminder alerts & some sort of 🚨 flashing of a alert reminder. There is NOTHING to let you know that you have a message, alert, missed call, voice mail, notification if you step away from your phone for a few minutes then come back to it... You have to remember to check it for missed whatever... I don't like that about this phone... People drive as myself & sometime  you have to step away from the phone for a minute or two. No indication of missed anything. Upgrade that & this would be a top tier phone in my opinion 😡... I almost want to return this phone cause of this missing important feature... My old phone had that feature setting... Alert/notification every 2,5,10 minutes until you answer or respond to the alert/notification... LG Stylo Plus... Man do O miss that phone, but it's a 4G phone.... OnePlus need to step up there Nord N30 & others w/this feature...."
"I bought this phone because it was cheap and I had to buy a phone right away since my old one was giving up on me. Good things about this phone is that it charges WAY too fast, which is awesome, and its a good looking phone. However, the battery will not last long if you use it frequently such as watching videos. Also it cannot be charged with a wireless charger which I was hoping it did."
Really like how the phone looks and feels. It allowed me to transfer my old phone data to the new phone. But the battery gets drained out faster than expected. I charged the phone upto 100% in the mornong. And then I played some video clips for about three hours. And browsed some websites. And by midday it went down to 50%. It's a brand new phone and it shouldn't have this issue with it. Kind of disappointed. So I am returning the phone.
"Edit: 7 months later, the headphone jack no longer works. The headphone jack was half the reason I got this phone. Moving/deleting photo files sometimes fails, which baffles me. Sometimes apps are very slow to respond, and I have to close and restart app. Camera is bad in lower lighting situations. Downgrading from five stars to two stars. It's an ok phone, but you get what you pay for. If I needed it for more than connectivity, this phone would be returned. Inferior to my last two Samsungs by a long way.First review: I have a Samsung s22 Ultra. I've been having battery and connectivity issues, not being able to use roaming data, spotty 5G where I should have it, etc. Went from a regular SIM to an ESIM and nothing got better, so I decided to try an inexpensive backup.Got this phone based on reviews. The biggest negative I could find online about it was regarding haptic feedback, which I always turn off because haptics irritate me... so that's a non-issue. There were also a few comments about the OxygenOS, but I use Nova Launcher on all my devices so this is a non-issue.So far so good. Once I received a physical SIM from my phone company, and got it installed... I immediately had excellent connectivity on my network, around town and when traveling.The pluses are the headphone jack, microSD card slot, battery capacity, and of course the price. The package includes a VERY FAST charger, which is amazing. Also, it was very easy to mirror my Samsung to this phone via USB-C to USB-C... only had to install a few particular apps. It runs all the apps as you would expect, like Spotify having connectivity on all your devices. Bluetooth connected perfectly to my vehicle, my Yamaha guitar amp, and laptop another devices for transferring files etc.As for negatives, the camera was a big downgrade from the Samsung, it's nowhere near the quality. And it's noticeably slower running some apps. I expected both of these things to be the case, but the performance difference is greater than I expected."
First off for $250 this phone's a steal. I came from a Motorola one ace for $350 2 years ago and it does everything that phone did and little bit more.my only major gripe is for some reason this phone only supports super fast charging on its own proprietary standardand that is the only way you'll get fast charging. I mean why reinvent the wheel power delivery is been around for a long time now and supports at least six different voltages and at least three of them cross over into oneplus's proprietary standard so the phone could definitely charge on them about half as fast but insted they lock it so it can't. I can't in good conscience rate it anymore than three stars if they're too terrified to support universal charging standards that seems kind of ridiculous and a blemish and otherwise nearly perfect budget product. The main reason why it's important is if you have a laptop steam deck or another device that uses USB c power delivery you only need to carry one charger with you this phone will still charge slowly off of Power delivery but it seems to be hard locked at 5 volt meaning you'll only get around 10-15 watts of charge which would take hours for this phone to charge. Also being able to reuse charges from other manufacturers cuts down on a lot of e-waste that's unnecessary the first R is Reuse.
If you don't need your phone to do things quickly and you don't mind photos that are low to mid quality then this is fine. If you're used to an older flagship phone you'll probably be disappointed. The battery life is pretty good but this phone's fingerprint reader is right in the wrong spot if you're left handed so that most of the time putting it into my left pocket it will be unlocked and running simply because my finger touches the sensor but it is just the natural spot for my finger to lay. Overall the phone gets things done but it's just  not impressive in any category.
"This is a smartphone for less than $300 and you get exactly what you pay for. Some pros: the battery is amazing. It will last all day on heavy use. The processor is quick enough for email, web browsing, video and music use, and some basic games.Cons: the screen is very finicky. Often tapping a back button will somehow result in a double-tap. Scrolling down a page doesn't feel like a smooth glide but more clunky. The cellular reception on phone calls is quite poor. When indoors and on a call, often times you will be able to hear a caller but they are unable to hear you. The camera is also about mid-range quality.All in all, if you're not trying to spend $1000+ on a phone, this will fulfill your needs. If you need something with better quality and performance, the Nord series isn't for you. Please take this 3-star review as a badge of honor. It's exactly what you are aiming for with this mid-tier model."
"It's fast, user friendly, customizable. I love the 3.5mm headphone jack and extra SD card slot! I love this phone! But the camera is so bad I'm almost wanting something new 😭 I think it could be salvaged: it seems like software/AI retouching BS, cause all my photos just look like I asked a bot to produce them. So beware! Everything's great but the camera."
"Shuts off automatically & very slow kinda disappointed after such good reviews!! Seems durable and packaging was nice, though?!!?"
I have no problem with the seller. I do suggest getting even a OnePlus 8t or a 8 pro because this phone is even slower than those. Even the camera is bad.
I have Samsung phones for quite a while now before I decided to try this phone. The first time I put on my polarized sunglasses I realized I could no longer read my screen. It looked completely black. Since I was driving and using Google maps at the time this was problematic. When I got to my granddaughter’s school and had to scan the code to sign her out I found that this was not straightforward at all. Only required one more fairly simple step but I have found it only works maybe two times out of three. This one goes to the bottom of the drawer as an emergency backup only.
What I like about it is the size what I don't like about it is I couldn't even turn it on so I sent it back
"Likes:  the battery life seems very good, even if running many apps.  the big charging brick and gimmicky red cord charge really well, including other phonesDislike:  the phone takes a long time to boot up and to power down.  the method of turning the phone off - simultaneously holding the POWER ON and VOLUME UP is a disaster!  Half the time only the volume button responds, the rest of the time the shutoff screen appears then disappears!  Most disappointing:  I don't think I am going to be able to get it to work with Tracfone.  I have been with Tracfone's tech support for five hours over two days and they have not been able to sort it out.  I get 2 or 3 bars on the display but an unable to make or receive calls."
"They (most reviewers) said it was overstated, but that was an overstatement.  The camera image and video quality is very poor throughout.  This is simply true, and should have been mentioned by reviewers.  Well over a decade old in expected quality.Everything else about the product is above standard.  Seriously cut the corners extrmemely hard on the camera.  Somehwat dissatisfied, but I needed something of rugged quality as well, something lacking in phones with much higher quality cameras."
"Does everything I need, call, text, chat, work related apps. The processor is not so powerful so HD videos can be stuttering sometimes. Good enough cell signal domestically and internationally.The reason for only 3 star is the terrible button layout. The fingerprint reader is on the power button on the right side of the phone. Directly across the phone are the volume up and down buttons. So whenever I need to turn off the screen, I would squeeze the phone to press the power button, and often press the volume buttons at the same time, which the phone would register to take a screenshot, or prompt you to shutdown the device. It's annoying enough for a 3 star which would otherwise be a 5 for the price and provided features."
"Can't give 0 stars or I would.Phone works fine.  Except for making and receiving calls (which is really important, you know, for a phone.  I thought I had a sim problem, but after getting a new sim it's the phone.  I can do everything except reliably make phone calls.  Sometimes it works, sometimes not.  I think there's a hardware problem.  From what I've read on some groups this has happened with other one plus phones before.  Not sure but it sucks.  I take the sim out multiple times and I can finally get it to work for a while then back to no one can call me and I can't call out.  Voicemail works though.  So does everything else.  Google voice calls, texting, Internet etc.Update:  problem is permanent, multiple working sim cards tried on the phone.  phone was sent in for repair on warranty.  They reflashed (reset to factory settings) my phone and sent is back.  They said it connected to the network fine.  Well I'm always did that but wouldn't make or receive calls.So now it's back and forth with OnePlus to get it fixed or replaced.  They want my to talk to my network provider. And ask them what?  The sim card works in all our other phones but the 3 I have that work won't work correctly in the one plus.I would not recommend this phone or company."
"When someone texts me, the phone rings. I can't delete a message unless I open the message then delete it. And a few other things that I noticed but whatever, I loved the first Nord phone but either I'm just not technical smart or this Nord phone is a bit dumber than the first one, is😔😞"
I got this phone because it's in the middle of the road on price  it's not a $100 POS and it's not a $1000 price gouge either.It's a decent phone biggest problem is it freezes up from time to time and I havent figured out what is causing it or why it's doing it.  It's so frustrating tapping on something and your phone does nothing.  Especially when your trying to show someone something. My phone cost me $270 anything over $250 is to much for this phone imho I wouldnt buy this phone again for that price.  Plus it didn't come with a charging block it had cord but no block now come-on that's just being cheap
Cheap with good performance but lacks some basic features in favor of gimmicks. With a damaged screen I can't recover files because it won't be detected as storage.
"likes -speed, game performance, screen refresh rate,dislikes - base keyboard, google ""needs"" permissions and data collection to run, side buttons are fairly indented without much rise, cant adjust 5g without developer mode enabled making for spotty connection and dropped signal constantlu, or you manually set to only use 4g.but my least favorite thing about the phone is size, its fairly too big and youll need 2hands ir put it down so you can reach over."
A great phone but there is a strange issue. I have had many cellphones and never had a screen that attracted dust and dog hair. Screens get fingerprints and saliva from talking but that is normal. I find myself constantly cleaning the screen! It is kind of discusting.
Camera is too much hyped. But not worthy
"So far it's ok....just want to talk and text and maybe take a picture.,. doesn't have enough power to talk from my house....when I'm out and about seems to do ok"
I dont do a lot with my phone. I play a couple simple games during the day on it. I take a few pictures here and there. picutes are fine only problem is the zoom. Only has a normal and 3x. I had seen the reviews and thought it would be ok. But im not happy with this part of the phone and the processer seems to be a little on the slow side also. i can deal with it can you? Watch some Youtube videos about the phone to make sure you know what your getting.
Great phone minus camera; I'd still be using this phone if the camera was completely a potato.
"Phone is nice, I really loved the camera, I love the AI helping to increase the picture quality, I liked the phone itself since it had a great weight feel, and nice LCD display. Only two problems, one is it doesn't display 2160p on youtube, that's just a negative for me personally. Also I ordered this phone to be new but I feel like I got a newish one, because mine came with a screen protector (been a few years since I've last bought a phone so I don't know if that is the norm now) also had a couple scratches on the screen coming out of the box."
"** DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE **From what I read online it seemed like a great phone for the price.  I was watching for the phone to come down in price and it did.  Bought it well in advance for a birthday present.  However I later learned some information was not correct on the Amazon site for the device.  In fact, a grave error was made about compatibility with some carriers.  Though it clearly stated on Amazon that it did, the phone does not work with my carrier at all.  So, I ended up with a paperweight and an utterly useless cell phone.  Bigger problem?  I discovered this error after giving it to the person on her actual birthday.  By then, too late to return it to Amazon.  Would the OnePlus Nord company allow me to return it?  After weeks of fighting with them, they refused to issue an RMA for reimbursement.  Wouldn't help at all!  Do not buy this phone or any phone from such a dishonest and unhelpful company.  I'm out over $200 on their mistake.  Terrible customer service.  It's the epitome of customer NO-service."
"The screen auto brightness feature sucks. It constantly changes it darker. The phone has become warped just from putting it in my pocket. Some apps seem to act up on it, where I never had an issue on my other phones. You have to open a separate app to read QR codes, not just open the camera. Among others. The battery life is good though."
This phone is not prefect bcz the calls network is zero the phone network has problems
"For the price, I shall not complain too much though I've noticed the touchscreen isn't always receptive and intermittently lags a bit."
"I have started using OnePlus since Oneplus one and always my favorite brand. This model feels cheaper make and bulky. I rather stay with the higher end OnePlus like 11 although having a screen issue recently. I have a feel that although Oneplus keep adding feathers to their phone, the quality control doesn't keep up."
"This phone is better than the Samsung A15 by far. Runs smoothly and charges fast. My biggest concern is china talking all my personal information. My biggest peave is the app for screen recording is has a time limit. So If you are not paying attention you can miss recording a large portion of time. I purchased this phone with extended memory to screen record my classes, Sometimes they save but most times they will not. I have lost already countless days of classes that I will never be able to replace. The screen record was the reason for purchasing this phone. In the short time of testing this phone this app has cost me much stress. something to be aware of."
"CPU quality is pretty slow or old type, play multiplayer shooting games or  MOBA, even RPG games, and will stuck pin, pictures not respond, and the Poplar cash app does not function on this phone dispoint. but cheap phone prices just have basic function choices. not good enough basic game quality, even game setting video set on lower setting,."
"I had a OnePlus Nord 10 that I bought new and unlocked in 2021. That has been the best phone I have ever owned. Previously I had always had a Samsung Galaxy. It has a ton of storage, the battery life is crazy long, it's fast, and I absolutely loved it.  Well three years later, the battery wasn't holding a charge very well, so I decided to buy the next generation of the same phone. I bought a new unlocked OnePlus Nord 30. I was so excited to get it. Well, I have had it now for about three weeks and other than the battery life, I have nothing else that is positive to say about it. I dislike this phone very much. The buttons, the layout, the unnecessary features. There have been good reviews, but my experience does not support those. I am having a new battery installed in my OnePlus Nord 10, then putting this one in a drawer as a last option back up. Why would they mess with what is what I consider perfection?"
"I bought this phone after my previous phone got smashed. As one of the few phones in the market that still has a 3.5mm headphone jack (and because I had heard good things about OnePlus), it was the phone I settled on. It worked fine for exactly eight (8) days before suddenly turning off right at the start of my work day. I plugged in the charger to see if it was perhaps a problem with the battery, but nothing changed. I tried to restart it by holding down the power and volume up keys. I was relieved at first when the screen lit up, only to be brought down to hell when the screen went black while I was in the middle of inputting the pin. I only had it for a week before it gave up on me."
"I didn't even open the OnePlus box it came in.  It was scotch-taped close and with the 'DO NOT ACCEPT IF SEAL IS BROKEN' sticker seals cut.And then there's the 'THANKS TO YOU, THIS PRODUCT HAS A SECOND LIFE' sticker.Nope, had my return sticker printed within 10 minutes and then ordered the same phone directly from OnePlus."
"I bought this phone to replace my pixel 4a due to poor battery life. I absolutely love everything about the pixel line except the battery life. But this phone is the worst phone I've used in awhile. It's extremely large and heavy, clunky system, takes awful pictures (no better than a flip phone), and would occasionally freeze just after a few weeks use. Thankfully I was still within the return time frame! The only good thing about this phone is the battery life. I decided to upgrade my pixel to a newer one instead."
"I got this phone as an upgrade from my N10 when the screen broke. I didn't want to spend a ton of money and I was familiar with the brand, so I went for it. Unfortunately, the issues I've faced are - in my opinion - unacceptable for something I spent almost $300 on.- Bedtime mode lets notifications through if you don't also set it to turn on Do Not Disturb. What's the point then? This is unacceptable.- The built in photos app has no option to overwrite the existing photo with your changes, so you end up with duplicates of all of your cropped and otherwise edited photos. The camera also just sucks. No improvement over the N10.- Gmail notifications don't have a mark as read option. You can archive emails but that's it.- The fingerprint reader is too sensitive. I'll feel it going off when I'm setting my phone down, or I'll lock my phone manually only for it to immediately get unlocked.- Tap to wake is unreliable.- ""Close all"" doesn't close all apps! Yes, if you're currently in an app and you choose ""close all"" from the app selection menu, it'll leave that app option. There is no option to change this.Just awful. I've never been so disappointed in a phone, but there's nothing I can do besides live with it for now."
Phone is very but doesnt work with my honda crv car for apple car play otherwise everything was fine
This phone was pretty good for the first month or two then it took an absolute nose dive in performance. The screen stopped working in most spots. The volume buttons are in s crappy spot and only works half the time. Whenever I would go to check the time I would take a screenshot when I didn't want to. It's just not worth it. Look somewhere else because this ain't it. It's not even a good budget phone. I've bought better phones at Walmart for $60 and they lasted longer and performed better.
Doesn't work with Xfinity mobile carrier so check first if your carrier works with this phone and don't waste your money
"Phone forces you to update to the newest android version, and it breaks the phone. It constantly unlocks itself, and I've opened apps I didn't mean to open too many times to count. Previously it was fast and smooth, now it lags on the simplest of tasks. There are way too many features that you can't turn off. If you hand is by the camera on the front, it will turn off the screen because it thinks you are in a call, and they got rid of the option to turn that off in the last update. You cannot use custom launchers with the navigations gestures, it glitches out and will not respond sometimes.All in all, it's been a nightmare phone that I really wish I could get a refund for. Stay away from OnePlus, they have upped their prices and lowered their quality so much in the last few years."
"I got the Nord as a cheaper alternative to more expensive models. I previously had the 7T and it was fantastic, only reason I don't use that phone still is because the USB port cant hold the cable long enough to charge anymore. Anyway, the Nord 30 whatever has the single worst design choice I've ever seen on any phone, which is that the fingerprint scanner is also the button that opens and closes the phone. You see the problem here. If you push the button on the side to lock your phone, it will activate the fingerprint scanner and attempt to immediately unlock. And if you use anything other than the fingerprint that you set it up to read, then it gets upset. So basically, you can never actually lock your phone on purpose, you just have to wait for it to lock on its own. Whoever made this design choice, I hope they are a janitor now, I hope the university calls takebacksies on their masters degree, and I hope their spouse filed for divorce and that they get custody of the kids."
"This phone is getting old, and it shows.  Id say only get it if you get a steep discount."
"The phone is fine but the camera app doesn't capture accurate location info. Switching to a 3rd party camera app solves the problem, but that shouldn't be necessary."
I was sad to discover that I switch to this phone because my previous phone battery lasted for one day before it needed to be charged. The new purchased phone was the same - I had to charge it the same day after regular use - not even for hours..Applications are crushing etc. Not satisfied at all.
"The phone is real nice , but the camera is real poor quality , and the battery runs out real fast even after all power saving options! real SAD!"
"I was sent a used phone with the packaging damaged/already opened with the tamper seals broken, smudges on the phone, and a screen protector installed.  Will be returning and ordering one more time... Hopefully the phone arrives new and I can update this review."
"Definitely a bidget phone. Alot of ossues with the display being glitchy. I am a oneplus fan, this phone is a bit of a disappointment for them."
"I'm having issues with texting, gesturing, and a bunch of other stuff. i've tried transferring data from my old one plus (Nord N10) and it has issues with that too. Mine might be defective as not many others complained. I was excited about it, but it's not a good look out of the box having issues."
Battery life was great initially.  Took 2-3 days to run down.Suddenly the device now only last 10-12 hours.  Perhaps apps now running in the background???  Just not the same power after 6 months.
"One plus used to be great... not anymore it seems. The phone itself is amazing. Good camera, big screen, big battery. But I cannot excuse it for falling apart in 1 year."
"Using this phone is like trying to walk across a room up to your armpits in nerf balls. Ya have to wade through all these popups telling you what you could do or should do with all the services it offers. And it uses an old, slow Snapdragon chip. And it can't connect to Verizon's call messages."
Delivery was delayed.Second Sim Slot is not working. Getting disabled by itself.
"I rarely write reviews however I thought it would be important to let others know that although this phone is great when it works, but it frequently restarts countless times out of nowhere, which is quite frustrating. I don't think I have ever had any phones throughout 15+ years that restarted so many times. It's ridiculous. Even with the latest OS updates, it still reboots consistently - while not even doing any major tasks. Simply surfing the web or listening to music can cause it to crash. I have read other reviews with this problem but didn't think too much of it as it was in the minority, until I had experienced it myself personally. It is such a shame as I really wanted to like and keep the phone, but the phone is just too unstable. The number of times it just reboots is absurd and unacceptable in this day and age. Even my old phones lying around does not crash or reboot like this phone."
"The phone is a great value if operating system overlay had all bugs fixed. The Oxygen 14 update from OnePlus caused call screen and message screen to not display when receiving a call or text. Phone is ringing and no way to answer most of the time, never showed full screen on calls, sometimes would get a banner, sometimes nothing would display. Great phone and value if they can fix the problem, saw on Internet that they're working on it but I can't wait without a working phone. Disappointed"
"My son's phone started to have an issue with the phone erasing SIM cards, happened multiple times.  I contacted OnePlus for a warranty replacement.  They expected me to ship the device and them have it for almost three weeks and then let me know if it can be repaired or replaced.  What is my son supposed to do for work and school?  They do not have a normal replacement process.We are just going to throw away this phone and go buy a name brand phone now so if something goes wrong, we can be supported properly."
My device came with the screen guard on. I don’t how to react to it. I thought it would be new. Now I fee like it it’s refurbished. What should I do now?
"This is a great phone. Runs smoothly, lots of memory no lockups. I've had it for about 6 months, maybe 2 or 3 system updates now. The home button fails to work still about half the time! Its a software or firmware problem, because you can see the indicator when I push the home button, just doesn't do anything. You have to press it 3 or 4 times, then press the button left of it then press the home button. Hey Oneplus! Fix this issue with one of these updates! Stay away from this phone! Don't buy this phone!"
Even with developer options enabled there is no way to get the phone to remember USB connection pref for file transfer. I use my phone heavily for this - moving images and files and a pain to have to keep selecting that option when plugging in. Had the phone for a day and after reading multiple forums I find I am not the only one that has this issue and no fix so returning. I was really hoping to like this phone as I got it for expandable memory but the hassle of not being able to easily access file makes this selling point worthless to me.
"The phone stopped ringing after 8 months. I Contacted customer support, and mailed the phone back to the service center for repairs. That was August 30th, 2024. As of today, October 17th, 2024 I cannot get an answer to the status of my phone. It appears that the customer service is handled out of the United States. I really need a new phone, or my original phone replaced in working order."
I am changing my review because over time this phone has become just obnoxious. I don't care how much memory they claim this phone has. It lags in so many ways even on basic programs. It gets stuck on stupid way too often. Thought maybe it's the websites but have no problems when I use other phones. The only things this phone has going for it is a reasonably bright screen and ok sound if you don't mind no bass notes at all .Camera is just average. Graphics processing is pretty bad. And running multiple apps at the same time will cause it to lag or get stuck on stupid forever. Even the kids would probably throw it out of frustration.
"Bit of backstory,dropped my phone(the first time ive ever dropped one believe it or not!)and cracked the screen so needed a replacement...saw the good reviews about this...and saw it for a decent price...went to buy it the next day,it had got more expensive,so didnt...couple of months later saw it again cheaper so brought it...Firstly the battery wore down to 65% without doing anything in a day!!went to take a picture..every one i took had a blue tint to it!!!unbelievable...and picture quality for a 106mp camera was not impressive!also wanted to transfer some pictures to my old phone via bluetooth to post for this review..it couldnt find my old phone even tho it was right by the side of it!!beyond disappointed not sure if it was a dud...but with all those separate issues i think not...i waited so long for this phone and all for nothing."
"I recently bought the OnePlus N30, but I am already experiencing some issues with it. The battery is not functioning properly as it only charges up to 80% and then stops. I reached out to OnePlus for help, but their troubleshooting did not fix the issue. Along with this, I have also noticed that some of the keys are not working properly. It takes multiple touches for the back key and speaker buttons to respond. This has left me feeling extremely disappointed and frustrated with my purchase."
I have att. Used mobile hot spot for years with no issues. Prior phone was a OnePlus 6t which worked. The mobile hotspot on the Nord N30 DOES NOT WORK! Which is a key feature for me in any phone I buy. I'm going to see if someone at the att store can help me resolve this and if not I will be returning and switching to another phone manufacturer. I'll update if they can fix the issue.
"I was excited to set up the phone once I received it. However within the first day of use, I ran into app crashes twice, and phone reboot once. For a brand new phone, this is totally not acceptable.I returned the phone right away. However, the seller's policy says if the phone is not defective, there's a 15% re-stocking fee. I certainly consider app crashes/phone reboots as defective. However how can I prove it remotely? Keep video recording the phone when I use it and wait until it strikes again?I would be satsified if I can get the full refund, even though I wasted one day of my time. After all sometimes there's just bad luck. However with the $45 re-stocking charge, I will have to blame OnePlus and the seller. I'll take that fee as the price I pay for a lesson, and I will stay away from OnePlus, and the seller, Cell Universe."
"I am happy with this product. However, recently I kept receiving Amber alert. I tried to turn off it, but it seems, it was set to ""Allow"" by higher level user, like manufacturer, I don't have the permission to change it."
The screen is a little washed out and the fingerprint reader is hard to locate
Battery goes fast. Went back to my 2021 moto G phone which has better battery life than this newer 2023 phone. I also don't like having to sign in over and over and over again w the built in security feature.
"I purchased this phone not expecting too much from it, given the price.  But after transferring all the data and info from my old phone, this phone does nothing but freeze every other time I try to use it. Like I said, I did not expect too much, but it should, at the very least, perform basic functions such as answering a call. It freezes halfway through as I am input the password to unlock it and then I have to hold the two buttons to do a restart. Not worth the time and money, but I figure I let others know about it. I will go back to purchasing from a more established brand. Very disappointed as all the youtubers are speaking highly of it, but in truth is a typical underperforming phone."
Overall pc of ...Nuw I have to our hade a REAL phone.
During the phone call the audio becomes one way - most of the time you don't hear the other person but they can hear you and occasionally it is vice-versa.  The only thing I can do is disconnect and call again.I have given the input to OnePlus and waiting to hear from them.
"Just received the phone, one sim card from Metro doesn't work on the phone but a different sim works.And the problem is not the Metro SIM card because is working on the old phone.So that's it, be careful is not fully unlocked!"
"Please never buy this crap , Always hang up and shut off while using, One plus has a credibility and dependability, but lost the faith in them."
Very cheap Card holder that is hard to add 2 cards and will break easily. The company doesn't even sell their own parts and will give you the runaround as they have told me 3 times that they will escalate this issue then always come back that they have no parts. Without a sim card holder the phone is useless. I have added a 2nd response where they say they Don t sell spare parts but if I pay to send my phone there they will repave the tray with the spare parts THEY CLAIM TO NOT HAVE. So remember that when buying from NORD or ONE PLUS
Pretty much overnight the phone went from not needing a charge all day to crapping out in the middle of the afternoon.  I foresee the phone not holding a charge for more than an hour soon.  POS.
Don't get it if you actually want to USE your phone.  The screen does working after 2 MONTHS and their support is garbage tier
"I couldn't last a week with this phone. It seams like OnePlus has abandoned their approach of using a stock version of Android by loading it with shovelware. On top of that, the touchscreen sensitivity is off, the cameras are horrible, and it behaves bizarely overall. What other phone do you need to grant permissions to use the built in clock app?"
"Bought this phone mid August, now 1st of October.  Worked fine for about 1 months. After I could not return it, it started acting up. Can't get on the Internet away from home, I have tried everything to get on.  Alarm goes off everyday even though I have none set.  Mostly I just want to be able to use the Internet when I am away from home.  It's a big deal breaker for me when it cannot be used. Giving this one away and buying a Motorola which I should have gotten in the first place.  So disappointed with this phone!!!!!  I would return it if I could."
"The phone was dead on arrival: would not turn on, even after charging overnight. Fortunately, Amazon refunded my money immediately."
"no case included, very disappointed"
"Sporadically restarts for no reason.  It'll go weeks without any problem, then it'll start doing it again.  Still can't figure out why it does it, but it is especially frustrating when using GPS to have it restart and you miss a turn."
"Update.A few months after purchase, now after a new OnePlus update, the Internet won't work when off wifi. Still makes calls and texts over data, but no Internet or gmaps over data.Pretty garbage. Waste of money.______________________________The phone itself is great. However it will not work with Verizon.It works with straight talk using T-Mobile towers only.Or it will work with T-Mobile"
Avergae kind of product.
So I ordered the phone as new. When I opened the phone up it already had a screen protector on it and the SIM card holder was all scratched up!
"While it may be carrier unlocked, good luck unlocking the bootloader. If the stock ROM isn't an option for you, have a look at the Nothing Phone(1) instead."
"SAVE ME TIME, READ  THE 1 STAR COMMENTS  AND THE 2's AND THE 3'sTOO MANY  BELLS & WHISTLES  AND THE ONLY THING I CAN COUNT ON WORKING CONSISTENTLY ( NO MATTER  HOW OFTEN  I RESET MY SETTINGS)  SOMETHING ELSE  GOES HAYWIRE!  LOST $$'S  AND WHAT THE HECK  DO I DO WITH IT  BUT  TOSS IT  SOMEHOW!  RESPONSIBLY!"
Perhaps the worst phone I have ever used.  A basic failing is there is no ability to call or receive calls via home wifi.  Would imagine a simple software patch would provide this but numerous contacts and queries were unanswered. Because of this failings likely will be tossed and money wasted but am holding on for this simple fix.  What gives? Forgot the FCC requirements for broadcast via wifi?  This lack of Wi-Fi makes this phone often useless.
"Screenshot function is not really working, other than accidentally, you can't watch YouTube movies,even in the lowest resolution,it's not running smoothly. Some functions are acting very randomly"
"The phone has great features and arrived new. However, the phone operation is slow and the screen freezes pretty often to be a new phone."
"double tap to wake not working often.Ms teams having so many issues in this phone. sometime not able enter text in chat box. Unable to silent the incoming call. Sometimes when I make call, audio not reaching other end.Sometimes when I touch one key, nearby key is getting recognized. so many issues..."
"Terrible phone, bought in replacement of a s10 Samsung and I was absolutely disappointed the entire time, games laggy, any more than 2 apps open laggy, was just terrible, then all of a sudden it got stuck in a endless loop of restarting, I would not buy this phone, stoped working about 2 months after purchasing and was glitchy out of the box"
Difficult to deal with
"Purchased this phone and once set up out of box I tried to use the cameras to see the quality.when using the front facing camera the app will freeze or crash within seconds, when using other apps that use the front facing camera the same thing happens.Tried to contact oneplus directly for help and they wanted me to pay to send it in for repair.would rate 0 if possible."
The camera and battery life are not as per expectations. The quality of the images taken from this cellphone is very bad as well as the battery drops very quickly.
"I ordered a new phone and the package came with the seals broken. It had already been opened. While I am returning it, it is a huge inconvenience as I need a phone now. Very disappointed that an item listed as ""new"" was actually ""open box."""
"I got this phone to replace my old 4g TCL 30 phone, and I'm pretty meh about the whole affair.The good:It's a reasonably priced unlocked android phone, it works with Mint Mobile (and therefore would work with T-Mobile and Metro, ymmv) and is lightweight and slim. It receives and makes calls and takes pretty good pictures, though I'm not a big picture taking person, so others may have issues, don't know. The 5G service is quite nice and allows for a better connection when we are out in the country than my old TCL 30 4g. The screen is vivid and the look of video/pics/etc is pretty good.The bad:Everything is Google, there is no native barebones alternatives like my old TCL 30. It's annoying being asked to set up all the different google apps every time I need to open one... If I wanted to use all the features of each one, I would. Ex: I just want to see the pictures I've taken, I don't want to be reminded to set up the app to save my pics to the cloud every damned time I open it. I use it to take pics of electrical schematics so I can complete my work without returning to the stand book to verify different connections etc ... It's almost like Google saying ""are you suuuuuure you don't want to"" every time like I'm a child or something.... It's very annoying and slows me down.The UglyBattery life is absolutely horrible. My old phone, with the same battery size, could stream Spotify to my earbuds through an entire shift and not be less than 60% battery, even after 2 years of doing this every Mon-Fri for 9-10 hours a day. The first day I used this Motorola the same way, my battery was down to 30% when I punched out to go home. That's absolutely pathetic. If it wasn't for the fact that this was a sub-$200 phone, I would have returned it and gotten another TCL phone. This is the main reason I gave this a 3 star rating. If you don't stream music all day like I do, or use it all day like a younger person then it would probably last longer. As with most things, your milage may vary....Another serious negative is the button arrangement and shared capabilities, I'll explain.The phone has the typical up/down volume button above the power button on the right side of the screen. The issue comes when the power button is also the fingerprint sensor. It's nice to just brush it to open the phone, but it's absolutely annoying when taking a screenshot or trying to restart the phone. It seems to just spaz out when hitting up volume + power button for a screenshot to restart, or any of the other button combos the phone is capable of.Overall, for someone who doesn't stream music it's a decent unlocked phone, but for someone who actually does it's a no go because of battery life. That and the 'Bad' section above is why this is a 3 star phone at best. I honestly feel Im being generous giving it 3 stars as this is gonna be a $180 paperweight when unlocked TCL 50s hit Amazon...."
"Bought this phone to replace my 8 year old Samsung. Though it may be a small matter but I expected the charger as indicated the product description and what’s in the box. It was part of my decision to buy this phone. Get no satisfaction from the seller. My friend went to consumer cellular and bought the same 2024 version for$100, the difference pays for a charger.  Live and learn.After back and forth I received a refund to put towards the missing charger. As far as the unlocked phone:It worked when I went to T-Mobile I ultimately went back to AT&T for  my original service to preserve my discount.The phone needs to be charged every day and with my old charger block won’t even get it to100%. I hope when I get an updated charger block this will resolve the charging issue, even with battery saver on.At first thought it was too large compared to my old Samsung but my camera app is 100 times better with interactive thumbnails. Totally appreciate how fast it is again compared to my old version7 android.Like all new phones I had to delete nuisance apps as I just use the phone for talk, text , photos, email and  my household apps, not someone who uses it for games, shopping or banking.Haven’t taken any photos yet to speak about quality."
"I chatted with Motorola agent who insisted it's a carrier issue so I went to Mint Mobile website and make sure that wifi calling is enabled there and got a confirmation text which tells me the next step it to enable wifi calling on my device.  I can;t figure out how to do that on my device so I went back to the same Motorola agent, who told me to search for ""wifi calling"" under settings.  I told her there was no result.  She said that means my carrier didn't enable it.  I said I am pretty sure Mint has done whatever they could to becuz the Mint agent stayed with me for about an hour and went through all the possible steps (checked IMEI numbers, reset mobile networks, turn airplane mode on and off, etc ) with me, so the problems is with the device.  But the motorola agent just repeated the same thing AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN:  GO TO YOUR CARRIER.  So the problem is still there.  very frustrating."
"Using this phone for 4 months. Wireless charging is great. Cell tower connection is great even in rural areas. Battery life drops like a rock even though almost all bloatware is uninstalled and or disabled and blocked. To much Moto software installed which drains battery considerably. Charging fails from time to time so the phone has to be restarted to get it to charge again. Out of the box the phone is bloated with bloatware and spam apps on top of all the unnecessary Moto and Google virus apps. Slim design feels smooth in your hand with crisp screen display. Speakers are moderate to clear. Camera takes decent pictures. Price wise at the time of buying it was a good deal compared to other over priced, Google virus, Samsung virus and Apple virus infested phones. All in all unless you know how to completely take over the software to control everything in the phone, not recommended."
"For the price, it's fine. I bought this to replace a 5+ year old Samsung S10 plus. It struggled with playing some games, camera was slow to open, not enough memory so if you leave an app and go right back it ""forgot"" its place and restarts the app so you lose your place where you were scrolling etc. The phone was just a bit slow and laggy at times in general, definitely does not have the processing power of a more expensive phone. I ended up returning it and got an iPhone instead."
"I got this phone to replace a TCL 10L that was 3 years old and no longer receiving security updates. I have to say that this is the first time that I have purchased a new phone and not been thrilled with it. The phone just seems glitchy; for instance when I open my gmail even though I am holding the phone in portrait position in my hand, it opens in landscape. Not the end of the world, but when you start adding up little things like this it starts to get annoying.The Moto G Power 5G does have some things that I like. The fast charging is a plus, if it had battery life to go with it it would be great but the battery lasts a day at best.The screen is very bright and the adjustment is all or nothing, just a really bright screen that doesn't dim very well.The phone is big and clunky feeling in my hand - kind of uncomfortable to hold. You'd think they would have tried to make the design a bit more ergonomic.The fingerprint sensor on the power button is annoying, I had to use my ring finger so that I wasn't turning on the phone Everytime I picked it up.I'm not really thrilled with this phone. Seeing how it is only going to get one system upgrade I will probably get something else by the end of the year.It does get a 5g signal - it does that good, but the rest of the phone doesn't warrant paying what they are asking. Had to go with three stars ...."
"I just wanted to get a new phone because my 2021 Moto Edge hadn't gotten a security update in 6 months. So it was between the 2024 stylus and 2024 G Power then I thought about the One Plus N30. Clearly I picked the wrong one. Not impressed with this phone at all. Deal breaker for me is the sound, which lacks volume and my Bowers and Wilkins headphones have never sounded so weak. Screen is ok I guess. Performance ok I guess. I recommend spend your money on something else. I wish I would have. Glad I got my tablet."
"I read several great reviews for this phone. My old Moto G7 had started shutting off and I had never liked the tinny sounding audio it had, so after 4 years decided on this Moto G 5G 2023. The box had previously been unsealed and opened which I expected since it was advertised as ' used like new '.I ordered the 'Ink Blue' color.The phone I received is a  very very dark gray or black with subtle sparkle or metallic appearance. It seems to be the Black Mineral color, although the box it came in is labeled as 'Ink Blue'. The invoice states it is ' Ink Blue '.The charger that is advertised as in the box is missing. The charge cord did come in the box.This phone gets hot! I played a couple YouTube music vids on it and the phone actually got hot and vibrated from the music.I guess I misunderstood what they meant by ' used like new '.Even though I ordered the Ink Blue phone and received a Black phone, I probably could have kept it even though the adapter was missing, but I am afraid to use this phone as it gets hot so I sent it back.I've ordered several phones from Amazon in the past and only ever had one problem. They've always resolved any issues with any orders.I'm looking now at some other versions of Moto, Nokia and Samsung phones."
"I just bought this after a 3 year stint w my previous phone. Except for BLAND DULL video and pics it is a Fast responsive phone when the 120 refresh rate selected. Do not use Auto refresh rate.No other complaints, in short if you don't need a camera, get it, if not STAY AWAY"
"I have always liked the Moto Power phones, still have a couple.This new 5g always keeps stopping.Maybe I got a bad one.My Moto 7 still works great and it's old."
"LAGGY!! Does not keep apps running in the background and all progress is lost. I would be on a website, have to go get a code from my email, then when I return to the website it refreshes and I've lost the opportunity to enter the code, have to start over. Many similar issues because it doesn't seem to keep the app in memory when switching to another app.So slow as to be almost unusable."
"I got this phone as a temporary phone because my z flip 3 quit working and I needed a cheap place holder until I could order a fold 6. Anyway, for about a week it was actually surprisingly snappy. It initially exceeded my expectations, because I was expecting a sluggy phone right out of the box because I mean, cheap phones like this, you get what you pay for, right? Right. After a week of having this phone, it's gotten sluggish. I don't even have all of my usual apps on it because it was just meant to be a placeholder phone. There is noticable lag typing on the screen or when I tap something, sometimes it takes it several seconds to acknowledge the tap. As far as the camera goes, forget it. Colors are washed out, dim lit pics and vids have tons of noise on them. The post processing of the pictures also adds a touch of blur to pics and it is a touch too much. The one thing going for this phone is the battery life. I'm a very heavy user and I can go around 2 days on a single charge. If you can afford to pay more for a phone, do it. Unless you want a sluggy phone and poor picture and video quality."
"I have to say that I'm not impressed.I can't return it because I sold my old TCL phone already. The TCL had a much better camera and the screen was responsive, unlike this heavy phone.I thought Motorola was a good choice but I won't make it again."
Had it 5 weeks and the screen is worn where you swipe back
"If it had NFC, never got it to work for Google pay.  After a year it seemed to develop problems like freezing or locking up."
"I waited a month for a pair of these phones. Amazon kept moving the shipping date out over and over. When I'd call, I'd get the usual lip service to get me off the phone. They kept asking if I wanted to cancel the order. The cost went up just shy of $100 per unit after I order them, so I think they were trying to get me to cancel.As far as the phone. They connected to Verizon flawlessly and have been great. These are a good phone without a ton of the new bloatware. They also have a crazy amount of internal storage."
"I got this phone because I needed a comparatively inexpensive one pretty quickly after my previous phone died, but I would not recommend it to anyone else. Within 6 months it's become very slow (and I have plenty of space on it), the battery life has significantly decreased, and it struggles to keep playing audio from one app if I open another. For example, if I'm listening to a podcast or music on Spotify and I open any other app, the audio will often stutter and pause and then stop entirely. It takes a while for apps to open, especially the camera app, and it takes several seconds to actually take a picture - sometimes 5-10 seconds, by which time it's often sort of useless. It's slow to switch between apps and then the apps are slow to use. It also does not show some of my sent texts. I send them and they just disappear on my phone. I had no issues with the seller or delivery, and the phone worked ok for the first few months, which is why I'm giving two stars. However the issues it's having within only 6 months of buying it lead me to recommend against it."
On quite a few Motorola phones over the last 6 years but this one is an absolute piece of junk. And the reason it's a piece of junk is because Motorola has messed with the basic Android that Google supplies and calls it Motorola Android and Motorola has no competent programmers to be messing on anything that Google puts out for programming on phones. These people were not even smart enough to put in a selection to look at all the apps that are installed. They only put in a selection to look at the most recent apps in the default apps. The standard Google Android has both. I'm trying to save you from wasting five or six hours of your life trying to set up with this thing so that it'll actually work and has the stuff that was on your old phone to use. I'm going to add to this that the notifications have stopped working properly. You spend more time trying to administer this phone instead of being able to actually use it to get any work done. And I would never ever consider doing any online banking with a piece of crap phone like thisUpdate when I got this phone somebody had set the gestures attached to the power button to turn on Google Assistant instead of restarting the phone. It's taken me numerous hours to finally figure out how to fix this issue. In my opinion this was not a new phone but it was advertised as new.Update 9/4/24 This phone is like all the other g series I have owned since 2022 which is 3 of them.  All of them have this uncontrolled scolling problem where the screen will all of a sudden scroll at speed up or down. This has been a problem with the last 4 Motorola phones I have had.  I have turned it in to Motorola twice now and they have done nothing to fix the issue which is about par for Motorola customer service.  BE AWARE IF YOU PURCHASE A MOTOROLA PHONE THAT YOU WILL NOT GET QUALITY CUSTOMER SERVICE.Update 10/28/24 the previous part of this review relates to the Moto G5 g that I had. This current part relates to the brand new one that is less than 30 days old and has a absolutely horrible screen on it. It is washed out text especially the small text and I frankly just don't have the energy to go through another replacement process. This is just a poorly designed phone. I've owned at least seven or eight Motorola phones over the last 6 or 7 years and this is absolutely the worst piece of junk of all the phones that I've owned from Motorola
Sad to say that this is not the best cell phone I've bought.  Hubby and I tried two of rhem and were nor happy.  They seem disorganized and difficult to use because it's hard to locate the features when you want ro use them.  We ended up getting iPhones.
"So far no other problems, just have to charge it without its original charger so it is probably slower."
"At first this phone might seem like a good deal but then you have to go buy Motorola's 30w Block. Using a different brand block results in inconsistent charge speeds.I do wish the size of the phone was under 6.5inches. It is a bit big for my liking.The texture of the backing is cool but will wear out faster than most.The camera is just ok, nothing crazy special.I miss the under display fingerprint reader. Having the reader on the side makes the phone vibrate anytime something else touches the sensor.The rest of the features found in the Moto G Power 5g 2024 are nice to have. As I explore the device more, I will try to come back and add more details."
"2023 Moto G 5G - Ink Blue. This thing can't hold a charge. Brand new out the box and bleeds 1% every minute. Battery Saver helps, but still bleeds 1% every few minutes. Not watching videos or anything major."
"I bought this for my husband as a gift. I just remembered to give this review, as I had to review the Motorola screen protector also. The charging power cord that was included, doesn't work. It also didn't come with a plug either. He had to use a different USB-C cord that he uses for another device, to charge it up. I would just like to have the cord replaced with a better one. It would be nice to get a fast charging plug with it too.The only thing that he reported about the phone so far ( besides the power cord ), was that when he swipes to the 2nd screen, it makes a weird streak on the screen, which disappears. He is also disappointed in the lack of accessibility features, such as making the light flash when there's a text message, or phone call, there are other accessibility features that he said are missing, or not very easy to navigate.He's a bit disappointed in the fact that there's no dedicated e-mail app, except for Gmail."
"I searched for “Motorola cell phone with NFC support”. The results offered “Moto G 5G | 2024 | Unlocked | Made for US 4/128GB | 50MP Camera | Sage Green” (ASIN B0CWHXVLXG), with a cost of $169.09. However, there’s the same phone with a different color $20 cheaper: Motorola Moto G 5G | 2023 | Unlocked | Made for US 4/128GB | 48 MPCamera | Ink Blue, 163.94x74.98x8.39 (ASIN B0C2SWQBMB). So, I purchased two units of that one. When I received the phones today, I discovered that they don’t support NFC! I came back to the product’s detail pages, as I remember asking Rufus specifically about NFC support, and this was its answer for ASIN B0CWHXVLXG:The product information shows this device has NFC connectivity.""Connectivity Technology : Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, USB, NFC""""Connectivity technologies : Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, USB, NFC""Today, I discovered that, if I ask the same question for ASIN B0C2SWQBMB, this is the answer:The product information does not specify whether this device has NFC capability. Motorola's website also does not list NFC as a feature for this model. However, I would recommend checking reviews from other customers who have purchased this product to see if they have commented on the NFC functionality.This is misleading and confusing. Why a cell phone would have NFC if it’s color Sage Green, but won’t have NFC if it’s Ink Blue? I want to return both phones, but Amazon asks me to pay for the return myself and I'll get a refund of up to $20 from the return costs. However, sending the phones back from Costa Rica costs $160 per phone, approximately. So, I'll be paying more for returning the products than what I paid for them. It doesn't make sense."
"I bought this phone to replace a 3 year old Pixel 6 with screen issues. I figured that a newer phone might nearly match my old phone, but boy I was wrong. Here's my assessment:Pros:Inexpensive when bought on saleLarge screenGood battery lifeAttractive iridescent backQuick fingerprint readerCons:Multiple installed apps that are advertisement supported. Many can't be removedSlow boot up120 Hz screen is noticably laggyNot enough RAM to use more than 1 app at onceDead zones in corners of screenCan't play HD videoMy biggest issue is the installed advertisements. Swipe right on your home screen, ads. Check the weather, ads. Multiple ""folders"" preplaced on home screen are ads. There are many better options without ads at this price point. I do not recommend this phone. Buy an inexpensive Samsung or a refurbished Pixel, steer clear of this Motorola. You'll be happier in the long run."
"I wish I had just gotten a new battery installed in my old Moto.  :(Cons:1) SO MUCH BLOATWARE!  Out of the box with 100 apps!  You can not uninstall most of them2) A lot (but certainly not all) of that bloatware is from Motorola services. They spam you TO DEATH to sign up so they too can track your every move and sell your data.  Endless notifications to set up your Motorola account and activate all the crap that you can not uninstall but desperately want too!3) I cannot get facial recognition to work.4) Transfer did not work right:a) A new phone has always been painless. This time, many of the apps I do want and use had to be set up and configured again.  4 days later I am still finding things that did not transfer and still don't work right.b) Days later and I still have my old phone on my desk because I can't get some stuff to work on the new phone.c) Ring tones/notification sounds! I have had Moto phones since they did their first smartphone.  I have used the same sounds for things for YEARS -- that should have transferred too but those sounds are not even on this phone. So now I have to learn all new sounds - is that work e-mail or personal? Is that a work text or personal? Not a huge deal perhaps but VERY annoying when stacked up with all the other issues.PROsGood battery life"
I have had Motorola phones for as long as I can remember. Awesome cameras kick ass battery life. I had the previous model power 5G and for some reason it has been a turd the battery never holds a charge the camera is awful nothing like the previous models that I've had. Bought this one and it doesn't even come with a charger what the hell? Hopefully the battery doesn't go tits up and the camera will take a picture more than 5 ft away if not this will be the last Motorola I ever buy.
"I like the phone. It replaced a Motorola G04 that stopped connecting away from home due to being incompatible with Mint. The strangest issues are having to go back to a home screen before being able to pull down notifications (what is THAT about?) and keyboard unresponsiveness. Have to practically punch screen icons to open apps. The green is almost black. At this point, just don't know if I'm keeping it."
"It's alright for $180 but a long way from the normal $500 phones I buy. Good kid phone as someone else said which I'll probably do. Screen brightness is terrible outside. The interactive dark screen capabilities, (answering texts, notification viewing without actually lighting up display) which is why I used to buy motos are only useable when an actual screen lock is utilized which I will not do. Typical clean fingernail corporate ignorance in this day and age..."
"How can you use a phone you can't charge?  An update started automatically at 60 per cent (factory charge), battery ran very low, but since I couldn't get it to charge further, the update paused and couldn't be stopped. The the phone is now unusable.  Being disabled I am not sure if I will need to go to a store for more equipment.  Now I have no phone at all since I have already switched the SIM card.The last phone (same Moto) at least had everything you needed."
"I ordered 2 of these phones for 2 different numbers. They are good phones for the money, however the battery in one lasts forever, even using GPS, Wifi, listening to radio all night but the other, just sitting on standby runs down in less than 24 hours. Poor consistency seemingly.Downsides; The clock display is totally goofy - double line, which cannot be changed or analog without numbers.Constant pestering from Motorola about trying one function or another or updating.No note taking app - very strangeMany of my favorite apps are not compatible with this device and replacements include adsGmail email app does not handle outlook very well."
The phone is ok for the price
The phone seems to work pretty good until I hook it up to my car. The sound comes out very bad. A lot of interference. And then when another call comes in it's a screeching sound that can't be tolerated. I'll have to return it. I ordered one for my wife also. I just tested it on my car and it works good. So I'll be returning this one and ordering a new one for me. Otherwise the phone seems fine.
"This phone is garbage. I don't know if it is the phone or if it is because it's an Amazon bot phone but I will say that Motorola phones have really gone downhill over the years. I bought a moto X4 in like 2014 and it still is working well today. This phone is garbage compared to that phone but they were the same price. This is my second 2024 Motorola G G5 and they are both glitchy and do things on their own and quality just sucks. I have also purchased four or five Google pixels 6 and 7 pros from Amazon and they all bit the dust after a year with the same exact issues. Battery wouldn't take a charge and the cord wouldn't respond while trying to charge. I've never had this kind of bad luck with a cell phone ever which leads me to believe it's because they are Amazon phones, bought from the corporations fixed or defective refurbished."
Had issues with phone crashing and freezing
Poor quality the screen I already cracked Two places.
"WARNING, this phone, despite being produced in 2023, beyond the era that all phones have NFC...it does NOT have NFC. I got rid of my old samsung 7 which has no trade-in value (thats how old it is) and THAT one had NFC. and this brand new phone does not. wild."
"I got this phone last week and have been sorely dissatisfied. I only replaced my 3 year old moto because I broke the camera lens, and I wish I hadn't gotten this one. Everything is slow. If I switch to another app and switch back, no matter how quickly, the app refreshes itself. The camera will make a noise and show a preview like it's taking a picture, but when I go to the photos, it didn't actually save the picture. The camera also takes a couple seconds to take a picture on the standard camera mode. Taking screenshots is a gamble. Sometimes just opening the recent apps makes the app your trying to screenshot just refresh so you lose what you're looking at. Other times, it just freezes for a few seconds and says ""Screenshot Failed"". The finger print scanner is also unreliable. I had to put in 5 sets of prints for the same finger just to get it to work most of the time. The ""Multi Volume"" also doesn't work like it used to. I know it's turned on, but I'm not sure if it's actually doing anything. I click on the volume for the app I'm in and it the slider controls both the app and the overall phone, so it's not very ""Multi"" in my opinion. The volume buttons are also not very responsive. They only work about 70% of the time. I will definitely be returning it."
"I really liked the specs and the option of having an audio jack, but alas the deal breaker for this particular model - no OS updates past Android 15 (although security updates will be updated for 2 years). Too bad. I was looking forward to using this phone as my main driver."
"I have yet to experience the 3 day battery. The set up is overly easy. Like it's made for a dumb blonde who can't do things. I honestly hate that when I try to opt out of things it feels like the AI of the phone won't let it happen and will opt back in without my approval. If that's a bug the it really needs fixed. Definitely not a Samsung, and Definitely not helpful."
"It says 50 MP camera, but honestly the camera is just worse. Your happiness of buying something new will disappear from your face once you see its camera performance. Please note it. Thanks."
I got this phone this week and it it's okay. It's very big. It constantly turns on to promote news stories and if I'm working it'll make me touch it in my pants accidentally and screw up what I'm listening to. Very annoying. Bluetooth doesn't stay connected either.
Battery sucks and screen crack the 1st time I dropped it even with protected casing! More cracks since then but the screen saver has kept it from getting worse. Not buying another Motorola. Bought a battery pack to keep phone charged when I don't have a 110 outlet.
I got this phone because I bricked my s23 at the water park and needed a budget replacement. I've had a few Motorola's in the past and they've never had the best cameras but this phone made me feel like moto had just given up on the camera. I went back and found pictures I had taken on my original moto x from 2014 and they've taken steps backwards. I couldn't live with the camera and returned this phone. Its too bad because all other aspects of the phone are great for the price.
"Updating my review x2. It was a 3 star then 2 and now 1 it just keeps disappointing and underperforming!! The phone's touchscreen is finicky and unresponsive at times, especially it's keyboard which makes responding to texts, writing reviews, and quick notes a hassle. The multi functioning is laggy. A LOT of stupid glitches from not opening ads on Instagram that I want to check out, so slow to open webpages they become unresponsive, and screen cut out issues (see above). The gestures Motorola put on are really dumb, randomly opening the camera and not knowing how I did it. The calibration is so off so picking an address to copy selects text two lines down!? Previous review said it was a great price but for how terrible it's been it really isn't. DEFINITELY returning and letting people know not to bother. A prime example of why Motorola is not up to snuff with high quality phone manufacturers."
"I've used only Moto phone for years.  They are reasonably priced, good phones with everything i need.  But this is the first Moto that does NOT have call screening.  I thought maybe it was in the settings but I can't find it. Shrinkflation on a phone. Wish I hadn't bought it."
This phone was only unlocked for Tmobile & Verizon. We don't use either one. Took our carrier FOUR HOURS to actually unlock & activate this phone! Buyer Beware alot of trouble for a so so phone
If you are buying this phone for any kind of rom modification I would look elsewhere.  These are not the same as the factory unlocked models on motos website.  Motorola will not issue a bootloader unlock for this device even though it's unlocked. And when hooked to comp I seen why.  In the boot log or variable under carrier it says something weird I forget exactly but I think was rufis.  Anyway talked to moto tech guy and he immediately asked did you but this thru Amazon. I feel like that should be in atheist the fine print on website.  The phone would have been cool tho if not for that
I live in a rural area. My previous phones have been able to pick up a signal but this one seems to lose the signal more often.
"90 day refreshed returns ENDED????? So I ordered a phone and I ordered a case and I use the exact model number on both, the phone doesn't fit the case and I don't know which is the problem but there's a year after the model of the phone so apparently every year this model phone changes go figure, the phone locks up it won't connect to Wi-Fi without an update but it won't update without being able to get on the Wi-Fi so I'm kind of stuck here and did I mention the phone it's just pure crap? I mean I know we're trying to refresh phones and save money and buy not new $1,000 phones but I mean this is just ridiculous I guess since I can't return it I'll just donate it"
"I have used budget phones before. But somehow, they managed to sneak horrifically bad cameras into this thing. Could be worse than any other smartphone I've ever had going back to 2010"
The product description says that it's locked on both CDMA and GSM 5G networks. However when attempting to activate this device on total by Verizon it was a complete fail.
Not great even for cheap phone.
"Slow, slow, and slow"
"I""ve had it two months (one month past the return window). I have the Asurion protection plan. The phone had small issues to begin with, but now it is pretty much unusable. It closes programs I am using, the screen glitches, and it lags so much. I didn't get a video of my daughter's dance at dance class because the video program stopped working. The phone is in pristine condition, it has lots of memory left, the phone itself is just bad. Because it is outside of the return window, Amazon can do nothing. Because I bought it through Amazon, Motorola can do nothing. The Asurion plan is useless. I usually don't leave reviews like this, but seriously, don't buy this phone."
I had to get a relatively inexpensive cell phone this past year. I had had a previous Motorola and like the phone wasn't crazy about the battery life. I was hoping this one being a few years newer in model would be better. It isn't. If you need a cheap 5G smartphone with a decent camera and good features this is fine. But if you use it a lot you'll be frustrated with the battery life. I probably will not get another Motorola when it's time to upgrade in the future.
My sis is having a lot of bad experiences with this phone. Sometimes you can't hear her or she can't hear you or just doing it own thing when she called Motorola they say it might be bad system
"My previous Moto had no issues but didn't have the storage I needed; it only had 64gb. I decided to get this one because it has more storage, and a payment plan was offered. Aside from having more storage, the notifications are questionable. I usually keep my phone face down (preference) and notice that notifications don't come through. The phone needs to be face up to get them. However, that's not always the case because sometimes when it's face down, and I mean ""sometimes"" at a most minimal, I'll receive a random notification. I've gone to settings to see if there are options and there are none. The volume of the notifications varies as well; the volume isn't consistent. Some are quiet, some are at the volume that can be set by you, and some are louder than the volume it's set at.If you have regular, non-wireless ear buds, it connects from the bottom of the phone. To me, it's more convenient to connect from the top of the phone. Especially if you have a phone case that you can clip to your belt or pants, which I did purchase. Again, that's just me.Battery life is decent."
"This phone only audibly notifies me of texts about 1/3 of the time. Most of the time I only know I've gotten a text when I notice my phone light up... And yes, I've checked all the settings. It also restarts open apps each time you go back to them rather than continuing where you left off. I've found the scrolling to be extremely sensitive and the keyboard intermittently deletes the first word in a sentence as I'm entering text. This phone is completely frustrating. I've been very disappointed."
I have had 3 motoZ phones and loved them  but this moto G is garbage the night vision doesn't work photos I have took just disappeared when I go to open up a app it just goes to a black screen and I have to go back to home and reopen the app my old phone was so out dated that apps I had would not work due to the software on the phone but it is still better than this phone absolutely garbage if this is what Motorola has to offer now then they need to stop selling phones so so disappointed
The  screen goes black and freezes when in a call. I’m not able to end the call or press any key while on a call.  Very frustrating
"I replaced a lost 2021 Motorola 5g UW with this device. I've always had poor reception with Verizon at my place of work, but my previous few devices have been able to connect to the network. This phone has no service 90% of my time at work, constantly unable to load websites or apps. I have essentially given up browsing on my phone while on lunch break, only able to use downloaded content. In addition, the restart and power up can sometimes stall for 15-20 minutes. The battery life is mediocre at best. The screen is nice and the sound from the single speaker is better than one would expect. It actually has a hard line microphone port which I very much appreciate. That being said, unless you're using this on wifi all the time, expect to be VERY disappointed with the device."
3 times this phone has frozen and had to be hard restarted. Very annoying.
"After owning several Motorola phones, this one is a disappointment. Constant connectivity issues between wifi dropping on and off and poor handoff between wifi and 5g when moving out of range. Two device factory resets, two carrier resets have not solved the problems. Support calls with both Motorola and At&t have not fixed issues. A new SIM card is on the way for the phone so if this improves anything I will updated this review. At this point, if you are considering this model, I would move on to another choice."
Phone is not good. VERY slow and glitchy. Sorry I missed the return window. Don't buy
"I bought this phone to upgrade from a moto play.  This phone boasts a long battery life, but that simply isn't true.  It last just as long, or short that is, as any other phone.  So don't buy this phone if you think the battery is going to last two days, because it doesn't.  With basic usage, sending text messages, talking on the phone, the average amount of web surfing, you'll find yourself plugging this phone in for a charge around 2PM.  But what I REALLY don't like about thos phone is the volume.  As far as phone's ringer and conversation volume, this phone has excellent volume.  The volume for music too is good.  But the volume for your notifications such as email, text messages, etc are EXTREMELY low.  Even with the notifications tab turned up as high as it goes it's extremely soft.  With my phone in my pocket I can't hear when I get a message.  This is super annoying and have no idea why it's so low.  I'm going to call Motorola to see what the deal is with this issue as none of my other moto phones has had this issue.  If they tell me that's just how it is on the moto g 5g, I'll just have to send this phone back as it's a deal breaker for sure."
Battery life is excellent.  Performance overall is ok but not up to my previous moto.
I was told it is compatible with Esim before buying. Now that i have it i cannot see the option. Disappointed! Decent phone for the price.
I purchased this phone because the SIM card holder broke in my old Motorola. That phone was great! And it lasted for years! This phone acts up constantly. I have to reboot it almost daily in order to stop all the freezing and auto-scrolling it does. This phone is a SEVERE DISAPPOINTMENT!  I'll NEVER buy another Motorola again because of this!! The company should be ashamed of selling such an inferior product!
"The listing clearly says that the phone is unlocked, and makes no mention of Verizon. Then why did you guys send me a Verizon prepaid phone that is locked to the carrier? It's not even possible to get through the first time setup without activating the Verizon SIM card. I need an unlocked phone, which is why I ordered a phone that says ""unlocked""."
"Description says 5G but when you go into settings, it’s a 4G phone."
"For the price point, it is a fine phone. It has dual SIM capability. 1 star loss as it can lag & the rest of the stars for how much Motorola nags you for updates (it says 22 notifications per day) that cannot be turned off. Nothing takes priority over the Motorola software update, not GPS, do not disturb, or the YouTube video of how to save a life. You will be interrupted by the constant nag of any update."
"We've had many Moto phones, and always had good luck. This is a solid phone, but for some reason the design of it makes the power button tougher to reach.  Every case we've bought for it has a cutout over the power button instead of a lifted button.  My wife has RA, and it's very difficult (and a little painful) for her to turn the phone on.  The volume buttons are raised, but the power button isn't for some reason.  I did reach out to Moto support, but sadly no help there either.  They had 4 or 5 cases for it, but all with the same design.Again - the phone is good, reception, screen, responsiveness all good - but for anyone with arthritis or other issues with their hands, I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
"the box the phone came in is not new.  It has been opened and taped shut.  It was not advertised as ""renewed"" but new.  So I am not sure I have a new phone and not renewed. The phone is in excellent condition, no scratches on the back or on the screen.  Just suspicious that it arrived in an open box that was taped shut and beat up."
"I actually logged into my account to see if I could return the phone, and realized I missed the window by 2 days.  That's on me.  Don't make the same mistake I did and purchase this phone.  Apps constantly close or won't respond, keyboard is laggy at times, phone speaker volume is poor. Camera functions suck.  Really the only good thing I can say is that the finger print recognition works flawless and it's located in a great spot.  Outside of that, this thing is trash.*UPDATE*. TRYING TO DOWNGRADE MY 1-STAR REVIEW, BUT CAN'T. NOT SURE IF THIS IS THE DEFAULT LOWEST RATING AMAZON ALLOWS, OR IF IT'S ANOTHER GLITCH WITH THIS INCREDIBLE DISAPPOINT OF A PHONE.0.0 Stars"
This phone makes me not want to buy another product from Motorola. The constant crashing is beyond annoying and it gets crazy hot.
"1. can't send more than 1 photo on ""share from photos taken"". 2. can't send any size video whether 10 seconds or 2 minutes. 3. no video share as a link option, called support and it's a fact for this model they said. Thus the deductive reasoning perhaps why no video can be shared at all. One can't even share it up to google or cloud, no option, phone says 5 second+ video is too large. There are no ""settings"" for camera/video but a different type of video extension yet that results in same no-scenario. 4. This phone is 100% useless, takes bad photos/lighting.  For a $250+ phone money must grow on trees."
"Worst phone ever. It constantly logs me out of my email and apps, even YouTube has problems running on this thing. I would return it but I missed the window by a couple of weeks, please don't buy this phone"
Phone is slow and stutters. Software is buggy! Does not pair properly with my car! Drops connections with my Bluetooth headphones! Drops calls constantly. Have gotten zero software updates since I purchased it. Not for $199 but not worth $1.99.
"I've had more Moto G's than I can remember, and this one just doesn't perform like the others. The lag makes it almost unusable, as if its broken. Started off minor, but now its frustrating slow when you need it most. Can't see much point in warranting a sub 200 phone. Will probably be my last Moto which is a shame."
"After almost month of use, the issues with connectivity were too frustrating to deal with anymore, and I had to return the phone. Wifi and cell service continuously dropped out, and I had to keep refreshing the connection (airplane mode on and off). When I put my sim back in my old phone, I had no issues."
Had the phone for 2 months and am having trouble with it. Return window has closed of course. doesn't always charge and now the screen keeps getting a shadow to it. Not worth the money
"The phone worked fine when I first got it other than the fact the charging port barely worked. However, a couple weeks in, the phone just started crashing constantly. Opening a simple social media app takes at least four minutes and around 10 crashes, and once it opens it'll probably crash within a minute. And God forbid you try to open Snapchat or TikTok. Keep in mind there is nothing apparently wrong with the phone, it's just like this. If you want a phone that has any basic functionality, do not purchase this. I can't stress it enough, DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!!!"
There isn't heavy usage and my brand new phone doesn't last anywhere near a full day
"Changes are not for the better.  They should keep the things people use.  My last moto was easy to set up.  This one won't set up properly.  Where is the HOME button, the OPEN and the BACK that are on every other phone I've ever used?"
"phone simply worked as a phone would not text receive or send.would not download news or anyinformation local or national .They only wanted to try to fix it over the phone after I had it checkedby numerous phone services.They kept hedging and did not want to solve the problem,only hopingthe issue would go away. Motorola simply sucks stay away and save yourself some greif.big ED K."
"Bought this phone for my mom. Somehow, she ended up turning on the accessibility feature so the phone would read aloud anything that you touch on the phone. Supposed to be for blind people I guess. But it's the WORST FEATURE I'VE EVER DEALT WITH IN MY LIFE.Can't scroll the screen, can't click anything, can't do ANYTHING AT ALL. Spent over an hour just trying to figure out how to get past the LOCK SCREEN. Had to use my phone to look up how to navigate my mom's phone while the accessibility feature was on.The most frustrating feature that could ever exist. Basically bricks your phone until you learn EXACTLY how to navigate it. Even then, it's GARBAGE. Whoever created and implemented the accessibility feature (which you can turn on accidentally by holding the volume button down too long), needs to be FIRED AND NEVER WORK IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EVER AGAIN."
"Broke right after return window which was a month. Less than two months the screen was completely unusable. Not only that, but most of these 5 star reviews are for another product. Scam"
Does not easily pick up Wi-Fi. Sensitive screen either mutes or pushes numbers on key pad if it's against your face
I barely used couple months and it’s broken now where I can’t see screen at all
"Do yourself a favor and don't get this phone. If you like to do things like listen to YouTube in the background, be prepared for it to crash every minute. After about a year, I woke up to an overheated phone with a blistered and melted port. Motorola offered me a repair for $300 and I laughed at them."
"Worst phone I ever owned.I took it to be looked at because every time I am on it, it kicks me off, back to home screen.Was told it had old water damage done to it.I made the mistake buying a phone on amazon.Very sad"
Ever since I got this phone it was very slow on the apps to type and in general a very bad quality phone I've never had this issue with Motorola in the past but honestly I wouldn't want another phone from this company if is gonna be this bad
"After watching videos and chatting with tech support, my only option is to return the phone. It never turned on, wasting my time and money. Back to Samsung I go."
"This phone is awful. I've tried 4 different chargers and none of them can make this phone happy. Once I get it to a spot where it doesn't notify me the charger has been plugged in every 20 seconds, if I bump it we're back at square one. Many of my apps freeze or close in the middle of use, the most annoying is Google Maps while I'm trying to navigate somewhere. I've had it for less than a month, so I guess I'm out a phone while I return it."
"the phone never powered up, even after charging and attempting reset.  Returned for credit.  This is a Motorola quality control issue.  Supposedly in stock, but many delays in shipping.... I would have rather had more delays and a functional phone."
"I could not get the SIM tray open, done everything I was supposed to but no way would it open..... brand new phone problems right out of the box....."
"They are sluggish, takes to long for anything to load, we have security cameras, the app usually brings up live view pretty quick but with this phone, whatever set it off was long gone by the time it decided to load. Might give up buying another phone, also got super hot while charging and doing anything on it for more than a few minutes at a time. Doesn't come with charge block"
Trusted places doesn't work properly phone keeps locking when at trusted places. No Nfc function.its fast but not sure I would have bought this if I knew what would and wouldn't work.
"Bought this to replace the Moto One 5G Ace that was several years old and had a damaged charging port. This phone is slower, clunkier, and has to be restarted daily or it will not reconnect to wifi after I leave home. The save games which ran well on the older phone lag on this one. Very poor purchase and a huge disappointment."
I didn't like how the lens protrude out so far that holding it I kept having to adjust the way I held it because I didn't want to smudge or scratch the lens..
"I was really looking forward to using this phone. It's new, it's shiny, it's fast, I liked the new features for the cameras (long exposure for effect), the night sight is improved and quite impressive, but that's where it ends. Here are the problems that I found:* The battery doesn't charge well. If I plug my Pixel 4a into a high current charger, I can recharge it from 20 to 100% in half an hour. The Pixel 7a charges up about 20% in the same time. In fairness, the battery drains much slower, but that charging behavior is disturbing. This was plugged in, I don't even want to see wireless charging, which is reported to be even worse.* The fingerprint recognition truly sucks compared to my Pixel 4a. It worked for a couple days, then simply stopped recognizing either one of two fingerprints. I also really dislike that it is in the front. They had the most brilliant implementation on the back, I don't understand why they gave that up.* The face recognition really sucks in low light, it is MUCH inferior to the Pixel 4, which could unlock in complete darkness, because of its IR sensor. The 7a doesn't have that. I ended up having to unlock with PIN the entire evening last night, because neither biometric solution worked.* I truly dislike the size and weight. Unfortunately, phones seem to be getting bigger with every iteration. The 7a is half an inch longer than my 4a, wider and a tad thicker, and almost 2 ounces heavier. I have fairly large hands, I don't know how people with small hands handle these monsters.* I was surprised that a phone that is 3 generations newer isn't all that much faster. I was expecting a screamer with the Tensor 2 processor, but my 4a can hold up just fine with that. Perhaps this is where we are at a plateau of performance, where more is not really needed. I don't do heavy photo editing, I have my computer for that, not quite sure what people need more processing power for. Despite the 90 Hz screen refresh, scrolling doesn't feel much faster.All in all, this was a very disappointing ""upgrade"". I returned the phone and will continue using my Pixel 4a until they come out with something that has working biometrics at a small size."
"I'm an android developer; I do a lot of research before buying a phone. I made a mistake buying this one and I don't think anyone should buy this phone. I swapped it for the Samsung S23, so I'll compare it with that in this review. It's $250 more, which I did NOT want to pay. I'm not a spender, but I guarantee you, save up some more and treat yourself better. You use your phone every day, trust me you want a better one than the 7a.(1) Battery life and charging. awful. This is the main reason you don't want this phone. This phone has 18W wired charging (roughly 2 hours to charge) and 7.5W wireless charging (roughly 4 hours to charge). The battery lasts about 4-5 hours. If you are like most people and use your phone for 2-4 hours a day, this phone WILL die before nighttime. Do you always want to carry a charger? Do you want the anxiety of worrying when you don't have a charger? Even if you think you'll be fine, what might start as a decent battery will be unusable after 18-24 months of use. That'll be an $100 new battery or entirely new phone.Pixel 7a: 18W wired charging and 7.5 wireless. Battery endurance test: 76hrSamsung S23: 25W wired charging and 15W wireless. Battery endurance test: 101hrComically, the Samsung S23 has a 12.5% SMALLER battery, yet lasts 32% longer.(2) Speed of the device. Google makes its own processors, with the Tensor 2 chip in this one. I expected very good performance given that it's the same processor they use in their Google Pixel  7 Pro phone. The processor is FINE for most things, but gaming is subpar. As a normal user you could get by with this, but just know it's SLOW and KILLS THE BATTERY. I used Geekbench, an app that determines phone performance, to compare this with the S23.Pixel 7a (Google Tensor 2 chip): 3191S23 (Snapdragon Gen 2 chip): 4950 (155% difference)Here's the GFXBench score, a frames-per-second stress test that shows game performance:Pixel 7a: 62fpsS23: 110fps (177% difference)(3) Cameras: excellent, of course. Pixels have some of the best cameras in the industry. You might think this phone is worth it for the cameras and it is, so long as you have a charger with you everywhere.Pixel 7a: Ultrawide and regular camera. Takes pictures that look less premium, but are more true to life and have the best detail. The camera also comes with some crazy AI editing features that Google loves to advertise.S23: Ultrawide, regular, and telephoto (3x zoom) camera. Takes pictures you might expect from a professional camera. Very contrasty, lots of colors, better camera performance. As an amateur photographer, I prefer the S23 because I like color and contrasty.(4) Software. Both these phones will have 3-5 years of upgrades, thanks to new Google and Samsung policies. Google Pixels have the best of the best Android features, simply because Google owns Android. Samsung uses a modified version of Android called One UI (5.1). This one is up for personal preference. One UI has WAY more features, controls, settings, etc, but it can be a little intimidating. Most people either love or hate Samsung's One UI.In summary--------------I spent the $250 more for the Samsung S23. The 7a was one of the worst phones I've ever owned and the S23 is hands-down the best phone I've ever owned. The price really hurts your wallet, but if you use your phone every day, the little things add up. You might think you can live with the awful battery of the 7a, but after a year or two I guarantee you, you'll want it replaced. Would you rather buy a new phone/battery in two years or buy a better phone today that might last you 3-5 years? You'll save money AND have a better phone.Please, please do not buy the 7a. The S23 might not be the right price for everyone, but look at these alternatives before you make the mistake of buying the 7a:- Samsung S23, a flagship, best of the best, but much more expensive.- Google Pixel 6a, last year's model. Better battery, slightly worse cameras, much cheaper.- Google Pixel 7, almost a year old and can probably get it for a similar price. Larger, better cameras, better battery.- Samsung A54, the mid-range Samsung. Comparable performance to the Pixel 7a with better battery but worse cameras and trade-offs in other areas."
"This is a decent phone in a lot of ways. The processor is powerful, the battery life is fine, the screen is okay, etc. Unfortunately, the software experience is absolutely awful. It often feels like a beta product.I must preface this with the caveat that I only used it for about 2 weeks before I was offered to upgrade to Android 14. I didn't much care for the UI of Android 13, so I accepted. This is supposed to be one of the advantages of having a Pixel, getting the latest versions of Android as soon as they're available. It's too bad then that Android 14 is hot garbage.Before I get into that, I'd like to discuss the issues I have with the hardware, specifically as it compares to the Essential PH-1. Here's a quick list of cons:1. The buttons on the side of the phone. This is not a huge issue, but it took me a while to get used to. I much prefer the button layout on the PH-1. Volume up, volume down, power, in 3 separate buttons, in that order. When I first got the 7a, I kept pressing volume down instead of power.2. The fingerprint sensor is awful. I cannot stress how much I hate the in-screen fingerprint sensor, which is not a convenient implementation. The sensor on the PH-1 is on the back, so I can operate it without looking at the screen and as I'm pulling it out of my pocket, using any available finger. It's just so easy and natural, and... it actually WORKS 99% of the time, unlike the garbage sensor in the 7a, which fails to recognize my thumb at least 50% of the time.3. Aluminum construction is flimsy and easily scratched. My phone hasn't yet gotten bent from living in my pocket, but I suspect that it's inevitable. Apple demonstrated this problem 9 years ago with the iPhone 6. The Pixel 7a is likely even less sturdy due to its plastic back. The PH-1 is built like a tank, and feels like a massively higher quality phone just sitting in my hand.4. It doesn't lay flat. Most phones don't. Still, this is one of my favorite aspects of the PH-1, as it never slides itself off a surface. At least the 7a DOES have the camera bar so that it doesn't sit crooked like other phones. (This can be solved by using a case, but I don't like to embiggen my phone with a case, so I don't use them.)5. The cutouts at the bottom of the phone are not beveled at all, so when I rest the phone on my pinky finger, they dig into it.6. The screen's aspect ratio is 20:9. I know super tall phones are a common trend in smartphones, but I don't get it at all. The last thing I need is a taller, skinnier screen. The PH-1's aspect ratio of 19.5:10 is far more usable. Not only for ease of touch input, but also for things like viewing maps while driving. The 7a is actually taller and slightly wider than the PH-1, but the usable screen space is significantly smaller.7. Speaking of the screen, it has a lower resolution and therefore lower pixel density compared to the PH-1. The OLED looks good, but the bright colors have a tendency to wash out text when I'm trying to read something in low light conditions. The IPS screen on the PH-1 doesn't visually pop quite like the Pixel screen, but it's noticeably sharper and easier to read in the dark, which is a tradeoff I'll take any day.8. Charging is MUCH slower. I can charge the PH-1 from dead to full in less than an hour. That means if I start to run low on juice, I can pause what I'm doing for 5-10 minutes and get a meaningful charge out of it. It charges so fast that I actually got used to NOT leaving it on the charger for any significant amount of time. The 7a seems to charge at about half the speed. It's not slow by any means, but compared to the PH-1, it's agonizing.9. Battery life is okay, but I feel like it's not significantly better than the PH-1. That wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the slower charging, and the fact that you'd expect better battery life out of a phone that is 6 years newer. Maybe part of the problem is the silly always-on screen feature, the point of which I still haven't figured out yet.10. It doesn't seem THAT much faster than the PH-1 despite the much newer silicon. It definitely loads ads better, but general app performance is only marginally more snappy in most of my use cases.11. No headphone jack, although the PH-1 lacks this as well. A headphone jack would have gone a long way towards redeeming this phone for me.12. It doesn't work with at least half of my existing phone chargers, including every cable I've tried in my car. I simply can't get it to charge in my car, no matter what I try.What's good about the phone?1. The screen is vibrant, though with the caveats of what I mentioned above. I honestly don't really care how the screen looks, I'm far more interested in how easy it is to read.2. The camera is very good. The camera on the PH-1 is terrible. That said, I'm not a photographer and I don't take pictures on my phone that often, so I don't really care about camera quality that much. Additionally, the software processing that the 7a does on photos tends to make them look artificial, which I don't care for. I do like the responsiveness of the camera and I'll take my 7a cat pictures over my PH-1 cat pictures any day of the week, but it's not really a meaningful benefit for me personally. I think most people care a lot more about camera quality than I do.3. The silicon inside this phone seems very good. It does get quite hot sometimes though. The PH-1 sometimes gets pretty hot, but it's far more predictable. The 7a seems to randomly get hot while doing normal things. I suspect this is due to background tasks in addition to whatever app I happen to be using.4. It's generally an attractive, minimalistic phone, although I would have much preferred a matte black back rather than the glossy grey, which looks cheap and collects fingerprints and grime.5. Superior haptic feedback. The vibration on the PH-1 is weird, it has a sort of ""ring"" to it when it does a quick pulse. Think of hitting a metal drum, how it has a long decay, as opposed to hitting something solid, which just makes a thud. The 7a vibration is tight and responsive.6. It can run GrapheneOS. I haven't made the switch yet out of laziness, but the more I use this phone, the more I want to de-Google it.Now it's time to talk about the software. Oh boy. Where do we start?1. ""Modern"" Android has far too much Google bloat. The PH-1 runs vanilla Android 10, and while there are Google apps included that I don't use, it's about half as many apps as what is included with Android 14. Aside from that, it's just blatantly obvious how much more data collection is now happening in Android, with the phone constantly prompting me to re-enable features such as location so that Google can better track me.2. UI bloat: things just take up more space or are organized in a less efficient manner for no apparent reason other than it looks different, I guess. The drop-down drawer at the top of the screen is the best example of this. It's so much more compact and easier to use in 10.3. Needless restrictions, like the inability to run 32-bit apps in Android 14. This means I can't run Swype, which has been discontinued. Google actually owns the IP now, but they'd rather you use their own, terrible keyboard. I can't stress how terrible the Google keyboard is. I swear it was better when it was first introduced than how it operates currently.4. Beta-quality OS experience. Basic UI features just plain don't work right. For instance, I unlock the phone, and I'm given the home screen background with nothing else on it. No dock icons, nothing. This is a FREQUENT occurrence. Sometimes, apps just close without giving a crash message. Earlier this morning, something happened which prompted me to write this review out of sheer frustration of the terrible user experience: the app-switching button, the one on the bottom right (which I use all the time), just stopped working altogether. I could press it and feel vibration feedback but nothing would happen. I had to reboot the phone to make it work again. There are more examples that I run into on a regular basis that I can't even recall right now. I've never had an Android phone with this many basic UI issues. It makes me wonder if Google is focusing solely on the Pixel 8 line of phones, and if I were a cynical person I might even suggest that they're doing it on purpose in order to encourage users to upgrade.All of this makes me long for the experience I had with the Essential PH-1 and its vanilla Android 10. That experience is shockingly better given that it's a 6 year-old phone. I wouldn't have even bought the Pixel 7a if it weren't for the fact that my PH-1's battery just stopped charging one day and I needed a working phone fast, and didn't feel like changing the battery again. It's really too bad the PH-1 didn't use a replaceable battery, because I'd be happily still using it if that were the case. I will not bother with a battery replacement on the 7a when it dies. Maybe the phone will work better with GrapheneOS and the removal of all of the Google spyware. It certainly cannot work any worse."
"128GB in 2023 is an insult. Tough screen constantly misreads touch inputs as triple touch. Google phones are typically decent but only adequate. As with all the other google phones dozens of features are missing including but not limited to hardware video output, headphone jack, card slot, automatic camera flash fm radio just to start.  Long term support doesn't mean much with hardware as outdated on release as a Nintendo Switch."
"This will be last update as I will start Amazon return process for my new Google Pixel 7A. I have tried all options and can not miss return window. Everything else works except Camera and PhotosUpdate 01-17-24: So far no response from @Google. One more thing- Fingure print Scanner has its own mind after putting screen protector on phone. Sometime it works after 1000 attempts (Exaggeration!). Most of time it does not. Never had this issue with Samsung. I will give benefit of doubt to Google... May be Glass screen protector is not a good quality one. Ordering new screen protector. Will see how it goes. I saw few reviews with Fingure print scanner issues specially in 7A. I am now thinking 7A is lower end, budget friendly phone so its bound to be of inferior quality. Wait.. this is Google phone, so it can not be!Will wait for google to respond. (I have doubts about that they will reach out as 7A is a low end phone, but will see.)Original Review:My first pixel. I was Samsung Note user till this point. I bought this phone few weeks back. It all went smooth after opening box. (Not as smooth as Galaxy) In week 2, camera suddenly stop working. It gives error the message (See Pic). I closed and open camera app 10 times but it did not work. So I thought may be it's one off thing and I restarted the phone, and camera started working again. I was not happy but well it's Google flagship phone, it has to be good. It happed 1 more time and I restarted phone but it just happened again today (Pic). I will have to restart phone to make it work again. By the way I do not use camera that frequently. So far I took less than 10 Pic so it can be overuse issue( if that even considered an issue !!) If this happens again I will return the phone. I want to make sure I do not miss return window.Google: Shame on you for this poor quality Pixel 7A product. I know you must have good QC but there is something wrong with it or you have software issue.Not sure if this is a common problem across all Pixel models. Be aware before you buy.I will post update. I hope Google respond as I do not think Amazon can do anything other than Return/Replace.Put 2 Star for now. Will remove 1 star if no response in 5 days from Google and we all return phone back."
"I've owned the Pixel XL, Pixel 4XL and Nexus 6P. All were google phones and all exceeded my expectations. I was hoping that would be the case with 7a.Pros1) The camera is excellent. It blows my Galaxy S23plus out of the water. In almost any environment, it gets a great picture 95% of the time.2) The software is excellent. AI, Call screening, basic PIM, Voice to text and more are A+. Android is refined and a pleasure to use.3) I found the size to be perfect. Having used regular and plus size phones, the 7a is a welcome change. It fits into my pocket and is comfortable to type on.4) The screen is great. Even compared to higher end oled panels, this is crystal clear and bright. The 90hz refresh allows the phone to fly through tasks.Cons1) The battery life is just not good. I had no issue with charging. I use a wireless charger for overnight refills and it was fine. Plug-in speed for a budget phone is very very good. The problem is the battery life itself. Even with no use and working close to a wifi router, the phone noticelably drains. Using it for checking whatsapp, podcast listening (through bluetooth with the screen off), web browsing and superlight gaming (Wordle) results in noticable battery reduction. I don't expect much of a battery when you do a lot of photography and GPS usage. But I mostly use it for light tasks, if at all. I'm below 55% in the late afternoon, even when I barely touch the phone. On weekends, if I use the phone for pictures and phone calls, it drains fast and I have to charge it. I thought this would stop after a few days, but it hasn't.2) The software does have some bugs. I still use the back/home/multi button set up. The home soft button stops working in the middle of the day sometimes and needs a soft reset. The fingerprint software cannot complete the set up on my phone. I gave up after a few resets.I am a google fan and wanted to keep the phone. Google has to get the battery life to make it through a day. There's no point to good software if you're concerned you'll run out of power before you can recharge."
"I play genshin impact and experience stutters and lag and if i connect it to the power outlet it gets boosted BUT ends up getting too hot. Display isn't great but its fine. But you get tired of fine after a while. Other than that, the camara is good video better than picture but not as good as an IphoneXS at taking a daylight photo somehow. Battery lasts about 6 hours of usage which is fine but not great, I can say it has great audio EQ and range for playing music while you shower lol."
"I really wanted a phone with a great camera. Google Pixel is great as long as nothing is moving. This phone is completely inferior with any type of ""action shot"". I have a busy toddler and almost every photo of her is blurry. Also the fingerprint reader NEVER works. I've re-scanned my fingers multiple times, removed the screen protector, nothing works and it is SO anno"
"The Google Pixel 7a is a great phone for my use, especially since I use many Google products.  Even if you do not use many Google products, the phone has many redeeming qualities, e.g., a wonderful camera, clear audio, and more.  However, since buying the phone, I have found that it regularly overheats and then, powers down -- asking me to wait until the phone cools off.  Also, a fully charged battery does not last anywhere close to 24 hours: 12 - 15 hours is more common.  Further, the phone may or may not re-charge quickly.  You must have an appropriate charging cable, otherwise, re-charging can take a few hours."
"The phone functions work fairly decent. It's like an iPhone, but does Android stuff. However, I've owned this for about a week and I've had to baby this thing with updates. I turn my head and it starts whining about needing a new update, conveniently once I disconnect from WiFi. I'll update this if it stops acting this way in the next week or 2, but the score is probably staying a 3/5 because the fact it doesn't update fully while on WiFi and you have to start them manually is just to annoying to ignore. Otherwise, no performance issues to mention."
"I previously had a Samsung S9 for about 5 years but saw good reviews for the pixel and it's cheaper than the galaxy phones so I decided to go for it. I've had it for about a month, which I thought would be sufficient to get used to differences between the two that came down to preference but I'm still not impressed.This phone has some cool features to screen calls and wait on the phone for you when you're on hold but it doesn't make up for the other things. The galaxies have more personal options for wallpaper/widget set up, screen saver. The battery lasts a full day with moderate/heavy use but it takes 1.5+ hours to charge, using my Samsung's fast charger that would charge that phone in an hour. This phone didn't come with a charger or cable in the box so that's all I've got. It's supposed to communicate with a galaxy smart watch but doesn't. It doesn't connect well to Android auto in a 2023 car - it connects for about 5 minutes then it says the phone isn't responding, closes my GPS or whatever I was using, and I have to reopen the GPS and put in my destination and all that while driving, to attempt to reconnect it and have the same thing happen. I live in a mountainous area where it's illegal to use devices that aren't handsfree so this is especially problematic. The swipe feature isn't as good at understanding what I'm trying to type and the backspace button is oddly placed so I'm constantly typing lllll instead of deleting things or adding spaces instead of periods. Also on the Samsung you can use the enter bar to send your text if you want but you can't with this phone, you have to tap the send button on the screen. You also have to press the enter button on the screensaver if you use the pin, instead of it unlocking the phone as soon as you input the correct code. The finger (the swipe feature just put the word concert, dinner, and fiber instead of finger) print unlock is mediocre. I rarely had issues with that on my Samsung and I made sure to scan every side of my fingers when setting them up but it only works if my finger is in one specific position so I often end up having to do the pin code instead. You also can only add 4 finger prints so if I do thumb and index finger on each hand so I can't add my husband's.That's all the big stuff I can think of. Anyway, I've been very unimpressed with what I was told would be a great phone. I'm returning the phone and going back to Samsung. After this experience, it's worth the extra few hundred dollars."
I was now starting to enjoy having all my Google apps in one place with ease of use and quick processing but then my battery life started dying faster than usual and over heating when charging. Then before I knew it there was a bulge at the back of my phone. I've had this phone for 1year and 1 month. It's outrageous to buy a GOOGLE phone and suffer this faith.. quite sad. Of course I'm out of warranty now so will have to pay for repairs on my own if I decide to go that route. The camera front camera also over processws photos and pics aren't that vibrant. I've heard so many good things about pixels but this is most disappointing.
Phone is okay but why would you not include a charger you can plug into the wall. How are we supposed to charge it? Magic?
"The battery is a joke. It doesn't last as long as my multiple year old phone that I was replacing. You also have limited ability to customize the home screen (search bar unremovable) and the selfie camera is awful - photos look filtered. Phone runs hot during normal use (Internet/Facebook). Lowest volume setting is too loud, but loudest isn't loud at all.Do not recommend."
"I have been an Android user whole my life, for around 20 years I used multiple Android phones. For the past five and a half years I had the same Xiaomi note 5 phone that I adored. But I had a long way to prepare myself for a change, because obviously my phone was really old , yet worked like a pro, just memory was not enough for me anymore. So starting from may 2023 I started warming up towards pixel phones and opened myself to discover new brand. I have probably watched more than 200 reviews comparing all the aspects of pixel 7 and 8 vs other brands and iphone and understood that this could be a good investment for another five years for a budget phone. But unfortunately reality was something different.I have had this phone for the past two weeks now and I was so excited to get it. But there are major issues, that still could be pretty subjective, yet istlike to highlight.1. I can't edit any photos. It takes forever for loading bar to load, but the function does not work. Not a single image cannot be edited. Even though with the latest updates of photo application and operation system.2. Not all notifications work. I have couple minor businesses and I need to be notified via multitapps including Instagram. Yet it pops random notifications from IG, not right away.3. Nighttime camera does not work , do not trust reviews. Toy have to have direct light at night to capture something.4. Battery drains too fast.  I do not have any heavy apps or games , zero to be fair yet basic daily usage of the phone drains battery sooo fast. I don't even take pictures. Just read Kindle, an hour of Instagram for a day and couple of other apps for ten minutes, but the battery goes down really quickly. Plus, charging takes not 2 hours but around 3.5. Screen is not intuitive towards my gestures . Fingerprint and face recognition does not work all the time and it turns off the screen while I read Kindle.I really hope that those issues will be fixed, but for now I think it was waste of money to be fair. Hope to be able to get back and update my review , bit for now it's a solid two star phone."
"I had the Pixel 4a for several years before I could no longer charge it, and had the Pixel 3 before that. I was very pleased with both of my previous phones. After having three iPhones and getting sick of how expensive they were, I was very pleased to get and affordable phone that took better pictures.However, I am not pleased with this phone. Hey, maybe that's a good thing! I'll use my phone last and be more present in my day-to-day life.Sure, having my new Pixel 7a unlock my phone with my face seemed pretty cool, however, it often doesn't work when it should.Well that's okay! You can use your thumbprint sensor.This phone doesn't use a sensor in the back to unlock the phone, but it uses a thumbprint on the screen. However, the fingerprint sensor in the back of previous Pixels worked much better in my experience. Frustrating.I don't know what has gotten into the software of these phones, but my voice to text, which I use all the time, has gotten progressively worse. It will often make grammatical mistakes, like using the wrong to or too when it makes no sense where it is in the sentence.Also, what is up with my Google maps? It is so slow when I'm driving, causing me to focus more on making my turn than the road. This wasn't the case with my previous phones.And of course as luck would have it, I broke my screen within a week or so of getting it, but there aren't replacement parts out as far as I know. So I'm stuck with a broken phone that doesn't operate as well as my much older model.I did get there earbuds too, and they're fine. They're barely worth the extra money that I spent on them. Maybe I have weird ear canals, but they do not fit well at all no matter which rubber bumper I use. Also pretty disappointing.We will see how this phone ages with me, but this might be my last Google phone. Also, I should add, I had a Pixel phone for over 2 years before I knew that Google had its own cell phone service. How does Google sell its phones without making it clear that I can get cell service through Google? I honestly don't think they know what they're doing with phones."
"We bought two of these and set them up the same way, connected to same devices, etc. We've had three previous pixel phones and always loved them. Always connect to many of the same devices.Both of our phones are defective in some way. One has a ton of issues with the touchscreen so it's difficult to unlock, fingerprint reader doesn't work. It takes so much effort to set up a phone with all of the security these days that I am just living with it until I need a new one. But I honestly hate this phone.Our other phone screen works fine, but the bluetooth is messed up. It won't connect to some devices. Side by side, one phone gives response when trying to connect a new device (almost everything else equal on the two phones) for random bluetooth devices and will never connect to them no matter what we do. All settings are the same. Have even tried adjusting them in developer options and nothing works. The phone thinks it is connected but it doesn't work.So in summary, skip this phone unless you want a high probability of something being non functional on it."
Just know that the battery life is poor. Would not get you through a whole day. That's what is upsetting me the most because I believe that at least in this day and age you should get at least 24 hours battery life. And no I don't play games no excessive social media. The battery just dissapears. Feel I'm going to just replace my Pixel 6 screen
"Thought it would rock but it's just so so...battery not great, no can do for a sd card. Only 128G ...Came without charger..For $250...I ain't complainen... I got it for the extra sim, useful for travelling but otherwise mweh...also quirky...trying to force google products so again mweh"
"Generally okay, sound quality is decent, but battery life is not good compared to my old Motorola G Power. I also wish it had a headphone jack."
"Enjoyed this phone for over a year and everything was fine! Since the most recent update in September 2024, and they pushed to get users to buy the Pixel 9, my battery has been dying at roughly 20%. This is a known issue for many users. I was told that since my phone is a few months out of warranty I would have to pay for the repairs out of my pocket. Seems quite convenient timing to the release of the Pixel 9. I'm going to look at Samsung for my next phone."
"I like some things about it, like the adaptive charging, ability to sync all of my Google accounts on one device, ability to soften loud noises from incoming callers, ability to automatically detect songs playing on the radio. So along the lines of gadgety things, the Pixel is great.But the battery life absolutely SUCKS. Even since the first few days I uploaded my information and hardly used it, even though I've been charging it overnight pretty much every night, I have to charge it again at some point during the day. I can't usually use it while it's charging, because it gets really hot. Well, there are times when it gets hot regardless of whether or not I'm charging it. But that's definitely a problem I'm running into.It seems to be a sturdy phone, from what I can tell. And I like the Google features. ""Hey Google"" seems to work somewhat well. Slightly disappointed that it doesn't respond to ""Yo Google"" or ""What's up, Google"", but perhaps it will adapt to my goofiness over time."
"It's been 5 months since I started using the pixel 7a.  Today I bought an iPhone replacement.  Here's why.  The google sw eco system interferes with the use and enjoyment of this phone to such an extent, its unusable.  Example: take a photo.  You can't.  google insists you create a ""memories"" album and transfer your photos to their server.  Memories automatically tracks and stores faces.  YOU CAN NOT DISABLE this feature/popup.  If you don't do what google says, the popup continues to appear.  There are constant reminders to transfer your files to google cloud services.  You don't own the phone, google does.  they insist on taking your information and are betting you will eventually tire of dismissing the popups.  as part of the last OS update google reorganized the tools folders, further obfuscating the functions you need to find and disable to inhibit their data collection.  I think I could live with the data mining if it didn't impact the use of the phone, but the constant pop-up telling you do is 'in your face'.  This is 10X worse that either samsung or motorola and none stop.  You can reduce the interference by deleting your google account but your contacts, mail and access to playstore (apps) ends.  Buy the iPhone.I wanted a smaller phone to replace my motorola.  Researched online and selected 7a.  I've been using the 7a for 3 weeks and like the phone very much.  The size is exactly what I was looking for.  The display brilliant and clear.  Cell reception is incrementally better than my motorola.  There is some google bloatware on the phone that I disabled and if you don't want to link you private info with Google you need to spend an hour configuring, turning off features.  One new feature I like is voice to text, voice mail (you can view the voice mail as text) which saves time.  The battery lasts between one and two days, which is OK.  Charging is a bit slow because it throttles the current to improve battery life.  I would buy this phone again.  Its an intellegent and attractive compromise, size, cost and features."
"Let me start with I love many things about google, and even administer a Google Workspace environment  with over a thousand users. So I really wanted this relationship to work. I'm very likely going to send this phone backWhat I love: Yes this phone is fast, has good specs, has a very clean android experience. I'm sure the photos are great too, but I'm not a big photo user.What I hate! The Battery Life is bad. Like have to charge in the middle of the day. Also the finger print reader can only unlock the device maybe 50% of the time. I wear sunglasses a lot so falling back to face unlock is a pain.I came from a Motorola G7, which was a phone from 2019, and cost like $199. Battery could last like 48 hours with very normal usage. The finger print reader never failed. I would love to go back to a Motorola, but they do not offer enough updates, and security patches for their android devices. Maybe I'll go to Samsung? God forbid iPhone?"
"Constant popups to add stuff, really irritating. Calendar a bit clunky & email hard to specalize. Next time will pay more for different brand."
The battery doesn't last for the entire day with normal uses
I loved my pixel 4a but the battery life went down after year 3. Thought I would get an upgrade with the 7a. Had absolutely no other problems with the 4a. My new 7a doesn't stay connected to auto Android in my car and is constantly disconnecting .The fingerprint lock is absolutely useless.  I even have problems with the password keyboard as it will either not respond or respond with double input.  The touchscreen isn't always responsive. I've already had to do a manual restart because my phone wouldn't unfreeze. Service/cell reception is somehow worse and when using apps or Google and is slow at time. Very disappointing!
"It's 2024 and google produced an update which has destroyed reception.I've tried both TMobile and Verizon networks.  Before they both worked very well.  My wife's pixel 4a still works just fine and has great reception.  I have dropped calls, missing texts, etc.This ""update"" has been a problem for pixel 6, 7, and 8 devices.  Been going on for almost two months now.  Google doesn't even acknowledge it. Yet a simple Google search will tell you a lot.Never gain.  They simply don't take this seriously."
"From day one of getting this device, can barely get 6 hours of battery life on a full charge using the phone for very basic things  My previous phone was a budget 2 year one from a cheaper brand, and could get me about well over a day battery life on a single charge, for the same type of usage.Amazon were willing to refund me, but refused to send me a replacement phone (which was my preference, as my only issue with this phone is it doesn't deliver on the advertised battery life). All they suggested was I get the refund, and place a new order. This would mean paying more for the phone in Jan 2024, vs what I paid in Dec 2023.Approaching Google support also yielded no practical resolution to my situation, and was beyond tedious. Google support is some of the most tiresome inefficient product support system I've ever used. They do not read information provided to them, and ask for information already provided. All their replies take almost 24 hours. Initially they said the phone warranty expired (even though it's new, and will expire in December 2024). After I pointed out their error, they then offered to repair the phone. I appealed this, as I didn't see why I should have to repair a defective new phone under warranty. They then agreed to replace it, but only after I sent it back to them first.  I pointed out to them that I am a foreigner, travelling in the US, and bought this phone just for my trip. So, would mean me being without a phone for an unspecified time. Also, they couldn't guarantee when I would get a new phone, and refused to ship the phone to another country if I had left the US by then.It's just amazing in this day and age how very inflexible tech companies and e-commerce sites can be in the face of what are surely fairly common challenges customers face- like not being tied to one address, or needing to travel."
"Admittedly, I was probably spoiled because previously I had a 2-day battery phone. This one barely lasts a day and if you are doing heavy use like video and photos it's not going to make it"
"Not a fan. No manual so I bought a book. Little help. This phone tries to do stuff I don't want it to do but refuses to do the stuff I want and expect it to do. Few days I don't express how much I dislike (hate) this phone. Everything seems to be based on services not based solely on this phone. I still don't have easy access and management of my photos like I did on the old phone. When the contacts transferred not all of them made it. Sometimes I can't even answer a call because the buttons needed to do it disappear!The old Droid Maxx with 4.4 served me well for eight years until a lack of memory space, a failing battery and the antenna wiring was evidently damaged when a new battery was installed. This Pixel 7a w/14 will be lucky to be around for another six months!"
"After having iPhones early on in the smartphone days, I eventually switched to Android phones by Samsung. Here I stayed for many years until giving the Pixel 6 pro a try. I absolutely loved it.Eventually I realized the pro was too big for me and switched to the 6A. This was probably my favorite phone ever. Light, small, and took some of the best photos I've ever seen on a smartphone.When the 7A came out with a new camera sensor I was excited. I got it the first day it was available. To say I'm disappointed would be a vast understatement. Sure, most of the phone works fine, but the parts that don't are awful.Which would be a nice way to describe the battery life. Absolutely pathetic. I'm a light phone user and I'm often down to 20% before dinner time. This is with both Bluetooth and location turned off. Which shouldn't be necessary since those are basic phone functions. I've reached out to Google who offered no help.There are also a bunch of silly software glitches. The phone stops rotating view after a while. So I need to restart it. Voicemails don't show up for days. The keyboard stays in place after exiting an app, then covering half the phone until you lock and unlock it.I'm going to upgrade my phone after three months or so since I can't handle it anymore. Which is ridiculous."
Liked smaller sizeCamera inferior to Oneplus 9 and iphone 14
phone was overheating and needed to go to google store to get battery replaced. hope that fixed the problem.
"What a poor phone. I don't think there are any hardware issues, but the software is crap. I've had Android phones since forever and never had so many stupid issues with a phone. Like the Bluetooth connection to my headphones reliably fails the first time, then suceeds the second time. It's hit and miss if it starts charging when plugged in. The display changes brightness randomly even when adaptive brightness is turned off. Hotspot performance is extremely slow unless forced on 5GHz - way slower than just using 2.4GHz. Probably other things, that I have given up on using. If you can't get the basics right, then the advanced things don't matter. Goggle has lost its way."
"This phone is good but definitely not great (closer to a 3.5 rating). The following list of cons is a direct comparison to my former moto ace. My main complaints are; battery life is poor (about 30% less life), camera/ picture (slightly more complicated and no better pictures), my app installed navigational bar is more difficult to operate (why?), multitasking during phone calls is not as easy or clear, notifications are not displayed the way I like, etc. (I will stop there, I hope you get the idea). The pros to this phone are speed/processor and size. Not sure I will buy again or recommend. Update, another con, this phone made a three way call without my knowledge. This is unacceptable and if it does it again I will return it."
"I have used motorola smart phones(last was A g7) and really like the motorola system better. The screen on the google is a little too touch sensitive no buttons at bottom of screen to close an app go back a page or reduce app to background. No with this and other systems you have to swipe the screen form the right or bottom to do this. Reduces amount of screen you can use for scrolling so I keep accidently reducing the app. Really annoying. This phone is also very heavy compared to my old moto. Settings are harder to navigate than moto. Takes a very long time to charge the phone to full capacity but battery life is also very long. I wil use it for a year before going back to moto. I switched because this was supposed to have a better camera. Maybe but I have not been happy with the pictures taken so far, seems the same as the moto."
"We're coming from a Pixel 5A and I purchased two of these as a replacement. Unfortunately the battery doesn't seem to last as long as the old one even after 2 years.Had almost a month. Maybe the worst battery on a phone I've had in last 8 years. Returning and maybe going back to old one until I find a better option. Unfortunately, my wife has had hers for 31 days and can't return. We used to make fun of Apple users who had to charge their phone by the end of the night. Now we're one of them.Haven't decided if I'm keeping it, but I've done all the updates and that has helped some but I barely get through the day whereas I used to still have 30 to 50% left on my old one.**Update 6mo later **Battery still my least favorite thing, but the finger print reader is also pretty bad. The worst of my last 5 phones and something we have decided to get rid of already. I just can't see having a phone in 2024 that doesn't last the whole day battery wise."
I hate bigger phones. This one is bigger than the pixel 5 which I knew but my biggest problem is it does not support sharing WIFI via hotspot. The pixel 5 does as well as the 6a. Not the 7a. Battery life is trash too. The same battery life as my 3 yr old pixel 5.
I had this phone for two weeks and ended up returning it because it was more glitchy than any other phone I've had.Pros:- nice camera (though I liked the Pixel 6a camera better)- google features are handy- nice look and feelCons:Glitchy. This is what I experienced in just the first couple of weeks:- Certain apps would close and then refuse to open- Bluetooth cut in and out occasionally- Fingerprint sensor was sensitive and worked 60/70% of the time- Screen would freeze every few daysReturning for a Samsung A54 5g.
"After a year, and just out of warranty of course, the battery is swelling in the case, see distorted reflection in photo, and will also shut off unexpectedly. The battery will show 70% charged, then drops down to 1% without warning and shuts down.Disappointed overall, was hoping for a better experience from Google."
"The phone is truly amazing, it has the best camera system and software experience ever, the downside is the cellular reception, it will drop calls and at times during conversations, you won't hear the other people on the line. So hence, best and worst phone possible"
I have used for 6 month. The fingerprint always fail. Sometimes the phone shutdown without reason.
"I am not happy with this phone... it did ok for the 30 day return phase, but now in less than 3 months it is not working well... it freezes up, takes forever to download items and when it freezes I have to back up to the previous page to get it to unfreeze.... I think something as important and costly, and technical as a cell phone should have a longer return window... I'm going to check with google, the maker, to see what their warranty period is.... my daughter cautioned me against ordering a phone from amazon vs the maker... learning a lesson, I guess... sure hope to work this out, otherwise I'm stuck with a phone that I am learning quickly to dislike..."
"Used the phone for about 2 months!! with a cover and screen protector since day 1.Had two falls from less than 2 ft. First fall, screen cracked; second fall, screen cracked some more and blacked out altogether. Honestly I've had many phones before and this one has the weakest screen I've experienced.Contacted google and basically they quoted $150 repair and I had to mail it in. Not gonna happen.MAKE SURE TO GET EXTENDED WARRANTY FROM AMAZON!!Currently buying a screen to replace it myself, since it will be faster and cheaper. Fearing i might end up with a paper weight.ALSO, the phone heats up and the videos are sluggish when running a few apps.It says it charges quickly, but it doesn't.Seemed like a good deal, but i expected much more with all the reviews and the product details, specially being a google phone.I regret this purchase already. Wish me luck, since i don't want to dispose of a 2 month old technology.Had a 1 Plus phone before this and loved it WAY WAY MORE! True quick charge, very sturdy, fast interface and great pictures. I don't think i will buy another google phone after this."
"I love my old Pixel 3a, so 7a was my natural choice not 7, even though prices were pretty much same. I love the blue color, I prefer plastic back more than glass.Everything was great but the battery and charging..... Battery draining is awful, some say android 14 beta would solve this problem, so I tried and installed,, same result. At least I didn't feel any difference.18w Fast Charging, at first I wasn't worried about it, since 3a is 18w charging and had no problem.On 7a it's really slow,, sure the battery size is 1.45 times-ish bigger but it takes waaaaay too long. More than 1.45 times for sure.It's probably due to overheating problem it's not always charging at 18w..And why there's no headphone jack?I had to return it.Google you can do better."
"Have had the phone for about a month and overall, I give it a ""It'll do"" rating.Pros:Pure android, no custom manufacturer version of android.Light weightGood screenSnappy responsesGood signalCons:Worst battery life of a new phone I've ever hadNothing special about the phoneBack camera ridge is just... why?Fingerprint sensor is RNG on reading fingersTouch screen is not perfectDouble Tap gesture only works when the screen is on and you have really whack the phone with your finger to get it to registerOverall: Okay phone, get's the job done.  If you care about battery life, this is not the phone for you."
"Get the great deal in price for replacing old 4a which cannot have goodbattery capacity and won't have security update after Aug 2023.The new 7a is good enough but some are not expected. The display is larger but the device is thicker than 4a excluding camera lens part. I can feel the OLED screen is flickering in dark gray color in low ambient light. The OLED brightness is controlled by how frequently turn on and off, but I cannot tolerate this in 7a and no such issue in 4a which is also OLED."
"Didn't have much time to check out this phone as the screen cracked on the first day.  Yes, unfortunately, it dropped about 3 feet from the desk I was putting in the SIM card to the floor, and boom, crack in the screen.Ironically, this was to replace my Pixel 6 also with a cracked screen, although that one cracked after a drop from a 10' step ladder (and it had a case on it).Now I'm looking at a $125 repair bill to replace the screen for this phone barely out of the box.  I read that the Pixel 7A has a ""lesser"" version of Corning Gorilla glass and the 7 and 7 pro.  You might consider that in buying this phone."
"Just like the Pixel 5a5g it replaced, this one died without giving me a way to fix it.As bad as I hate to, I guess I'll be going back to Samsung phones.Edited 2024-11-19----------------------Because I'd bought it so recently, this phone was under warranty. I took it to the local recommended repair shop, who got it going again. I assume they just had to remove the battery and put it in again because they reported that it started working immediately.My guess: all they had to do was remove the battery and put it back in. I remember when phones would let ME do that. That will be another thing I'll be looking for the next time I'm phone-shopping."
"Phone worked ok for a few weeks, then AA decided to stop working.  I'm sure due to some update.  All other phones work correctly with the same configuration.  Should have never went away from Samsung."
"Its a nice little phone. The only thing to note is this phone unlocked does not have 5G mmWave, which is called UltraWideband (UW) with Verizon and called UC with T-Mobile.So it cannot access the truly higher speeds (like 300 Mbps+), especially in Verizon. You'll get sub-6 speeds only. I was a bit disappointed to find this out. I believe the 7 Pro has mmWave, or if bought directly from Verizon.Still, a great size, very bright display, and extremely fast with the 8GB RAM. Launching an app is instant."
I was hoping for something like my k95. I love my k95 it's a perfect size and easy to manage. This Google phone is very small and it's hard to read the screen. I realize that I'm getting older and need larger fonts but this phone is so ridiculously tiny that even if I was 20 years younger I think I would still hate it. It's also really hard to navigate probably because I'm used to the k95 but still I just dont want to spend a year trying to figure it out. I like things that are easy to use and this phone is not easy to use! It would be nice if manufacturers would keep in mind that a large percentage of the population is over 50 and we like things simple and easy. Also the battery doesn't seem to last as long as my old phone. I got the phone yesterday and gave it a full charge and less than 10 hours it's on empty and needs to be charged again even though it's description stated 24+ hours battery life. I don't think 20% would be enough for the next 14 hours.
"So far, phone is great. everything is working good. I had to update my review because the battery is really really bad. Its fully charged, I go to work for 8 hr shift I made no calls, no games,nothing. As so I left work I made one phone call on my way home. By the time I get it I went on Amazon and now the phone battery is at 22,%. Like how. It's not even been a full 9 hr. I really like the phone the features are great it works good. It's was really easy to set up and transfer data from old phone to new one. No issues was able to get connected to my phone carrier in less than 30 mins But the battery issues is now killing me, I may have to return"
"As soon as I started to setup the phone, noticed the yellow tint in the display. I updated the display setting (Natural, turn off Night light, turn off Color Correction), but nothing helped. I had  chat with Google Support and they wanted to start a warranty repair. COME ON, a warranty repair on a device that's only few hours old, decided to return the device and get my money back.Google support says they are not aware of the issue and I referred to articles from their support site where users have mentioned this issue.Still why a 3 star rating? Outside of the above yellow tint display, no issues with the other features, the experience was nice. I didnt take any pictures though. I could even take it down to a 2 or 1 star, just because of the response from Google Support."
"But the battery drains much too quickly even for a brand new phone.  I'm a moderate user, no games played... mostly  reading or surfing.  I even tried to use the battery saver to disable apps that were using battery even  in background mode.I had to  charge  2x a day. And it ran hot a lot.  Not acceptable especially for a new phone.  I gave it 2 weeks but it was just too annoying. Too bad because it had a good camera with editing features...Ended up returning it and replaced it with Galaxy S3.  So far this one appears to be a keeper.Hopefully they fix this in the Pixel 8."
"I was really disappointed by the camera.  I'm trying to replace my old pixel 3a phone which stopped receiving security updates a year ago.  One of the things I was looking for was to get an improved camera, but this one is actually worse (in some cases).  Specifically, when taking pictures of a landscape, nature, or at a distance, the resulting photo is blurry, as though you have vision problems and need to go the doctor.  It has more megapixels, but turns out that doesn't really matter if the camera can't (or won't) focus.  I'm getting the pixel 6a instead, which doesn't seem to have this problem."
"I decided to upgrade from a pixel 4a to a pixel 7a last summer. I had such a great experience with my pixel 4a that I decided to stay brand loyal. At first glance it would seem that I made the right decision to go with the pixel 7a. I quickly noticed while using the maps app that the satellite accuracy is awful on this phone. While driving my phone is constantly adjusting my route in urban areas because it believes I have made a wrong turn or kept straight while I was supposed to turn. This has caused a bit of frustration especially in areas I'm not very familiar with. The other big issue I have with the phone is the battery life. If I am streaming a podcast through iHeartRadio onto my Bluetooth ear buds I can get through 6 hours of my work shift before the battery dies. This was very disappointing seeing as this had only just become an issue on my pixel 4a near the end of it's life. Pixel 7a advertised 24 hours of battery life so this is a massive underachievement. The last glaring issue I've had with the phone is the delayed response from the screen. Sometimes the screen freezes up for 15 to 20 seconds. It almost always catches up and functions again but occasionally the phone will freeze. Everything else on the phone works as it should. Good camera, average speed and performance. Take into consideration I bought this phone brand new and have used it less than 6 months when writing this review."
"My Pixel 4a was a remarkable device that, as best I can recall, never glitched. In contrast, the 7a simply chooses to stop doing things on its own: audible response to 'hey, google'--gone; ability to say 'stop' to cancel an audible notification--gone; automatically connect to bluetooth speakers--erratic; turn on bluetooth changed to a 3/4 step process v. 1/2; cannot seem to choose different notification sounds for different apps, meaning 'low battery' sounds the same as incoming text or email.I gave it two stars instead of one because, at least as an actual phone, it functions."
"Moving from a pixel 4A I was ready for an upgrade. Mainly because I dropped my previous phone and cracked the screen. So far the pixel 7A is a lot faster but my main two gripes are the battery drains really fast  even when not using the phone. You can almost watch the percentage number go down in real-time. Dissapointing to say the least. I have to basically keep the phone charging almost full time. Also, there is no head phone jack on the phone which means if you want to use wired headphones without ordering a special cable and even then you won't be able to charge the phone at the same time using the USB-C jack."
My phone failed only after one month of use. The phone went completely black and became unresponsive and would not turn on again. I'm not the only one that this has happened to. Tried for 4 hours trying to apply all the fixes (videos and videos available showing how do this...which just goes to show the numerous of others who have this same problem). Do not BUY this phone! its not worth a surprise where you phone randomly becomes unresponsive and have to scramble for a new one. beware the black screen of death!
"If you're already accustomed to the Android ecosystem and appreciate the flexibility it provides, this phone is a solid choice. However, as someone who values the seamless integration between devices and the optimized user experience of Apple products, I still find myself reaching for my iPhone for day-to-day use. It's a matter of personal preference, and while this Android phone has its merits, it hasn't swayed me from my iPhone allegiance."
"Topic says it all.I basically don't even use my phone.  It just sits in my pocket in case.  With this non-usage, expect about 24 hours of battery life.  If I don't plug it in overnight, next morning it's at 6% and asking to turn on Battery Saver.I set up the fingerprint reader at installation.  It worked 3 times then never recognized my finger again.  I just use the PIN.All in all this is a very disappointing phone.  It's just the same as every other phone out there, except absurdly short battery life and the fingerprint reader doesn't work."
"In many travel situations, I've come to depend upon sharing a wifi connection with others using the Hotspot feature. Although this feature exists on prior Pixel phones I've owned (3a, 5a), Google, in its effort to cut corners implemented bare-bones wifi hardware components on this phone, making hotspot sharing of wifi impossible (although it still works with sharing a cellular connection).I tried to return the phone under warranty but Google denied it, saying they don't plan to ""fix"" this defect, and claim this limitation is an intended ""feature"".The other beef I have is, like most, I've installed a screen guard. Since the fingerprint scanner is on the face of the phone, not the back, it renders the fingerprint scanner virtually useless.  I used to be able to pick up my Pixel 5a with one hand, tap the back, and unlock it.  Now it takes two hands, and most of the time I get multiple fingerprint read errors and have to type in my PIN anyway.Now I'm looking for the best way to trade this Pixel 7a in for something more useful..."
"I used a Pixel 4a for years and loved it. I ordered a 7a and it never worked right, it continually froze up and needed a forced shutdown to get it working again. I tried all the suggested online ""fixes"" (others were having the same problems) but none worked. I took it to Verizon and they agreed there was something wrong with the phone but couldn't replace it since I didn't buy it from them. I could not return it on Amazon for a replacement, only a refund. The phone was $375 but to buy another was $460. Since I wanted the 7a I had to pay an additional $85 which I did. The new phone works fine and my data was transferred, then I needed to return the original 7a. Instead of being able to bring it to UPS like normal returns I had to package it and wait for UPS to pick it up. I was told it would be picked up the next day but it was picked up 3 days later and I was never given any indication when the pickup would occur until UPS was at the door. For 3 days I had to hope I would be home when they arrived. I have always been pleased with the Amazon return process, but not this time. I would give this experience zero stars if I could."
I bought this phone because they made it seem like the camera was amazing on it. Well it isn't. The touch screen has to be pushed more than once.  It's never sensitive enough to open something just tapping it once. The charge doesn't even last an entire day.  Now I'm stuck with a phone I don't normally pay this much for. I won't but another one of this brand. I've had cheapy phones work better than this. Convincing commercials. Horrible product.
"EDIT: (2 to 3 stars) Perhaps these new phones take some time to dial themselves in. I'm seeing some improvements with the 'Mobile Network' battery usage.These are my issues with the phone. It also has plenty of benefits and nice features.- Massive* battery drain. *Obviously, this is relative to average use. I don't play games or watch videos regularly on my phone. 50% battery at the end of the day is my baseline.- Somewhat Buggy User Interface- Annoying preferences that are mandatory and cannot change (Google has been gradually designing phones that give users less and less options)Disappointed. Debating returning and going back to one of the Samsung Galaxy series."
"So bought this phone and even though it said on the description on what was included, it did not come with the sim kit and without the charging cable. I was disappointed from this. Other than that, phone is ok."
"Great value, but could be better. Polishing is all it really needs"
"The best news about this new phone that I used to replace my pixel 3a XL is that the transcription is fantastic. Unfortunately, the phone is heavier, the battery doesn't last as long, the fingerprint reader sucks, and the face identification is iffy and doesn't work at all when it's dark. I'm sure I will learn to accommodate to some of this, but it really is a disappointment. I'm amending this after a couple of days because after installing Google one and trying their VPN I am even more dissatisfied. It keeps on losing connection and screws up any connection to the phone. My NordVPN works so much better."
"Not terribly impressed but I didn't expect to be after reading the reviews. Purchased because I had to get a new phone and didn't want a Samsung or to pay some ridiculously high price. I find the same issues mentioned by others... battery life sucks and finger print sensor is worthless. Other than that it is a phone and I can make calls, test and access the internet. It does have a pretty decent camera for a phone."
"Was able to call when I got the phone, but it will not let me make or receive any calls now.  Have only had it for a week.  Probably going to be sending it back unless I can get it to work again. Update..... it's not the phone, it's my carrier."
I have a couple of issues with this. 1: The delivery driver left my package next to my trash can in the culdesac on trash day. 2: the phone came with a 3 pronged crack at the bottom of the screen. I don't mind gently used but screen cracking is different. I would like a replacement that does not have a cracked screen please.
"I want to stress that me buying this phone and being disappointed in on me because I should have researched better.-No micro SD card expansion (stuck at 128gb internal storage)-Battery is very bad: not so so, not average ... it's bad. You would go from 100% to 50% in about 4 hours of use.-No headphone jack: the phone is thick, like above average thick. There is no reason to not have a jack. Limiting users to only blutooth is not a feature, it's a limitation-Speakers are so so: they are clear and great for voice, but they are not loud and have below average bass relative to other phonesOther than that, the screen is vibrant and slick looking. Camera is great. Feel of the phone is nice."
New - first of a dozen phones to crack a screen from simple drop. I even had one fall out of pocket riding motorcycle that never cracked!Its speed makes up for what differences I disliked from my Motorola phone. Ditto ditching apps that aren't simpatico with pixel. Also getting a nonslip cover is mandatory because it slipped out of hand and on top of anything not level. Getting used to their gestures over the three button system. Fingerprint security is getting closer to normal. Default immovable Google search bar reminds me of Microsoft and its IE browser.(Older one)It's fast! Other than that I miss my half the cost Motorola phone which I only ditched because Android makes it so that its software updates eventually kills your phone.Even trying to get in with the ridiculously difficult fingerprint - so many takes and few get in.The screen... recent apps. It's a mess compared to older phones.
"Everything works OK but (a) moving data from old phone to new phone via cable did not work (this is a known issue that is still not fixed after many years) (b) the battery is BAS BAD BAD (be lucky and you get 24 hrs. under moderate usage), and (c) the photos appear excellent on the phone screen but not so great on the computer or after print out (there seems to be a lot of post processing going on)."
"In less than a month we've had 2 of these phones and had issues with both. First phone which was only a week old did an update then the camera would no longer work, only showing a black screen and the camera app crashed within seconds of opening rendering the camera completely unusable. We returned for a replacement and again within a week we ran into issues. The phone went into a constant restarting mode. Then started crashing and system wouldn't load and that we needed to factory reset. We did a system update per google instructions by hooking up to our laptop and performing the update. Within a few hours it went back into a constant mode of restarting. I feel like we were sent faulty products both times and am losing trust in purchasing electronics from Amazon."
"I've had several phones, apple sony Nokia and zte. But this phone has been the worst. In call clarity, face recognition (always reports low light) and finger print sensor reader (works about 25% of the time). The phone has become a pain, I'm now forced into manually typing my passwords, and using the speaker or a headset for calls. I chose the wrong phone, should of went with my other choice Don't be like me.Update.. I've returned the phone because I suspect the touch screen is bad, which may have been causing all the issues I was having. I noticed that when typing on the touch screen. I would get double characters when typing the locked screen password."
"phone screen stopped worked suddenly after just a few months of usage. As well, no customer support. Thought I was buying from the google store / amazon but apparently not. Do NOT buy from this group; check who you're buying from first.Batterly life also sucked the entire time I owned this phone."
"I bought this phone to replace my 4 year old phone.Have owned this one for approximately a month now, and with exception of battery life there is almost no aspect of this phone that better than my old one.-I don't notice any speed difference.-I miss the headphone port, I know there are less and less of us, but I do.-Blacks flicker under low light. You can't read in dark mode because of this.-The USB-C port is failing or I can't find cables that will consistently charge the phone. Even new ones. If you are holding the phone it keeps vibrating indicating the phone is loosing connection with the charger.-Not a fan of the front fingerprint reader, especially at night when it blinds you, the one on the back of my old phone is better."
"I did not like the fact I could not change the home page to my preference.  No way to get rid of date in upper left corner unless you use a third party launcher. The phone got very warm after using for awhile, uncomfortably so.  The phone would not pair with my hearings aids and that was the straw that broke the camel's back.  Wound up returning for a refund."
"I'm 10 days beyond the return policy.  The phone has been glitchy the whole time, but I figured it was just needing an update.  Today, the screen froze for 15 minutes and would not come back.  Amazon Customer Service would not allow me to return.  Would not recommend."
"It's clearly states it's (Unlocked) but it's not or the one I got from this very page.Buyer Beware check when you receive it.The phone itself is phenomenal & arrived flawlessly.To those complaining about charging you need to get a fast charger like this one https://a.co/d/aZdYyqLIt's official & from googpe. As for better drain that's dependent on use & options you have on pile always on display, wifi/Bluetooth scanning ect.Sorry for the dark images.Hope this helps."
Good phone on a budget but the finger print doesn’t work too well.
"I noticed by battery would drop from 28% down to 5% in a manner of seconds.  Battery replacement should be covered under warranty, but when I brought the phone into an authorized repair shop they informed me that because the bloated battery caused the back glass to crack, it was no longer covered.  The whole repair would cost more than half the phone cost.  I asked if there could be an exception or a way to escalate since the damage was caused by a faulty battery and they said no.  It is very frustrating that this poor quality is not covered and I would not recommend a google phone to anyone."
"I purchased a Google Pixel 7a cell phone in April 25,2024. I paid $349 it lasted 4 months & I can no longer get it to take a charge  therefore I had to purchase  a brand new phone from T-Mobile . Things should last longer than 4 months especially a cell phone. When I looked it up I had until May 25th to return it . I would not recommend buying a phone through any place except for the  service you have your phone through. because if something goes wrong after a month you're stuck with a phone that does not work & you end up paying in the long run ."
"I've had Pixels since they come out.  I like that it's not packed with bloatware.  I have had increasing phone issues with each one,  So..... I switched carriers to T Mobile.  Maybe they have better towers.  At any rate my Galaxy works better as a telephone."
"Not as good as my older Pixel 5a. Batter life is less than 24 hrs, messages don't clear. The camera isn't as good as it was on the 5a"
"I had the Pixel 7a for two weeks then Amazon dropped the price.  I returned the 7a (bought for $500) and returned for the Pixel 7 with more features for $450.  Kind of a no brainer, but the 7 is a better phone when the price is the same!"
I've had this phone for less than a year and used to love it. Ten months in I started getting a random acetone smell and noticed by battery dropped from 20% to 3% within a literal matter of seconds. Turned out my battery began to swell and I've quickly come to realise this is a common problem.It was good while it lasted but I paid too much to get only 10mths use out of it. Severely disappointed is an understatement.
Rings so low I can't hear it. Screen brightness all the way high and still can't see much when it's sunny out. Volume is low on this when playing videos or when it's ringing I can't hear it go off when I'm outside and cars are driving by. Putting phone calls on speaker doesn't change volume. Sounds almost the same as leaving it off speaker.
Buy another brand phone. I wish I would have stuck with moto. The battery isn't that great. And only had the phone a couple months and the screen flickers. camera is okay but not the greatest.
Google seldom makes mistakes but they did with this phone.  I feel fleeced by Google.  My old OnePlus 5 (from 8 years ago!) is better than this phone.Why?Battery life is bad.  Fingerprint reader is bad.  Both are discussed at length elsewhere.  Will leave it at that.I swipe type using Google Gboard and this phone can't keep up.  It endlessly gets words wrong.  I know its not the Gboard app because I often switch back to my old phone (using Wi-Fi) to type long messages and that one works fine.Camera is pretty good but not amazing.  Better than my old phone but not anywhere near new iphone quality though.Video is another story.  My old phone takes better video.
That's it. For a mid range phone this one stands out although I must say pictures are a bit over processed. Google's simple UI is pretty good.Now the battery..my god this is bad.
"I used to have a Samsung but wanted to try a different brand.  This got great reviews and was inexpensive.  The pros are that it has a great camera, far better than my last phone. It works reasonably well with most apps.  The major problem is that it is full of glitches.  Incoming Whatsapp video calls don't function correctly part of the time. The screen locks up in some apps. Sometimes notifications work and sometimes they don't.So it's ok. I'll keep it for a while but I wouldn't buy another."
"Latest Google upgrade ruined my enjoyment.  I have a primary email with my local cable company. Trying to get email, on the Pixel, to have my primary email provider primary, was not possible. Google has isolated their support to ""User groups"" and ""FAQ's."" I could not get to speak to a HUMAN."
"The plastic back on the 7a is trying it's hardest to be shiny like glass and it fails; a far cry from the Pixels of old! If I wanted glass I would've got the Pixel 7...Besides that I have no critics about it's functionality.Update: I got the Pixel 7, wish me luck. 🤞"
"My 3a served me well so now it's time to upgrade. It came new in the box and everything seems good. Setup was easy and everything transferred in 20 mins using the cord. Hopefully it's more of the same for team Pixel.Edit: Having had it for a month or so now I can confirm the battery leaves something to be desired. Additionally, apps randomly crash or seize up and do nothing. It's highly annoying. Fingers crossed that it can be fixed in an update or something but as things stand I wish I would have looked elsewhere for a budget phone.Edit: Owned for under a year and the speaker now makes random pop/crackle noises. Randomly not constantly...yet."
"I have dropped my old Google Pixel 4a on asphalt and cement, all of the way from the seat of my truck. Even dropped an inexpensive Motorola on the same surfaces and same distance! NOT EVEN A SCRATCH! They were in protective double sided cases though. Just got my SORRY Google Pixel 7a on October 21! Also had it in a double sided case! It slid off of a table indoors only 28"" from the WOOD floor and the screen totally shattered! Only 2 MONTHS OLD! I have always liked my Pixel 4a, but I wouldn't buy another Pixel phone if I had to resort to 2 cans and a string!😆😅😂🤣 Talk about shoddy quality!!! What a waste of money that I shouldn't have bought from the start. While I know you shouldn't drop a phone to begin with, accidents DO happen. I just find it strange that my other phones have survived being dropped on harder surfaces and from twice the distance. All of the cases they were in were tough and double sided. It might be a good phone, but take my advice...... whatever you do, DON'T DROP IT!!!😭😭😭"
Phone is decent. I expected more upgrading from a 3a. Nothing spectacular.
"I purchased this from recommendations by family & reviews. I have had problems with this phone from day 2. I have 89 apps on the phone & only added maybe 10. The rest came with the phone. I clear my screen when I'm done using an app. I have had to do a factory reset( day 3). It helped take phone out of restart cycling loop. It has refused to open apps. Any kind of apps doesn't matter. Will restart itself randomly. No, the RAM Boost is not turned on. And this last Saturday I woke up & my phone was off!! I was on call for my surgery dept!! I went to return cause that was the last straw only to realize I had (kept trying) for 31 days. One day outside the return window. I now cringe at the ""hello moto"". If you buy one and it glitches, return immediately. Don't give it the benefit of the doubt!!!!!!!!! It won't get better. I otherwise love the size, speed, screen clarity of this phone. Maybe I got a bad one but after googling my issues trying to fix it I've read of others with this same issue."
"Before the review drops here are a few Facts and world Law.1: As part of the International Communications World law(Created 2012)The Earth Court Of Justice( aka world government) requires all cell phones produced to be compatible with any carrier code via SIM card...The cell phone frequencies can't interfere with civilian protection services and systems,such as fire fighters, law enforcement etc2. As of 2020: All the Americas, Asia, Africa, and Europewere annexed by a 4.5 billion vote.2a. The USA IS IN FACT NO MORE by a, 275 million modern means vote( aka public social media and in person by protest vote)New Horizens Nation has a product regulations law.while individual cell companies are allowed to have independent Manager officesThey are required by law to allow usage of any device by simply switching sims.no company is allowed to have a locked-in device. or produce a device that interferes with civilian protection systems frequencies.and plans have to be all the same services and prices.Why do I bring this up?1. Because most of the Carriers executives on this listSaid to, the New Horizens Nation Rights Advocacy Leadership Chair.No, we will not back the People's Choice we will remain and run as a free business in a nation of our choice.2. This phone not only fails product requirementsbut is not compatible with networks illegally identifying themselves AS USA Carriers...what phone aspects does it fail?Battery life: When many apps are installed:All cell phones are required to have1. a 3-day full battery drain when app loaded heavy use.7-day drain  with no app or power save on( why because that is where battery tech is)the battery is also required to be replaceable and swappable2. Memory card access and SIM card input have to be simple and require no special tools to get outand replace.3. All tech products have to be a 10-year supported shellDIY fixable( with some education on repair required)4. Not Compatible with all Carriers.5. Note Max phone price and other product spec for New Horizens Nationare also not met...other than that it is a great smart phone...."
"My bad because I relied on my husbands (biased) opinion of Motorola in general.  He's had several and he's happy. I've has Samsung for 20 years, this is my first non Samsung.  My A13 was just a quick replacement phone when my S series went black.  I've been on two memorable cruises (to Antarctica and to mid Pacific to be in 100% totality for solar eclipse) with the cheap A13 Samsung and although it was a great phone, it was a terrible camera and I take thousands of pics, my hub does not, so I guess he's not a good judge of camera/picture needs.My biggest need is a camera, and was told by hub it had a great camera.  It is better than my cheap Samsung, but I feel lacks editing features.  It also lacks screen sensitivity, as I, a nurse with millions of hand washings and chemical exposure, have dry, almost printless finger tips and I have to press, drag, rub, beg....for the screen to respond. At least my samsung had a sensitivity mode. It's settings search will result in 'no results' more often than finding me an answer.  I feel it's slow and clunky and have missed so many great shots getting the dang thing to open.  It does one thing better than any past phone I've had and that's the screen is so bright and clear when outside.  I can even see it fairly well while wearing polarized sunglasses and that's impressive. Battery life is ok, overall size is good, it works but I don't love it.I was hoping to return it by the end of the 30 days but I got very ill and missed the deadline.  Since my hub loves Motorola, I'm sure he'll love getting this when I replace it with something that works to my standard."
"First off I gotta say that this phone is really fast. It loads everything reasonably well and it the screen itself looks really good. The resolution is a bit lower than other phones but the screen is so crisp that you wont notice the slightly lower quality. The battery life on this is amazing. Playing games on max settings barely affects the battery, its insane. This phone also has a headphone jack AND an SD card slot. 2 things that SHOULD NOT BE as rare as they are on smartphones made in 2023. I understand a lot of people like wireless earbuds but I like more wired earbuds when I can get them. For cons I'm not a fan of this phone's UI. I'm coming from the Samsung phones so the fact I can't swap back and other button feels weird. I also hate the camera. Its not great. It works but compared to other phones on the market it feels REALLY lacking.  If you record video, the audio really low quiatly and even when recording at 4k it sounds & looks really off/ The stylus is cool IN THEORY but when you use it, it feels so uncomfortable to hold.While saying all of this, I think this phone isn't a bad idea for a budget phone but man, if the camera was betterPros>Crisp screen, smooth visuals>Loading is fast>Amazing Battery Life>Headphone Jack and SD Card slot>The Phone's Speakers sound REALLY goodCons>Front Camera over the screen>The Camera quality is extremely mid>Stylus feels uncomfortable to hold."
"I upgraded from the Moto G Stylus 5G (2022) version of this phone and am frankly disappointed as the phone takes serious steps back in several regards:The Good:- A bit snappier with the upgraded processor & GPU- The smaller form-factor compared to 2022 makes it easier to hold- Dual-speakers for enhanced sound- Better mic (or mic placement). On the 2022 model if I cradled the phone between my head and my shoulder, people I was talking to couldn't hear me. This is no longer a problem with the 2023.The Bad:- Cell reception (4G & 5G) is far worse than the previous phone. Areas where I would have full-bars with the 2022 model, I will have 3 or less with the 2023.  It will frequently drop calls.  On a few occasions - I've to reboot the phone to regain connectivity.  This alone is enough to have me considering swapping back to the 2022 or moving to another brand.- Battery life is also worse on this phone. My 2022 model is a year old and still has better battery life.- Motorola got rid of image stabilization and a depth lens on the back of the phone - downgrading the imaging capabilities.- The phone can charge at up to 20W speed but only ships with a 10W charger. I assume Motorola want to sell you the 20W charger as an accessory.Overall, I feel like this ""upgrade"" was actually a downgrade and a waste of $300. I wouldn't do it again if I had the choice.My Moto G Stylus 5G (2022) never felt sluggish to the point I felt an upgrade was necessary; so the slight increase in responsiveness is far outweighed by the signal strength & battery-life issues.I have to wonder why Motorola even released this phone? It feels like a crash grab."
Never got to use it… price dropped the next day  after I ordered it it had just shipped was told they could not adjust price so it was returned after I received it and reordered waiting to received it.
I wished I went with a Samsung. I had one before and I use it for extra on the side for 5+ yrs. I've had a TCL which was a gift and now Moto G and nothing but problems. The phone it self changes a lot of the settings too off! Agrivating . I'm on disability and can't afford to keep getting phones. This phone is the most I've spent to get. Don't go for a Motorola anything.
"I purchased this phone in Feb 2024 and now it's the end of May. The battery drains way too quickly for a phone this age. I don’t use a lot of apps and I pay attention to what is being used or still open (processing in the background). Other than that it's been a good phone, so far."
Ok for a budget phone but the camara picture has blue hue
Moto g stylus 2021 is better than this one. On this one the stylus always wants to fall off because its circular all around not like the 2021 model.
The volume is very low.  The other party hears a lot of static in speaker.  Good phone but not not the best in volume.
"Tons of bloatware. The setup forces you to install all kinds of nonsense regardless if you want it or not. If you don't keep most of the bloatware you get popups every time you try to text, make a call, or use your camera. Why can't things be simple?"
"This phone was fine for the year and a half I've had it but there are some notifications (from the settings like security, features, etc.) that, without going around, really annoy you to the point that I'll be looking to either mod the phone or just switch to a different OEM. If you're someone who has no knowledge of how the devices work nor do you care then this type of behavior will not bother you. For those of us that are knowledgeable enough and do not need our hand held, don't bother with this device unless it's for your kid or dog."
These phones are extremely fragile.  A few drops of water or a dropping from a table onto the floor is all it will take to destroy one.  Mine only survived a few weeks.
"It was such a disappointment that modern phone does not have eSIM support, how is it even possible? Was it so hard to install this option? I bought this phone as a gift for my mother, and she can't use it properly, because she has 2 SIM cards which are very important for her. I am sooo disappointed and frustrated...."
"I'm currently working with Motorola's support but as of right now, it looks like this phone doesn't provision properly on AT&T's network, meaning the 4G/5G/LTE/VoLTE/WiFi calling options are completely unavailable on this phone.This means that unless this issue is fixed, the next time AT&T decides to boost their profits by culling non-VoLTE/Non-5G phones like they did last year, this phone will stop working on their network. Keep this in mindOther than that, it's a great device with a stylus. And you can pop a 1 tb micro SD card in to max out the storage potential.Update - 07/22/2023To get VoLTE working, I had to work with AT&T's network engineers (not an avenue normally available to most people) to get the device provisioned properly. After 3 weeks of dealing with Motorola's support, turns out this device does not support WiFi calling. They're claiming that they will be releasing a carrier locked device later this year that will but the funny thing is that Motorola for several weeks lied and said the current iteration of the device also supported WiFi calling.Unfortunately, after nearly 60 hours of working with multiple support teams, I'm going to have to return this device since I absolutely have to have WiFi calling since the device's 5G reception is actually pretty bad."
"This terrible absolutely the worst phone I've ever had. Most of the time my income calls go straight to voice mail, witch I don't use. Volume when I do get it to work stinks, there is often noise on line when I'm speaking. And this happens with several different callers. Alarm often doesn't work . I was impatient hospital for a period after I purchased this phone so I didn't use it so when I was able to use phone I realized it sucks?!! If the date of return hadn't pass, I would certainly return. ALSO I TAUGHT I WAS ORDERING A 2024 PHONE INSTEAD I FOUND OUT THIS IS A 2023 MODEL. I HAVE PURCHASED THIS SAME PHONE SEVERAL TIME IN PAST YEARS AND AM GREATLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRESENT phone!!!!!."
Had no idea there would be any que s tion about a Sim card. Purchased a plan a few days a go because my plan ended. Thought as I have before would just transfer plan over. Tracfone would not.Now I have to return another phone and I liked it very much.
This phone appears to be great and everything I'm looking for BUT it will not connect to metro pcs. It asks for a second imei that does not exist. I have spent hours trying to get this to work and have had ZERO success. BUYER BEWARE!!!!
The battery drains really fast after the first month or so.
Pushing temo & tictoc on me in a lot of my app groups 1 weather app wants me to pay to remove ads and can't get see h to mic on key board
"I have tried and tried with this worthless phone. It's slow. Just plain slow. The battery dies incredibly fast. Right from the start. Even with all the phone's settings for conserving battery ON, it is quick to die. The built in apps for the alarm is way more than complicated to set up (it has glitches so I use a back up alarm), gallery (there isn't one), slow to open and use camera, iffy (if ever) finger print reader sensor, limited options for personalization and preferred set up preferences, and every built-in app is filled with ads before any app will open. I have so much regret."
I paid $ 69.99 for insurance/warranty with Asurion that is offered ON AMAZON when I bought the cell phone.  Now I have a cracked screen which IS covered and now they say I need to pay another $41.00 for a service fee. I am feeling they are scamming me. I called Amazon and they said Asurion is a 3rd party insurance and they can't do anything about it. So Amazon isn't telling their customers that this extra insurance isn't real. I am so disappointed. I am not paying the extra and I expect someone to do the right thing. Please look into what you think you are buying for damage insurance. I am looking into this further!
"This phone comes with 128 gb of internal storage, not 256 as advertised. And it comes with 4 gb of ram, not 6. They do send a 256 gb sd which isn't bad unless you planned on needing more than 128 gb specifically for apps. The phone comes unlocked/preowned and the last security update was over a year ago and if you search for security updates it says it's up to date so I'm not sure how long it will stay secure against malware and data breaches. It's looking kind of sketchy and i'm starting to think I should have bought it from the manufacturer. It's on sale by Motorola right now for the same price"
I ordered the phone on here and worked fine but after 2month it was reported stolen. How it that even possible i paid over 200 dollars for it.
"Loved everything about this phone on a technical level. Great features and a great camera for the price, but for some reason Motorola phones don't get reception at my house. This is the second one with this issue (first was a 2021 model) but other brands of phones work fine with the exact same carrier."
Moto g stylus 5G has a side fingerprint scanner. This cover is not designed with a hole on the side. So basically worthless for this phone
"Even when I turn off 5G, this brand new phone's battery only lasts marginally longer than my smaller, 6-year old battery in my Moto G5. The charger that came with the phone is a 10 watt charger although the specs say that the phone can charge at 20 watts. The screen is quite dim when using the phone outdoors. It's also very annoying that days after I purchased this phone, the price dropped by 25% and amazon will not refund the difference."
"I ordered this phone for my husbands birthday, due to Thanksgiving couldn't switch it over until Friday. It says it's unlocked for all carriers but due to recent updates from most carriers that is not the case anymore. This phone has one IMEI but the new update requires two IMEIs. So now I have to send it back for either a refund or one that has two IMEIs just make sure you look on the box before you open it."
"I bought this phone after having 2 LG Stylo phones, which were great. Motorola made a screen that is unresponsive most of the time. The apps are not usable , can't make calls and there's no help from Motorola. It's only 2 months old and useless . Don't buy a Moto!!"
"Purchased 3 of these recently to replace our Moto G6s. I had my last phone for close to 6 years and put it through hell, never had a problem. 2 of these new phones have broken screens already. Mine barely took an impact and completely shattered. My daughter's cracked and no idea how. Consider a different phone. Wish I would have."
Not unlocked for use with US Cellular
Once I put the case on people complained of not hearing me be very well. And yes it was the correct case. Everything else was fitted correctly. Looks like they did not come over far enough with speaker whole.
"I spent hours on Amazon being transferred from associate to associate who would say, 'hang on while I read the comments to see where we're at."" I was repeating my self constantly cause no one reads. Argh! Each person would assure me they could help me better, then they would do the same exact thing. The phone only has one IMEI number; my company requires the second IMEII (2) number. Not even the phone had it in it's hardware. They shouldn't advertise this as compatible with MetroPCS / T-Mobile because it isn't. I had the same problem at Best Buy the next day. I returend it - no fault of my own. Still got docked a restocking fee."
I bought this phone brand new and there is a scratch in the back !.This is crazy for a new phone.
"This phone died on me after 34 days.  It powered down and wouldn't start up until it had been off for more than 2 days.  Then it powered down intermittently, even during conversations.  We Googled the problem and there are many people having the same issue with this phone.I can't return the phone to Amazon because the problem happed after the 30 day return window.  So now I'm trying to get Motorola to replace this defective phone."
"Not a good phone. It started shutting down on its own and the screen glitching, would not recommend this phone."
Tried something other than Samsung and hated it. Gave it to my friend who desperately needed a phone... was gonna return it but since he needed a phone I just gave it to him
SIM Card tray was difficult to eject and unable to re-seat properly.  Left SIM card inside phone unable to remove.  Not my experience with other Motorola G phones.  Have always had excellent performance and battery life from Moto G6 phones. I was very disappointed.
"Worst phone I have ever had, and I've had bad ones. You name it's wrong or doesn't work with this phone.Never again"
"The phone is great other than it will not work with Metro PCS network. It says it has 2 IMEI numbers but the phone only has 1.If you have Metro, don't buy this phone!"
"It's a great phone but it comes preinstalled with a non-removable app called ""MotoApps"" that will constantly show up in your notifications after every system update asking you to install a bunch of low quality apps. The notification will keep appearing until you uncheck all the ""app recommendations"". This is annoying to say the least.I wish there was some way to convince the manufacturers to stop pulling this nonsense. I already bought your stupid phone. Stop trying to monetize me."
"Do not buy this phone unless you want a $300 paperweight. The description states that it is unlocked and will work with a majority of carriers. Yeah, right. Tried to activate this phone only to find out that you need two IMEI numbers to do so. There is only one IMEI number listed. Hopefully someone will see this review and it stops them from dealing with what I and so many others have experienced."
"The phone appears to be ok, but the box was open. Like wtf you open my new phone? Or if it's open, why you sent it to me?! I was buying a NEW phone in a SELAED box. I don't think I'll be returning cause as I said the phone appears to be ok, but the open box was a complete disappointment."
"I bought these phones for my parents because they prefer a stylus.  These phones cannot send text messages with pictures!  After hours and speaking with 5 different representatives from BOOST mobile, ultimately I was told this is a KNOWN ISSUE with no fix yet.  My mom usually sends pictures every day, this is very upsetting.  I regret this purchase."
"This phone, on day one, overheated every time I used it and the battery drained super fast.Sent it back last month and still have not received my refund."
I've owned Motorola phones for over ten years but this phone is a big disappointment ! I would return it but it was so hard to download everything and remove all the extra junk this phone had installed it was crazy stupid!  I just don't want to be bothered !!
The phone slipped and dropped 4 inches and became completely inoperable.  I couldn't even turn it off or answer an incoming call.
"The phone itself is very nice and it is extremely fast HOWEVER, the battery charger, headphone jack and stylus are located too closely together that when the phone is charging the stylus can't be withdrawn. Additionally, the multi volume feature which should allow the user to manage individual app volumes is faulty among this style phone as well as numerous other audio and app failings."
"Lesson learned, don't by used phones, just got mine in today and came in locked with no pin code to actually access phone, very disappointed."
"Laggy and unable to disable certain notifications like ""Wireless Emergency Alerts."" Why not let me be in control of what I own? Also, I put the phone on the charger for a few hours and when I pressed the power button - and even held for over 30 seconds - nothing happened. Within the first day the phone no longer powers on!!!"
Five star phone giving one star because MetroPCS is a bad company. They have this single SIM phone listed in their system as a dual sim phone and there is nothing they can do to fix it. Only buy this phone if you have any company except MetroPCS.
Spent the last 4 days trying to get this and  my wifes Moto G put on the spectrum mobile network.First Xfinity said the phone is not compatible with them and now Spectrum said it is not compatible with their network either.Stay away
It's  does  that the phone is unlocked  but I had to return  because it was not capable at my carrier.  When I got in touch with Motorola. They new about this issue and told that I had to either buy directly from them or try a different carrier.
"Ok I got it, went to 3 stores for metro pcs it was not able to activate it only has 1 umei number but needs two, I wasted allot of time and money now a hassle from customer service that I only can return it. They can't fix the problem..."
I was unable to set up with Metro PCS due to only having one IMEI number. I was given the direct number to Motorola and they confirmed this will not work with Metro. I wish it worked because it appears to be a really nice phone.
Not for metro PCs at all. Says Xfinity.-_- rip off
Product is defective whenever sending voice messages they're like static you can't hear anything. And also making calls persons not hearing you on the other end. Phone wouldn't even allow you to reboot it.
Will not work for Verizon. And Amazon will not return your money.
Battery doesn't even last HALF a day.  Total crap!
This phone is slower than my 2021 model and the camera seems worse. The Stylus fell out and is lost. I don't suggest you purchase this.
Went to get it turned on only to find out that the phone is locked
States that this unlocked phone is compatible with Metro by T-Mobile but it is not. This phone only has one IMEI number but Metro by T-mobile needs two IMEI numbers.
Speakers are crap.
I got the phone but it didn't come with the stylus. How do I get that for this phone
I hope everyone who orders and pays for this awesome phone receives it. Took a month to get refund.
LockedDidn’t workCarrier unable to access to join subscription
"item wasnt compatible with metro , could not use it"
Cannot use this phone with MetroPCS you need to IMEI numbers do not buy this phone
Battery doesn't last two days it last a half a day
the specification says it works with metropcs. it doesn't. fix this misinformation.
"This is my third Moto G. Everyone was a problem. This one, the third one, only 4 months old. Shut is down, when I tried to turn it back on all I got was the log screen. Would not do anything else. Push the on/ of and volume down button and you get a screen where it says reboot, or recovery. Does nothing, just takes you back to the logo screen. Took it to a phone repair they couldn't got it to work. Said it looked like the there is no software in it. Went online with Motorola, tried their fix to restore and install software etc. went through the complete process.  Still the phone only shows the logo screen. Tried speaking to someone at Motorola, only get automated robot. Finally, I threw the phone in the garbage. Three Moto 5 g phones this year and all junk. I will never buy another Motorola product again."
"I got the stylus 2023 after upgrading from the stylus 2022, I didn't have many problems with the 2022 stylus but the 23 has given me problems from the start! I had to send my 2023 into Motorola about a week after having the phone because the screen would freeze, I would be on an app and it would suddenly go crazy and start switching onto other apps by its self, scrolling through Facebook it would randomly refresh the page and take me back to the top, I couldn't text, my phone would ring but it wouldn't show up on the screen who was calling or give me an option to call. Motorola did try to fix it by replacing the motherboard in it but unfortunately it worked for a couple days and then started again. So I had to send it back again for a replacement phone. This one has not done that stuff but sometimes the screen does not respond to me you hong it. If I try to switch between apps the apps ALWAYS refresh so if I'm doing forms online and need to switch over to my contacts, I lose my spot on the form and have to start all over. This is supposed to be Motorola's best phone they have out but I do not see it. I have had some sort of issue with both of the 2023's IV had. Another huge downfall for me is it is not compatible with the dexcom g6 app, so we have nothing to connect my diabetic husbands dexcom sensor too to read his sugars. I would think since this phone is 2023 it would be compatible."
"When I first got the phone I was satisfied because it was under $300. However the service has been pretty bad when everyone else with the same provider has good service, also the memory filled up quickly and I have constant problems now. It's got so annoying that I'm going to get something new. I've always been loyal to Motorola so I'm thinking about trying the new Razr."
"I am coming from using a Samsung Note 4, used the Note and Note 2 before that.  This stylus is BAD.  It doesn't seem my touch one out of about 6 times!!! That is totally unacceptable.  I do not have any screen protector on, just base phone here.  It is NOT just the particular phone, because I returned it, got a new one and THIS one is doing the exact same thing.  Try making loops of dots and see how it lags yourself.  Because of this, I cannot use it for the games I play on my Note 4.  VERY dissappointing.The rest seems decent, but too much spying and extra apps.  There are some things I can't turn off, like the fact that I have an SD card keeps coming up as a notification every day WHICH I don't need and CAN'T TURN OFF!!!NOBODY should remove options (FREEDOM) from phones!"
"After using it for 3 months the phone started overheating and shutting ofMotorolla sent me a replacement refurbished phone and after a month it started doing the same thing, shutting iff in it's own"
If this phone hits like $200 to maybe $250 max...... It would be worth it but for $400..... Not even close...... I ended up getting an OnePlus 10t 5g for $429 and that phone freaking blows away this one..... Hell the 125 watt charger alone is a beast not to mention a snapdragon gen 8 plus..... With 8gb ram.... Also them pixel phones..... But I like having a big screen.....
"Currently having issues updating standard android security patches that are needed to use work suite apps through my employer.  This something that I never thought twice about with any other new phone however I've spent hours dealing with Motorola's foreign customer service team without resolve and its frustrating.Other issue is that there is a 15 second or so delay between when you unlock and when you can see or use app icons.  Doesn't seem like it would be a big deal but when you are used to instantaneously being there, its a huge difference.  There are spec reasons why I was excited to get this phone but the lack of service, support and basic updating has left me to not desire owning further Motorola products.Thanks"
Tried everything even called the manufacturer and they said it was defective and to return it to AMAZON.
My phone is already glitching and acting up and I just got it in September. I'm very disappointed at this.
"I bought it locked from t-mobile, but my experience using it was too bad that I decided to write a review here!It took nearly 8 hours to fully charge for a normal daily use!I just couldn’t believe how bad the battery performance of a phone can be in 2023.It was a nightmare."
"Horrible phone. App restart everything time you navigate away and come back.  Meaning that you will loose everything you were working on, like Facebook post or the news or even a car search."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Worst experience... device not even turning on just stuck on bootload .... tried 10's of time with diff power outlets and cords not reaults ... even tried to factory reset from bootload.... no results .... its refurbished i know but why making such big claims that its tested by our experts etc etc
I've had it for a day. It gets pretty warm already. It seems decent enough for the price though
"I purchased this particular cell phone because the previous cell phone that I had was the original Moto G power 2020. I bought that phone shortly after it came out, and it was still working perfectly just last month as it was when I bought it close to 4 years ago.Based on that alone, I decided to buy the newest Moto G power when I upgraded my Verizon plan one that included 5G service.Most of the features are the same, but with newer and better hardware. The coolest feature of this new phone that I have noticed is the fingerprint sensor. While the 2020 version had a round fingerprint sensor on the center back of the phone, this cell phone has the fingerprint sensor on the power button. It's worthy to note that the power button is not round, but a small line shaped button on the side of the phone. Don't ask me how this can read a fingerprint, since only about a third of your finger touches it, but it works perfectly and I've had several other people try to unlock it using their fingerprint and it has always said that the fingerprint is not recognized, while it reads my fingerprint every single time without fail perfectly. This is very convenient and handy and I'm very impressed with this feature. The camera quality, especially the video quality, seems to be of top quality for a phone that only costed me $200. I only use the camera for enjoyment and memories, certainly not for anything professional, so somebody that is into photography May disagree with this, but I think the quality is great for the price.  The phone comes with Android 13 installed on it and with one promised upgrade in the future, but as of February 26, 2024, it is still operating Android 13.  Just like the 2020 version of the Moto G power, the battery on this phone is wonderful. I use my phone to browse the internet, get directions from Google Maps, and take a few pictures during the day, and while I work overnight for 8 hours, I turn on battery saving mode and am able to play music on YouTube during almost my entire shift, without charging my phone during that entire time. When I do charge my phone, it's usually in the range of 10 to 20% battery left, but it still fully charges in less than two hours, probably closer to 1.5 hours.What I DON'T like about this phone is the audio quality. The quality of the audio on phone calls, Zoom meetings, etc. is perfectly fine and will get no complaints from me, but when I play music in my car via Bluetooth, I quickly noticed that the quality and volume are both not nearly as good as it was on my 2020 Moto G Power. The 2020 version used something called Smart Audio, while this 2023 version has something called Dolby Atmos. I've tried different settings in Atmos, different pre-set options like Music, Movie, etc. as well as just turning Dolby Atmos off altogether, and nothing has really made any difference. The quality of the music just isn't nearly as good as it was with the 2020 version of the phone. There's not nearly as much base, and when you turn on base boost, the base sounds even worse than with it off, which produces almost no base at all. Nothing is as clear or as crisp as it was with the 2020 Moto G Power, and since I drive and listen to music a lot, this is the main factor in me giving this phone a rating of 3 stars instead of 4. The 2020 version of the Moto G Power, I'd give a 5 if I could review it."
"Pretty great phone so far, I've had it a week. The camera is fantastic and the battery lasts all day. If you have Mint Mobile I'm warning you so you don't have to go through what I did. Everything I read in the description and what I googled on this model of phone said it was eSIM Card compatible. It is NOT! After a very frustrating morning of trying to get my phone service connected Motorola Customer Service told me this particular model of Moto G Power 2023 is not compatible and I had to order a physical SIM Card to be mailed to me. If you have Mint Mobile order a replacement SIM at the same time you order this phone. Other than that the phone is great so far."
"My previous cell phone was a Motorola.  I used that phone for over 3 1/2 years and finally had to give it up when the screen was shattered by accident.  After such a good experience with a Motorola phone for several years, I decided to replace my old Motorola with a newer one.Maybe my expectations were wrong to begin with.  I thought spending $300 on a cell phone would be sufficient to get a 'decent' cell phone.  Apparently, Motorola considers $300 to be something just above 'entry level'.From the first day of use I found reasons to dislike this phone:1) There's no way to turn it off.  I simply can't understand what use case Motorola was trying to satisfy here.  Sometimes you just want to turn your phone off, or at least, reboot it.2) Phone freezes - I've had a few instances where the phone has frozen for over 2 minutes.  A few times I've just given up and did a hard reset on the phone.  A new phone shouldn't have this behavior.3) Screen scrolling - The scrolling of the screen isn't smooth.  My old Motorola would smoothly scroll in applications.  This one is no where near as smooth.4) Battery life - While it's not bad, it's not great either.  I can go two days between full charges.5) Low power charger - Motorola decided to include a lower wattage charger in the package instead of a larger sized charger that would recharge the phone more rapidly.6) Finger print scanner - After one of my more recent hard resets due to freezing up, the finger print scanner failed to recognize two of my fingers for about 2 days.  Nothing was unusual with my fingers, they're the same ones I've had all my life.  After two days, it just started working again.While none of these 'issues' are deal breaking, combined together they just irritate me.Take my advice, spend a little more money and get something better."
"Overall the phone is good, but the Bluetooth connection does not work correctly"
It was a decent phone but it stopped  responding to touch can’t really explain it
"I had problems with this phone from the day my first one arrived. I didn't buy from this seller, but I bought a 6RAM, 256GB Moto G Power (2023) and that wasn't what I got delivered. Then I got the phone I'm using now, from this seller, and the phone hardware was exactly as advertised so I'm not sure how that mixup happened the first time. Chalk it up to a scammer I suppose.So, moving on, this phone arrives and its has the right features. But for a few weeks this (see pictures) is what the Internet browser looks like - images load fine, but absolutely no text is getting displayed. Turning the phone off and on again clears it up, but it's happening often enough that I'm returning this phone.I've been a Motorola user for about 9 years. I've bought them for myself and family, and despite being a budget phone (which I love) I've never had problems with them that wasn't common with the iPhone that was the only other smart phone brand that I've owned, namely that performance and battery life degrade after 3-ish years. I even tried Samsung once for about 3 months and literally just gave that phone away for free so that I could go back to Motorola, because they just have features I hate to do without. But I think this is the end, I can't deal with needing to reset my phone every few times I'm trying to browse the Internet. So long, Motorola."
"i have to test this out more. but so far, i did a video chat and lighting was off n more. idk.  the light is terrible.  my other moto flash light was the best. no other moto has matched it yet. all downgradedi was surprised to see a sd card.  i pulled out my older cell and put the sd in.  no issues. a heck of a bonus.i tell you the truth, this has flaws, but still better then razr. the video and light on that are 10 worse"
"I bought a Edge 2023. The keyboard wouldn't work. I traded it for a Think phone. I can send text to iPhones, but not receive. I was in touch with Motorola to trouble shoot. When they told me that that's all they could do, I just ordered the Moto G Power. They always treated me right. Well, the same thing is happening with it. I spoke with Motorola and we did some troubleshooting. Still no answers. I would love some help. I have a good bit of money tied up in phones that I can't receive a text from iPhones."
"I've had Motos for about 4 years and this is the last. The quality is getting terrible. This phone drives me nuts because it has a back button and I'm used to swiping back. Why go back to a back button??? Also this phone stays in 4G though I pay for 5G, it keeps dropping my network, and this is the first moto I've had that didn't come with a SIM card. The camera also still sucks. I'm ready to move on:/"
"Pros is U can send msgs to more than one person separately at one time in the msgn...lots of storage space..you can transfer your data easily from.old phone.Cons is..you don't have a 30 day hold on deleted msgs they leave permanently once deleted....mute button is right by your face, volume quality isn't so good."
I have the same phone in a lower model and it was much better than this one.  I wish I had not bought it and am disappointed.  The settings seem to have a mind of their own sometimes...really annoying.  The battery is good though and that's important.  The sound isn't that great both ends of the line...
"Replaced a 4yr old Motor G Stylus. This new 2023 Moto G Power mostly about the same... But, not overly impressed with battery life.Was expecting around 36hrs+ for charge new; but only getting just around 24 hours. With 5000mAh sized battery would have expected better.Other than that mostly looks, feels and operates like a Moto phone."
"This latest Moto phone really is far, far below the quality I have come to expect from Moto.  My last 4 phones have been Motos, and all but this one worked very well.  A real bargain for the price.  This latest model, however, constantly disconnects a phone call if you even move the phone slightly.  Forget about walking and talking, if you even try and adjust the position of the phone, it disconnects the current call.  Really frustrating if you've been on hold for 20 minutes, and then pick up the phone to speak, and the call is dropped.  As a device for communicating mobile-y via phone calls, it is virtually useless.Also, even with the battery optimizer on, I rarely get a full day's use out of the phone before it needs to be re-charged.  Very disappointing.Another tiresome feature is that, when using Verizon and utilizing a wifi connection to make and receive calls, the phone prevents notification that you have a voicemail message.  So you don't realize that you have a voicemail message waiting for you until either you go out range of wifi or you manually switch off the wifi connection.  The second that you switch to cellular data, the notification comes through.  My previous Moto model did not have this problem at all.  We even inserted another carrier's chip, and we were able to receive notifications of voicemails left to that number.  Ugh.Not to mention they removed the feature whereby you can re-arrange your screens in any order, an entire screen at a time.  Now you have to create a blank page and drag/re-order every single element individually.I have been a long-time fan of the Moto products, but this model will make me think many times about whether or not to purchase another."
I've exclusively been using Motorola phones until 22 when I went to Samsung. Went back to a moto g power 2023 this year excited to have my chop camera back. Unfortunately this thing is unbearably slow which is not an issue I've ever had with a phone as I don't do anything particularly demanding. But I can't even go back and forth between playing solitaire and looking at a text message without it reloading both apps. I'd hoped an update or a battery setting could solve the issue but I've seen nothing. I'm left wondering if it's defective or just very poorly setup out of the box. I don't really care to dig into fixing it with tech support cause the battery life isn't even that remarkable in the first place
"Planned to use it on Spectrum where this model also has been sold and is in use by others. BUT the IMEI comes back as incompatible, and Spectrum customer reps say the same."
"I bought this 2023 G power model to replace my 2 yr old G power model due to a damaged charge port and what I thought was diminished Batt capacity. I can still charge it with a rubber band keeping tension on the cord. I bought this one. I can have YouTube/Rumble on, mainly listening, and will run out of battery in about 6-8 hrs, depending on how much other activity on the phone. My old phone lasts 8-10 hrs of streaming. So my new phone's battery usage is about 25% LESS than my 2 year old phone. And it's buggy. Apps freeze. Apps conflict with other apps (like Rumble is really buggy on this phone, not on my 2 yr old phone... The finger print reader is too sensitive or in a bad spot. I was constantly unlocking my phone by just holding it. Granted, it works well, unlike my 2 yr old which has the sensor on the back. Camera is still garbage."
"Phone was buggy and had weird quirks the entire time I had it. Exactly 11 months after purchasing the battery failed. Was expecting better from Motorola. Typically these middle tier Motorola phones last at least two years for me but this one gave up early. Not recommended.For clarification, I charged it with the factory provided charger overnight and typically never needed to charge during the day so I don't think I over worked the battery and never got it hot from using high amp fast chargers.Now (11 months after purchasing) I can charge it overnight and it dies within three hours of taking it off the charger.Other than that and the strange UI bugs that I just got used to rather than trying to fix (lock screen not responding to touch or swipe, delayed notifications, occasional connection disconnect) it would have been a decent phone. I'm sure that not all of them have the same problems as mine."
"I should have spent more time reading the bad reviews of this phone.  They were spot on.  Battery life is horrible.  It took me three days to figure out how to get the phone screen to go dark and in standby mode.  The first couple days every time it moved the screen lit up.  It never did go completely dark and that ran the battery down in about 7 hours.  Finally on the third day when I was ready to send it back I was able to get the phone to go into stand by.  Don't ask me how, I don't remember but you would think the people who designed the phone would give better instructions.  Sometimes there were no instructions at all.  I will say this much.  My old phone was very similar and when I transferred the sim card it all transferred over very quickly and easily.  I will keep it but I wanted to give everyone warning the people who made this phone are idiots OR they don't care about customer service and are in it for as much money as they can get out of people"
"I don't use any high-intensity apps, besides Pokemon Go, and after a few months later, it takes 1.5 hours to lose 25% ridiculous. I thought it would be tougher better quality phone, but I believe it follows what a friend said: you get what you paid for... Just don't know what would be enough money to get a descent quality phone.Furthermore, my Motorola One 5G charges faster than this newer one. It seems that sometimes an upgraded phone doesn't mean a better one."
It does what it needs to do but definitely isn't as smooth or as fast as a Samsung.
"Got this phone to replace my LG k92 5G phone. I would have gladly bought another LG phone but since they have quit making them I figured I should probably get one from a company that could back up their products should anything happen. I guess I didn't do my due diligence in reading all about the phone because although it is similar to my lg, it is not quite the same. The biggest difference for me is the lack of a photo gallery! Not sure if I'm going to keep the phone or not. If this is a deal breaker for you then please keep looking at other phones. Does anybody have a suggestion for a phone that would be similar to my LG k92 5g?"
This is the 2 Motorola Power g phone.  I liked the 1st one but this one sucks.  Battery life is not anywhere near as good as my previous Power G and there is a little icon or whatever ya call it. Touch it and a small window opens up you can move around to magnify pictures or text.  The icon is always in the way.  I'd rather not have it.
"The phone has a phone is okayIt's in your privacy a lot more than my previous phone, wants to sell me more ads continuously through the settings of my previous phone, and I can't stand how many basic common features are not available on this phone.I would not purchase this phone again"
"This phone deserves a 5 star but for some reason my speaker crackles so bad and won't stop doing that and I have the phone protected very nicely in a fancy case and screen protector and it's flawless, yet those speaker crackling and everyone on the phone with me wants to hang up because of it and I can hardly handle it myself 😞 be smart and invest in a protection plan!!"
"Basic phone, nothing special.Battery life isn't too good, have to charge 2-3 times a day and phone gets hot.Decent camera, I like that there's different settings you can choose for the picture."
Good improvement for the mid range phone. Sadly still lacks the wireless charging and tap to pay features.Much faster than the 2022 version.Very hard to charge. Even in battery saver mode it loses charge while charging with previous turbo charger and high end laptop/steam deck charger. Only the newest version Motorola Turbo charger kicks into turbo mode and even then it's about 1% per minute if you turn off everything and leave it on standby. Frequently I've had to turn it off and let it charge all day. Otherwise it will hover around 18% while it slowly charges them drains when I use it.
"I have owned Motorola phones for years so it's safe to say I am a fan.This phone just is not up to the quality I normally expect from Motorola.Coming from the One 5G Ace, this is a let-down. Yes, it's lighter. That is because (I think) the battery is smaller. This results in a shorter battery life, no matter what Motorola claims.My main issue is with the signon sequence. It used to be so smooth with the Ace. Now, the lock screen is overlaid with a white screen, then the unlock keypad appears, all in a very clunky series of events.*Not good, Motorola.*I wish I could have held on to the Ace but there were issues so it had to be replaced.Next time I may look at a Samsung or Google Pixel. More money, I know, but maybe better software."
"It's definitely a great budget phone, but I don't know if it's just this one faulty phone or if it's all of them, but the battery life is horrible. I'll charge it completely and barely use it except maybe 10-20 minutes the whole day and look at it and over half the battery is used up. With it just sitting there."
"Bought this for my fiance, forgot to factory reset it before I gave it too her. Her bank account got hacked like 3 weeks after I gave it to her. I can't be 100% sure it was the phones fault (keylogger, etc.) and it is good quality at a good price. But the timing bugs me. Make sure you factory reset your used phone!"
"This phone has raise to wake enabled by default with no way to disable it in settings which means the screen constantly turns on and off when the phone is moved often with only the slightest movement which uses up the battery and is very annoying.  For the life of me I can't figure out why there wouldn't be an option to disable it?  When the phone is in my pocket I have no doubt it's turning off and on hundreds of times during the day with the battery draining.  For this alone I would avoid this phone.UPDATE:  To be fair I finally found a thread online to fix the above if anyone is having the same annoying problem.  In the Moto app you actually have to enable Peek Display, once you do that then it lets you go to Peek Display settings and you can disable the wake when phone moves setting."
"The phone is fine, except that it gets too hot when using it. I had Spotify running for approximately an hour and a half, and had to shut it down for fear that it would catch on fire, or explode! I'm not real happy with this purchase. I guess you get what you pay for..."
"When I hook it up to my 2 TV's, with an HDMI cable, it doesn't project my phone on to TV. My last phone didn't either, and that's part of the reason why I got a new phone. This SUCKS !!!"
Getting used to it. Discovering issues
"First the positive.  The battery is great, easily last all day and has gone two days with battery to spare. Had an SD slot and actual audio jack. Screen is big. Honestly kinda to big. Screen images are high quality and audio is clear.  Unfortunately the killer to this phone is,  this phone.  The Motorola and Android software crash constantly. The phone reboots all the time. It is almost dangerous how often this thing crashes.  You can't make phone calls,  finish getting directions to where you are going or any of the other important things you need it for. I want to love this phone, when it works it's really good but the Software integration is abysmal.  The phone worked for roughly two weeks before the screen started glitching. Then the crashes started.  After two weeks I factory reset the phone and got another two weeks before an update hit and phone started crashing again."
how could you sell a phone that did not have NFC function? I wanted to buy Motorola because my generation grew up dreaming Motorola. its really pity that the phone did not have NFC reader.
"When I bought this Moto G ""Power"" 5G, I thought I was getting the long battery life phone but it was not.  Other Moto G power phones has 3day battery life but this one is not.  The battery life is less than a day in my case  This phone is 5G.  That's mean the phone use much more battery than 4G.  If you could disable the  5G, may be you could get long battery life.If you need the long battery life, I don't recommend this phone.BTW, this phone worked without problems with Mint mobile."
"DO NOT BUY IF YOU CAN AVOID.- Extremely laggy. Opening and switching between apps takes several seconds (often 10-20).- Switching between apps often causes a full refresh. Have lost data more than once to that issue.- Constantly drops Bluetooth connection. This seems to be connected to the lag. Often when I'm listening to something, the apps will do a full refresh and the Bluetooth connection will drop. (It happens multiple times each hour; gets old fast.)I don't think reviewers do enough to convey just how insanely slow and annoying the above issues are. When a given app is open the phone isn't as fast as a flagship but it works just fine (even games have a slight lag but nothing that's a deal breaker). However, the basic functionality of opening and switching apps is just so bad I'm gonna try and return this even if I can't get a full refund."
"It's okay, nothing to brag about. I bought a new cell because I dropped the old one and a rock cracked the main camera lens. I was hoping the new phone would be faster since it has 4x the memory as the old phone. Actually think the Power G is slower than the Motorola XT2045-3 (G fast). Touch screen doesn't always acknowledge my fingers. The case Amazon recommended from Fntcase is non stick in that if you bump the phone when it is on a flat surface it will go flying. I'm used to cases that reduce phones from sliding, this case is hard plastic I assume if dropped on a cold winter day in New England it will shatter into a million pieces. But given my track record at breaking phones ......I'll suck it up and deal with this one."
"Bought this 2023 phone primary because of the camera specs where it says on Motorola web site: [0.5X Ultra-wide zoom] => Capture more of the scene than with the standard lens. Use for architectural and landscape photography.Unfortunately, this feature was not available for the phone that I got. I did try to load the latest system firmware updates, cleared camera cache, etc, but nothing helped to activate missing 0.5X zoom feature. Also, found on one of the forums that I was not alone with this particular problem for this 2023 G power 5G with no resolution whatsoever on the moment of the writing this review, so buyers be aware.Last but not least, tied to use Chrome on this brand new phone, which crashed several times within 5 minutes. YouTube also was glitchy so I had to use my old phone to continue my troubleshooting.Anyway, I rated this phone 2 stars because of the decent HW that has some potential, but from SW perspective this phone is still raw, with unstable essential apps and missing features so I decided not to waste my time looking for non-existing solution and returned it."
I got this because my phone told me. I needed more storage and now this phone is telling me I need more storage.
Is on the right side of phone and not suitable for a left handed person
"This item was bought in good faith. It could not be supported by my cable co.'s mobile. I returned the item unused, unaltered, and promptly. Slow delivery, no support, and an interminably slow refund. Nice phone. Bought from the manufacturer instead. Extra⭐for refunding to card."
Battery died on vacation. Wouldn’t charge in my car at all. Plugged it in for 2 hours; still dead. Only charged after I got home on electricity.Be warned.
"Aside from a nicer screen and a little more memory and ram, the 2023 g power 5g that replaced my 2020 G-power seemed to be an inferior phone. If it wasn't for the ending of security updates, I probably would have kept my 2020 another few years.The haptic touch in the 2023 sounded like things were rattling within the phone every time I would push a button. I liked the haptics in my older phone much better and it was rattle free. Doing a geekbench test on the GPU resulted in a failing test every time, leading me to believe the phone had various GPU issues which were never resolved by Motorola.I ended returning my 2023 moto g power 5g and picked up a 2023 Moto G stylus 5g phone which seems to be a step up in quality all around. A better Snap dragon processor vs. the Mediatek in the G-power 5g. It also passed all geekbench tests with flying colors.If you're looking for a nice Moto phone check out the G Stylus 5g, in my opinion it's a superior phone to the G-power 5g for less money."
It's a good phone but has a poor camera quality.
What the heckThere was no SIM card
Pretty disappointed that a couple of months after having this phone and taking a brand new job that this phone will dial every number but that one. I need to call my place of employment. I went through Verizon tech. I went through the store. They did everything including switching out the SIM card and it will not fix the problem. My only solution is to buy a new phone like I can afford to keep buying new phones. Don't buy this phone. Don't buy online. Don't buy a used/refurbished phone. Get a store phone!!! This is probably the third or fourth time I've purchased a phone outside of the store and have had problems every single time.
The screen color is very nice.
"I have always said good things about Motorola but since Lenovo buying it, it has gone to the ground they don't issue software updates or bug fixes for that matter and on paper these specs seem really good but the dimensity 930 chip is not that great maybe if it had 4X arm cortex a78 cores Instead of two ..come on Lenovo issue us bug fixes only on June patch should have gave us July where almost into September....the reason I like having updates is there's a factory reset glitch for this phone so if I lost it someone can get into the phone not that secure ."
"My old Moto 5G Ace worked well enough but since Motorola doesn't allow saving apps on an added SD card, opted to try an affordable phone with more internal storage for my learning-related apps. There's plenty of bloatware, but here are my real concerns: (1) Sometimes the phone just doesn't work. At all. For texts or calls. I can see it is charged and has service but it ... doesn't function. (2) Keyboard does NOT appear about 50% of the time when I try to text so I have to restart phone. To text!  (3) Even when I can use the internet/wifi on my Kindle, laptop, and Samsung Tablet, this phone tells me more than half the time ""Can't connect to the internet"" and it doesn't. (4) After setting DEFAULTS, the phone system often  ignores my defaults (yep, I checked, and they're saved) and pauses to tell me it's going to a Microsoft or Google product at which point I have to stop to select my DEFAULT. Defeats the purpose of setting defaults, right?In summary, maybe I got a lemon or maybe this is just not a good value. Giving this 1* because it sometimes takes decent pics and there's no Zero-Stars option. I like to travel and need a phone that's an Asset and is Reliable, not a stressor. Save yourself a headache and select another brand."
"This is by far the biggest pile ofcrap phone I have ever owned. It is extremely slow. I can't play music and a simple number game at the same time. I have owned Motorola my whole life, I'm 42, and after this phone I'm thing about switching to Samsung. I constantly have to restart it because it freezes up or so slow. I must say the durability is good because I've thrown it across the room several times because it's so incredibly slow, and it's not broken. DO NOT BUY!!!"
"This is my 4th Motorola phone. I use them for work and personal so I usually have 2 and replace them when their batteries stop working well (every 2-3 years or so). I always buy a phone cover and screen protector to help protect the device. I've never had any problem with any previous models being fragile, but this one is. I had had it less than 2 months and the screen it chipped on the edge and cracked in 2 places.The battery life is good. The photo quality is good too. Just very disapointed in the screen being as fragile as it is."
"After 4 days of calling Motorola and T-Mobile both are stating that it will not Work with T-Mobile Network.To bad it is a nice phone and fast as well. Being for that reason I gave it 3 stars.Also the shipping and returns on the Motorola Moto G Power 5G are horrible, took weeks to get it and weeks to get a refund. I will never buy a phone from Amazon again."
"Chrome failed repeatedly, all messaging apps won't send consistently. I keep getting an error message when I send SMS. I restart and it works for a few hours and then reverts to not sending.  I switched the SIM to my old phone and everything worked fine. Speed and performance is good. Battery life is not as good as advertised. 10 hour moderate use (no gaming or video) drained the battery. I would not buy again. I'm a big proponent of the moto g series ) I've purchased three others but this one does not do that one basic thing"
"VERY disappointed on Motorola Quality. This piece of garbage locks up frequently, loses connectivity to my ear phones (hearing aids) and must be restarted several times a day. Phone has a LOT of latency. I came from a Pixel 6a which, other than battery life and overheating was a better product. I do NOT recommend this phone at all."
I assumed that when I upgraded my 2020 device to newest 2023 it would be the same great battery but it barely makes it through the day. I have battery optimized and screen is almost lowest settings. I also dislike all pictures make it seem like you have the beauty filter on and also really red faced. Ive also had issues with recaphtcha while browsing the web.
So I bought this for my wife. The product is advertised as being unlocked for the US. I charge it and turn the phone on. I then put the T-Mobile sim card in. It keeps saying ( invalid sim card detected ). Then it keeps saying install a Xfinity mobile sim card. This is just BS. Do not advertise it as being unlocked when it is not. The seller should be ashamed for selling it like this. This is false advertising.
I had a Motorola g power 2021. The battery life was great. The phone was much thicker than the 2023 g power.. this g power 2023 cannot have the same battery 50000 mAh battery as the 2021 version. At 100% charge within 5 hours it's down to 50%. Motorola is not what it used to be. Now I'm stuck with phone that's not as advertised.Update .. now the phone on any given day will not load chrome web browser. Impossible to go online and see all what's on a web page
"THE other features camera, storage etc were ok."
"I took pictures that did not look real. In addition, the microphone does not have enough volume. Also screen freezes"
"Because it's a total pain switching phones, I'm going to keep it but they changed the battery in this year's model.  It has to be charged nightly and really used power during the day.  The previous models had batteries that lasted 3 days.  So if you need a long lasting battery, look elsewhere.  Camera is slow., But clear.  Phone is not always responsive.  Still good value for money but my older one was a great value, I just ran out of memory at 64g and a 64 g sd card.  This one is 256 with a 512 SD card.  Hoping it lasts several years."
"After purchasing, but before I received, I did more in depth research  and  followed with comparisons to other android devices. I found this phone will only receive one IOS update; while other android devices receive several over a period of years.  Also found does not have ""nfc"" (not a huge deal...but is a great feature).  After receiving found this phone  will not stay powered off.  Device was ""powered off"" and in the box to return and  I hear...""Hello moto!"""
"Ordered this 2023 Moto G Stylus and the manual shows a stylus on the bottom right, but there sure isn't one on this one. Not pleased with that. The phone works okay but it is early days yet. Recommend making sure if you order this that there is a stylus if that is what you wanted."
"I thought product would have been great, but unfortunately with my network service I was unable to use it and had to return product.My disappointment is with the ""Return Service"" because even though the product was returned on May 10th 2023, and is marked as returned on my account, I still have yet to see my refund back in my account. Which is sad and unfortunate especially given the many years I have been working with Amazon.I am still waiting to get my Refund back"
"When you try to turn off or restart this phone, Google assistant rears its ugly head to ask what you want it to do. When you say to shut down the phone, it takes you to Instructions on how to shut down the phone. You must hold the on/off button down for quite awhile before the phone shuts down. You are not given an option to simply restart. I tried turning off Google assistant to avoid this annoyance but when I tried to restart my phone, it popped up again and said to turn on Google Assistant."
"Always been a fan of Moto phones. Had a Moto One and was having some issues with it due to age. Best phone I ever had.After some research I chose this for the supposed charge life. Pretty disappointed. Camera sucks, too. Keeps shutting down and restarting on its own.Will be switching to something else soon."
"The phone freaks out when 2 apps or more are open at once so if I'm listening to a podcast and trying to look something up or text or play a game, it shots everything down so often. My A14 Samsung that's $2/month never did that and I spent over $150 on this. It's crap. Oh, and the battery life isn't good"
"The phone can't do NFC so no tap to pay anywhere. Huge deal breaker. I also have to charge it 2-3 times a day even if I don't use it or only text, no streaming, no games. It's just a horribly short battery life that takes almost as many hours to charge (yes even with fast/turbo power chargers) as it lasts."
"Unable to activate, couldn't type anything in,poor instructions."
I was watching a video whilst the phone was charging and it suddenly became very hot. Now the battery will not charge fully. Seems to be a problem unique to this phone.
"I enjoyed the camera and editing program.  Nice and clear pics, even taken through windows!  The camera is already glitching and freezing and I've only had it a week or so."
"I have always bought Motorola G phones and loved them.  I recently upgraded to the 2023 Moto G.  I only upgraded because I was running out of storage and I was going out of state for my son's wedding.  I am completely disappointed.  The battery doesn't last like the batteries in my previous phones.  The screen is smaller and the phone is lighter.  I have 5g service, a 5g SIM card and this phone rarely if ever picks up 5g.  You have to dig around for the off button and taking a screen shot is a pain. I should have returned it and just switched back to my old phone.  I won't take a chance and upgrade to another Moto G in the future.  Totally bummed."
This was not a USA phone...so I was unable to use it to get service from Spectrum as I had planned. My husband has the US one and his was fine. Was not happy! I started setting it up then went to get the sim card only to find out this wouldn't work. So be careful if you order a phone from Amazon that is unlocked and be sure you can use it here. Very disappointed!
"This is my second similar Motorola phone. The first one lasted about a year and a half, till the battery literally blew up. Now this one is eight months old and it malfunctions all the time. Whether it is a hardware or software issue I can not determine. Tried every possible remedy. Just buggy or chip going bad maybe. Too bad for me I guess. No more Motorola phones for me."
It was fine to begin with but after a month it got very tiny and out of pitch.
The phone was supposed to be unlocked. When it arrived it was locked to a carrier I don't use which made it useless to me. I don't know if this is a one off problem or if it is common.
"Its only December and it already doesn't work properly.  I haven't used all the memory or anything.  It sends random texts that I didn't send, it won't keep my apps open.  I'm not happy with this purchase."
Price dropped 100 dollars the day after I purchased it. GRRRRR
Phone is heating when chargingSlow on the apps
I had a big problem trying to figure out how to work with the SIM card that I put in there but eventually I saw to connect to Wi-Fi for the setup and it worked.
"The performance of this phone is much better than the 2021 Moto G Power I had. It's processing power is great, the memory storage is also great. The problem now is the battery life. This phone will be at 50% power by lunch time. Get ready to charge this thing all the time."
"Motorola decided to force you to load junk apps which you have to waste time trying to remove or disable. Then it keeps trying to get you to load them again.The battery life is 1/2 of what I was getting on my Moto G5+, Moto G Power (2021), and Samsung A53. Most use seems to be on the ""Mobile network"", even overnight. I'm using the same apps, and roughly the same texting and phone use."
"The worst part is you can't get your apps for old phones now. I guess Google has figured out a way to prevent that unless you go through Play, and I'm getting sick of having to ""register"" phones just to transfer programs I have already paid for. The phone is also full of bloatware, again mostly Google things designed to gather information so big brother Google can spy on us and sell our information. Previous versions didn't have all of this Google spyware, and you were easily able to move files back and forth with other phones. If the goal was to increase profits, Motorola has absolutely failed. I sent it back right away. What a shame. My 2020 version was great, but this is the last time I'm buying a Google-motorola phone."
"The phone operates slow, going from app to app is slow, opening apps is slow, using the camera is almost impossible because it glitches so much. Save your money and buy a different phone"
The phone is just fine except even with the call volume pushed all the way up if you are in a public place you will not be able to hear the person you are trying to talk to on the phone and that's just not acceptable.
"I purchased this phone to replace 2021 Gpower, I hate it. Battery doesn't last as long, to many prompts from Google, apps slow to respond. I tolerated Motorola for incredible battery capacity. It has 2 stars because I'm sure there's worse out there that I hope not to discover. Thinking about a iPhone now."
"I *loved* the 2020 version of this phone, and when the battery on that started to go, I didn't think twice about buying this as the replacement.  Oops.  The first problem is the Android Material UI, which is less usable than the previous skins, and I find ugly as sin.  But that's subjective; YMMV.  What's not subjective is the bugs.  It quite often mistakes my taps for swipes, the clock just disappears off the lock screen at times, and now suddenly (the day after the return window closed, of course) the phone won't even make calls, even after a restart.  It also downloaded a bunch of apps it thought I might like on its own.  I don't know if that's on Google or Moto, but... no.  It's just been a mess."
"I bought this in July and now it is October and the battery is dead each morning. I bought the refurbished model that was  claimed to be ""like new.""  My 2022 model Motorola is still working but I wanted 5G. I am very disappointed and 189.00 is quite a loss for 3 months of use.  I only use the phone for audiobooks and a few calls."
"My neighbor bought the same phone and he can message himself, I can't.  My old phone did.  Not sure who to contact or how to fix this."
"It's a good easy to use phone. I satisfied with it, I really would have liked wireless charging."
"The phone itself seems okay, but trying to get rid of the huge amount of garbage apps is a major headache!I’ve been told that Motorola phones are notorious for this!This was a gift for my elderly mom and she’s not overly techie and she doesn’t like it.I should’ve paid a little more and bought an apple phone like mine.Live and learn"
This is the worst phone I've ever had. Poor sound. Poor quality. Not user friendly. Only had for a few months and ended up having to buy a different brand. My friend had the same phone with the same problems.
I was very disappointed with my new phone.  It has no where near the battery life of my previous two phones.  The Moto G 7 and  Moto  G Power 2020 had fantastic battery life.
Battery doesn't last well. Worst battery life of any phone I have ever owned. My phone is used mostly for talk and text. Use less than average on those. The phone is okay. Good value for the money if you don't mind charging a lot.
"Received the phone, and discovered it’s still LOCKED to a carrier!!!??! I cannot use it, so it’s now just a very expensive paperweight.Don’t waste your time, I’m not the only one this has happened to."
"!) Bloatware in abondance,Unable to uninstall jujst disable2) No flash notifaction, or LED for received messages3) Very picky on SD CARD brand4)contined reminder to continue with set up phone. Went thru set up 3 times.....5) unable to power down or turn off phoneI am rating this model phone as disapointing and over priced."
"I truly dislike this phone already. It is a pain to set up. Loaded with bloatware that has to be removed. Tedious. Swipe up does not kill an app. You have to go to the square at the bottom and then kill all the ones you opened. The home screen has an enormous clock/date icon that cannot be changed. It takes up two slots on the home screen. Compared to my nice and easy, user friendly Moto X4, this one is a major disappointment. Still more features to test but time will tell if it is a keeper."
"Phone has terrible service. I have Verizon carrier and with old phones, I was able to get good enough service to make a call. With this phone I am constantly sitting at zero service. I have to use my spouses phone. Shipping and everything was fast and it was a new phone, it's just the product is junk."
"lock up constantly cannot control apps, downloads ads without permission, extremely ad friendly. the most annoying phone I have ever had. After a few month I need a new phone, again...  DO NOT BUY"
"BUYER BEWARE. Read the negative reviews about the A25. Apparently, the shutting off/connection problems are a known issue and are non-repairable.Days after the 30-day return window closed, my son's phone kept turning off. Call Samsung customer service and the representative says it is because we aren't using the correct Samsung charger. Bought two of the recommended chargers and they are EXACTLY like the two we already own. What a waste of money!Continued to have phone issues. Contact Samsung customer service and they say to return it for repair. Next we get an email saying phone received by Samsung repair department but they don't have the needed part and it will take 10 days for them to get it.Update: (May 10, 2024), we get an email stating the phone is being returned -- UNREPAIRED. No explanation, just an 800 number to call for more info.  Called, complained, told they'd look into it. Called, complained, told it was being referred to another department.Update: (May 24, 2024) After weeks of complaining and being jerked around, we finally get a text that we'll get a cash refund. Heaven knows how long it will take to actually get it.We will replace the defective Samsung A25 with a different model. Meanwhile, we hold our breath and hope our second A25 lasts more than a few months.For years, we've been fans of Samsung products, having owned a number of Samsung televisions, monitors, tablets, phones. Samsung was our go-to for electronic entertainment. Normally, we love the products but the customer service is definitely third-rate at best. We hope the experience we had with the A25 is an isolated one and not a predictor of the way Samsung's business is heading."
"Upgrading from an A14 due to more storage and more RAM. Hugely disappointed that this phone runs no better than my A14. The screen on the A14 is better when compared side-by-side.  My A25 freezes, opens and closes apps on its own, won't keep memory of last app and will restart the app. The screen is unresponsive A LOT. Sometimes the keyboard will not pop up. Other times I'll be typing and all my words get bunched up showing where the spell check words are, but not in any field on the screen. It's so frustrating. Sometimes I have to keep tapping the screen for it to be responsive. Other times it jumps from screen to screen. The battery life is okay, nothing stellar. Sound quality is decent, but I don't care much about that at this point. I have quality ear buds and BT speakers. I've been a Samsung consumer for decades. I've had a handful of awful Samsung phones including the ones Samsung would kill, (had two of the same model and they both died a day or two away from each other) like they were scheduled to be a brick. Took me a while to get good with Samsung again...and here I am. Again. Taking a screen shot is difficult because the power button is too sensitive and the - volume button is not. It takes some finesse. Your experience might be different, but I got a crappy phone it appears. There's also some connectivity issues with LTE. I wouldn't recommend Samsung A25 at all."
"This phone is ""unlocked"" but cannot be used with USCellular."
"I wish I could give Zero stars.  After owning the phone for a few months it began malfunctioning.  It would start and stop apps on its own randomly.  Sometimes it would start playing music, other times the weather or the calculator numerous other apps would start.  Today it was Lyft's turn, and it welcomed me as a new user.  At least I could make and receive phones and texts; everything else was a crap shoot.Samsung customer service was even worse.  The phone was past Amazon's 30 day return period, but I knew I was covered by Samsung's 1 year warranty... ha!!!  I've never been so wrong.  The first tech was a very pleasant woman to whom I gave permission to link into my phone and adjust some settings more to her liking.  She made sure I had the most up to date firmware (maybe software).  This did no good.  The next tech had me wipe the phone clean to original factory settings, and then download the current firmware.  This also did no good.  I finally got to a supervisor, and he said to take the phone to Samsung's nearest walk-in repair location.  Happily this was only a few miles from my home.  The tech there accomplished nothing.Today I went through the entire tech and then to supervisor routine again.  The supervisor promised to call me back in about 2 hours after texting me to make sure it was a convenient time.  He never texted nor called... what an insult to a customer.  So I tried again working my way to another supervisor, who had the ticket of my earlier call.  He insisted I sent them the phone to have their tech people examine it.  That this was done locally had no impact on him.  I raised enough hell to be bumped up to his boss who went on and on about Samsung's ""Policy"" of getting the phone back before honoring their warranty, and their was no other way.I give him a couple of other ways, such as buying a phone from Amazon and and sending it to me (as a loaner, if need be), or he could reach in his pocket and send me his phone to use while my phone in transit and being evaluated for a maybe 3-4 weeks.  He had a fit.  I gave him a few other options, but he said that only one of their techs had that authority.  I told him I'd guess the CEO of Samsung in Korea probably had that authority as well.  And that many other people had it as well, but he would only repeat Samsung's ""Policy"", which I then told him was in conflict with my Policy.I let him know that I'd contact the Ohio Sect of State, who loves tearing into big companies, and that I was sure his team of lawyers would find something, anything to sue them for.  I guess breach of contract, false advertising, etc.  When I told him government works slowly so he might not be served with the suit for a few years, but to be on the look out for it.Keep away from this phone, and never count on Samsung to honor their warranty.  They make it nearly impossible to dance to their requirements."
"This applies only to the SM-A256U1 variant of the Galaxy A25 5G. It replaces my review from a week or so earlier, with some better info and less invective (I hope).  That said, this is my last Samsung purchase, for reasons I'll (calmly) enumerate.  The executive summary is:The phone seems to work reasonably well, after I fixed some glaring issues (No thanks to the utterly useless Samsung Customer Support).  I haven't had any of the connection issues I've seen in other reviews, but then I was careful to select the variant mentioned above, one of only 2 that support my AT&T prepaid service.  The essential documentation for this variant is unpublished (unforgivably IMHO).I mistakenly claimed previously that the bluetooth couldn't detect my favorite headset, but AT&T support proved me wrong.But, the unacceptably bad voice transcription, which Samsung told me flatly couldn't be changed, turned out (thanks to a web angel) to be the Samsung Keyboard, easily replaced by a settings switch for the already-installed Google Voice Typing.  (And I prefer to think of Support as inept rather than dishonest in never telling me.)The (hopefully) last functional problem was that the advertised 8 MP UltraWide camera (1 of 3) was inaccessible to the factory installed camera app.  Go ahead, read it again.  They installed hardware with no way to use it.  I found I could access the function with the Open Camera app, meaning I need 2 apps to control all the cameras.What burns me (and maybe no one else) is the fact that Samsung has apparently published no spec sheet or user's guide for this particular variant, which may account somewhat for the Support team's ineffectuality.My tech-savvy friend has also sworn off Samsung, and has good things to say about Pixel.  End of rant."
"I realize people love their Galaxy phones, and that, in general, they're decent phones, and I likely just got a lemon, but I'm reviewing the phone I received, which was horrible.The good.  I was upgrading from a middle-of-the-road Motorola.  The graphics on this Samsung were great, smooth motion, and really high brightness levels.  Sound was also really good.The bad.  Like, really bad.  After spending two days getting everything set up on the new phone, I'm using it for navigation, and the phone just shut off.  Restarted, ran, for another few minutes, and shut off again.  No, the battery wasn't dead.  After that, it would stay running long enough for me to log in, then shut off again.  No drops, bumps, impacts, or anything.Found a video online that showed a setting that could enable these random shut-downs, but that option was not set on my phone.The phone felt warm, but not uncomfortably hot.  After keeping it powered off for a couple hours, I was able to get it going again, and it stayed up, but now, no texts or calls came in, and anything I tried to send said ""waiting for network"".  Texts would eventually send, usually minutes later.I'm using the phone in the same area I've lived for decades, and there are no known network dead spots.  Every other phone I've had, with multiple carriers, works fine everywhere.  If I randomly open Chrome on the phone, it's unable to get online unless I'm somewhere with wifi.  The mobile data network would eventually reconnect, but for me, the phone was just too unreliable, so I'm returning it.Silver lining here is that the phone starting failing almost immediately, so I was still easily within Amazon's return window."
"I get the feeling Samsung wanted to re-create the iPhone experience with this galaxy. I bought it because the android platform is much simpler and for years did not seem to have the problems of Apple downloading iOS that deliberately slow everything down.Not anymore. About two months after I had this phone a series of downloads were placed on Samsung. Now it takes about two minutes to boot up, so quick reboot.  Now put a bar on the screen, saying optimizing apps and takes a good full two minutes to reboot just to turn the thing on. I’m not talking about a reboot after updates. I’m talking about every time I turn on the phone. Quite a surprise to me. Samsung wanted to be like an iPhone, well, Apple may mess with battery obsolete all your accessories, etc. but at least it’s still boots up quickly.I can’t say that for this phone. It was functioning just fine if I’ve written this review a month earlier it would’ve been a 4 1/2 star.  Now, I don’t know what they’ve put on this phone.  Just all I can say is get your money worth.  The phone was a good value. It works, but frustrated."
"Like: it's a cell, plenty of storage for my needs, long battery life, clear screen and pictures.Don't like: even tho I have it on auto connect for wifi, it DOES NOT auto connect. My hubby has same phone, we used all of our data the 1st 2 months we had these phones, didn't realize why until I dug into the situation. Constantly have to reconnect. Pain in the ars."
"I used the phone for 2 weeks and now calls drop, signal drops out and text will not go through whether on wifi or network. Restart the phone it works fine for a day and then same issues again until restarting phone. I never had these issues with phones in the past and calls connected to my network and wifi work great on my old phone. I would not recommend"
"This phone and my experience with Samsung has been an absolute nightmare.About 5 weeks after I bought it, the phone, text, and internet functions stopped working properly. The phone wouldn’t make or receive calls or texts, and the internet would work for a few minutes and then go dead for an extended period.The service carrier (T-Mobile) ran multiple diagnostics on the phone and told me the problem is likely the hardware. That’s when the chaos really started.I called Samsung, and they told me I need to call their local repair center.When I called the repair center, they told me they didn’t have parts for the phone, and it would likely take about 3 days to fix it because they would have to order the parts.So I called Samsung back to ask for a replacement phone, and they told me I needed to go the repair center to have them confirm that the phone is under warranty.So I wasted an hour driving to and from the repair center, only to have them tell me that the parts are backordered, and they don’t know when they are coming in.Soooo, I called Samsung again, and they told me that I needed to send my phone to them, and they will repair it or send me a new one in about 12 business days!I demanded a supervisor, and the supervisor told me there was nothing she could do to speed up this process.I told her that was outrageous and unacceptable, and she then called Amazon to ask for an extension of the return window. Kudos to Amazon for refunding the phone.Samsung then offered to sell me an A35 for $80 more than the A25, which I rejected.So here I am, about 10 hours of wasted time later, without a phone."
"Had to return because of lack of service support for this specific phone. If it were though, I would still be using it, probably."
"Bought this as it has 5g vs my older A51 that was 4g. Going from 4 to 5 was not great an experience.Here are the problems I've had:1 - Failure to re-connect to mobile network when coming back into range when out of range. I was an hour away from our house and received a call from my wife. Signal wasn't the greatest but at least I could understand her. When I went to leave, I opened Google Maps to show me the way home. Device said no connection. I remembered part of the way and figured when I was in range the phone would automatically connect. Well, I was only 1/2 hour from home and phone still gave 'no connection' message. Frustrated, I pulled over, shut the phone down and restarted it. Magically, it now had a connection!2 - Today it would not make a call (even 911!), all incoming calls went straight to voicemail and call history did not even show these calls. Restarted phone and magically, everything was ok!3 - Samsung music player in new phones does not play WMA files where the Samsung player in my old A51 would.I can't believe I spent this much money on a phone that I apparently need to restart every few days to get it to function properly and to restart it when I go out of range (I was only 1 county over).I may get iPhone next time or if an Android, definitely NOT Samsung."
"Still getting use to the phone...Disappointed a Samsung cord didn't come with it...I always get a phone, won't use till it's charged 100% and with the cord that comes with phone...my order didn't come with phone..."
"Adequate for light use such as calls and photos. Good reception, vivid screen. Feels underpowered and lurchy for moderate use, such as navigation / switching between apps. Fingerprint reader is average."
"I love the look and feel of the phone, but unfortunately there are a few major issues. The camera glitches if I try to livestream or do any video calls. Also my mic is horrible! so I have to use a mic every time I live stream, record, and video call. As a Content creator this is a major disappointment."
"I would definitely b.uy this product again, if I hated myself."
"My husband & I both got the galaxy A25. After WEEKS of troubleshooting, including completely reseting the phones, we still had connection issues with ALL 3 phones. I'm talking Bluetooth, wifi & cell service connection issues. We were lucky to keep cell service at all, much less 5G. Sometimes I'd get the old busy dial tone when I'd call my husbands phone, even if it was showing I had good cell service. His would do the same when he'd call me, never seen that issue before... My 1st phone had a faulty battery & connection issues within a week or so. We returned it for another one, hoping for the best. Then my husband's phone started having the same connection issues. My new phone arrived & guess what? Same connection issues right off the bat. It's for sure not our sim cards/service provider because our old phones work just fine. Thank goodness we still have them. Our wifi isn't cutting in and out on any of our other devices. My bluetooth headphones work & connect just fine to other devices! These phones are just defective! This has been such a nightmare!!!! We're switching back to the S series & will be buying elsewhere. Not sure if it's Amazon selling all the defective ones or if its just the A25 model in general."
"Product was shipped in an empty box far too large for the phone, no sim tray. Not usable out of the box, certainly not ""good condition"""
I upgraded from glaxay note 10 plus and this phone is good for the price but I've notice the camera action is so slow along with the speakers for music and listening to somone on the phone talk is super quiet
"Got this for my daughter as a first phone. Overall, phone HW and ID look great. However, even though this is advertised as ""unlocked"" for US carriers, Spectrum mobile claims this is not compatible with their network and so I am returning this."
It was hard to use wouldn't let me make calls. Loses Internet easily. Was not happy I returned it.
"The camera quality on this thing is terrible and only has the option to zoom while using the 12 mp option. 50 mp cannot zoom leaving you with only being able to use it up close. I bought the phone in hopes of being able to capture great shots of my boys on the baseball field and my daughter while marching with the band.The speed and function of the phone is subpar for the price. I've bought much cheaper phones that function better. Overall, extremely disappointed and wish getting my money back was an option so I could buy something better."
Phone was Great till one day out of nowhere it started to drop cell service and not receiving calls. I read that this model Samsung a25 has a flaw in the motherboard that it would mess up the phone.ProsGreat batteryClear hd screenErgonomicsHeadphone holeConsFlawed motherboardFingerprint sensor wackyFrequent cell reception drops.Over all it was a great phone while it lasted.
Purchased this phone for $299.99 received yesterday and today it now selling for $249.99 thats $50 bucks difference and there is a used pne for $274.79.  Wish I had had those options.  Other than that phone is good.
"Ordered this phone as a replacement for my old LG phone, worked great for the first 3 months but now has issues with recognizing touch on the screen. It will twitch or freeze up as if something is holding up the capacitive touchscreen, can only be remedied by resetting the phone (which takes about a minute and a half of wait time for full functionality is restored). Would recommend finding a phone that doesn't have this problem since it seems to be systemic from what I've researched."
Very good phone for a modest price of $300
The ad says it is unlocked but it is not and Metro T-Mobile charged me $35 to switch phones then another $35 to switch it back to my old phone when they told me it was not unlocked.
"I bought this phone 5 months ago.  It worked for two months and then it stopped getting any reception and connectivity to any network.  It only works on WiFi and not always on that.  The “warranty” says you have to mail it in for 12 days minimum so their techs can look at it.  There is no loaner phone.  Obvioulsy, this is not a viable option for people to be phone less for two weeks.  Help yourself and move one from this product and this horrible customer service.Side note:  while the software for this phone (updates and such) is still supported, it is next to impossible to find replacement parts which is why you cannot get the phone fixed at local repair shops."
Wifi constantly disconnects and doesn't pick up networks. Only has long exposure up to 10s. Overall cheap quality.I decided to try a Samsung phone after years of Motorolas. Worst mistake ever. My old 2021 Motorola Stylus was better than this. The most important features for me are a definite downgrade with this. The cameras and wifi connection are a joke. Samsung added a bunch of useless features at the cost of a quality phone. It's bloated but none of that counts when you need it. Battery life is not great either. It seems like Samsung locks out features because it's midrange and not because the phone would be capable. Do yourself a favor and look at another phone. I recommend Motorola.
"This phone typically worked fine on 5G, but it couldn't hold a conversation or play a song over the broadband when connected to LTE in the semi-rural settings around my house and work location."
"I purchased this phone because I needed to replace my damaged Motorola phone. My previous Samsung phone screens never cracked even though I dropped it daily so I appreciate that Samsung uses Gorilla glass with their phones. The A25 worked fine for almost 2 weeks, then I started having Internet connection issues. Unless I used WiFi, it would constantly disconnect from my TMobile service. I was unable to make or receive phone calls, texts or notifications while at work or traveling. I changed SIM cards, restarted my cell phone numerous times but that didn't solve the connectivity issues. I wish I had looked at more reviews before wasting my money on this phone. I want to purchase another Samsung phone but I don't have $500 to $1000 to buy their newest phones. Buyers Beware the A25 is an overpriced paper weight!"
"How ironic that it stopped working literally the day after I couldnt return it. I can't make calls or receive calls, most of the time. I'm talking even on a Wi-Fi network and 9 times out of 10 it's not working.  Text messages aren't being received or sent. I wouldn't buy from them. Next phone I get will be coming straight from Samsung themselves. Not really sure what to do until then. Guess, pray no one needs to get a hold of me that bad. Oh, wait that already happened!! My doctor couldn't get through to me because of my phone so proceeded to call my boyfriend and mother multiple times because she had my cancer screening results (it's all benign). And because she couldn't get through to me and I to her, it was a scary time."
"This phone was great while it lasted the screen went blank for no apparent reason. Unfortunately the return window is over it lasted about two months .I called Samsung and asked about warranty they said you have to send it in for repairs and pay shipping and whatever the cost to repair the phone what a joke would not buy another Samsung phone. they're great phones when they work,this phone lasted about 2 months."
Have owned several Samsung's but this one is very slow and I find myself having to reset it several times a week because it will lag or totally freeze up.
"I really liked this phone for the first month. Then the motherboard went bad and it just didn't work at all. After dealing with my service company (who made certain it wasn't their SIM card), I sent the phone back to Samsung. That was 4 weeks ago. They received the phone, decided it needed a new motherboard, then said it would take a week to get the part. Then they wrote to say, no part, can't fix it, we'll send you your phone back. (WHAT?). Then, they just said, well, sorry, we'll give you a refund. Nothing. I contacted them today and my refund is in some sort of limbo. They are NOT FIXING FAULTY PHONES! DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!"
"Phone has difficulties connecting and keeping connection to cellular, like many other reviews.  Samsung Repair center in Texas indicate that there are no parts available for the repair.  This suggests wide problem with this model with more than normal failure rate.  The battery got very hot once for no reason.  Skip this lemon and go with another.  My phone was sold by Amazon, Samsung is suppose to be refunding the phone, but it'll take 7 to 10 business day for the first step, and who know how many days for the check to be send.  Sorry Samsung.  lost a customer."
The description say unlocked and it was not. I have returned and still waiting on my refund.
"I've had this phone for 6 months. The last 2 months the phone keeps losing the network connection.""you are not on a network"" emergency calls only. Sumsang had me go to a repair shop, who told me that the phone is unrepairable. THE MOTHERBOARD IS SHOT! Now I need to send it back to Sansung to see if they can fix it... It is still under warranty. It's my first Samsung and mostly likely my last..."
"After calls to my carrier, I was assured that this phone would be acceptable. It wasn't. And because they had tried numerous ways to get it to work, the Customer Service Reps at my carriers store they said it wouldn't be returnable. So, rather than going through the hassle of returning the phone, I traded it in for 1/3rd of what I paid for it! VERY DISAPPOINTING! I strongly recommend that you call your carrier 1st and be very specific about the phone you are buying before making the purchase!  :("
"Only a few days of use and it repeatedly shuts down. This was the more expensive version of this phone, with a supposedly better processor. Yeah. Behaves like a broken down 5yo phone. Returned it promptly. Motorola makes bad phones, now Samsung. Where else to look? Expensive $1000 phones. Got it phone manufacturers. We hear you. We must starve for a month to be able to afford a working phone. Got it."
"It consistently says I'm not on a network and when I check,  it is smh. I get no calls, no texts, no internet,  no connection! The absolute worst phone in history. My Nord Plus runs circles around this phone, even with a cracked screen. Hundreds of dollars for complete GARBAGE!!! If I could give no stars, I would smh..."
"I purchase this phone and start having issues with (making and receiving phones, sending texts, zoom calls and checking voicemails) and took it to my local T-Mobile store and they said their are a known issues with this phone that are not comparable to United States  and can't be fixed and Amazon is aware of it and they shouldn't be selling these phone.Buyer BEWARE, if your purchase SAMSUNG Galaxy A25 5G A Series Cell Phone!"
I bought this phone mid-april.. yesterday it stopped charging and now emits a burning smell when you attempt to charge it. Would NOT recommend unless you've got cash to burn and enjoy the smell of burning electronics.
"This phone is not very quick response phone first, second  this phone  doesn't come with charge cable"
"Loved this phone for the first week.  I love that it still has a headphone jack too.  After the first week, it would start randomly powering off.  It stated dropping calls, then wouldn't connect to network at all.  I went to T-Mobile to get a new Sim card.  It worked for about 12 hours than started again.  I'm disappointed, I really liked everything else about this phone too"
This phone was amazing for ABOUT A DAY! After the first day the phone kept losing my network connection EVERY 10-15 minutes. I factory reset it 6 times DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!!! I replaced the SIM card went into my carrier store everything on their end was good. A real piece of trash! The Revvl6 5g I had provided a MUCH MORE STABLE NETWORK CONNECTION! (and that phone is a HUGE downgrade...) GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER SAMSUNG!!!!! This phone is WAAAY TOO OVERPRICED TO HAVE THIS GLARING OF AN ISSUE!!!
"This phone worked for 4 months and then started disconnecting and staying off the network. Now I have to save the money for a new phone while this junk actively deteriorates my quality of life. I want half my money back for ruining my day, every day."
"Only can get a network 20% of the time. Called my carrier, they said they did all they can do. Called Samsung they said as long as it picks up sometimes, it's not the phone. So basically I have a phone that will work occasionally. My wife has the same carrier and her phone works fine!"
Phone hasn't worked properly from the start. Rest the phone it worked for a day or two. Factory rest and it worked for a few days. T-Mobile replaced the sun and doesn't work properly. It won't take calls and goes straight to VM. Calls drop repeatedly and sound goes in and out.
"Constantly cuts out, and loses connectivity."
"This brick may as well be a Nokia. The slowest load times. Even with all other apps closed, this thing need a hand crossing the street.Avoid. Period."
"I, too, was bested by Samsung and a victim of the phone shutting off/no connectivity issue. It also conveniently happened after the return cut off date. I don't have the money to replace it. I'm stuck with a broken phone for the next 6-8 month. Everyone who bought this phone deserves an automatic refund."
"I had issues with this phone from the beginning. I talked to Samsung support, could not fix problem,took it to my cell phone provider, they could not fix problem.  Issued was intermittent - sometime it would work sometime not.  Problem went on until pass the 30 day return so now I have a new phone that is worthless, it doesn't work and apparently can't be fixed."
"The phone worked fine for the first few, weeks, and now it limps from wifi network to wifi network, it can't navigate on trips thanks to constant drops in connection in fairly urban areas.Everything else about the phone seems to work fine, but that doesn't matter if it can't stay connected to the internet."
The phone I received is useless unless it's connected to Wi-Fi.  It cannot maintain any data connection. Which means no internet and no phone calls.  I tried Samsung support.  Resetting my phone every 5 to 10 minutes would keep it running for a while. Then that didn't even work.The return process sucks. You have to be home to hand the box to UPS. Which means taking time off work.Do not buy this phone!!!
"After 4 months, It has no signal and internet doesn't work. Don't put yourself in treble. I called the samsumg costumer service and they said you can buy the new version of a35!!I will never buy a samsung phone anymore."
"Half the time my phone does not ring and sends my callers to voicemail, and then when I can pick up the caller can't hear me talking!  Didn't last more than a week!  Lemon or bad phone?"
misses calls sends them strait to voice mail stopped reading memory card after 2 months  loses signal always restarting for updates wait hours to get a text
Who knew? Bought this new iteration Galaxy A25. Fought it for some weeks trying to get it to work. No go. ???? Finally found out not supported by AT&T Network. Wouldn't work. Even though past return date. Amazon hearing my story of woe agreed to let me return it for full credit. Thank you Amazon!
Just spent 27.00  to hook up this phone but was not able to because it was not unlocked but was charged anyway. This is the 3rd Samsung phone I have purchased on Amazon since January. The first 2 were broken.
"Worked great for about four months, but now it overheats and shuts down frequently. My previous phone never had this issue and was in use for over six years (and still works)."
"Audio problems, sin card problems,  internet connection back & forthI'm sending to samsung serviceNever again I'll buy cell phone in amazon 😡"
"Buyer, read negative reviews.  Phone disconnect itself from the internet and mobile red, I wasn't  able to make a  call during an emergency. I don't have money to buy a new phone, now I have to use my old phone."
Recurrent connection problems after the 30 day and can no longer refound the item. If not for that. Would be perfect phone
"I used mint as my network line,but this phone doesn't seem to support it.so am out of network all the time. From the description it says it's unlocked so I wonder why I should verify every time"
You can't get rid of Samsung internet with this phone and you are continually over run with adds. You have to pay to stop all the junk mail.  Buyer beware.
"Bad phone... not registered to the network. Tried everything, nothing."
Phone loses carrier signal.  Unable to make calls or text intermittently for no reason. Tried all resets and fixes.  DONT BUY THIS PHONE.
This phone was great for a few months then it suddenly stops working SAVE YOURSELF Some Time And Look For Another Phone
Died after 30 days for no reason.  Can't return it.  It's horrible.
This phone freezes up on a regular basis and has to restarted in order to continue using. Worthless.
The screen went blank as a call was coming thru. I had it just 30 days now I'm out 330
"Turn it off by itself, internet doesn’t work outside"
item incomplet
It was working fine and then just one day it died.. lasted 4 months total
Not a good phone.Battery heats up unnecessarily and phone restarts without any reason
having a lot of trouble with dropped calls
Phone did not work properly ended having to by another phone $300 down the drain
Phone got very hot and died. Thats it.Bad battery from factory
Doesn't work with Xfinity
False advertising.  Phone doesn't work with US Cellular.
"When i get phone calls they can't hear me on the calls but i can hear them,,the phone battery drains if you use to much screen time..The fingerprint scanner could use someImprovement,"
Had to go to a Prepay service.  But i am saving $30  a month.  So far so good.
"I bought two Galaxy A25 5G phones directly from Samsung. After two weeks, one of the phones shutdown repeatedly over a period of a few hours (it was fully charged). Subsequently, the phone couldn't reliably make wireless network connections, and almost never with 5G. I had trouble making and receiving calls and could rarely complete a conversation even when I could initially make the connection. Ditto for internet service.I called Samsung support to report the issue and asked them for a new phone. They put me through a host of steps to try to resolve the problem. These were pointless wastes of time, because the phone obviously had a hardware issue. They told me that they couldn't give me a new phone unless they could verify the issue themselves, but I first had to take the phone to one of their third party authorized service/repair centers. The closest one was 30 minutes from my house. I went there and after several hours, they told me that they couldn't find anything wrong with the phone. On the way home, the phone was unable to complete a call.I called Samsung service again and they told me that I needed to send the phone to them. I feel that given that the phone was only three weeks old, they should have sent me a new phone immediately, but whatever. When they evaluated the phone they told me that they needed to replace an out-of-stock part on the phone and that it could take them up to seven days to get the part. Two days later I got a note from them saying that the phone could not be repaired and that they were out of stock on the phone. They asked me to call them to arrange a refund. I called and they told me that they would refund the price of the phone. I told them that I expected them to refund the price of the phone as well as the sales tax. Even though I bought the phone directly from Samsung, they made me send an image of my receipt to them to prove that I had paid the sales tax. Ridiculous.So, that was one of the two phones that I bought. I replaced it with a Motorola phone which my wife is now using. One month later, I am still using the other A25. Guess what happened yesterday? The phone died seven times. And again this morning. Needless to say, I'll be on the phone with Samsung today and I'm sure that I'll have to go through the same inane process again.The net result of this nonsense for me is a simple conclusion: I will NEVER again buy ANY Samsung product. Between the poor quality of the product and the horrific support experience, I would feel like a fool to ever again purchase anything from Samsung."
"Phone always over heats. drop calls ,won't receive text tell hours later. People say I sound like I'm under water when their talking to me.  Worst phone ever !!!!!!!"
Never has any service. Carrier says to ship it to Samsung for warranty…. Avoid this phone
"LITERALLY THE WORST PHONE I'VE EVER OWNED.  It thinks the USB port in wet, but it's not and it never charges. It's possible to fix it, apparently it has been a problem with samsung for 8+ years AND THERE IS NO FIX. SAMSUNG HAS NO SUPPORT"
"This was my 2x trying Amazon Renewed. This time I purchased the LAST stated available 2023 described as ""In OEM box, Box shows wear from opening"". The Moto Razor Flip phone was described as ""Like new"". Immediately upon arrival w/o even opening the box I knew it was wrong as the package was far too light. I opened it & there was a Moto Razor w/obvious discoloration on the case from use + a CHIP in the bottom screen. Packaging was similar to a top end Samsung I ordered from Amazon Renewed & fulfilled by a 3rd Party in FL 2 years ago. I saved due to credit only $20 @ checkout over a NEW One.  WORSE there's NO WAY to return this immediately (There' are 2 Amazon Return 2 locations within 2-5 minutes of my house. Just came back from one & CS stated ""I've never seen this"")). Instead Amazon MAY notify me when they'll ONLY pickup from my house in 3 days.I had this EXACT same problem with a $700+ Laptop that was supposed to be Brand New. I'm beyond a coder or tech guy & ran a battery cycle count software on that as the battery lasted 2 hours less than advertised. It was obviously a RETURN, re-sold as NEW, unless Compaq sells Laptops w/over 200 battery cycles already on them. Same thing w/2 PB's & a CH Android Tablet which still had the previous User's name & account information installed. Seriously, WHO is doing QC? I'll NEVER use Renewed again. Period. Even when you buy a NEW item it's 50/50 now you'll get someone else's return sold as New! eBay here I come again. Worst thing this was supposed to be a gift. OBVIOUS Screen CHIP really ticks me off. Since 2022 I'm now 2 for 8+ on purchases of tech devices.  Buy with caution!"
"I've waited for years for the right moment that foldable are common enough to a tad cheaper than $1,200. Even at $700, it's still not really worth it. The Mediatek chip in the standard, non plus model is slow as crap. It lags, and hangs on even the simplist tasks, like using the camera. My cpu is spiked at 100% most of the time, even if it's JUST YouTube or Instagram being used. The build quality is decent, and screens look good, but the viewing angles in bright sunlight are terrible. The battery life, kinda mid. Sometimes I'll get home from work and have 55%, and sometimes 25%, it's really irregular. The device also gets concerningly warm while on a wireless charger for too. The case selection is also terrible, and no rugged or tough cases are available. Yet otterbox makes them for the Z Flip.  I seriously wouldn't buy another foldable unless it's shockingly better than this. This was a humongous waste of money. And, to add insult to injury, Motorola dropped the price to 499 literally 2 days after I paid $700. 3/5, not terrible but not great. They should've at least put a snapdragon 600 series in here."
"I am a very average smartphone user and just can't justify spending the $1k or more that most phone manufacturers want to charge for their flagship phones. I just need a phone with a good camera, decent storage and enough oopmh to be able to quickly browse apps and social media. I don't do gaming or use a lot of the bells and whistles most phones come with. I was intrigued by the flip form factor and old enough to remember how much I loved my pride and joy, a Motorola razr phone circa 2007. I thought I would try a Motorola again since I haven't had one since that original razr. I found myself irritated almost on a daily basis with my Pixel phone not fitting into my pants pockets, so this return to the compact flip phone has been an absolute pleasure. I find that I don't lose my phone anymore because I'm not constantly setting it down in random spots, it's always in my pocket.The phone is zippy enough to load webpages and photos quickly when browsing. The user interface is really similar to my Pixel, which I loved. It's uncluttered, simple to use and intuitive (unlike my husband's Samsung which I hate using). I truthfully haven't used half the bells and whistles I'm sure this phone comes with, but that's one of the reasons I didn't buy a super high end phone in the first place.I have dropped it a couple times in the open and closed position with no issues, even though I don't have a case on it. The texture on the back of the phone makes it really nice to handle and keep hold of, as it's not slippery like most phones. I went into a store and test drove the Samsung Flip 5 phone and hated the feel of the crease in the screen. On the razr the crease is honestly so incredibly minimal you immediately forget it's there. I was worried switching to a flip phone that the crease would drive me nuts while scrolling but it's been a complete non issue. Battery life is pretty good so far. I can make it through the day without a recharge unless it's one of those days where I'm doing a ton of browsing. I basically don't use the tiny outer screen for anything except checking the time, but I knew going in that I wasn't the kind of person who enjoys using a tiny screen, which is why I didn't spend the extra on the razr plus. One annoying thing if you happen to have a Tesla, this will not charge properly on the Tesla's wireless charge pad because the charging spot inside the phone is too low to align with the charging spot on the pad of the car. I've worked around it by putting a little wedge on the pad to boost the phone up to the right spot, but it's annoying for sure. It charges fine on a normal wireless pad, although a bit slowly. It charges very quickly if plugged into a charger. Overall a really solid user experience, except for...The camera. Ugh. I'm not savvy enough to know if this is a hardware or software issue with Motorola's but the delay time from when you press the capture button to when the picture is captured is excruciating. For someone who is often taking pictures of little kids and animals who never hold still, that means I basically never get the shot I wanted. It's honestly so painful that it may be a deal breaker for this phone. I switched to this phone from a FIVE YEAR OLD Pixel phone and the razr camera is SO much worse. Shots are often blurry and it struggles so hard in lower light conditions. I have had this phone for almost a month now and I am already keeping an eye on new flip phones coming out because I can't wait to upgrade to one that has a decent camera. I will likely hold onto this one just long enough to find something with a better camera but I am truly disappointed because I feel like this phone had it almost perfect for an average user like me who is interested in getting into a flip smartphone without shelling out the big bucks."
"I loved my 2023 Razr so much that I decided to buy a new 2024 Orange Razr with the bigger battery and gave my 2023 Razr to my wife, I received my new 2024 Razr in perfect condition and delivery was quick and no complaints in that respest.  But i started to experience headaches and blurred vision and eye fatigue as soon a starting using this new phone, I read later on, on some online reviews that motorola increase the brightness on there 2024 Rasr to help with outdoors viewing, but they didn't provide any option to adjust in back to the 2023 model settings for people that would just prefer that option , there are no option to adjust the Contrast and Sharpness for example, yes there is brighness adjustment in the Display settings and on the widget ,but the brighness jump in increament of - + 10%  and trying to get a perfect brighness setting is difficult and for that reason I'm only giving the 2024 Rasz 3 stars"
"Bought the phone mostly because of the screen and the form factor at this price point. Purchased in orange. Feels really good and looks even cooler.Overall a good experience. Phone flips open very easily one handed but doesn’t feel flimsy. Very snappy during day to day  and all of my apps work on the outside screen, including apps that I couldn’t get to work on the z flip 5. Battery is darn good, but testing still in progress. The crease is almost non existent when in useNow my nitpicks.- Was promised a very bright screen (3000 nits at certain times I believe)…my iPhone 13 is brighter , so not sure what’s going on there- given the flip action you’ll be using your thumb to slide the phone open for daily use, prepare for the fingerprints. Not sure how good the oleophobic coating is, but in direct sunlight I’m just staring at a greasy plastic screen with unreadable text.- games that fly on my iPhone 13, barely run on this thing. Not sure if it’s a mediatek chip or an app issue.- mediocre photo quality during the day,, but absolutely terrible during the night.- video quality is not a term I would use as there is no quality, it stutters, hiccups, artifacts, blown out colors. Definitely not the phone for video.- not sure if this phone will ever get updates, given Motos track record.Overall a good phone. Maybe at 599 this would be a must have, but for this price, I might just spend the extra 100 for a galaxy s24 and get an amazing camera, a bunch of artificial intelligence and a way brighter screen …but that’s just me. If you absolutely need a flip phone at a decent price and decent performance while not taking any video or pictures in non ideal conditions i would buy this."
"I'll preface this by saying it's a fine enough phone. There's nothing technically wrong with it, the display is clear and crisp, the speakers are surprisingly competent, and the overall build is far sturdier than I expected. This is my first foldable phone, and there was about a week where I was just impressed with it, especially since I'd never seen one in person. Now to the frustrating things: The battery life is just awful, maybe I just got a dud, but it drains in just a couple hours. And not while doing anything intense, most of the time it's just sitting there closed. The worst power intensive thing I do is watch youtube, and that drains the battery in what feels like minutes. The power and volume buttons are also frustrating. I feel like it would have been a better decision to put them on opposite sides of the phone, that way you don't accidentally turn it off when you're just trying to adjust the volume. They're also ridiculously sensitive, I barely have to scrape past them and they'll go off. I also am not a fan of how tall the screen is, it's next to impossible to reach the entire screen with one hand, not to mention that it feels misaligned. I press on one part of the screen, and it actually clicks on something a few millimeters down. That sounds small, but it's a huge feel difference. I never feel quite in control of what I'm doing. Overall, it's a pretty decent phone, and I'm glad to have tried a folding screen, but I'm probably going to move back into a phone that isn't quite so frustrating for me."
"I have been an iphone user for the past 4 years and decided i wanted to try an android phone.  The fold phones were interesting so when Motorola was offering this phone under $400 i thought i would give it a try.  I realized that the biggest problem switching from an iphone was losing the rewards in various reward programs since i used the iphone option in creating accounts vs email address.Regarding the phone, the battery life does not last 8 hours.  I took the fully charged phone at around 8 am and it was dead around 3 pm.  i played PokemonGo for most of the time which drained the battery.  The good news is that this phone charges fast compared to my iphone.  The screen is taller and the crease doesnt really bother me.Another bad thing is that after 7 weeks there is a black round dot where the crease is.  It looks like a pixel went dead.  I have not dropped this yet so I guess the display is fragile."
"I purchased this phone on Black Friday because it was a GREAT deal.  My carrier is Xfinity Mobile (which uses the Verizon network).  They sell a Razr 2024 for use on their network, so I assumed this phone would be compatible.  Sadly, based on the IMEI, Xfinity Mobile says it is not compatible.  They could not really explain why, it's just not compatible.  I'm returning it, and will have to pay an extra $150 to get the same phone from Xfinity."
"An amazing phone, I love not having a long slab phone in my pocket. The phone is perfect in the hand, it is great to prop up and watch on a tabletop. Very responsive and the hinge is holding up well for the time that I have been using it with no cracking of the screen.The only major problem is that the screen suddenly stopped responding with a white bar on the right side and bottom of the screen. It was working fine at night then I folded it and set it on my nightstand, next day not working properly. This is a nuisance, but the final problem is that I cannot request a repair because the Motorola service website keeps throwing an error when I select the phone. Sucks, I miss the phone."
I liked the phone. The issues I had were my bluetooth ear piece kept getting unpaired. I actually returned the ear piece to Best Buy thinking it was defective. Nope. A bug in the Razr? My 1Password would work sometimes and sometimes it was very slow. So even though I liked the phone those were 2 things I couldn't work around
I've had this phone 6 months I love it but stopped working for two days I have not been able to use my phone the screen is not working or allowing to do anything I was told to replace the part is $340!
"Love the nostalgia. I was excited to give it to my wife. However, she found it very heavy to open the door and flip open. Additionally, she also found it quite irritating when trying to open the door and perform a function. The unit tends to overheat, particularly around the camera area. On the positive side, it is definitely fast. The refresh rate is amazing, and the processing speed is impressive. However, there is a noticeable bulge that almost looks like a wave, and it has only been used a couple of times. Somehow, we are unable to send a text using the digital SIM, but we're still trying to figure that out. Overall, her switch from a Xiaomi to this hasn't been exciting, which is surprising. So, while it was a great idea, I don't think she's going to keep it long term. And this is only our third day. So, what can I say? It's not for everyone."
I have had this phone since July and it will overheat. I have to turn it off or cool it down somehow. This is concerning!
"It pains me to write this review because I absolutely adore this phone.I bought this in mid-April 2024 and as of the end of August 2024 the screen is completely unresponsive to any touch. It didn't just lose pixels or become finicky around the crease--I can't get it to respond to any touch on any part of it. I can hold the power key until it reboots, but I have no way to turn it off completely, or try factory resetting it since those options require you to touch the screen. There's no reset pinhole.Touchscreen phones are great until you can't use them even for emergency purposes.This is frustrating and heartbreaking though, because this is such a fantastic form factor! I LOVE how tiny it is when folded. I love the small screen on front--just enough to glance at when needed but not so big that it's constantly crying for my attention, getting scratched, at risk of getting broken, etc.I love the unobtrusive design, so refreshing in comparison to the bigger, heavier, and increasingly more expensive phones out there.The speed and responsiveness of the OS was great when it was working, and the external color and texture are fantastic! I rarely talk on the phone so I can't say much about that, but obviously none of this matters since I can't use the thing anymore.It is a great price, and theoretically I could just buy another one. But if that one also only last about 4 months, I'm effectively paying $100 a month to use a phone. And that makes it just as expensive as the more popular ones out there.Personally I'm not willing to pay more for a phone than I do for a laptop, so I've reverted back to my old Samsung Note 8."
This is day 2 with my new phone and while scrolling through Facebook a black box scrolled along the page. This just happened 2 times. This makes me nervous. It is gone now... I will come back in a month with an update unless something bad happens sooner. 😐
Advertised for 2023 razr is actually for 2024 and is a little loose
"It's a nice phone but it isn't compatible with my old razr aux adapter and it didn't come with one. It also didn't come with the base for the charger, just a c-type to c-type connector. Luckily I have a base that works. If it didn't come with these things it would have been nice to know in the description. Not sure how to connect aux now."
I was excited to get the phone ...I received it yesterday and it didn't come with the piece to plug in just the wire and I notice the phone gets hot quick so am disappointed 😥
The phone was great just died after one week. No hard reset would work. One minute it was working then it wasn't
I thought I found my dream phone and I never really had any problems the problem I've occurred with the razor even though it has a lot of gigabytes and all that stuff must the apps that I have to use when on fine and Etc after I started using the phone half the apps won't work I downloaded the updates I did all the updates and having my apps still is not working properly and this is a brand new phone otherwise if everything worked I would be keeping it but no return
"see title.that seems to be a common problem. extremely cool and compact phone,  dont expect it to last years."
I bought two 2023 razers and the first one would not let me send pictures and would echo when on speaker phone. The second one had a dead pixel and there was a green dot on my screen. I let it go be cause the phone worked and a dot would not bother me. Now the fold crease has a black line going through it. I guess we get what pay for. I paid 334 and it was a really good phone. Oled smooth video fast processor. I bought the 2024 and I'm hoping they ironed out the kinks. I bought used again.
"Battery is charging slowly and dying quickly. I had a phone exactly like this, different color with the same apps on it and that one charges quickly and battery lasts just fine. Hoping it fixes itself soon but if not I will sadly have to return.Update: Seems the issue has been fixed. Honestly it wouldn't even power on for a bit after reviewing it. Might've needed to adjust to everything but never had a phone do that before."
"This phone is super cool! It flips, it sits up it has these super cute displays that people can see. I love wearing mine like a cross body purse as an accessory:).  There is one major downfall .  I may not have gotten this phone if I knew that it would form a crease in the middle.  I mean like a bubble crease.  It leaves a line across my photos ( not the actual photo . that's just what you see) but it's annoying.  Or MB my OCD is just really bad;)  I love the phone but I hate that bubble crease .< Btw, the bubble crease happened just one month after buying.  Great phone  if you don't mind that"
"The top of screen is dark,it was good then I had it charging, opened it up to use it, and the top of the screen was dark. Sent it back yesterday with the label that I had printed, gave it to the UPS driver he said he could take it. Now it’s I don’t see anything on it no tracking like it just disappeared. So I tried to get in touch with customer service. See if they could help but I could not get through to customer service and that’s Amazon customer service I’m talking about I tried to use the chat but it just is too difficult for me to use because I’m a senior citizens I guess and I don’t understand all of this computer stuff , I wish they had a part of customer service that would cater to seniors. But they probably don’t care as long as you’re spending money."
"I do not have an opinion yet about the phone itself, but have a suggestion for Motorola.  Please put a notice on the outside of the box the new phones come in, to not try to put an after market screen protector on.  It is in the manual, but it might avoid problems, if it was on a sticker on the outside of the package, since it says inside that doing this could void your warranty.  I am not one who reads the whole manual before I try using the phone and I imagine there might be a lot of people like me, so this would be helpful."
Nice phone. I love the form factor but it overheated like crazy for the 2 days that I tried to use it. Issue with push notifications from Gmail which was odd. But I'll try the 2024 with the Dimensity chip as I seem to have more luck with Mediatek.
"I loved this phone. The design is sleek and I Love the folding aspect of it, it fits right into a shirt pocket. The specs and performance of the phone are great too, it runs fast from browsing to gaming and charges really quickly.That said, my phone is totally useless after only a couple months of use. I noticed today that there was the smallest little bump at the side of my screen where it bends, I was worried there was something under it so i turned my phone to the side and bumped it ever so slightly and the tiniest piece of dust fell out, smaller than this period.I noticed a small black spot on the screen where the bump was but the rest of the screen worked fine. I continued using my phone normally over the next hour.Suddenly one of the times I opened the phone up it formed a black bar directly across the middle of the screen and now only the bottom half of the screen works at all.Needless to say, the phone is now useless, and would be Very costly to fix. I have to buy a new phone and it definitely won't be this one again."
Had this phone for two weeks it works fine it's just not as smooth as iPhone tbh. Google assistant always turns on when the aux is plugged in so can't listen to music in peace. And flipping it is kinda tedious
"The phone was great while it lasted, but 2 months after purchasing it, a minor mishap cracked the screen (our Galaxy phones have been through worse, dozens of times, and always come out unscathed). The damage is beyond cosmetic: the touch screen is non-responsive. Now, I didn't buy the Protection Plan coverage, and that's on me. But I can't get this fixed out of pocket, either! Local cell phone repair shops told me they can't get replacement parts for the Razr. Motorola won't sell the parts to them. They said they can only get replacement screens for the Razr Plus, not the regular Razr, and even if the one I had was a Razr Plus, the part alone is so expensive that the repair guy recommends just buying a new phone instead."
"I suspect I got a lemon because other reviews don't describe my experience at all. The phone is slow, sometimes when I open it and try to use a messaging app the keyboard won't pop up, and occasionally my data just drops out. I am currently typing this review on a spare phone because I am having so many problems just with wifi. Really disappointed and frustrated with the phone."
Motorola Razr 2023 was great until one day (4 months after purchase) the screen stopped working :-(
I have used Motorola phones for over 15 years and loved them.  This one I loved for 3 months then the screen quit working. I had to go back to a previous phone and could not use the razr anymore.  I talked to motorola tech support about this and they said they would call me back the following day.  I finally called them after 2 days with no call.  I got to the point of them sending a replacement.  I gave my address and they were asking about shipping options and they hung up on me.  I repeated this and was hung up on again at the same point.  I have read other reviews of this phone and they are similar stories.  They know there is a problem with them and are trying to avoid it.  After so many years as a loyal customer I will now have to buy a different brand of phone.  And apparently have to eat the cost of this phone after only 3 months of use.  JUNK!!!!!!!
"If this is your first flip, you want something brand new and you're on a budget, go for it. It's a solid entry flip device, and I'd be happy with it if it was my first entry.If you have a flip phone already, I'd pass on this one here's why:- Feels slower than my ZFlip 3 5G (2021)- Camera exposure is abysmal- No good cases on market- Hinge feels way to stiff and crunchyThe only real benefit I saw was the fact that the screen was nearly perfectly flat when fully open, which isn't worth an upgrade for me either. Overall it's an average budget android that has no snap. Not nearly enough power to run a 144hz display effectively in my opinion."
"Loved the phone until it failed. It was working, then unresponsive when I opened it a few minutes later. Did a restart, did a factory reset, screen does not respond to touch. Six months."
Phone does not last.  it was never dropped or mistreated but I started having screen issues after 7 months.  Motorola wanted almost 380.00 to fix it.  A new phone is only 450.00.  Love the form factor but it is simply to fragile and I cannot afford a new phone every 7 months.  I should also note that this phone was never dropped or mistreated and was only opened when necessary.PROs:Form factor - flip phone fits in front pocketgood memory and processorvery thin for even when closedCons:Front screen too small to be usefulsmall black spot on side of screen near hinge.does NOT last - screen issues started after 7 months and not worth fixing.
"shuts down even when it's on 24%. Only turns on when it's plugged up. I bought the product twice because i thought it was a one time occurrence and the second  one has the same issues. I called Motorola  and the only option they gave me was a refund that was the  1st round, 2nd round  I just went and decided to go ahead and place another order on the  same thing since i like the design and features (also hoping its just a one off experience) i opened the box had it on for a while thinking everything was fine and it powered off at 24%.I'm not sure if it's transit problem or the product itself, but it's insane that it happened twice. Now here I am stressed and without a phone for work.Aug.12:Fixed it. (Thanks YouTube)Decided to try to fix the problem since I had to wait for a postal carrier to pick it up. Seen a couple YouTube vids and save you the trouble of research I had to let it die then charge it multiple rounds till it finally hit 100% and let it drain naturally. You'll  have to restart the whole process over if it dies again with no warning. Its a hassle but it works and haven't faced anymore problems after.I would give it 5 stars if I didn't"
"As other reviews have stated, this is a really good phone until it isn't. Bought it for my aging Mother for it's small folded size (why are women's pockets so tiny?) and she loved it. The phone is fast enough, very little bloatware, decent screen, good battery, wireless charging, etc; workED very well.Not 8 months later, the screen decided to leave the chat. The middle area around the fold stopped responding and soon after, began registering constant ghost taps. The problem continued after factory reset, so it isn't software related. I can't even set it up after the reset now. It's a very high tech brick."
"I actually liked the phone itself. However, I had to call Motorola for customer service.  After two weeks of waiting on hold and having my calls dropped I returned the phone.  This is the first time I have ever returned a product due to poor customer service."
"Phones have been mostly the same for a while now, so when needing a new phone I figured I'd take a chance and try something with a fun gimmick.Mistake. Not because of the flip part--that was actually useful and I miss it, even if it didn't have the ease of flip of the original flip phones and required both hands to flip open.No, because whatever programming Motorola does for their software on their phones, it's trash. I outright stopped using the camera because for some reason pictures now suddenly took FOREVER to take, no matter the settings or lighting conditions. It was constantly turning on nonsense gesture settings I didn't want and kept having to manually disable. And they were so concerned about screen space the screen goes over the flip part, but can't seem to communicate properly with apps the dimensions of the screen so it was constantly cutting off parts of videos. The only thing I miss about it is the flip capability--if Google made a flip in addition to a fold, I would have that instead right now, but I'm NEVER going motorola again.Oh, and the deciding factor for me trading this in for a Google Pixel? The screen randomly developed a green line one day, which is apparently a known issue with Motorola phones they've not bothered to fix and has no solution."
"My first experience with a foldable phone was quite disappointing. I was initially impressed by its design and features, but things took a turn when I tried to transfer my data from my iPhone 13 Pro to the Motorola Razr 2023. I connected the two devices via cable for the transfer, and suddenly the screen went black. I thought it was a device reset for a complete transfer, but all the information didn't go through. As a result, I had to turned it back on and manually set up everything on the new phone.Things didn’t improve when I contacted my carriers, AT&T and T-Mobile, to activate the service. They informed me that the device was locked to an unknown carrier and couldn’t assist me. Neither the physical SIM nor the eSIM worked, which added to my frustration. Overall, it was a really disappointing experience"
I was excited to try a different kind of phone that was a smart phone that folded.  The phone worked without issue for a couple of months and then out of no where from just normal use a long white line appeared down the center of the screen.  I attempted to send it in and was turned down because of a small crack on the back of the phone (Which i could live with and caused no issue to the front normal use).  They said i needed to pay $375 to fix the entire phone!  I payed $325 for this.  Unbelievable.  Do not recommend this model of phone or company to anyone.
"I generally love what Motorola does. I knew this foldable phone would eventually break, I figured after a year or so of abuse at the hands of this IT guy. Unfortunately, it only lasted 4 days, and it was not a drop, or liquid, or even my wife's reckless throwing of items, it was a lint free cloth that killed it. I was wiping down the screen at the end of the day before I put it on charge that I heard a pop and a pink line appeared vertically on the screen, just left of the camera all the way down. Amazon took amazing care of me though and I purchased the plus model. so far it has made it through the days since. I think this was a fluke, so don't let it deter you if you are looking to try a foldable phone, these are great: but just be super careful."
"i purchased the phone new in July 2024, initially i loved this phone.  My co-worker told me about the concerns some previous owners had with the crease appearing on  the screen after awhile.  Fast to the beginning if October, out of the blue a thin line appeared on the right side of the phone and then 2 black spots appeared. Well the line and the dots decided to connect and now the phone is useless.  I didn't drop the phone nor was it water damaged, apparently this phone has the glitch that Motorola can't seem to resolve.  I won't be buying a flip phone again because this seems to be the problem with all the flip phones regardless of the brand!  Money wasted!"
"This flip concept is not new, but the first flips were not touchscreen.  You cannot put a screen protector on this Razr flip or it voids the warranty, but this renders the sensitivity of the screen defenseless.  This new Razr malfunctioned 4 wks after receipt.  Sent it to Lenovo/Motorola in Fort Worth, TX for repair under warranty. They repaired and put in a new screen, sent back within 7 days.  Today is 6 months from purchase date and the  upper half of the screen is dead again, the liquid inside the rest of the working screen appears to be slowly leaking.  No more Motorola.  I just ordered a new Google Pixel, which I had before this Razr."
"THIS PHONE IS TRASH. battery is dead halfway through the day and I'm never really on it. The screen just quick working all together had to send it in for repairs and it came back just as bad and guess what that screen is starting to glitch out again. Save your money, shop somewhere else. Oh and the mic is junk no one can ever hear me."
"Overall good phone,only issue is that the screen doesn't last long..6 months in and cracked right down the folding seam.."
"I was looking forward to this phone. One of my coworkers had a similar one for the last couple years. Unfortunately, the battery life was not good enough for the little bit I used the phone daily. The worst thing is that there is no way to contact Amazon and they have not credited back my money. I returned the case at the same time, and I was credited that money a couple weeks ago. The phone was sent back in excellent condition."
Since I've received this phone it's been babied pretty hard only to get a dead zone on the folding screen near the hinge and reboot constantly throughout the day. I wanred to believe and move forward but this has made me not want another foldable. 700 bucks down the drain!!!!UPDATE: a black bar has appeared right along the crease and now has to be sent in for repairs or replacement after only two months. I'm afraid to even get the replacement at this point.
Purchased this over Samsung due to price.  Sadly it would not read my Glucose sensor reliably. Had to go to Samsung.
"After 13 days of use, a dead spot appeared on the screen where it folds. A small black line that quickly expanded. Only a few days later, a bright white line appeared across the left side of the screen, followed by another black dead spot in the bottom left hand corner. I have never dropped the phone, it has remained in a case since the day I received it brand new. Aside from the glaring issues of screen problems, the camera is also extremely slow, taking 3 seconds to actually take a picture. I haven't had it long enough to notice any other big issues, and I'm definitely not going to keep it long enough to find out. Going to return it tomorrow for a different brand of phone, never buying another Motorola. Complete piece of junk. Don't waste your money on this."
"I was very upset, after spending 2 hours with my carrier, transferring my service to this phone, to find out that it was not unlocked. It is set to T-Mobile.  I thought buying a phone from the Motorola store, saying it was unlocked, that there would not be a problem like this.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
There was a defect in the phone. The brightness went up by 1-2 % every time I opened the phone. Even with adaptive brightness off.
I have had this phone for almost one month and the screen protector has lifted where it holds and traps all kinds of dirt in it. When you purchase the phone there are numerous warnings that you are not to remove it! Well I have not and it's almost embarrassing to use in my workplace.The phone and operation itself is really nice although it will run hot. Not sure if that is also a defect. I'm so disappointed.
I purchased my Motorola RAZR 2023 in later January 2024. In approximately 7 months the screen began to have hairline cracks underneath the Motorola screen protector.Calls to Motorola warranty and other representatives of the Company; revealed Motorola refused to repair the screen under warranty. Instead Motorola wanted to charge me over $376.00 for them to repair it.This cost was getting close to the original price of the phone. This was all due to Motorola's equipment being defective.I now have a better understanding as to why Motorola can sell these phones cheaper than their competition.Stay away and buy a different brand of flip phone.
"The top half of the case fits, but the bottom half one side sticks up higher than the rest so the case doesn't fit correctly"
"Cool phone, loved it. For less than a day. Barely used, put right into a case, never left my car or dropped remotely. Inner scren broke, and even started chipping in the corner on its own! WARRANTY UP, tastes like lemon..."
not unlockedThis item is listed as unlocked but it is not. Do not buy it if you are looking for unlocked phone. I bought it for someone that is living overseas. I spent about $314 for this phone and when I received it it was not unlocked. Amazon has not informed the seller to update the listing and it is over a month.
"Had this for all of one month, literally 15 minutes ago my phone decided to break on me and the screen turned black like a liquid was spreading under screen, mind you all I did was sit down and place it on my bed like I always do and it was broken. Total waste of $400 do not buy"
"The warranty expired this month, and out of the sudden my screen has a bright bar across the phone. It seems like the screen is damaged exactly when the warranty expired. The screen also starts to crack after 5 months, even when you are careful. This is a cheap phone and it will stop working. Don't buy it."
"Phone failed after 2 days,  1st, a line appeared between screens and upper screen would not react to scrolling soon I could not make a phone call. Then the lower screen went dark! Already sent it back!"
This is the second phone I got that had issues with dead pixels. It was a fun phone otherwise but they really didn't do well creating a screen that will last. It's been ten days and I woke up with a dead pixel on the fold that radiates a line to the top of the screen. Very disappointing I was excited about this phone and even gave it a second chance after issues with the first one.
"I mostly like it, but outer small screen is so useless I leave it open a lot of the time.  So don’t get the benefit of the folding screen.  I should have just bought the more expensive model.  I also have an issue where it sometimes won’t detect that the screen is open so the screen stays off.  I have to soft reset it to get the screen back.  Have had this happen several times.  Guess I will see how good their support is."
external screen not operable
"I really wanted to like this phone but unfortunately when you live in a rural area like I do, you never really know how they will work out.  Because I never have any issues with my IPhone I called my cell provider about conversations keep cutting in and out & after running some diagnostics, they said the problem was not on their side, so it must be the phone.  I don’t know if the antenna is placed differently than on my iPhone but sadly had to return this phone due to connection issues."
Used this for personal use.There was nothing I liked
"I open my phone yesterday to a black spot covering at least 80% of the screen, can't see to get it open to use.  Useless, not happy at all !!!!"
Do not advertise this product for something it's not. Clearly you can see a black blotch on the screen. What a inconvenience it is for consumers to spend hundreds of dollars on a product that has to be returned upon arrival.
"Nice how it fits in your pocket but this is not ready as a commercial product.Just 1.5 months of normal use and the screen cracked inside. No outside damage, just a black spot that within one day grew to the folding area.On top of poor quality of the flip screen, there is a huge compromise on the camera - very disappointing quality, basically can only take decent photos on bright sunny days."
"Bought a phone, it was a defective piece of junk.Returned the phone.They received it 30 days agoSTILL NO REFUND ISSUED $380!!!!GIVE ME MY MONEY!🖕"
My phone doesn't work with my DexcomG7 glucose monitor
"I bought the phone in July. On December 3 the screen was black. It will not charge, reboot or show any sign of life."
I have never had a phone totally stop working for no reason until I purchased this one.  Will not power up at all and it was not dropped or damaged but just stopped working.  What a pain - luckily I kept my old phone that still works.  Guess I am just out a few hundred dollars!
Phone is very nice but quite on the 30th day. So I can not return it to Amazon ( bummer)  Would like to talk to Dealer for exchange. but do not how to contact seller. Would like to talk to the seller
Worst deal ever I bought it on August 7th and on September 10th the screen went all black I went multiple places to try to replace the screen and it cost $300 to replace replace it I ending buying another phone and Im pay $440 for the phone it's not worth it I ending buying another phone.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Got a white vertical line going down the whole phone. A black film going over the bottom of the phone. I thought it was something in between the screen protector and the glass so I took off the screen protector to see. Well I called Motorola and now since I removed the screen protector and void the warranty nowhere in the box or the when I bought it told me not to remove it or voids the warranty. I've had Motorola phones since it came out love them not anymore we'll never buy another Motorola again.My wife's got the same one her screen cracked in the Middle where it folds so does that tell you something.Now I'm out of 500. Dollars
Don't waste your hard earned money. No different than any other phone.  Eh..
"Product seems nice, but arrived with a crack on the small front screen and zero charge - very different to my typical experience!"
Flaslight did not work returned. Also Amazon hates giving refunds once it's back in their hands!!! STILL WAITING!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Worked for a month on my old SIM card then stopped. Found out It's not able to be activated in my area - Out $500 Dollars because it worked for over 30 days, and it is now outside the 30 days return window. Won't be buying a phone that's not on carrier website or in their store ever again. Had to get another new phone AND had to change my phone number which I had for 2 decades. What a big mess!"
"really bad about this phone won't recognize sim card, not one but three different onesDon't buy"
"I dislike I was sold a product that was supposed to be unlocked and it's not, also my screen already went out and Amazon said oh well, don't buy this product from Amazon"
"Owned the Razor 2020 for over 2 years with no issues. Figured I'd upgrade and the Razer 2023 lasted 3 months before the main screen touch functions stopped working. Have to send in for repair, so we will see how that goes."
The phone powered off during setup and had to be put on the charger to start again. Would read 0% battery life.  I called Amazon to get a replacement and they told me to return it and buy it again when I get the refund. I bought the phone on Prime day for over 50% off so that's not an option.
"I purchased this phone after owning an Apple XS. The Motorola Android 14 operating has a few bugs that are show stoppers. 1st, popup messages appear to be leftover debug remnants that cannot be turned off. These messages are annoying.  Customer Support from Motorola is slow and the support staff is hard to understand. Don't buy - Do not Recommend."
"The ""Vegan Leather"" started to peeled off 6 days after being received.Does anybody has this issue?I kept the phone in the case since the day it was received.I love every bit of the phone but this, makes it hard to enjoy knowing your phone is feeling."
"Less than 3 months and its a brick.I am so tired of having to return items and lately it seems like every two items purchased need a return for repaiThe phone overall is okay, but I would expect do much more. The worst part is the screen, I had to double tap and sometimes three times to get a response, now the screen is doing what is referred to as ghost touches; Where the applications open and close automatically and back and forth without touching the screen."
"My phone would not text in my pick up. I thought my GPS was broke so I’ve got a new GPS which cost me close to $1000 installed in my pick up. After several days many many phone calls to Motorola they finally told me Motorola razz 2023 cannot text over pick up GPS. In order to text in my pick up I have to open my phone and unlock it, I might as well just text and drive. I was told by two different employees of Motorola the Motorola, 2023 does not have the capability to connect and text over your vehicle. Had I known I wouldn’t have been out $500."
"Frequently the Razr phone goes to a black screen, requiring an hour-long reboot process.  Phone does not always ring on incoming calls.  Have to press multiple times to call someone on the occasions that the Razr allows calls out.Battery life good so far; speed and responsiveness less than adequate... pushes on doors marked 'Pull.'"
Most of this has line across the screen after a few months.
A grain of sand or something hard got in the corn in my pocket and damaged screen. Very fragile phone.
dosent seem to be as durable as the Motorola's of old
It was pretty alright for a couple months but now there's a black circle in the middle of the screen that makes it so if I flip the phone it freaks out and I can't touch anything. I should have just bought the galaxy 24 plus
"I have had this phone for only 4 months.  I've only dropped it once while it was closed and that was from the couch to the hardwood floor, not a dent or scratch, but now the bottom half of the screen is black, but oddly the top of the screen won't respond to touch.  I'm not a heavy phone user so for this to have happened after such a short time is ridiculous."
I purchased this phone near the end of February 2024 and now it will not charge. It's been in a case it's entire life. Very well taken care of. I'm not happy. Now I have to purchase a new phone 5 months later.
"It's a shame it's a really nice phone, but has zero durability.  Dropped it once (in a case) and it now is dim with lines across the screen.  Only 2 weeks old.  That's crazy."
"There's something off with this phone. I wanted to like it, but I just couldn't it drove me nuts.  The haptics are not great. Touch didn't work many times, like swiping up to get to my apps. It wouldn't do anything till the third or sometimes fifth swipe. Then the side swipe was terrible. It would accidentally swipe while I'm trying to look at something or zoom in. Sometimes it would just be stuck doing nothing for 30 seconds to a minute...16gh of ram where are you?!  The second big issue was the screen. Definitely not pwm friendly. Also something is just off. It reminds me of looking into a fishbowl. The pixels just don't look great. I've used cheap phones that have better appearance. And the color gamut, not sure if it's just software but they severely undersaturated red. It looks brown/orange in comparison to my other phones. Only on the basic app icons and system view items though. I kept not recognizing certain apps because the color wasn't right. And, it just didn't look nice.  Third the fonts are horrible. The system fonts are so ugly and hard on my eyes. And they make using even the basic apps like Facebook or Gmail unbearable. The way the fonts were utilized and bolded and squared was painful. It looks like a windows 95 font system. I tried all the options, sizes, styles,  and there's no way to download new fonts for this specific phone you're stuck with what's on it.  Fourth. The apps themselves didn't work half the time. Many apps would freeze or not load. Made no sense.  Fifth the camera is decent while using the phones app, but you go into an app and load the camera and it's horrible. Tiktok photo was absolutely terrible, snap was decent, fb not great.  I was having trouble with connection too. It must not support the same bands or something. It was in and out of service and dropping more than my old phone ever did.  I did like the base camera and it's features. It was excellent in detail and color. Problems occured uploading photos to apps though and they were severely distorted. The videos were good, and night photos really nice. The audio quality was pretty decent, but it does have a bit of a ""thingy"" noise. The speakers are loud and clear, but a slightly different octave and reverberation, I rather hook it up to a speaker for anything other than calls because it wasn't a pleasant noise.  Navigating the system on this was a whole new field, not difficult but very different. It does have a lot of similar looks to an iPhone. I didn't hate it when it was actually working fine.  I can't say that this was any faster than another phone I used with less ram, and definitely not when it would hang up. The one decent thing was the battery, it definitely lasted quite a long time, but possibly because I couldn't look at the phone screen very long without a headache or nausea.  The system warning for battery and hotspot were intolerable. It would constantly warn me not to leave hotspot on (which is what I use for everything and leave it on all the time) so that was terrible. The constant reminder of low battery was equally annoying, especially when it was at 20% which usually has several hours. Remind me at 5, fine, but 20? And it's on the screen anyways.  The size of the phone is okay bigger than I'm used to, but not unwieldy. It's a little strange though and looks a bit long and not quite pleasant. The length to width is definitely important and this was a bit off looking.  Overall I don't recommend. I really thought it was going to be great with all the other reviews, but I definitely didn't enjoy this experience. The speed is not there, the screen quality, the app compatibility, the audio, it did not live up to expectations. And for the money it definitely wasn't worth it. It seems like they keep putting all kinds of new great specs, but they all fall short of actualization. My old sony phone would still best these in every category besides ram and charging capabilities. Even my old moto Z4 looks better, and still takes better photos than most of these new phones."
"I was in the market for a new phone and was torn between an S24 Ultra and this. Had Alexa flip a coin for the decision.The OS is not noticably different from my LG G7 ThinQ.The pull down dock app thing is worthless to me and I cannot disable it.The sheer amount of ""extra"" software that comes installed is baffling for especially for an unlocked device.I cannot get apps to auto update and instead get notifications from Google Play and the app that they require updates.Having said all that, I do like the integration of my media apps and frequent OS updates.The ability to limit battery charge to 80% and the phone learning my charging habits. The ability to limit app power usage in both fore and background.The ease of getting it set up with a carrier and importing all my contacts from previous carriers.Now onto my biggest problems with most modern phones.I absolutely loathe the curved edge display, the little hole for my selfie camera, the in-display biometrics, and I still hate not having a headphone jack."
"May/2024Coming from Apple and Samsung I thought I will regret the decision to get this Cellular phone. I was wrong and I will never go back. This is the best phone you can have and you can save some money too. Everything is outstanding on it, Battery life for 2 or more days, then I can connect it to the charger for 20 mins and that's it, I don't have to worry anymore for Battery or charging times, nothing, a tremendous relieve for sure. I consider everything else better than previous phones and a better value than iPhone 14 pro max and Samsung S23 Ultra (My previous) so I can recommend it to anyone without any hesitation.07/13/2024Downgraded to 3 stars cause of Oneplus updates.I used to love my OP12, but after the last update ( June-July/2024) this phone is a mess, extremely buggy, Gmail is frozen every 2 or 3 times I open it, I cannot hang up calls, sometimes the call does not go thru in or out, I have missed several calls from my work team and relatives as well, some apps are not working or stopped working in the middle of something. I had to buy an iPhone 15 in a rush to avoid communication issues both at home and work (Since I'm working remotely). It's been a very bad and sad 2-3 weeks till I decided to switch for good, I cannot wait for a month to the next update to see if everything has been fixed. This is an amazing phone and I loved it, also I have the Oneplus watch 2 and this is a killer combination, I did forget about chargers and charging time with this two and it is a shame that this is happening to this flagship. I think Oneplus must take note on this and never have the same mistake again, this is not a cheaper device either. Disappointed.BTW I was using it on Google Fi (eSim) without issues till the last update.Also, solutions: In crashed apps you have to close and reopen them, most of the time they are working again. No need to clear cache or anything else, at least I do not have to.For calls: Worked for me to change the audio to Speakers during the call and then hang up, be aware that sometimes when you do it the phone app hang up by itself (It is randomly). I never tried the airplane mode, but some people say that is working too for this.For missing calls, I did not find a solution, Google Fi customer service did not know what was causing it."
"I decided I wanted to switch to the OnePlus 12 from the Pixel 7 Pro to see what the hype was all about with OnePlus. I was so excited to get it setup and everything. I got this phone on July 18, 2024. So I have had time to play with it and everything and I want to love this phone, but I am having nothing but issues all over and the camera is very underwhelming. Once I get this phone paid off I plan on selling it and going to the Pixel 9 Pro as I have never had a bad experience with the Pixel series and have been using them since Pixel 5. I love the charging speed of this phone, but the amount of apps like Gmail constantly becoming unresponsive and having to close it and wait a few before opening it again to open any emails is a nightmare for me. I contacted their support about these constant issues but they just wanted me to send the phone wherever they gave me to do so, but I can't go without a phone at all for work and etc. At this price point I would just go with the Pixel 8 or Pixel 9 non-pro versions so you have a long window of Android updates guaranteed. Plus you have a beautiful camera and performance when it comes to their Tensor chips."
"It is an okay phone. My Samsung Note 9 has almost the same specs at nearly a decade old. Lack of headphone jack is a serious issue in nearly all modern flagship phones. Ditto with the inability to use microSD card for expanding the memory.So tired of the disregard for these small but necessary items, especially if I'm dropping that much money for these devices. Also, the ergonomics of the phone are horrendous without a case. The phone is unnecessarily slick, and I dropped my first one trying to put it into a case."
"I loved how the OnePlus 12 looked and felt, but my particular unit had some worrying behaviors that made me lose confidence in it.First was that it ran too warm out of the box even when not doing anything.Second was that the battery charge lost single digits every few minutes as I used it regardless of display brightness level or mobile data mode. That hasn't happened to me before with any other new phone.Third was that even though I set the battery to stop charging at 80%, regardless of it notifying that it stopped, it still kept charging the battery all the way to 100%. If it disregarded the battery's charging limit, what else would it disregard?Fourth was that the camera quality left a lot to be desired in terms of sharpness and detail, especially in RAW format.I have a OnePlus 9 and although the cameras have older sensors that aren't as good as the OnePlus 12's in difficult light situations, the pictures look sharper and more detailed. I mean actual definition, not the appearance of false detail.I decided to return it to Amazon, since the unit is clearly flawed from the factory. That saddened me, because the phone looked so beautiful and upscale,  and felt so nice.Performance-wise, the Snapdragon Gen 3 chipset was amazingly powerful. Almost 5100 on 3DMark Wild Life Extreme was something never seen by me before, and exceeded all leaderboard scores."
"I saw some reviews and did other research,  but wasn't impressed with its battery performance."
"I liked the phone a lot. Battery life was insane too. I tested running a YouTube video for 24 hours and the phone ended at ~15% at the end, and it was running cool not hot.Unfortunately the phone is just legitimately gigantic. I couldn't imagine carrying it around with me day to day. It hardly fit in any pants pockets I wore, and I imagined it trying to fit into shorts pockets... Right now I'm using a Razr Flip 2023 so maybe I'm just spoiled but this phone was too big for me.Camera quality was also great and looked very nice. Sound quality was pretty solid too. The charging wasn't as fast as I expected but the battery is pretty big so that makes sense.Performance seemed pretty solid but I don't mobile game or do anything too intensive on phones honestly.Overall, if this phone was 1 or 2 inches smaller I'd love it, but it's too big to be practical for me. Right where you'd want your hand to rest is where the huge camera notch is too.TDLR: Great phone but too big for me. Amazing battery life, so if you don't mind phone size this is a great phone for you."
I love the phone but for some reason it randomly just decides to tell me I don't have a sim card. And I'll lose the ability to text or call anyone until I get home to pop out the Sim card. And that is very inconvenient
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It should have been a great phone. Lots of fast memory, nice screen, fast and good looking phone.I have OnePlus 11. So I wanted to upgrade it to OnePlus12: better camera, faster processor, more modern OS (Android 14 vs 13), faster storage, wireless charging.What I found out: does not work with Cricket. Works with T-Mobile and ATT. Set up was easy. Clone the phone app is not able to clone the phone. Your apps, backgrounds, WiFi settings will not be migrated. The Assistant will copy most of the settings and apps, but not all. I've not figured out how to launch the Assistant, but phone offered it on its own shortly after the initial set up. It copied all images, videos, screenshots and documents. It skipped some apps and offered no explanation.The camera app is not able to record geotags. I tried many times to set it. But it just would not accept the setting. See screen capture. The phone takes very good pictures and video.Fingerprint sensor is easy to set up. But it is recognizing the fingerprints. One has to press fingers hard and wait longer (it works much better on OnePlus 11).My initial purchase was during July Prime sale. I got a good discount, but ended up returning the phone. OnePlus customer support was very pleasant, but useless. They kept asking me to reset the settings or to reset the phone (meaning I ended up migrating my stuff from the old phone several times). They also wanted to see how I try to set the geotags in camera. And doubted I knew how to do it. They had no clue why I could not make or receive phone calls using Cricket SIM, but could use ATT or T-Mobile SIM . Sending or receiving texts, getting online using mobile data was working fine with all three SIMs. Cricket customer support was also useless. They kept restarting the phone or just powering it down, waiting 10 sec and powering it up again. That had no effect . So I thought I got a lemon, returned the phone and bought another one. The sale was over and I spent $130 more the second purchase the same model. It sucked ! And it did not help . The second phone has the very same issues as the first one.For now I'm using it with ATT SIM, but it's much more expensive plan than Cricket. I now have to either go back to the old phone - Samsung Galaxy S20 or buy another brand.Compared to OnePlus 11, this phone is much worse. Fingerprint reader is slow and not reliable, can't use it with my carrier, camera can't record geotags, but it has two new zooms - 3X and 6X. The OnePlus 11 has only 2X zoom, that this newer version has too.Too bad OnePlus can't figure out to to fix these problems. I do want to keep the phone, but it makes no sense since it forces me to pay more for service and the features I'm interested in aren't working. I guess, I'll have to go back to the Galaxy brand ."
"Likes: good price comparing to Galaxy S24 ultra. Storage, memory, security, OS, etc are all good. I have Jabra hearing aid and the Bluetooth connection is better. Also, I can use this phone as car key.Dislikes: My previous phone was Galaxy S10 plus. The previous phone can have 5 app icons in a row while one open plus 12 can only do 4. Oneplus 12 screen color is not as rich. The speaker is not as loud. The notification sound cannot be completely muted. There is no headset jack. Photo taken is somewhat yellowish.  My voice recording is not as clear as galaxy."
"I bought this phone as a Mobile App Developer and at the same time to use it as a main phone but I found many obstacles.1. Face ID at night or in the dark is inefficient2. For bank apps it does not support Face ID as a security measure, it only serves to unlock the phone3. The cameras have a lot of color saturation, my iPhone 12 Pro Max surpasses it in photography4. I wanted to try the Android 15 beta but the process is complicated and they still warn you that the phone can be ruined in the process, I am used to trying the iOS beta that simply in settings there is a switch to activate or deactivate the Beta versions of the system.5. The customization layer (Oxygen) has several errors, I had to install a third-party Launcher but sometimes to see the recent apps it does not work well.6. The NFC is not very good, to connect headphones I brought the headset close to everywhere and it was even on the side of the cameras that it worked but it does not always detect it.There are more errors that I don't remember now, I wrote to support and they asked me to send them the data from a test, after several emails in a time interval of a week, they told me that perhaps it would be resolved in an update, from the first email they would have told me that, totally disappointed with the brand, since I was a child I had the illusion of buying a OnePlus phone and now that I have tried it it was disappointing, now I can't even return it because I am outside the USA"
"The OnePlus 12 is a fantastic phone. The charger died just 2 months into ownership.Reached out to OnePlus customer support and since they didn't sell it referred me back to Amazon. OnePlus apparently doesn't warrant their product but the reseller does .... Guess manufacturing has taken a new turn. So while phone is outstanding super 80W charger died very, very quickly. 2 months is a travesty to design/ functionality. So buyer beware OnePlus doesn't seem to stand bye their products. Would have rated higher but the phone staying charged is what makes this electronic device function !!"
"I really like this phone BUT!! How can a ""FLAGSHIP"" phone not have WiFi calling capabilities? YOU NEED TO GET THIS UPDATED ONE PLUS!!  This would have been 5 star if not for this oversight. And I might add this is not a carrier problem. The at&t sim card was just switched into it from my old phone and WiFi calling worked on that Samsung phone it was in"
"I tried the pixel & figured I should go back to the one plus. Mine was 4 years old so I was excited to give the newest a shot. It freaking LAGS like no other. God forbid trying to open the camera, especially on a social media app. Fig. Contemplating heavily, returning it. Plus it's freaking huge. The cameras are huge in worried about setting my phone down anywhere & the quality of all 9 cameras is crap. Unimpressed to say the least."
"I have been a OnePlus customer for years, probably since OP3 or earlier. this is my 5th OP phone and always the camera disappoints me. Every time I am about to replace a phone I read reviews about how the camera got better. Well it doesn't. I t ka thousands of photos every year and I must say the OP12 camera is the worst I had, even worst than my OP8T.Really why they cant get it to work after so many years.The Selfie camera is the worst ever - I cant take a single selfie photo and keep it - I delete them all. I don't know if my specific phone has something wrong but really all photos are bad. The white balance is awful, the sky always look 'burned'/white there is not autofocus.Even the front back camera are not as good (not as bad as the selfie) Every time I take a photo with other people near me, and they have older Iphones or Samsung they all say my photos are bad comparing to theirs. Every time I send a photo to my family they say the quality is bad.Other than that I really like my OP, Operating system is great, performance is great, battery is great, really no complains - but since I shot a lot and its important to me this is my last OP ever. I will switch to iphone or samsung no matter how good the reviews are"
"Everything else seems what you'd expect from OnePlus, but the camera was bad, the light part of backgrounds were very bright like headlights from a car. Not good. My OnePlus 11 is better than this"
"I wish i could give this phone 5 stars. I love it very much, however, BT can be spotty and android auto isn't very optimized. It also refuses to stay to connected to my truck via Bluetooth which might be the android auto issue. Some apps don't feel optimized or lag and i never had this issue with my 10t. I'm hoping it can all be fixed in an update but I'm not sure if i wanna wait. As i spend a lot of time in my truck and its incredibly frustrating to have to disconnect my phone to answer calls."
"The phone started off great!Massive hardware failures started, in updates. Pink screen, which has become wide spread with many oneplus customers.After customer got involved, found out very quickly. They have no replacement because I purchased this phone from Amazon.  They told me if I had purchase the phone directly from them , this would not be an issue.If was willing to send them the cell, they would ""try"" to fix it. Which means....the weeks send back to China, I will have to buy a new cell until they send it back.I say save your self the trouble."
"this phone is good. I bought it because I wanted to zoom out to the moon and I'm disappointed . sound quality is great better than expected, appearance is also cool, sensor is not that great, takes a bit to unlock. the Operating system is regular and I had great hopes on this phone for the camera but like I said the X120 zoom is not Worth it. probably Samsung 100x zoom is better. I'm not sure."
"I've bought OnePlus phones in the past with NO issues... OnePlus 12 keeps glitching,it shut completely down to format mode,another issue is the screen....it's easily scratched... difficult to find phone case for bulging screen....I think overall it's been cheaply made compared to previous models..... not worth the money"
"The phone performance are comparable with a POCO3, 2/3hundred $ phone 5/6 years old."
"I bought a OnePlus 12 to replace my trusty old OnePlus 5 mostly because I wanted a phone with a better camera. The OnePlus 12 is super fast but it has some deal breakers.Oxygen 14 comes with lots of new features  but plenty of regressive changes too.All ""1"" characters on the digital clock are red among other annoyances. OnePlus thinks they are so clever to make the ""1"" red. It is a stupid anti-feature that distracts and draws attention to itself for no reason.The curves edges of the screen look neat but when you actually try to use the phone it is obvious that this is a form over function design. The screen goes nearly all the way to the edges but it is not usable. All edge content is completely distorted from the curved screen.The worst is that Google Voice outbound call redirect does not work at all. It is a known issue since Oxygen 12 and OnePlus will not fix it even though this phone comes with Oxygen 14.I think OnePlus has gone off the rails since Carl Pei left. I will probably never buy another OnePlus unless they get their act together. I am returning the phone and going back to my old phone for now."
"I love this phone, but it was not brand new. It arrived with a screen protector on it and the settings were not factory settings. Not pleased with the transaction. Will not be buying a phone from Amazon again in the future."
"I own OnePlus 8. Great phone.I decided to buy a more modern OnePlus 12 model.I tried to figure it out for several days, but nothing worked out for me. Technical support could not help me and, as I understand it, they are not competent.OnePlus 12 has 50 48 and 64 MP cameras. The photos taken by these cameras are 12 MP in size. Technical support claims that this is 50 or 60 MP.????It's a shame - good phones, good company and illiterate technical support staff.I continue to wait for an explanation from them. But it looks like I have to return the phone.Do not buy it!!!"
Was hoping it looked more like picture.  I hate the charging port cover.  It's a pain to maneuver to get plug in.  It's a lot heavier than I thought it would be. But hopefully it protects my OnePlus phone.
"The phone is indeed snazzy. Good camera. Should be for a Hasselblad! Honestly though, that's about it for me. This is the first ""new"" phone I've ever bought, and what a disappointment it is. My 4 year old Samsung was more responsive than this thing. It is constantly glitching on apps that I have forever been able to use without issue on my previous older/used phones. Occasionally it will just cease to respond and freeze up. Also for some reason, when you're occasionally watching videos, the brightness of the screen randomly becomes overwhelmingly bright. Almost painfully bright.... Can't quite describe just how disappointed I am. It's slow to response, glitches apps, and I am not even remotely a fan of it's ""new"" AI feature controls. Should have bought another used Samsung and been done with it. Live and learn I suppose.... Wish I could send it back, but I'm past the date. Save yourself some headache folks. It won't be what they advertised or what you expect. 😕"
Love the phone except for the screen. Scratched he's easy.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I took a chance with Oneplus because the specs on this phone are impressive.  And for awhile I really liked this phone. Then one day, I  noticed four distinct vertical bars on the screen. I made a complaint with Oneplus support and got the run around from them. This phone is supposed  to be the flagship of this brand, and I thought they would honor the product. Instead I have an expensive brick that I can not use. Do not buy this phone!"
Having come from the Galaxy Fold 5 and being the oneplus brand I figured this would be a awesome switch. Boy did I regret it. After giving it the benefit of the doubt a few days and multiple factory resets this phone with the constant crashing of apps and constant freezing is borderline unusable. Buyer beware!
It drops wifi every 10-15 minutes no matter what settings or ghz i have my network set as. No other device I have currently or previously has had issues this severe. It will not hold onto a wifi signal at all for any steady period and constantly drops calls and text are always being stopped and non-delivered.
All I can say is to Google OnePlus 12 bugs before you buy this phone...
"I used to own a Oneplus 9 Pro before I got a Motorola edge plus 5g UW(2022), and I really liked Oneplus 9 Pro a lot more. So I thought that upgrading from Motorola edge to something I already used and liked should be a no brainer.I bought this phone back in July, and nearly 2 months later, I believe made a HUGE mistake. Not sure why there are so many restrictions on Android 14, but for whatever reason, I can not disable AT ALL, the vibration features. This phone is a big disappointment and if i could return it and get my money back, I would do it in a heart beat."
"Pretty disappointed in this phone.  I want my 8R back.  I don't care for the volume buttons on the same side as the on off. It constantly resets display time. Often won't let me swipe to change screens. And I don't know who had the idea of a plastic screensaver.  Horrible idea. I loved my original One Plus.  Was completely sold on the brand.  Now, I am rethinking that.  One Plus, do better and give us a glass protector and quit changing things that don't need changing.  Guess I am stuck with this phone for awhile, but I am definitely NOT happy about it."
Almost a month ago I got the Android 15 update and now I can't make or receive phone call. This only seems to be happening to AT&T customers in the US. Oneplus doesn't seem to care.
Bluetooth doesn't work very well and annoying. I have it connected to my vehicle and watch. Now I can't pair it to anything else.....Even with it paired to my devices it doesn't work correctly. It sucks because I really like their phones. I would have returned it but I didn't notice the issue early enough.
"After less than 2 weeks of use, phone stopped charging. Battery level indicator shows stuck at 51%. Messages expressing hardware failure on battery. OnePlus only offers repair but no replacement of faulty device. There is NO service option outside of the US. Customer service is terrible. This is definitely a huge red flag. This was my first phone that is not a Samsung and I was very happy about its performance, cameras, etc, but the customer service has convinced me that I made a mistake by buying this phone."
Dropped 2 feet high and screen went crazy w one small 16th of inch weak phone
"Before upgrading to this phone I had the OnePlus 10T and was always able to rinse the screen to remove any grime, also forgot it was in my pocket at the pool being submerged for 5+ minutes and it worked perfect afterwards. This phone however, can't get wet at all because after rinsing the screen, my camera lens has water buildup under the glass that I cannot remove.. given the selling point of the OnePlus 12 is the camera quality, I can't really use the camera with water on the lense."
Absolute trash. Don't waste your money. Either get the Samsung you turned away from or keep shopping around. This phone makes day to day task infuriating. Will definitely not buy or recommend this brand to anyone. 🗑️
"Piece of crap waste of money can't install sim, can't factory reset. Stupid phone. I want my money back but Amazon is refusing don't buy this stupid phone. Just blew 800 plus. What an idiot I am."
be aware this phone will NOT work with anyone other than T mobile.the phone is not unlocked as advertised and is NOT GSM compatible as advertised
Should have known better. Big disappointment. Overly hyped reviews. Customer service gives you the runaround. They won't take responsibility for a lousy product. This phone has many problems and software glitches. Don't believe the hype. Don't waste your money. Buy Samsung or Apple instead. Just another cheap piece of junk from China
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Both OnePlus 12 have the same upper tiny box screen flickering. Again, my wife's Samsung S21 (4 years old) did not flicker at all.OnePlus 12 reminds me of my cheap TCL phones, but it costs almost 4x as the TCL phone."
Locked for TMBOLIE July 2024
Phone stopped working and powering up within less 30 days and Amazon wouldn't do a replacement. Had a difficult time with customer service. Amazon just lost a loyal customer. Prime canceled and now no longer doing business.
Took the risk of trying out a OnePlus.Good God just buy a Samsung. OxygenOS is cancerous. Having to go through the trouble of finding another launcher is frustrating.
The phone turned off and would not turn on after less than a couple of hours of using. There was no option for getting a replacement so opted for refund.
"This phone has all the hardware you'd want in a modern phone. The battery and battery charging doesn't get any better. Where everything goes wrong is the software. This thing is a black hole of nag screens, unexplained and illogical behaviors. Notifications that cannot be controlled. Media playback is a joke that can't be changed. On all of my previous devices I could have my media playback control in the form of a persistent notification. I could fast forward in just two gestures. Now everything is compacted into a media tile that has to be opened to gain access to media seeking/fast forward. Furthermore if I pause apps playing media they disappear after a few seconds or a minute. I cannot resume media playback with the Bluetooth resume button. I have to unlock my phone, reopen the app and press play. if you're wearing gloves or have dirty hands this is an absolute deal killer. There's no way to change it. I've tried finding Magisk modules and anything else. Nothing works. Certain media apps randomly wake the phone screen when media is playing. About ever 15-20 seconds the phone screen will consistently light up. All this good hardware is useless when all these unexplained behaviours cannot be fixed and when the phone cannot be fine tuned to my personal needs. I thought that was always the point of having an Android. Fine tuned customization. The worst thing is OnePlus phones are no longer custom rom friendly."
Just updated my phone to Android 15 and cell signal is broken.  This is now a phone that can't text call or use cell data.  OnePlus has said it has been many weeks that this is a known issue and they don't know when it will be resolved.  I loved this phone for 5 months but now it's just a small wifi tablet.  Returning to store.
I thought this would be a much better phone considering some people have gave pretty good rating I wouldn't have two of these phones for the Samsung 21 ultra that I had some features on this phone came out with the dinosaurs but after using it I had to keep it because if I sent it back I'm sure they would have kept half my money but I am trying to sell it. No more OnePlus phones for me not even if they are giving them away
"Purchased this phone from the manufacturer. After about 6 months, I noticed air bubbles under the screen so it's sent back for repair. It has been almost a month and the phone is nowhere, which I see as poor service. If you rely on good phone service, perhaps a different phone would be more suitable for you. Never settle!"
"very poor camera design, I've replaced back glass cover for oneplus11 3 times already.They keep using the same poor design for oneplus12, I forsee same issue with this.I've used about 6 oneplus cellphones in the past, I think I am getting tired of this brand. It is getting overpriced,  not flagship killer anymore, and all the design issues with back glass cover and OIS camera blurriness makes is a bad phone now"
Why would you make the back side glass? What a waste
Phone and company is complete rubbish now. I used to buy one pluses for last 10 years and that one is my last. Phone is a brick after last update they pushed and support is non existing.
I'm just done with Oneplus. Never again. The UI is terrible & always changing without notice or any way to change it back.
"Red all the horrible online reviews. One Plus phones are absolute garbage! Customer service laughs in your face. Oxygen OS is a nightmare. Reliability is terrible. Windows USB integration does not work. Everywhere you look, One Plus sucks. Please, I repeat please — do not buy this trash if you want to keep your sanity."
"I am a fairly tech-savvy smartphone guy.  I had read great things about the OnePlus 12, so I decided to give their latest, the 12 series a chance.  But I had an unexpected experience with the phone constantly disconnecting from my devices, including my Android Auto.  I use Android Auto religiously.  But there is nothing worse than being in the middle of a drive and randomly losing my in progress navigation.I did everything.  Including updating my phone, then factory reset my phone.  Updated my car's systems, HOPING I could isolate the problem.  Nothing resolved the issue so I contacted OnePlus' support and reported the issue.  They gave me the expected steps which I followed to no avail.  I just wanted my phone to be reliable.  But that didn't happen.Eventually, OnePlus support advised me to ""ship my phone"" to a ""service center"".  Being this is my primary phone, I asked, could you cross ship a replacement?  I'd be happy to provide a deposit.  ""We don't have the means to do that.""  ""Here's the address"".Buyer beware!  Great phone -when it works.  Great price.  Poor post sales support."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                I used to own a OnePlus 6 and I absolutely loved it. I ended up with a Samsung phone for a while, then decided to try the OnePlus 12.It is a wildly different experience from the OnePlus 6. OnePlus uses something called OxygenOS which is a Chinese version of Android that's been semi modified to feel more Western.The hardware is great, like every other phone these days. I love the alert slider and can't figure out why every company doesn't build these into their phones. The phone is powerful, the battery life is pretty good, the charging speed is phenomenal (again, why doesn't every phone manufacturer focus on this?), and the cameras are pretty good though definitely not top notch. The screen is great, but the curved edges are a pain to use, hold, find a case for, and it's impossible to find a good screen protector.The reason for my two star review is OnePlus itself. OnePlus does not use a normal version of Android, but instead they port a Chinese version to America. There are so many frustrating decisions they've made that I can't change. For example, if I use the OnePlus launcher (the main home app with all your app icons, your wallpaper, etc) the phone is super quick. However you get very little customization. For example I can't change my wallpaper to anything besides the pre-installed OnePlus wallpapers. (Update, I figured out how to do this after all. You just need to go to the main settings, wallpaper and styles, click the current theme, click wallpaper, then click album. Oddly any other way off accessing the wallpaper selection only allows OnePlus wallpapers. Even accessing the launcher wallpaper selector only allows OnePlus wallpapers.) this phone is much much less customizable than Google's or Samsung's launchers, and far less than 3rd party (downloaded from the android store) launchers. If I use any non OnePlus launcher, and I've tried many, there is a 1 second lag anytime I swipe to go to my home screen, which can be a hundred times per day. I uploaded a video where I open Edge from the home screen then return home, the first part is using the OnePlus launcher, and the second part is using a 3rd party launcher. Notice that there is a delay where you get frozen on the wallpaper for a moment in the 3rd party launcher. I have never seen this on any other brand of phone. After researching, I found that this has been an issue with OnePlus for years but for whatever reason they don't address it. The OnePlus launcher offers far less functionality and customization. But they programmed the phone to punish anyone who wants to use something other than the OnePlus software. For the record, this doesn't happen one Samsung, Motorola, or Google Pixel phones (probably most others too, but I've personally tested those three).The phone often makes decisions for you that you can't override. For example, when my battery is at or below 15%, I can't use the flash on my camera when taking a photo. Where I live, on Earth, It generally gets dark at the end of the day, which is the same time that my battery is low. I have missed several photos because OnePlus decided that I would rather save battery then be able to use my camera at night. The flashlight still works, even at 1% battery, but not the flash while taking photos or videos.Then there are the random missteps that are just not thought out. For example, there is a setting that only charges the phone to 80% to prolong the battery's overall lifespan. Well, battery saver automatically turns off at 90%, not 80%. So if you set charging to stop at 80%, you'll have to manually turn off battery saver every single time you charge your phone. Not awful, but these things add up when you use a device daily for years.OnePlus' customer service is essentially non existent. You can email them with questions, but they respond with generic, prewritten responses. OnePlus has a community forum, but the company themselves don't seem to interact with it, so the forum is just thousands of people complaining, asking for features, or asking for help with no response from the company and no acknowledgement of the community's issues. I have emailed customer service four times about two different questions but not get a single response that seemed like it came from a human, and I never had my questions answered or even directly addressed. Just basic trouble shooting steps like turning my phone off then on, or doing a factory reset (erasing every single thing on the phone. This is commonly suggested by OnePlus.)There are several more software issues I have had but I don't want my review to be 50,000 characters.Overall, the phone isn't terrible, mostly because the hardware is great, but with phones like the Pixel with its superior software and cameras, or the Galaxy phones with superior software and cameras and as-good-or-better hardware, OnePlus only makes sense if you're trying to save some money, don't care to customize your phone, and don't mind having no customer support from the manufacturer. Personally, I regret buying it and wish I'd spent more on a Galaxy phone. They go on sale often enough that they cost what I paid for this. Beyond that, I've found that companies don't let you trade in OnePlus phones, so if you want a new phone, you'll either have to sell your OnePlus yourself, or leave it in the drawer and take the loss. A Samsung phone would have retained a portion of its initial value for trade-ins. Accessories are also very hard to find for OnePlus devices, even my OnePlus 6. I had to settle for an okay but not great case. I couldn't find the kind of case I wanted, and most options out there have poor reviews. I'm still using the original screen protector which is all scratched up, because I can't find any screen protectors for this phone with good reviews. Likely a mix between the curved edges and OnePlus' lack of popularity.I find myself frustrated by odd choices OnePlus made to the phone at least once every single day since I've owned it. The overall experience of a OnePlus phone is just plain lower quality. You pay less for similar hardware, but you give up software quality, customer service, accessories, support from the company, and customization.Personally, I shouldn't have settled."
Sent Support a screenshot and now I'm stuck with a great looking phone that cannot take calls.Reset APN and still will not take calls.
"I was supposed to get this device yesterday, and they moved me to the 26th. I love Oneplus, but their customer service and speed can be horrible. Most of the time"
They promise you a price on the website and then they devalue your trade in and charge you full price
"I hate the microphone on this thing, sounds like there person is under water"
"I have had LG phones on and off for 10 years i choose them or Samsung. 6 years ago is when they stopped being good. This phone can't even open instagram without crashing itself! This latest update from android comepletly destroyed this already barely functional phone. I can only use this phone maybe an hour in day before it just gives me anxiety just trying to use it. Wanna do a quick google search, wanna also find out what modern day dial-up feels like with your phones operating system..... Look no further than this phone, wanna wait 5 minutes real time to use you video on you camera apart of the phones OS ya can't even do that. It opens to the camera you switch to the video get 2 seconds recording and the phone crashes back to home screen. I can't stress this enough DON'T BUY THIS PHONE. i absolutely regret buying this phone it was an utter waste of money, I could have bought an IPHONE XR on here for the same price this was at the time of buying. I can guarantee I wouldn't have dealt with any headaches besides making the switch from all my google accounts I have had for 12 years. That still would have been less frustrating then owning this phone. Anything to deal with media i don't even use anymore and have deleted. Genuinely because its impossible to even use them. I'm not even able to casually look at reels on facebook or even communicating with people i don't live near or do is impossible on this phone. it will crash 6 times loading messenger. i only have 12 gigs of data used, even after deleting nearly everything besides social and communication things aren't on this phone and it can still barely run. If i was in an emergency and needed this phone to work the OS calling app would crash and you would die. I can barely make any communication with this device which is its most BASIC function. That is still a chore to even use! Heed my warning do not buy this phone, don't gift this phone(unless its someone you hate) Stick to Samsung or Apple there are few other good phone manufacturers worth the price. A low end model of either of those phones manufacturer on a budget, you would still have a better experience and have a truly just functional phone. if i could get a full refund for this phone i would! Stay away from this trash, all of these phones deserve to be in a landfill."
"So I just received this phone overnight which was great. Unfortunately after spending all morning working with this phone, I realized it just will not work effectively and it is supposed to be brand new. It is a gorgeous phone, sleek, big enough screen...BUT I was checking out the camera functionality and it refused to select the photo button when I pressed on it..the colors are horrible so opaque and it was like this from the moment it went on, no vibrancy whatsoever (this is not something that anyone should have to play around with) colors should always be vibrant on a cell phone. Also who sells a phone with just a USB cable?  and no charge box included with the cable.  So i'm supposed to what??? plug this USB port where ?? in my computer? It is beyond ridiculous, and not an error.  If you look at what comes in the box..clearly states only USB cable (dumb of me to not notice that yesterday) but been going through some things so that mistake was inevitable.  NO PICTURE as I just packed it up to return"
"I ordered Moto Stylus because of the stylus. I wanted it to control HTML/JavaScipt web pages with small buttons. For this purpose, it is no good.Another reason for getting  Moto Stylus was the ability to write down notes. That does work, in a way, but I have to write those notes in handwriting!! The stylus cannot be used with on-screen keyboard (although the keyboard works quite well with my fingers).What I learned:- The stylus works with some apps and DOES NOT work with other apps.- All browsers behave differently from browsers on other Motorola smartphones (e.g. Moto E7 power, which works MUCH better). (Since this holds for ALL browsers, it seems to me that the problem is on the operating system level.) All browsers require the !DOCTYPE line to recognize a file as HTML page (no such requirement on Moto E7 !), and even so, they cannot access pictures in directories other than the directory where the HTML file is."
"I thought I was safe buying a Motorola Stylus as the last phone I had was the 2022/2021 version and was the best phone I've ever owned.I don't understand how their quality standards for phones dropped so fast within a few years. This phone is, funnily enough, the worst one I've ever owned, and I have lived through the horror of dropping my Android and having it explode like a bunch of LEGOs down the middle school hallway.This phone cannot do literally anything. Listen to music on Spotify or a video on YouTube in the background? The app you're using will force quit and take 2-3 minutes to load back up. Try to play a game? It barely runs and you guessed it, force closes. I'm lucky if I get 15 solid minutes on TikTok before it force closes. Reddit force closes - how do you screw up bad enough for Reddit to force close?? Pictures taken with the camera don't save half the time, so I have to use Snapchat, but then also half the time Snapchat will force close so I can't take the picture.I have owned enough phones in my life to know the general fixes. I barely have any apps installed,my storage space is decent (though mostly taken up by Motorola apps), I make sure all other apps are closed out of before trying to open a new one, I turn the phone off and on again. None of these fixes help.And at the end of the day, it's because Motorola cheaped out and put 4gb of RAM in this thing. Disappointing as hell. I used to love Motorola but will not be coming back."
It does not come with the 10W Rapid Charger but is still a bargain
"Moto G Stylus 2023: Terrible DisappointmentI recently purchased the Motorola Moto G Stylus 2023, and I must say, it has been a complete disappointment in every aspect. This phone fails to deliver on its promises and falls short in terms of performance, design, and functionality. Here's why I strongly advise you to avoid this device:Lackluster Performance: The Moto G Stylus 2023 is painfully slow and sluggish. It struggles to handle even basic tasks like opening apps or browsing the internet. The overall user experience is frustrating, and you'll find yourself waiting for ages just for simple actions to complete. It's as if the phone is stuck in the Stone Age!Inferior Build Quality: The build quality of this phone is subpar at best. It feels cheap and flimsy in hand, lacking the premium touch you'd expect from a modern device. The materials used are of low quality, making it vulnerable to scratches and damage. Moreover, the design is uninspired and outdated, making the Moto G Stylus 2023 look like a relic from the past.Mediocre Camera Performance: Despite the marketing hype surrounding its camera capabilities, the Moto G Stylus 2023 fails to deliver impressive results. The photos captured are often grainy, lack detail, and suffer from poor color accuracy. The supposed ""stunning"" low-light performance is nothing but a marketing gimmick, as the images turn out noisy and unusable. If you're looking for a phone with a good camera, this is definitely not the one.Frustrating Software Experience: Motorola's software experience on the Moto G Stylus 2023 is a nightmare. The device is loaded with bloatware, which not only eats up valuable storage space but also slows down the phone even further. The user interface is cluttered and unintuitive, making it difficult to navigate through the menus. Updates are infrequent, leaving users stuck with outdated features and security patches.Lack of Display Quality: The display on the Moto G Stylus 2023 is a letdown. It lacks vibrancy, and colors appear washed out. The resolution is mediocre at best, resulting in a pixelated viewing experience. Whether you're watching videos, playing games, or simply browsing the web, the display fails to provide an immersive visual experience.In conclusion, the Motorola Moto G Stylus 2023 is an absolute disappointment in every aspect. From its poor performance and inferior build quality to its underwhelming camera and frustrating software experience, this phone simply falls short of the competition. There are far better options available in the market at similar price points. Save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere for a reliable and feature-rich smartphone."
"I received my 2023 Motorola G Stylus from the Motorola Store.  Out of the box, I ejected the stylus and pushed it back in.  Then I did my transfer of info from my old phone and made sure the apps were working fine.  I then tried to eject the stylus and it was stuck in the phone.  I checked online for how to release it and finally took a tiny jewelry screwdriver to pry out the pen.  I tried working the release button without putting it back in the phone.  When you push in the release button, it locks into the closed position.  Then when you push it in again, it's supposed to go in a little and release about 1/4 inch so you can grab it with your fingertips and pull it out of the phone.  Mine didn't release, it stays in the locked position and you have to pull it out manually again.Here's the fun part.  I tried calling Motorola that day and got an India connection.  The lady couldn't help but she escalated it and said I'd get a call on Monday.  On Monday, no call.  So on Tuesday, the India connection dropped my call at least a dozen times.  When I finally got to speak to someone, I went through the problem and she told me I'd have to purchase a new pen on the Motorola Store.  When I started to complain, the call was dropped again.About 5 minutes later, I got through to a new person and went through everything, getting the same result.  I'd have to buy a new stylus even though the one I bought didn't work out of the box.  They said the stylus isn't covered under warranty.  Next, I started looking for a Motorola USA phone number and ended up a chat.  Explained the problem and got the same result but they are escalating it and I'll get an email within 48 hours.Motorola never contacted me so they sold me a new phone that I can't eject the stylus pen to use it.  BEWARE....their customer service is non-existant.It's my 3rd of 4th Motorola phone but now that they're owned by Lenova, it's not the same.  I won't buy another product from either company."
"I've been using this phone for about a month. I have fought with it more than I have truly used it it has issues with connecting because does not respond to the touch, which makes it very difficult to answer calls. It freezes up so frequently that I am unable to rely on the usability. People call me and they know that it will likely take two or three calls before they can actually reach me. I would not recommend this phone at all. It came with a screen protector in the case. The screen protector is difficult to see through and makes any videos difficult to see. I had a previous version of this phone that I enjoyed very much so it looks like I will go back to the old style instead of this new updated version."
"Follow-up review.First, I’m a Motorola fan since using their pagers since the late 1970s.It saddens me to say I regret buying this phone.The call quality is good, both receiving and others say they hear me fine.The problem is connecting to the internet, or should I say not being able to connect to it.It’s horribly slow when it does connect, but more often than not it won’t, both at home and using outside location WiFi. I’ve had to to to Settings-network and click on my WiFi to -I guess reset is the word or completely restart the phone and this happens often — VERY OFTEN. I even went to Verizon store and they checked the phone’s settings to make sure all was correct.  Anyway, I cannot recommend this phone."
This is my first Moto phone. I have always been a Samsung user but mine was getting older and I needed something newer but not brand new and I adore pink so this was a no-brainer for me. It is a really pretty phone but it is not without issues. It is very slow to start and it freezes often. The stylist is not really work well so I gave up on even trying to use that. It serves the purpose for my texts and internet but would not buy another Moto
"Often find this phone is very slow to do anything, but its a phone and better than nothing.  Each time I want to place a call?  Have to search thru the menu or type in phone in the search bar.  Why? Motorola or who ever makes their junk now should realize this is a cell phone first, calling is kind of important? But here its one of several apps or games or?  Its better than what I had before, but what I really dislike is Motorola support.  You have a chat robot who is not helpful.  Will look to a different brand next time."
"I've owned 3 different Motorola phones and this is by far the worst. Ever since Lenovo bought Motorola the quality and performance has gotten worse. Did not come with charger that was in the description. I've tried this phone for over 6 months just to see if it was consistently bad, it is. Even now when I try to write this review the keyboard disappears and the phone stops responding. I can't even finish writing this review. Battery life is down to 12 hours. I think this may be a refurbished phone and not new in box."
This is the worst Motorola phone I've ever used in my entire life and I am a big Motorola fan this phone has been a very buggy from the start it freezes it it takes five or six different tries to to tap on the screen. It doesn't respond when you're trying to do things with it it's just disgustingly horrible.
"Ordered the Moto G Stylus 2023 in Midnight Blue. It arrived and is SO pretty and I could not wait to go to US Cellular and get a SIM card and start using it. Well....the item says it is ""Unlocked for all carriers"". So I had confidence in ordering it. Drove almost 2 hours round trip to the nearest US Cellular store to find out that it is NOT compatible with US Cellular. Warning...don't believe what they tell you!"
"Overall, when the phone is working consistently, love it.  HOWEVER, I have had it set up for ONE day thus far, and already 4 times the screen, function buttons freeze/lock up.  I have had on those occasions NO access to communication or anything.  I discovered if I hold the close/restart button for awhile, it will restart... all good and well, but the fact it's not been reliable consistently when using it is a p.i.t.a.  Just saying."
"I had decent expectations with this phone given the price, but within a day of use I'm starting to notice that the phone freezes often and takes too long to respond, very slow!!"
"Wasn't sure I wanted to keep it after I realized it had usb-c connection. Decided to since my old phone was on its last legs. Set it up and walked outside, sat down in my truck and it slipped out of my pocket and immediately shattered the glass.  I've never broken a phone before and I've dropped them all plenty of times.  Why it's so fragile and small in my hands I don't understand. Made for someone with smaller hands I guess.  Also, plugged it into a USB port on a PC and the charging was incredible slow.  +5% in 1.5 hours.  Wall socket charge a little better but still slow. Hopefully the new cables I bought are faster than the one in the box.  Should have bought the in protection plan."
"I like the battery life. I like the picture quality. I like the size. I love the value for the money. I don't like  how the stylist functions. I have to click the keyboard icon after every letter. So, I back to using my fingers."
"In the not too distant past, some of the great things about Moto G phones were getting great hardware at a decent price and the lack of bloatware. Those things are now a distant memory.If you want a Stylus, get the 2022 model as it has a bigger screen, better hardware, better, well, EVERYTHING. This is a downgrade across the board and literally EVERY aspect is worse than the 2022 model. Seriously, right now, late November 2023, the 2022 Stylus is a much better by than the 2023 Stylus version. It's not even close.And on top of Moto G disappointing with the hardware. I just spent 30 minutes removing bloatware AND spyware from the phone. Motorola used to be a great brand. But ever since (the truly horrible company) Lenovo bought them from Google, Moto has been on a slow but steady descent into irrelevance, so now, Motorola is apparently as bad of a brand as their parent company Lenovo is. Sad, because I can't remember the last time I wasn't using a Moto G phone and yet now, after purchasing this for a family member and having a go with it, I am fairly sure that my next phone won't be a Motorola.Seriously though, if you are considering this phone. Don't. Get the 2022 Moto G Stylus instead. I wasn't joking. It seriously is a better phone in every aspect."
"I bought this phone to replace my old one. If I could, I'd use the old phone again. I can't get any help anywhere on the phone as it doesn't come with directions. I'm old school, I like to look up what I don't understand or go online to figure it out. When you turn it off, or restart it, the phone says ""Hello Moto"" how dumb is that? How can I turn that off? Arrrgggghhhh!!!! I can't even get my voice mail because it has a code to retrieve it. I never got a code! Hate it, hate it, hate it!!!! Maybe I'll sell the crappy thing!!!"
Had the phone for 6 months now and if I could return I would. This phone is very slow compared to similar Androids. The worst thing for me is how it completely closes apps when you switch between them or you take longer than a minute to go back to a previous app you were on (namely TikTok and YouTube) Don't get me started on YouTube... literally from the first day I started using this phone I had issues opening YouTube properly and still do to this Almost every other time I try to open YT it opens oddly in the corner of the screen and never loads fully. So annoying. I should have returned then but I needed a phone.
PROUCTDid not come with charger
"EDIT: The battery is not charging fully. In fact it's so slow that it takes close to an hour ro charge 20%. It also doesn't charge past 50ish %. This phone was either badly refurbished and sold as ""new"", or massively defective but sold anyway. I constantly have to turn the screen off and back on to get it to recognize that I'm touching the screen and my music keeps randomly stopping. It's a good thing I'm not epileptic, as YouTube starts flashing, glitching after a few minutes. I have to close the window and open it back up. All this after the return window, and I don't have the funds to replace it. Will never recommend this phone to anyone. I'll warn them off of it!"
Photos reproduce very muted colors. Think I'm going to return phone.
"I am a senior and bought this phone many months ago for $150 on Amazon. I had wanted an unlocked phone that was easy to learn how to use.  After a month of trying I am still confused as to how to use it.  The people at the carrier I foolishly got, Mint Mobile, are confused too. The Moto customer service is awful, and they could not help me. Told me to send it to them, that maybe it wasn't working right. I wish I could get a refund but its too late. It dims after a minute, does alot of other things I can't figure out how to work. I just wanted something basic, this has 42 apps! Inspite of only making two calls on it and doing nothing else, i got a message warning that I was at my limit .  When I called Mint they said some of the apps run in the background without my permission.  When I asked how to turn them off they couldn't tell me. Many other things. Now looking for a basic phone.Just want to talk, take pics, and audio record, but can't find anything."
"This is a beautiful phone if you just want to look at it.  I travel through areas where the tower strength is 2-3 bars in some areas.  There are always some bars on the trip but this phone cuts off (if you get a connection to begin with) in the middle of the conversation.  The antenna for this phone must be VERY weak.  I have used Motorola phones for 12 years and this is the first one that won't go through this area fully functional.  If you are fortunate enough to live, work, travel in areas that have a full bar count, you should not have any problems with this phone.  I do not recommend it for anyone traveling in 2 to 3 bar areas."
"I bought this phone to replace my 3 year old Motorola X4. I'm not a Tech geek or phone snob or someone who knows how to work all the bells and whistles on a phone. I just needed a basic no frills phone to make a few calls, surf the web and play a game of candy crush or 2.  I knew this was a cheap basic phone, and I was okay with that. The problem is, this phone can't even handle basic things like opening a website or playing a simple game with out lagging, locking up and freezing. I wanted to write a review using the Amazon app, but the phone kept freezing up and not responding so I had to use my old Motorola just to post this. There is something really wrong with how slow this phone operates and how often it crashes. I tried to take a photo and the phone locked up before I could use the feature. ( I didn't load my old phones info because I was waiting for my husband to help me do it, so all of these issues are happening on a brand new clean phone.)I'm beyond disappointed in this phone, and I feel like I've been screwed over by Motorola. My old X4 performs and works better and never had the lagging issues like this one.These are the things I've tried to do on this phone and been unsussefull because the phone freeze's up.- taking a picture- trying to watch a YouTube video- playing a game ( candy crush, wordhero)- trying to browse a website- trying to open the Amazon app, or most other apps.- trying to open and read emails.I don't know if my phone is defective, but I doubt it. I think this is just a terrible phone, and a huge waste of money."
"Alright, here's an enthusiast's review.The main problem with the phone is the buggy Moto version of Android it's running (which Motorola doesn't post the current version of the code online for).  Certain apps don't work right and while it does have the ability to have it's bootloader unlocked and stock android installed, Motorola sits on the phone for 7 days before allowing that.  I purchased this hardware specifically because it was bootloader unlockable.  I may have considered it knowing up front that I'd have to let the phone sit in a drawer for a week before using it for anything.  However finding that out AFTER purchasing the phone, getting the unlock codes and getting everything ready to go is simply infuriating.  I could have purchased a bootloader locked phone for a 5th the price.  However, it's live and learn I guess.So in summary:The included OS has major compatibility issues with established applications.Motorola does not disclose the source code for the kernel in a timely matter (the present version disclosed is 4 updates/an entire Android version out of date).While you can request the unlock code for this phone on day 1 and give up your warranty, you're still held in limbo for at least 7 days for zero justifiable reason by Motorola.This phone is somewhat basic in terms of performance / features compared to similarly priced competitors.Having spamware applications force-ably loaded to a phone as soon as it's connected to the internet is in incredibly poor taste.This will be the last Motorola phone I buy unless they substantially change this entire process."
When I first purchased it worked very well. It freezes Alot and sometimes turn on and off by itself SMH .
"Got one for myself and my partner. Ordered the pink so we could easily tell the difference and was more expensive than blue, but when mine arrived I was surprised it was used. On top of that had no charger, and this type of charger I do not have. Would have been good to know this, I would have just gotten a new one like I expected in a cheaper color. Feel deceived and also need a charger now."
"I like that it is easy to use. Has talk to text. I don't like that when it downloads gaming apps without my permission. I went into settings to check if I could disable that, but it comes bundled in phone updates."
"Phone is OK.Like the phone but its being downgraded a star because it didn't come with a power adapter.  Since I already set up my new phone, I called Motorola - and they said it doesn't come with a power block, anymore.  So the amazon web page is incorrect, because it still says it comes with a power adapter."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I didn't receive the pen or the protective shield
"Motorola I believed to be reputable, innovative within the smartphone arena.Moto 5 g, 2023, I returned thinking the manufacture failed to include the charger, so I re-ordered, the same phone, to my disappointment, the Moto G simply DOES NOT COME WITH A CHARGER! Thus an inconvience, that devalues the boasted battery life, if one does not have the ability to plug the USB into a laptop. Forcused to purchase a USB type C/Charger, dispite the warnings not to use othe apdators not made by manaufacture.  For those with  special needs children, and physical limitations, be prepared."
Maybe just bad luck but the phone kept locking up. Returned it and bought a Moto G Stylus which works great. A little more money but the Stylus is better phone than the Pure even without the lock up problem.
"Phone  dropped calls, delayed texts, took forever to boot up, picture quality was bad. Slow to switch from  app to app. Took forever to to learn you have to go to the settings screen to shutdown and reboot. Very disappointed with this. I've had  better phones from Motorola. I bought a Samsung S20 5g two months later to replace it."
Nobody can hear me talking whether it's on speaker or not. I also did not get the right color. It came in midnight blue instead of glam pink. I called Amazon and explained the problem and was connected to tech support who told me the mic was bad. They offered to refund my money and take the phone back. I was told ups would pick it up and put a label on it. That never happened. Eventually I was sent a label twice to my email but we do not have a ups in my town it is 30 minutes away. Any the time I was able to get there Amazon told me that the label was no longer good and that  not only would the not replace my they also would not give my money back. So not only am I out of a phone I also am out $150. Great way to treat anybody but especially someone who is on a small check and doesn't have the money for another phone.
"Not 5g as the info specifies, but a decent budget 4g phone for the price."
"I bought two Motorola Moto G Stylus 2023 phones, they are very good devices, however I do not appreciate the false advertisement of what should be included within the package....the missing CHARGING ADAPTERS!!!!"
"When I got the phone it was so easy to install my sim card. However, it froze the first day and I had to restart the phone.  I still happens from time to time. Also the phone charges slow so you many need to buy a new charger. Lastly the battery will not last for two days without charging. Unless you don't use it a lot which isn't possible. I recommend getting the phone as a starter budget phone. Then save up for a better phone."
"This phone is terrible. It has literally no redeeming features whatsoever beyond it's price.Phone routinely freezes turning on any app, and there is often an input lag of up to ten seconds when typing. Trying to type additional characters while it is lagging causes the phone to freeze.Do not buy this phone under any circumstances.Whoever was in charge of this at Motorola should be jailed for fraud."
"It works, but it’s not a 5G model. So the seller basically lied in the description. I won’t return it because my wife still likes it, but it is a lie nevertheless."
The phone takes forever to load apps and to browse the internet.  Didn't even had this phone for a year and its already this super slow. My phone has plenty of free storage yet its still so slow.  The worst phone i ever had.
"Update:The issue appears to be specific to Google Play store.  Browsers seem to work fine.  I can use the playstore on the carrier network but not on WiFi which is extremely odd.Previous post:My family have used Motorola Androids for years and have been impressed with their durability and reliability.  We got this for our girls when the battery on their Turbo 2 died.  Unfortunately, we've had nothing but trouble with wifi and downloads failing.  The network management services are awful, very flaky at best.  It is running Android 12 which is newer than anything we'vr used before.  I don't know if it's an issue with the hardware or software, but very disappointed so far."
"According to many expert reviews, this is supposed to be among the top two or three phones in its price range. Unfortunately, the phone we purchased was defective. It immediately dropped every call to other numbers on the shared phone plan.Four local employees from our carrier and the company’s tech support could not solve the problem, even after at least three hard resets and replacing the SIM card. We tried another inexpensive phone from a different company, and it worked perfectly.The phone is also much larger than I expected. I didn’t check the dimensions before I ordered, but I was surprised that it was huge compared to my standard-sized iPhone.Even though I returned the defective phone, I think it deserves two stars. It worked fine for calls to and from numbers outside the shared plan, and the screen was large and bright enough for the visually-impaired person it was bought for. I don’t think the problems we had were typical because the carrier reps had not seen these issues with other phones of the same model."
"Don't bother and look elsewhere. Whatever ""refurbishment"" they're selling is a complete hack job that's incapable of running the software that was designed for the phones to begin with. Basically feels like a scam."
The phone get very very hot I'm scared to plug it up cuz I don't want to burn down my house it's very very hot sometimes it works and sometime it don't
This phone would work fine at home and anywhere you could connect to WiFi. If you were anywhere that WiFi was not available you were left with the ability to make and receive calls only. I like to use my phone to help in navigation when in unfamiliar places or to find the best prices on items when away from home. This phone would not let me make any internet connection through my carrier network. It was pretty much useless when WiFi was not available.
After about 2-3 months the phone will only charge with certain chargers and overall the phone is pretty glitchy but definitely the best phone for the price to me
This is the 2022 model not the 2023 it's missing a few features that the 2023 has like NFC tap to pay and the camera is dual when it should be triple macro settings suck thanx for the false advertisement good back up phone tho.
"The battery drains fast on this phone for me doesn't even last a day.I didn't like the fact I had to use an app to transfer my data from my other phoneI tried taking permissions off, deleting some apps for battery like and like another review, I have 3 to 4 games downloaded daily and not by me"
"Phone barely works for 3 months. Only in this era trying to save money isn't a plausible option when times aren't the best. Faulty hardware or poor technical repair, we can only use our imagination for a result. The reality remains. Money to the trash and a phone that went to sleep, plug to the charger like any other day to never waking up again. We can argue probably that's what they are selling sometimes, a borrow illusion of what you need.Sad times."
This product came defective. I returned the item through USPS. They confirmed it was returned but the saler stated that it wasn't returned and charged me anyway. I would not recommend this at all. Very frustrating experience!
I am 77 and this is my main phone. All I care  about is calling and texting. I do not want gesturing. therefore maybe I should have bought another phone? However I had to buy new phone to ping on towers so this is what I got. Just think it's difficult to learn.
"this is the worst phone made by Motorola i have had, the brand as a whole is great just not this model. I got it to temporarily replace the 5G model and it was a mistake"
"My Moto G Stylus from 2 years ago busted so I thought Itreat myself by upgrading to the newest version but this is truely a terrible phone. You can see all the specs for yourself but looking at the numbers doesn't really mean anything to me so if you're like me take my advice and pass on this purchase. The camera is absolute trash, think the quality of an old flip phone, and the phone itself runs slow right out of the box."
"Literally the only thing I don't like about this phone is it will freeze on you consistently. Simply locking and unlocking it will get it working again but sometimes you cannot hang up a call, while in one app you can't get to the other apps, literally just freezes way too much. The speakerphone volume is pretty low compared to other Motorola phones as well. It would be best to get another option from Motorola because this one really isn't worth the price."
Though the phone is unlocked it is a branded UScellular phone and has their chip installed. If you don't take that chip out your phone will start filling up with all kinds of crapware which you will not be able to delete.
This phone is not compatible with Visible Cell service.  Don't know about the actual functions because I cold not get it to work with visible.  Returned the next day. There should be a way to check the IMEI number before you buy.
"The phone works fine and was a good deal. But while it is indeed unlocked in the sense that it is not bound to one network, on boot up it declares itself in a graphic to be a US Cellular phone. Moreover, lots of garbage apps install and re-install themselves (mostly lame games of some sort).A phone sold as unlocked should arrive clean, without any nonsense like this. Either it is used sold as new and not properly wiped, or they simply don't know what they're selling. Either way, not worth the hassle to send back (my other phone has a cracked screen), so I'll just remember this experience when making future decisions."
"This is physically a very nice phone but the two star review is in regards to the compatibility with networks.  The listing states that this phone is completely unlocked for all carriers, both CDMA and GSM.  However, the phone I received could not be activated on CDMA providers.  I attempted to activate on Total Wireless and was told this phone was not compatible, even though the listing clearly states Total Wireless is a compatible carrier.  Also attempted to activate on Visible, which is a Verizon company and was told again that this phone is not compatible.  Finally able to activate using Tello, which is a GSM provider.  First time I've had this trouble with an unlocked phone purchased from Amazon.  Unsure if this was just a problem with this particular phone or a consistent problem with this model.  Good luck!!"
"I have had this phone only a few days and it hasn't even left my home since I WFH. It's never been dropped, never gotten wet. It has really just sat on my desk and nightstand. The only apps on it are a few common/popular ones (Facebook, Messenger, TikTok, Outlook, Microsoft Teams, and the standard Google apps.) I have only used the charger it came with. Today, while responding to a message, the phone suddenly went black despite the battery being fairly close to full (as it was fully charged last night.) Holding the power button down, or a combo of the volume and power buttons (attempting to reboot in safe mode) has done nothing. After being left alone for a while, holding the power button will make it start to come on (showing the blue Motorola screen) where it stalls and shuts off again. Definitely returning."
I bought this phone and it crashes all the time. If I click the back button it will freeze. When I turn on it won't turn on. I've had it just restart or freeze for ten minutes. This is a common thing for this phone. Oh and if you take a picture you have to wait like 10 seconds for it to capture. And sometimes it doesn't even take the picture. I don't even have that many apps on it. Just basic ones. I've had this phone now for almost a year and I'm buying a new one
"I've had several generations of Motorola (now Lenovo) phones.  This generation has some very bad, very annoying habits:  First, they have a propensity for switching to ""call goes to voicemail"" when you don't want it too.  I keep resetting it, but this continues to happen.  It is almost impossible to use in sunlight -- you have to go into the shade or inside.  The battery seems to last a long time, about 4 or 5 days, and then suddenly - - although it says 15% or more power is left, it dies.  I'm not getting another Lenovo product.  Cheap, but once you've used this product for a while, you'll know why it's cheap."
"The screen kept freezing on me, would even go black randomly and would sit that way for a few minutes until it force restarted itself. Phone is very very slow and very laggy. Front face camera is incredibly disappointing. If you need a phone that barely touches the surface of bare minimum for a phone, this is it. Returned it after like two days of having it. I do not recommend. Two stars because it is a nice looking phone."
Backlight sensor should adjust brightness according to the light but it doesn't do. It dims or brightens up randomly. Do not buy this phone.
"This phone was slow and laggy to begin with, but after updating it to the latest operating system it became nearly unbearable to use.Additionally, almost every app available can no longer be downloaded or updated from the Play Store because this is a 32GB RAM device and Google is now requiring most apps to be 64GB RAM compatible only."
Been a great phone BUT it did a update and the network is not unlocked it is a locked phone.
"I brought this phone for my elderly mother to have something to reach out for help and for communicating with loved ones, but 2 days ago it stopped charging and now I am being told to contact the manufacturer. Do not buy this phone from this listing."
There is intermittent static when talking and echoingIf the battery lasts 1/2 a day you are luckyMotorola used to be a well made product. Now 😞
I bought this phone to use in Nigeria but it doesn’t have SIM card unlocked and can’t be used in Nigeria like the description said
"Do not buy it.. It has been a pain since I got it, and it’s only a week old"
"I bought this phone in March 2024.  Four months later, it is losing it's entire charge in half a day.  It does not seem to matter how heavily I am using the phone, how many apps are open or closed.  It also does not matter if it is used in battery saver mode,  It even discharges when the phone is turned off!"
"Needed cell phone w/ strong Bluetooth ability.  When paired, unit produced extremally poor sound quality.  Rest of phone might be OK but was not tested."
Very slow processor still ok for money
"The memory, the speed in the crowd quality was not what it had said in the previews"
Open box come with no charger+ scratchs
"Let me start off by saying I am a very understanding person, I have waited for quite a while before writing this review. I got this supposedly ""unlocked"" device, turned it on and to my surprise I was greeted with a UScellular pre programmed screen stating the device is financed and locked, that i must sign up to uscellular and prove I can make payments on the device. I contacted uscellular and told them, they instructed me to get in touch with Wireless Experts and have them contact them. I did contact Wireless Experts and they seemed very incoherent on what I was telling them, so granted this may be a mistake, but at the very least contact the uscellular company and get this straightened out instead of ghosting me not answering my message."
Loved it and now I hate it and have to replace it.  It upgraded a few weeks ago and it has gotten to the point where it will not connect to anything anymore or stay connected if it does.  Cannot have a phone that has no connection it is unreal that upgraded and ruined everything.  I used it for 8 months with no problems and now it's unusable.  This is my third Moto I've had connectivity issues with and will not be buying more.
"I really dislike this phone. I have not been well or I would have returned it in time. It freezes up, loses the page you were just on if the phone rings, is impossible to get things done on it and has the stupid moto hub installed on it. Too many ads."
"Purchased due to sudden death of old phone and this one being in stock with a same day delivery for only $10 more from Amazon. This all occurred on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving so it was nice to place the order at 9am and have it in my hands and up and running by 9pm and not even having to leave the house.Great phone, NO, a long ways from it, but will likely repurposed to serve as a backup phone once I buy a better phone in the future. This one is slow and hangs. Not impressed at all, but it works."
"This Moto G was the worst phone I've ever had.  It made me long for the days of flip phones.  It crashed repeatedly (more than 10 times an hour).  I tried resetting to factory settings, removing the apps that came pre-installed, and dancing the hula.  None of these things helped.  The phone is complete junk and so frustrating I sent it back after two days of fighting with it to get it to work.For the record, I am a tech person, so this wan't a lack of skill.  It was a lack of quality of the product.Save yourself some frustration and order a more expensive but better phone."
"I've had several Motorola phones but this is the absolute worst.Adaptive battery destroys all background apps and is not adaptive. Memory management at the Motorola software level is trash, and there is bloatware for days.Honestly considering switching to an iPhone after well over 15 years of anroid."
Okay I bought this phone and I was so excited but I love the color but everybody who I talk to on this phone says that they can't hear me it sounds like I'm underwater this phone sucks I can't get my Google Assistant to work on it maybe something's wrong with the mic I don't know but it sucks
"Keeps glitching when videos play with broken audio and screen freezes cant check emails without it exiting out, buttons glitch the keyboard even after turning off and off reset, no troubleshooting option on here or website  either"
"This was a great phone up until it stopped working with my carrier out of nowhere. I purchased this phone in may of 2023. It was a great phone for the price. Fast forward to 3-09-24 and it completely stopped working unless i was on wifi. I tried everything i could find on youtube to get it fixed, took it in to my phone carrier, they tried a couple things including changing the sim. Nothing would work so I had no choice but to buy a new phone :("
I legitimately got so pissed while dealing with this phone I forgot I wasted my thumb muscles AND $200 and straight broke this thing over my steering wheel. It is absolute trash and I wish to God I could get back the few weeks I wasted trying to get it to work. This has actually turned me off from Motorola forever.
You cannot compare it with the lowest version of iphone. It takes so much time to open text messages.The operating system is very slow. it hangs if you click multiple times on the email or any app.It should be sold for $50 or less. 100$ is not the worth.
Pretty phone but the way it factions terribleNever again
I can't understand why this phone is sold as a Boost Mobile phone yet it doesn't allow you to connect to Boost Mobile's service?
"Shuts itself off, gets stuck on the Motorola start up screen"
"No two day Battery, bologna"
"I purchased this phone 10months ago and had no issues with my provider SIM card installed. Today the phone stopped working and is preventing me from taking calls because it requires a US Cellular SIM card and for 10months I was using my Metro PCS SIM card. I have called this seller so many times and no one answers and there mailbox is forever full I can't leave a message. Please don't waste your time Motorola, Asurion neither your provider can fix this because this seller didn't check to make sure this device was truly unlocked"
I bought my son's last Moto G Pure on Amazon and it was truly unlocked. When it was time to get him a new one I went back to Amazon and ordered one and it was delivered on May 2nd. I used Tello for my carrier and once I had the SIM card put in the phone worked fine for a week and now it's on a lock screen saying US Cellular and we can't get it to do much else. So I'm going to return it and I advise people to avoid this one because it's a hassle and it's not going to work out how you hope it will. I'm upset because I feel like I've been scammed.
"Some colors available say they are ""renewed"", mine allegedly wasn't, but performs like an outdated, years old bogged down phone with full memory. this thing lags scrolling through instagram. on startup, thee is a visible delay on the unlock screen typing in your PIN, it freezes a solid second or so when you hit enter, then brings up your home screen with no icons for a second or two, then starts showing all your apps. Slow garbage."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The battery life is terrible. It does not even last a couple of hours and I don't talk on the phone at all. I've made up on the phone 5 minutes and the last week. And the talk to text does not work at all. The phone is absolutely terrible. And don't buy the song re far p*****I see what I mean, I say one thing and it puts something else. I did not say any of that. It's just don't buy this phone record wrist because it's a piece of trash. Don't buy this phone refurbished."
"Welp, it turns on.It is extremely slow even on full wifi or full service. Everything takes forever to load and often freezes. Phone also over heats pretty quickly during use."
Very slow. Takes forever to boot up or open an app. Choose something else trust me lol.Update 8 months later and this is the worse phone ever. DO NOT RECOMMEND! Works when and if it wants. I always have to restart it. Ughhhhh please choose a different phone!
Literally doesn't work with TMobile. Useless garbage.
Avoid buy from this Seller ...no Invoices ... No answers ... prvious claims regarding devolutions with refund etc ... Avoid ! I bought this product from them and claim near Amazon ...  meanwhile I'm not able to classify the Seller ... also my previous chat with the Seller is missing ... Avoid !
"I made the Amazon order back on December 10, 2024. I received the phone on Thursday, December 12, 2024. When I received the phone, the phone worked fine like normal. By the time I checked out the adapter, the travel adapter was wobbly (which would be a potential fire hazard). I contacted Motorola to see if they will send me a new adapter - but it turns out that the phone is from Motorola. I also called CanadianOutlet1 and they refused to send out a North American motorola adapter. I contacted Amazon and told them that I can't return the adapter but they will return the adapter. I might plan on returning the phone since it is under the refund policy."
"Phone arrived today,  good looking and sturdy very nice. However I specifically wanted fingerprint unlock which it states this phone has, along with face unlock. Not the case, it has number, pattern and face unlock, no fingerprint. Getting sent back tomorrow."
"TL;DR: Doesn't maintain connection to WiFi, actual ""phone"" function would randomly stop working, would freeze during start up, failed to correctly boot and needed a factory reset, not at all water resistant, stylus is very basic and not pressure sensitive, very heavy and bulky for a phone. Battery lasted well, speaker and camera were decent, and had some nice software features.The phone was great, for the first month, until I started to notice particular issues with it. It doesn't maintain a WiFi connection. It'll say that it's connected, but then pages won't load and it'll endlessly be buffering until I turned the WiFi off and suddenly it was a fast as lightning. I own numerous devices that connected to the same WiFi with absolutely no issues, and I even tried using different WiFi hotspots, but always had the same issue. I even tried configuring the phone settings to see if that would help, but it never did.What really bothered me about this phone though, was the fact that after a certain period of time after it was on (I'm not sure exactly how long, but definitely less than 24 hours) suddenly the actual PHONE part of this ""smartphone"" would stop working. It would still be able to use data, and I was able to send /receive messages via social media, but I wouldn't be able to make/receive phone calls or texts. I'd suddenly get a voicemail, while using my phone, stating that I missed a call when it didn't ring. And if I tried to make a call, the call would immediately end without ringing. The only way I figured out to resolve this (even after searching Google for more ways to configure the settings), was to restart the phone.Which brings me to my third issue. A small percentage of the time, it would restart in a normal, timely manner (1-2 minutes), but most of the time it would freeze on the startup screen for at least 5 minutes before finally loading in. Sometimes, if I held the power button and manually turned it off and back on, it would fix it, but not usually.My fourth issue, was that sometimes if I plugged it into the charger, it would suddenly restart. It didn't seem like too much of a big deal at the time, until one of the times that it happened, it froze ENTIRELY on the startup screen. I tried doing what I did previously to hopefully get it to start again, but it continued to freeze. After searching online for answers and trying to troubleshoot it, the only answer I was able to find... Was to manually factory reset it. I would have considered bringing it it somewhere to be looked at by a professional, but I didn't have the time or the money for that, especially since I was not at home and needed the phone ASAP. Doing this was an absolute last resort for me and I was devastated.Finally, what brought about the death of this phone, was that it's definitely not waterproof. I'll admit that this was entirely my fault, but I'd like to mention this as a warning to those who are used to nearly indestructible water resistant phones (like the Samsung Galaxy series). It happened to be on the sink counter beside me while I was brushing my teeth and I accidentally knocked it into the water stream. The charging port ended up frying and it no longer charges. Being that I had so many issues with it though, I'm thankful to have a reason to move on.Also, I'd like to mention that if you're used to responsive pressure sensitive styluses (like the Galaxy Note series), the stylus for this phone is nothing like that. It's exactly like a stylus you'd buy from the dollar store, except it looks nice and fits inside the phone.Another thing I'd like to note, is that this phone is very heavy compared to other phones and kind of bulky. I like to use PopSockets, and I never had issues with them before, but while using this phone I had to replace the base about once a month because it would just start peeling off, due to the weight. I ended up having to super glue it to my phone case, which resolved the issue. It also hurt my hand quite a bit while holding it for any length of time.Despite all of these things, it did have numerous features that I liked, but they were software related, so I imagine they would probably be available on most Motorola phones. The battery also lasted a decent amount of time as well, about a day and a half as long as I didn't do too much gaming. The speaker was also nice and loud, but a little tinny at times. The camera was decent too, and I was able to take some nice pictures with it.The cons definitely outweigh any positives in my opinion. What the point of a smart phone if it doesn't perform as a phone?"
"Small, cheap, but works when you're poor."
"I wanted to come back and update. I did manage to contact the manufacturer about a warrantee claim. The process was relatively simple and smooth. Evidently there was a problem in the software related to how the IMEI number registers with the cell towers. Now I have it back and I noticed something that wasn't very obvious before. I got a different phone and the display of the new phone is quite good. When I put this phone next to it I could tell the display of the moto g is adequate, but not as bright or vivid. Seeing what else is out there in the same price range, I think it's safe to say this phone is a solid 3 stars.This particular model has some reliability issues. It's not the network or the sim card. The phone disconnects from the cellular network and you don't know it on home wifi. You miss calls and can't call or text unless you restart the phone. I have the 2021 version and it has worked great. I used it so much I have to replace the battery. The 2022 version is not worth the aggravation. By the way. I don't know if I've ever written a 1 star review for anything. My phone is still within the warranty period but I can't seem to find a way to contact Motorola for help. If I could actually contact them my rating might have looked different. As it is we may never know."
"I give it a safe 3-star review.  Today, I'm writing on a 2021 5G model, only a year old; this recent 2022 is a 4G only.  Last month, my phone current phone came on with that green droid.  I took it to the Consumer Cellular rep at Target.  Restored after an hour.  Sometimes volume won't reduce and stay on the screen.  Twice, now, it has come on and went out or a couple of panels came on then off.  I had to restart or reboot which took 15-45 minutes before I got it back to normal.  So, I bought the 2022 for $70, ""like new"" from Amazon resale.  It sits on the shelf like a bench player on standby.  Tech ratings were mixed.  Verge gave it a 7/10; Android Authority, a 6/10, and Tom's Guide a low 3/5, much disliked by the author.  The Consumer Reports article was favorable.  That confirmed my selection."
"I dropped my phone and broke the screen. So I ordered one from here. I like the phone. BUT, I had to order a sim card from StraightTalk. I have never purcchased a phone that did not have a Sim card included with the phone. So disappointed. 5 more days without a phone. My fault ?"
"The only positive about this phone in my opinion is the price, I got it for about $125.  The phone has Android 12 which for my purposes makes it pretty much unusable.  I have many apps that I use that require root access to the microSD card and Google decided you shouldn't have root access to it.  Many of the Google apps have depreciated to the point of my not being able to use them,  the Calendar App, the Messages App (which I can't use anymore, they made it take colors from your wallpaper instead of letting you choose from a variety of colors, I'm color blind and can't read the texts because I can't use colors I'm able to read. I can't set default apps to open certain files which means I have to choose the app every time I open the file.  Honestly, if I hadn't spent so much time TRYING to get this phone usable I would send it back.  I'll end up using it as a music player for working out.  Honestly, this phone and Google's choices (because after all, they know what's best for you) have made me want to give up having a cell phone entirely, I'm spending the money, I'd like to be able to use it.  The phone is also ""laggy"" sometimes freezing up or taking too long to respond.  I have the Moto G Stylus 2020 and the battery is not holding a charge all day anymore, that's why I got a new phone.  I miss being able to replace my battery too, used to be simple to open the case put a battery in and the phone would last me forever, I have 5 working phones here that just need batteries. Let's create more electronic junk that a simple battery replacement would fix, I don't care if the phone is waterproof, I don't swim with it.  So I guess I'll go back to 2020 model and have the phone die before the day is through.  Most of my complaints are about Android 12 so I guess I won't be getting another phone, things that were simple in Android 10 and 11 are now near impossible to do.  Thanks Google for always knowing what's best for everyone even if we don't realize it."
Not impressed with the lack of battery power!
Battery last.uses alot of data.
Serves as a communications device. Has good storage. Below average speed. Has 4 cameras and none of them are any good.
"I purchased two of these phones for my son's, they loved them so I purchased one for myself after I broke my moto edge. It keeps having issues with Bluetooth connectivity and keeps saying no service when I have bars and Internet connection. Wifi connection and still have to reset phone. So disappointed for sure."
"So I needed a new phone and I didn't want to pay a lot and went with this one, now I don't have a lot of pictures and games like that but man this phone sometimes is really really slow, I've never had a phone that took as long as this one does to start up, it works but I'll look into a different brand next time."
"It's a pretty good phone overall. The second day I had it, I looked down and the screen looked like a black and white broken TV screen. I was terrified! I restarted, and it went away. It's happened about 12 times. It goes away after a few seconds. I'm worried about the day it won't go away though. I'm praying that won't happen though."
"They're only occasional restarts.. so far. Looking into the issue I notice it doesn't seem uncommon with this phone, even the 2023 model.Otherwise it seems like a good phone at a good price. Random restarts are unacceptable though."
Every day I have had phone calls nobody can hear me unless I put myself on speaker phone.
Phone overheats very quickly.  Requires you to turn off multiple times per day.
I had this model and it got crushed and I really liked the phone so I just another one.  The previous phone had a great battery but this one doesn't seem to hold a charge for as long and it also charges more slowly. I still like Motorola phones but I'm not thrilled with this one.
My husband only uses it for calling me. I wouldn’t recommend this phone.I would have returned it but needed a way for him to reach me since he is handicapped!
"Just received and update it and over heat it and died .Wait few minutes later started.Second time same day same problem ,turned off and sticker in Moto screen for minutes ….I’m using a TCL phone and no problem.Bought this to connect it with Visible.Yes,confirm Visible by Verizon works ."
Items had dirt prints on it and the boxes were scratched. Am afraid it may not be new.
"While it did come new and looks nice, the phone speed to process inputs and apps is a joke. While this is an inexpensive phone, it is still $100 overpriced based on the speed. It also constantly needs updates on the 1st few days. My game systems over the last 5 years collectively needed less updates than this seems to in the 1st weekIf you want a cheap phone, buy a cheaper no name product"
"It was fully charged before I started setup and transferring everything over. And in less than 20 minutes, I have 95% battery life and it says 23 hours 2 minutes left.I barely turned this thing on and I can tell you, with my remedial math skills, THIS IS NOT 2-DAY BATTERY LIFE.Not even one day with this phone and I am already disappointed.The only reason I needed a new phone is because my battery was going way too quickly and was having a hard time charging, my 2+ year old previous phone.Oh, and for the life of me, I can't figure out how to change the time zone. Instead it just adds another time to the list instead of changing it. Now I have to google. It should be intuitive."
"I was a galaxy fold user. Which was a mistake. I bought this phone to replace and run out contract on the fold. This phone now consistently disconnected the SIM. The phone has been protected with a case and has had no liquid submersions. Out of nowhere it started doing a SIM disconnect. I went to the aty store, got a new SIM. Worked for 3 hours, disconnected again. It's a phone problem and the phone is crap. Do not recommend."
I like the phone but the stylus is trash. Broke within a week and now will not pop in and out like it is supposed to.
"I bought this phone because my old Samsung of 6 years has been slowly dying. When researching this phone I read mixed reviews. Going in I knew this would be a cheeper quality than I'm used to but it shouldn't be that bad. For me I exclusively use the NFC touch to pay option and according to different sources this year model should have NFC, yet this device doesn't. Another feature that it doesn't have is wireless charging, I was aware of this and was planning on getting an adapter so it wasn't the end of the world. The stylus is cheeply made but it is functional to take notes and doodle with. The battery definitely doesn't last 2 days it barely lasted 4 hours before it was at 50%. Apparently the default for screen being open is 10 min (that could have been user error). It's also surprisingly heavy. It's not the phone for me"
"This particular model randomly reboots (whether you're in a call or it's just sitting in your pocket) over and over again until you shut off the power. I reserached it and there are other owners having the same problen, which means Motorola is aware of it. I've reported the incident and have been sent a different phone on three occassions (4 total), which means 4 totally separate phones have had the sane exact issue. I want my money back foe new model; however, Motorola doesn't want to stand behind their products."
A few times lines have showed up on my phone. It takes a few for it to go away.
I really really wanted to like this phone.Great size. Ease of use. But......If you are a power user. Or a fast typer. This isn't for you. It lags at the simplest tasks and it just can't keep up. Which is sad. Games lag and what not.Beautiful phone. Just way too slow.
Adam this is the third time sitting my phone back but I like it so much to get a new one something's always going wrong with it
"I had the same model phone a couple years older than this one & it was a great phone. I lost it & bought the 2022 model instead of 2023. This phone (2022model) is horrible. It lags, glitches,battery is supposed to last 3 days it barely lasts a day.  The camera quality isn't what it's supposed to be either. I should of sent it back. Because my 1st moto stylus was a good phone I thought this one would follow suite. The price was right for me but this phone didn't hold up next to it's older brother. I've had it 4 months & will get a better phone soon as I can. I don't recommend this phone at all. It's a piece of junk."
"I'm disappointed with my Moto I previously had a moto power 2021 model it I dropped it and cracked the screen real bad and finally got a new phone the Moto stylist that I have is slow the touch screen is responsive as I was used to and I'm just really not pleased with it but it's too late to return it so I'm stuck with it, camera and flashlight quit working and it's SLOW AS HELL"
Stylus was missing.
"I can't describe how much I don't like this phone. My Samsung Note 9 was having issues so I got this as a temporary replacement and it's awful. Apps freeze, the way photos are stored is ridiculous... There's no image gallery, you have to go into the files file which is linked somewhere I don't even know. The autocorrect is terrible. The phone is just lacking in so many ways. It'll get me through while I decide what real phone to get, but I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone."
"The phone worked well for a few months then it started freezing once in a while. It now freezes all the time, shuts off, disabled apps when using, etc..  I am not happy with this phone."
"ive had this phone less than a year and ive had more issues than any other phone.vdoesnt stay connected to wifi, mobile data etc. Now it it wont start. it died i put it on the charger let it charge, itll get to the motot screen but wont finish loading. Almost $200 for a phone that i have to replace in under a year. this is damn ridiculous. moto used to have actually good quality phones. the phone not working gets in the way of me handling business."
"I tried entering text into google Docs with the phone held upright. The keyboard did not appear (a blank space did open up. I played with settings, googled for tips, etc. Finally contacted Motorola support via chat on Messenger. Chatbot gave me a link to a keyboard topic that didn't work. I finally got in touch with an agent. She asked what the problen was. I told her (politely!) and waited for over 20 minutes with no response of any kind from the other end. I've wasted too much tine on this, so the phone will have to go back."
"I got a phone that was already hooked up to someone else account! Not only that it is not compatible toMy Metro according to ""metro themselves"" even though they are compatible with T  Mobile devices, because I had such a headache with this whole experience I would never do this again. Happy Shopping 🛍"
"Settings change daily no matter my preferences, phone screen lock appears randomly mid app use and battery has not held charge for 2d no matter usage. Also, phone is filled with unsolicited n unwanted apps and some I can't even get rid of, perhaps, they're the ones that drain the battery on a regular basis."
This phone is slow but that is not the deal breaker. My major problem with it is that the volume is stuck on max. I try to decrease the volume but it jumps back up to max. It also intermittently shows the volume control on the right side of the screen. I cannot remove it and it obstructs the screen. Restarting the phone temporarily helps the obstructing volume control but not the lack of volume control.
"I've never had a phone that was more useless. Despite having a feature to run more than one app, this phone doesn't even have the capability to run one well. I will never buy a Motorola again."
"Absolutely headache making! When listening to music it closes the app and I have to reload the music in which closes the app you were using and then you have to reload the other app as well. What phone, other than this, can't have multiple apps running at the same time! You can get a much better phone for less at any store that sells disposable phones!!"
"This phone has started shutting itself off and restarting itself in a constant loop. The only way to stop it is to manually shut it down quickly after it starts, then wait a few minutes to turn it back on. It will do this at random times, when I am driving or whenever, and I don't notice that my phone is off and not functioning, but still using power. Very inconvenient, but also potentially very bad for me when I need my phone right away and can't get it to stop restarting itself. Very disappointed that it's after the return window and there is nothing I can do about it."
Phone was in perfect condition and came with a charger. However as soon as I noticed there was no Sim tray I started a return. Hate to only give two stars but the phone is useless without the tray.
"Don't buy this phone. Horrible experience,  no connectivity,  slow, doesn't ring when it should. Complete utter garbage. I purchased 3 of these. They are so bad my refund was less than $20 on the ones i didnt destroy by submersion or boom stick. Thats how bad these phones are.What an enraging product."
"I am sorry to say, the battery is over heating, it lags, the BATTERY LAST MAYBE ONE DAY.  I WONDER IF I VAN SEND IT BACK... I GUESS SAMSUNG HERE I COME. THIS MAKES ME SAD."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It lasted one week then it shut off and never turned back on, I have zero clue why this happened I did not wet or drop it. The battery life is no good also kind of slow for the money I would save it and invest in a better one."
"I purchased this phone in December and it's already junk. Finger print reader randomly doesn't work.  Charge port has to be just right or it won't change. Will randomly get stuck in a rebooting loop until I force it to shutdown. I've had good luck with other Motorola phones  in the past, bit this thing is a turd."
Bought the Motorola Moto stylus on Jan 1st 2024. From Joygood cr. 6 months later it starts shutting itself down then back on multiple times in a row. Won't let me sign in to emails. running very slow it's just a piece of junk the seller wouldn't work with me so I won't buy from them again.
Great phone until screen issues keeps coming up. It keeps blacking out and not letting me use it. I have to power off fully to make it work again.
"I purchased this phone less than two months ago. Unfortunately, it accidentally fell from a height of about one foot to the road curbside one day, resulting in a cracked screen. Despite being within the warranty period, when I contacted Motorola customer service, they informed me that the warranty does not cover physical damage. To repair the screen, they quoted a cost of $149, which exceeds the amount I initially paid for the phone. I recall Motorola being known for producing robust and sturdy products in the past, but this phone screen seems excessively fragile. I don't think I will buy Motorola products in the future."
Like the other phone I returned and have not seen refund for this phone also has glitches the screen messed up from time to time but I'm not returning it because I have not seen refund from last return they got me for my money and the phone what a ripoff
"While this Moto g stylus does work on Consumer Cellular, WiFi calling is not an option with this phone. If you don't have a strong cellular signal from Consumer Cellular and depend on wifi calling, keep shopping."
"Device stopped taking pin so it was factory reset. Unable to use device ever again as it wont let me finish the reset without the pin. Total waste of money. Remember, you don't own your phone, google does. Don't buy a motorola, blu, or samsung. DO NOT BUY."
This particular phone I recently bought is starting to overheat at the  fingerprint sensor /power button for some reason! It won't let me access any apps that require fingerprint verification! It's so frustrating!
This phone has a mind of its own and other times has no mind at all! It does not do what it is supposed to and does things that it's not supposed to! Far too much to list. I do not recommend this at all!! 🤔😕
"Laggy, disconnects from wifi randomly, apps crash constantly, speeds are slow regardless of wifi or LTE network, randomly updates and wipes alarms in middle of the night, this is third time I've written this review due to Amazon app crashing. Battery lasts a while though"
I have been  having trouble with this phone. A bunch of lines come flashing up across it and I have to shut it off and then turn it back on. And then sometimes it freezes after I turn it back on
"This phone has been a disappointment. Reviews were good, particularly for the camera, so we chose it, but it takes forever to do just about anything, including take photos."
Nice size big phone but it doesn't work properly. It malfunctions all the time and the battery doesn't last long at all. It could be I received a bad phone. And I didn't put insurance on it 😕 so my loss
"Bought for the battery but it doesn't last 2 days. I use ""battery saver"" and maybe 2 days. But even light usage, drains it kinda quick. Even with brightness dimmed.Flashlight works good with the shake to turn on/off. Only compliment."
The operating system clearly says this is a 2021. Thats a pretty big lie. The phone is meh at best but being lied to in the description is unforgivable.
The phone constantly glitches and refuses to make or receive phone calls.  Text messages won't go through.  This happens in areas with plenty of signal.  Phone has to be restarted when the problem is noticed but LOTS of calls and messages have been missed.  Terrible for business.
"Phone stopped working after 3 months, warrenty expired. Not buying again"
It's your typical android but it runs at a snail's pace.  Boot times can be over ten minutes at times and it's been this way since I took it out of the box.  Only buy if you're ok with the stylus coming at the cost of very poor performance.
"After a month using this phone, I gave up on it and went back to my old phone, a Xiaomi. This Motorola phone tends to drop the wi-fi internet connection. In addition, it may not even find your wi-fi connection, ie the site does not even appear in the wi-fi list. I do not recommend this phone. Motorola gives ""solutions"" for dealing with this problem going back years. I want a phone that works, not one that I fiddle around with constantly trying to get it to work."
"The phone came as described "" unlocked for Xfinity"", went to Xfinity to set-up phone change sim card, was told only Motorola phones that I could use is ""a Motorola phone bought from Xfinity"". I'm not sure if this is a scam by seller or Xfinity. Proceed with caution!"
"I was handing my phone down to my son so decided to just get me a phone. Bought this junk and surely wish I wouldn't have wasted a penny on it!Is soooo slow, most of the time the photos are CRAP, now it's doing this stupid shut off thing where I can barely even use it now.. and of course after my return time all this started..Do not waste your money!"
Of course! 8 days after my 30day return window closed. The speaker stopped working. The phone has been very laggy as well. Even more so when the battery is low. I have to use Bluetooth to talk or put it on speaker phone.... SMH...
Not only have I had problems with this phone and the replacement phone.  No words ... They want me to pay a $25 restocking fee??? I littleraly have no money. I feel like I've been scammed. I've never had a worse phone in my life. I can't afford to be without a phone for the time they refund and for me to purchase another phone. I'm done with Amazon.
This is the worst phone I have ever bought!!!! I have purchased several Motorola phones throughout the years and this has to be the worst one that Motorola has ever put out they have replaced his wife and I Am not going you except the third 1 from Motorola so I returned Amazon for a refund To be honest with you I would not rate it  Is a one
Phone arrived riddled with greasy fingerprints with a dead battery and upon charging it for an hour I discovered that the phone was locked anyway. If you want to burn 130 bucks with fewer headaches I recommend going anywhere else.
"I have broken the stylus twice INSIDE the phone.  The stylus is very frail.  I was able to get the broken piece out once, but this second time I am simply disgusted to have to go to the trouble again.  I didn't want a new phone and to go through the process of transferring my info but I will have to get some other phone."
THIS PHONE IS A PIECE OF CRAP!!! The first one I got worked the first day then turned off and would not turn back one luckily i could return it well not really that lucky because the second one broke as well the screen changed colors where the stylus goes in and then would do whatever it wanted and eventually went black and now wont do anything this was with in two months of having the stupid thing.
The media could not be loaded.
Bought this for my teen 4 Xmas. Setting up was easy. Worked good for about 2 or 3 weeks but now only allows calls to come in n out sometimes. Can't figure out why. Spent $100 for a phone that isn't even reliable.  Should have known better. Unsatisfied...
"So slow to unlock, open, switch apps, get camera/video ready that it's almost unusable. Buggy; crashes and loops on the unlock screen a few times a day, even when I'm in the middle of using it. This phone borders on being unmerchantable.  Shame on you, Motorola."
"Bought this and regret it. It's a weird phone with quirks. Screen turns off and on randomly, you have to unlock it to have it connected to Android auto. Can't double click power for the camera. I can't recommend it. Id recommend getting a Samsung over this."
"I bought this phone and it is very bad. When I called customer service, they were rude and unhelpful. The phone gets very hot and I can't hear well."
Don't waste your money on buying this phone the volume control button is out of control it turns up and down the volume by itself most of the apps doesn't work on this phone and the speaker is very low
"Screen constantly locks up, requiring a hard reboot which usually takes multiple attempts, freezing repeatedly for several minutes before it'll boot up again.When operating normally it's a little laggy sometimes, but it's extremely laggy when playing video."
The pen in this phone is known to get stuck in the phone. There are many many cases of this all over the internet. My pen worked for all of 3 days before getting stuck and not coming out. There is nothing to do except mail the phone back. An absolute waste of time for a known defect. Disgusting! Avoid this phone
"Have to reset phone daily otherwise phone calls are dropped all the time, pure garbage vs Mint mobile being garbage, not sure why they're not compatible."
Dropped off lap less then four o ground screen shattered it was in a case ther isn't a good reason for the damage
This item was not a good cell phone. It is not capable of upgrading to the latest android operating system. Shame on Motorola for making a descent cell phone but limiting it's capabilities.
"Every since activating this phone I have run into problems with unwanted ads, and difficulties with my streaming devices connected to it! Do not purchase from this link! Find another one elsewhere!"
the motorola cell phones are junk
