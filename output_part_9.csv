Very short battery life!! It would be great if you could adjust the lens like binoculars can
The package was damaged but the product is good
He found it difficult to use.  We decided to return it.
Amazing.. but went from 5 to 3 stars.They are bragging about big screens for movies but don't provide  a USB otg Media Player. Smh the files folder should just read USB otg !
Gives you good feeling while using it. But the problems start as soon as you take it off. Could make you Feel headache and eye strain for some moment. Those who have brain issues or eye problems should avoid using meta quest.
Didn’t come with charger
"Ordered two of these on Black Friday. I gave the first one to my brother as an early gift to replace his old Quest 2. Visually a nice upgrade, but the sound quality was really bad. Any time a low rumbling sound or any bass was played in any game, the speakers would crackle, pop, and produce a lot of static, as if they were not connected properly or used very low quality components. No volume change or any other setting change could mitigate the problem. (Think of the worst, lowest quality speakers or headphones you've ever used trying to play any sound.)We tried factory resetting it, consulted with repair technicians online, and ultimately we're returning it for a replacement.No problem, right? These things happen, and Amazon was good about the replacement order. In the mean time the second one we ordered was there and wasn't going to be gifted until later, so we tried that one.Exact. Same. Problem.Whoever was handling quality control for Meta as they rushed to get these things out in time for the sale must have been asleep that day. So now I'm going to have to replace the second unit, and hope the third and fourth that arrive don't also have the same problem.I'll update this review when the replacements arrive, but be aware when you're buying these things.UPDATE: Two replacements arrived. One has the same problem, and the second is even worse. The right speaker produces almost nothing but static.  I suggest waiting for Meta to get a handle on their QC before purchasing. These are supposed to be the same parts from their other models, tried and tested. Obviously one of their suppliers or manufacturers is cutting corners for whatever batch is in my nearest Amazon warehouse.Incredibly disappointed."
"Before my review this is what you should go away with.DO NOT BUY and if you did buy it, GET YOUR MONEY BACK.If you have the quest 2 and don’t want to upgrade to the 3, then don’t get the 3S.  if you do want to upgrade, just spend the $200 difference.  you get far more storage, better lenses, and better electronics.The meta quest 3s is all of the worst qualities of the quest 2 but at least the quest 2 can track track your hands better. the only thing the 3s has going for it is color pass through.  it is over priced when compared to the quest 3.  It doesn’t have headphone jack, and it can’t adjust exactly to your eyes.  Yes, many of these problems comes with the quest 2 but having a quest 2, 3, and 3S i can say that the 3S is actually lower quality to the quest 2.  the frame rate for the one I bought is also slower for some reason.I also bought quest pro controllers ($200+) to give me a more immersive VR experience.  turns out that the quest 3s is the only quest that doesn’t support these controllers. both the quest 3 and quest 2 can support.  It is painfully obvious that meta put out the cheapest headset and priced it equal to the 3 (if comparing storage space prices) just to upsell people to the 3."
"I don’t know if it’s just a band unit but whenever I try to play most games, there’s weird massive black lines that go all around the screen and glitch out everything. The only thing I haven’t experienced this in is thrill of the fight. The battery life is solid atleast"
"Meta Quest 3S product page advertises that you'll get Batman: Arkham Shadow game, and a 3-month trial of Meta Quest with purchase. It's a false claim. What it should say is:""Sign up for 3-month Meta Quest trial and access many games, like Batman: Arkham Shadow, but lose access if you don't start paying monthly for Meta Quest subscription""It's false advertising to highlight the Batman game so significantly as coming with Meta Quest 3S, then go on to say you get the game *AND* a 3-month trial of Meta Quest. There's no *AND*. It isn't two separate things, or even one thing *with purchase*. It's just an ad trying to interest you in paying monthly for a game subscription service.Buy the Meta Quest 3s from wherever it's cheapest. DO NOT even consider the supposed game offer and huge Batman visuals on the product page as being a real benefit of purchasing from Amazon. Plus, when you get the headsets, there is no information at all included regarding how to get the Batman game so gloriously highlighted on the Amazon product page."
"It constantly loses tracking and clips from the game I'm playing to my room as if it's bit registering anything. The lighting in my room isn't the best, but my quest 1 had no issues. This is supposed to be superior. I shouldn't have this issue. It's ruining the immersion"
"I've had nothing but trouble setting up this headset. The first issue I had was during the software update, it would update then restart the unit in a never ending loop. I reset the unit and that didn't help, all I could do was shut the headset off. I was finally able to get by this by using my phone as a Hotspot during setup. Second problem is they force you to download  the meta app and pair the headset to it during setup. The app isn't showing my unit in the menu to pair to, they have a code that you can enter to get past this, well the app won't let me continue to the point that I can enter the code. At this point all I have is an expensive paperweight. Absolutely frustrating, I can't believe that a company would release a product with this many major issues. Buyer beware!"
Not sure what to do.There's a hole in the package.I don't want to open it cause its a christmas present.
"I ended up cutting my losses and returning this. Primarily, even *hardwired* with a link cable, the picture would artifact so much, that the picture looked like when YouTube throttles a video down to 240p.That is, *if* you can get a game to function in VR. And on the off chance that you do, expect the game not to work the next few times. I'm not sure why it's a roll of the dice, but maybe, that's because VR is just not ready for prime time.TL;DR For ~$100, this is a bargain. For $300+? This is a ripoff. Save your money."
Dont working with mac
Too tight on the head
I really need to contact the company. Surely there’s a mediator that scares the background. I had an awful experience very upsetting. I was in aI really need to contact the company. Surely there’s a mediator that scores the background. I had a awful experience very upsetting. I was in a world and stationary minding my own business. The five-year-old kid in the background was so annoying and accompanied by a very worrisome stalker I can’t even feel safe in a virtual world. This thing scares me. The company needs to be aware.
"Pre-ordered. Recieved and we all had a blast. After 2 weeks, it had a software glitch losing tacking of the controllers. Customer support was great and sent a new unit (after receiving the original). 2 weeks after receipt of the new unit, the same issues arose and it is bricked again. Customer support is saying they are expediting our issue, and will update review based on their response. Purchase only if you like texting with customer service every 2 weeks for a dead unit."
"I didn't get around to playing it when it first arrive for a while unfortunately. However, I have tried a few times now and everytime it makes me so very very nauseous. It's now going to be  a $350 piece of junk.I tried a few other things than arkham shadow, but the game itself is so dark and hard to see with weird turning motions that after half an hour I'm struggling to not go to bed."
"Product is awesome, absolutly love the headset and have no problems with it. I would reccomend the headset. The credit deal for black friday led to me having to spend an hour and a half with support trying to get my credit. After it was received I learned the credit can only be used for products sold by Amazon and shipped by Amazon. Which limits what you can buy. That combined is the reason for the 1 star."
"I was so excited to order this unit for my 14-year-old child's birthday gift.We opened the box with excitement, but after a software update, the device won't turn on anymore. It's our first purchase of a VR headset, and we're met with such disappointment. I read reviews on resetting the device and tried to do so, but I was met with negative results."
The controllers only worked sometimes so I returned it.  I guess I will buy another and hope the controllers work this time.  Some people say you can not put a credit card through for the apps on mega quest 3?  I hope i do not have this problem
Bought Black Friday with a 75$ dollar credit. Email says to use on anything sold and shipped by Amazon.  then when I try to use the credit they say it has to be digital purchase only. Wtf am I gonna watch 75$ movies
"This is supposed to be a gift, when i picked up the pkg from my door where it was dropped off the tape was ripped opened. Hopefully it is the item I ordered. Stay tuned for further development."
I would give this product 4 stars if I received Batman but I didn’t. I bought 2 VR headsets and I received The Batman game on 1 headset for free but the other headset has to pay $50 for the Batman game.
The quality of this device is too low. Too blurry. Will return after one day! I tried all tactics to improve . Nothing helped! Vision Pro has a very good quality when I tried! I rather spend that money than this piece of trash !
Didn't even get to use because it wouldn't finish updating when I was setting it up for the first time.  Just says applying update and then restarts back to the applying update screen and repeats. Did this for about 2 hours.
I ordered the Meta quest oculus 3s with $100 gift card from Amazon and never received the gift card pulse this battery life is so short! Feel like I got ripped off!
"there are a lot of buttons on the display, I set it up while I was looking for games, I'm already tired of it, I think it’s not a finished product yet"
"Jeez, for this price, I get to wear a heavy thing on my head and roam around rendered worlds that look clumsy and dumb. I got it for ""adult viewing"" but can't find anything worthwhile to view. Shoulda done more research. If anyone wants to buy a barely touched unit, DM me!"
Enjoy a movie for 30 minutes and charge it for 2 hours I just returned mine it broke after using it 5 times less then 2 week old
I couldn’t even update the headset right out of the box because it got stuck in a never ending loop of applying software updates and then restarting.
"The video quality is horrible even with good wifi, when connecting to a computer. Also, the battery lasts nothing. This is not at all what was expected"
"Cannot link payment on the meta app, can't purchase anything and I found this is happened to many buyers.  Dud...Meta, do better.  I wouldn't buy again, if you can't download and buy a game, what good is it?  Can only play the freebies."
Have gun buying it locked and trying to unlock it. Customer support chat is a joke. I will never buy from this company again.
For an expensive item one would think packaging would be better. Hope i dont have a disappointed kid on Christmas.
Just got it. It's already bricked. Doesn't do anything at all. Just spins and spins and spins. Complete junk
"Definitely wasn't worth $300, I would recommend you getting different vr instead of Meta Quest brand"
No Batman Arkham. Did not come with the free trial. It was for my Sons birthday and even though it arrived on time they were disappointed.
It doesn't turn on
The comfort with glasses just isn't there. Than I was always having trouble making the controllers curses show up.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Stripes appears on the screen. My oculus is brand new....
"I bought a headset & a extra set of backup controllers. First 4 months was great then the issues with the controllers began. In a period of 3 years I went through 5 sets of controllers due to issues with the joystick. I got Meta to replace a couple but gave up after that. Really disappointed with all the joystick issues. As far as the battery, I originally had 2hrs of play time now after 3 years the battery lasts 45min maybe an hour. I also purchased a back up battery which normally lasted 2 hrs. It's now gone in 20-30min. So I went from 4hrs of play time to crossing my finger to getting maybe an hour before needing to recharge. As a huge gammer this is very disappointing especially for the price. Graphics wise and the amount of games you can play is awesome but would love to see them get better quality controllers & batteries in the future."
"I received this as an early Christmas gift but unfortunately had to return it after trying for 2 days. After much effort in adjusting the lenses, I was never able to get it into focus. It works similarly to progressive prescriptions glasses where you have a very small focus area. If you move your eyes instead of your head, the scenery will be blurry (at least for me). I also felt motion sickness, nausea followed by headaches after using it for 20 min. Not for me."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                We have another Oculus headset, so my kids are having a lot of fun playing games together. I'm the video my daughter's playing ping pong with her brother who's in the next room!They're having trouble with over of the joysticks though. The left hand joystick controller keeps sticking, they try to reevaluate it, but it keeps glitching on them, like maybe a website in it isn't connected properly."
Don’t you think it’s funny you can’t buy a new meta 3?But you CAN buy a new 3s and it’s cheaper with more add ons.So why would an upgrade be cheaper? Read some of the reviews (negative)….it’s a downgrade! And they removed the standard option so you can ONLY BUY THE DOWNGRADEBtw the 3s and 3 have same memory but the 3s DOES NOT have headphone Jack3s IS NOT compatible with pro control (why?)So the 3s does less and doesn’t use stuff you already bough and your being ushered right to buying it.No.
It did arrive on time for my granddaughter birthday.  I can’t take it back because now to late. The control buttons don’t work and hard to use.  She didn’t want to tell me because she knew it was expensive and didn’t way to hurt my feelings.
"Compared to my 3, the trade-off and sacrifice made to get this product made at a lower cost isn't worth it.My eyes hurt minutes after putting this on due to the limited IPD adjustment and cheap fresnel lenses that have an extremely small area of sharpness."
"Cheaply made, with numerous bugs in the software and poor image quality. Avoid this junk at all costs."
"Used it for few minutes, was abot to vomit. It gives a bad headache.Head is 'spinning after that'.Otherwise colors and image clarity is great.EDIT: It's causing brain fog, and hard concentration after few hours of usage, that lasts days. Also highly addictive.It's akin to heroin, that initially was sold freely in pharmacies, then banned.Dont waste your health, and also money."
"This review is for those who do not yet own a VR headset and are thinking about this for their entree into that technology with the lower-priced 3s. That describes me. This was my first VR headset, and I'm not a gamer. Having tried VR in a public venue a few times and been very impressed, I was excited to see what it would be like at home.First off, it is very easy to set up, and they really use the VR technology to make the introduction to the device easy and fun. It really did just work right out of the box, and all I had to do was connect it to WiFi and take a few tutorials and off I went. After some adjustment with the lenses and headset, I managed to get it fitting and looking good enough. I was pretty impressed that it could recognize my hands and mostly individual fingers, and it knew where the controllers were. It's integration with the real world surroundings is quite impressive. I was off to a promising start. (Yet while the field of vision is much grander than even the widest desktop monitor, it's still fairly narrow compared to natural field of vision, so the immersive effect isn't nearly what it would be if you couldn't constantly see the black edges and the light coming up from where your nose sits.)This is where things turned. Despite their efforts to make it easy and simple, you really are operating an entire PC, with menus and browsers and lists of apps... but it's not EXACTLY like a PC - just different enough to be confounding over and over. The two controllers each have three buttons, a joystick, and two triggers, for a total of 12 controls to understand, all by touch, as you usually can't see them. And no, the left and right controller buttons are not mirrors of each other, and no, not every app uses them the same way. Very soon I found myself, when the button I thought turned out to be the wrong one, to just start pushing buttons until something happened. And sometimes even then nothing would happen. And this was usually because, in addition to the controllers themselves, you can also control the device with just your own hands, and put the controllers down entirely. This was also kind of magical at first, and I enjoyed it tremendously. Two simple white spots represent where your fingers point, and they are amazingly responsive and accurate. Kind of creepy but so cool. But I quickly learned it's TOO sensitive. Using your finger to tap on a Close button always takes 3-4 annoying tries. An it's almost impossible to type, (for entering passwords or search terms, for example) despite there being a virtual keyboard designed for that. I push on keys and nothing happens, then I accidentally somehow push the wrong key, then have to go back-back-back and try again, except that my finger doesn't reliably connect even with the back button.... argghh. And again, not every app uses your fingers the same way or at all. I gave up on using my hands as controllers pretty quickly and went back to the controllers. Except sometimes it would forget I was using controllers and would pick up on my fingers instead and just show me the two white spots. Argghh.Anyway, throughout my experience with the device, I was always struggling with that. So just assume that frustration was a constant as you read on.As for the content, as you might suspect, there is very little content that is truly free. At least not that's going to hold anyone's interest for very long. Most apps or downloadable content packs that come with apps cost anywhere from $10-40 dollars. Many don't even have a demo. So for a new user, having just shelled out $300 for the headset, discovering then that most content costs even more -- well I felt shafted immediately. And like so many phone apps, those advertised as free usually want you to buy anything above essentially demo content. Really owning and using the thing promises to be an extremely expensive endeavor.Also, despite the advertising, and the possibilities inherent in the technology, most content is your basic teen gamer junk, albeit spruced up with the immersive 3D VR experience. So it's really just better versions of video games. If you're not a gamer, there's not a lot for you. I was expecting a lot more immersive travel, history, exploration, and fiction. But there just isn't a ton of it, especially not unless you're willing to shell out money for any of it. It felt like attending a 3D movie where the filmmakers add visuals in there JUST BECAUSE it's in 3D. Once the novelty wears off, what's left?The device itself is still rather heavy and unwieldy, and any significant motion you make requires you to readjust it on your head every so often. It's perfectly comfortable, and easy to get right, but it's still pretty bulky and unnatural. I saw ads for lots of exercise apps (all incurring extra costs), but I can't imagine being able to move very freely with this thing on my head. And while many apps make adjustments for you if you are lying down or sitting up, many do not. If you plan to use it lying down, plan on having to regularly lift your head up to a vertical position just to see what's going on.Here are some apps I tried:FLOAT VR - This is an ""experience"" wherein you sit back and let randomly generated doodads (planets, walls, auras, flying creatures, and splatters of random debris) slowly float by you while new age synth music plays. It's kind of fun for a while, and I love the concept. The graphics are quite computer-y and simplistic though, and there is no texture to them, so there is no way anyone can truly be ""taken away"" by it - it's simply too obvious what it really is. So I found myself not being able to get into into, feeling like I was living in a universe populated entirely by 20-year-old lifeless computer graphics.PRIME VIDEO - A lot of confusion here because of the above mentioned controller troubles, but once I got the hang of it, it was a nice experience exactly like my Fire TV. And I really did enjoy lying in bed on my back and watching a movie on the headset. But the battery life is only about 2 hours. Enough for a single movie IF the thing is completely charged when you start and IF the movie is under 2 hours, and IF it's the only thing you use it for. That's a lot of IFs. And while it's pretty nice, it's not a significant improvement from just watching on my TV. Cool, not really worth it.TRIP TO VR - A travel app with a few dozen short travelogues from around the world. Only one of them is free. The rest are 1.99 each. Having watched the free one, (Venice), it was pretty great, but there's no ""exploration"". You are stationery while a narrator explains a building to you. Nothing to do, and it's only about 10 minutes. Fun as it was, it's not all that, and at that price I could blow a couple hours looking at static travelogue video for the price of a nice dinner. Not worth it.This is a fun entry into this promising new technology, and I thought maybe since they'd been around for a few years already that the technology would be advanced enough now to make it truly viable for the average consumer, but I was disappointed. Really usable VR for the masses is still years away. This device is for teen gamers mostly."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I recently recorded a video using the MetaQuest 3S camera, it's important to note that while watching a recording differs from experiencing it firsthand, the core issue lies in the Fresnel lenses. These lenses offer poor clarity and an extremely small sweet spot, making even slight movements result in blurry images. In contrast, pancake lenses used in most premium headsets provide a much wider sweet spot and sharper visuals.I found the passthrough color quality to be below expectations. The colors appear inaccurate and overly pixelated, making the visuals uncomfortable and causing headaches after just a few minutes of use. Additionally, the sweet spot is extremely small; even slight movements quickly blur the image, detracting from the overall experience.Another major issue is the hand tracking functionality. It performs poorly, with the pointer trembling and frequent failures to recognize hand gestures or clicks. Despite claims that hand tracking on the 3S is superior, my experience was the opposite, making interactions frustrating and unreliable.Although I haven’t purchased the MetaQuest 3 yet, I definitely plan to replace the 3S with the 3 to see if the reality and performance truly improve. Based on my current experience, I wouldn’t recommend the 3S unless these issues are addressed. If you’ve already bought the 3S and are facing similar problems, consider requesting a refund or exploring other options."
"I was disappointed with the Meta Quest 3S. The visuals are not as sharp as expected, and the headset feels uncomfortable after a short time. The included game and trial don’t make up for the overall lack of quality. Not worth the price."
Batman did not come free with what o got. Says I have to pay for it. Getting ripped off. Please fix this!
"Not impressed at all, the only reason you would want to buy this is for the 3 good exclusive games it has. I do like the pancake lenses but the graphics are literally powered by Snapdragon processors, which are  also used for phones. It gets better when you hook it up to a PC but I prefer my PSVR2 when playing on PC. It has a much better FOV, better graphics, OLED screen more vivid colors and darker blacks. The blacks on the Quest 3 look like grey areas. Also what pisses me off the most about this headset is it was made purposely so you have to buy extra peripherals to make it more comfortable and play it longer than an hour and a half with all the batteries dying. Without a headset mod this is the most uncomfortable headset I’ve ever used and will give you a headache after an hour of use. The batteries die after a couple hours unless you buy extra peripherals. Better headsets out there. If you have a PlayStation 5 go with a PSVR2. Much more powerful headset and is actually cheaper right now. Also the PSVR2 has better controllers,more comfortable headset, haptic feedback on the headset and adaptive triggers plus much better exclusive games."
"when i got the Vr box i looked at the box it looked little damaged but it looked like normal box damage but when i opened the box it was as if some one forced every thing in the box and closed it, and it looked like some one was removed all the stickers on the things so i didnt use it and closed the box because i dont know if some one stole the game and the 3 months trial from the head set or not so i didnt want to risk using it and ordered a replacement hope i get a new one that is not used and work fine"
"I am very deeply disappointed in the experience I have had purchasing the Meta Quest 3s.  I was able to use it for less than 2 weeks before I got the lost connection message  after that it doesn't work because it can't connect the controllers to the headset.  I contacted customer support and they said I need to send it back and they will send a replacement right out.Well they received my return (proof by shipment tracking with signature)  but they lost it at the warehouse and now I'm receiving email after email from different reps saying they are dedicated to finding my VR but then a new rep messages me with no answers.  The headset was heavy on the face and quality was so so.  My score is so low due to the horrible experience I am having with customer support, I'm almost at the point of refund.Please take caution !"
"3/5 blurry eyes, get the 3 its worth it"
"It's cool for the first couple minutes, then becomes a paper weight and dust magnet. The fact is that videos are best viewed on a monitor, instead of a blurry projection. Even videos & games made for VR have its novelty and wow factor wear off really fast. I am glad that I did not pay for the more expensive version."
"My son is 13 and saved to buy this himself.  He was so excited, I noticed as days went by he was using it a lot less , until he stopped all together.  I asked him why and he finally admitted “it gives me severe headaches and my eyes hurt after”.  He has perfect vision and never gets headaches. This was a first. Sadly, it now sits there wasted."
"I didn't think this product meets my needs because the vision is very blurry and the battery life doesn't even last for half a movie, which is what they're main promotion is...I think this product should be redeveloped before it is reintroduced to the market..."
Gives vertigo and puts pressure on eyes. Video quality is not good enough to watch movies.
"What a disappointing product man.... I was really exited to get my quest 3S but after spending time i realized in something...IS  BASICALLY a Quest 2 Modded with color pass-through and quest 3 controllers... THAT'S IT..... it uses the same cheap lenses from the quest 2 and even if this has 8GB of ram, for some reason it feels like 4GB.If you're looking for a (REAL) change, then buy the Quest 3 or Quest pro, but please AVOID the Quest 3S.Definitely not worth $500. Retuning it"
It’s a shame that it’s off centre & a little blurry
"Just got my S3, downloaded games and it loads forever.  The screen was black, no image but there is sound.  Not sure if this problem will remain?  If it is I am sup returning this!"
"Received item - it appears to come with pubic hair as part of its packaging, batteries pre-installed,  dirty googles... very disgusted and very annoyed"
I had high expectations for the Quest 3S but the resolution is so bad. Texts look blurry and strain your eyes. And I feel dizzy in some games.
"I wanted to hate this.  I am not a Facebook fan nor a Meta fan.  However, I do have a curiosity about VR.  I have tried the Apple Vision Pro and was blown away.  I could not afford a Vision Pro, so it stayed at the store.  This is VR at a much lower price point, and as such I expected it to suck a lot more than the Apple version.  I was wrong.  Is it as good as the Vision Pro, no, but it is still really, really good.  And I suspect in some ways better than the Vision Pro.It is really easy to setup.  Physically, it comes with a spacer which, when added allows you to wear prescription glasses when using it.  The head strap is really easy to adjust so the mask fits nicely on your face.  I found though that the mask, over time, pushes on my face and my glasses such that my face starts to hurt after about an hour or so.  There are third party headgear accessories already that claim to alleviate this stress.  I might have to try one.  Also, if you have glasses, you can get prescription lenses for the MetaQuest for $70 CAD - seriously going to consider that.  Inside the headset are the two lenses, and you can adjust how far apart they are to match how far apart your eyes are.  The two controllers fit very comfortably in my hands and the controls are very intuitive.After getting it setup to fit your head and eyes, you are ready to go.  When you first power it on, there is a tutorial to get yourself acquainted with everything you see, and how to use the controllers.  Once done with that, the VR world is yours to explore.  There are games, and movies and a VR community where you can meet and interact with other (real) people.  One of the games I played, involved capturing these furry ball creatures that have invaded your space.  Your space being whatever room you happen to be in. The game will map out your room and your furniture then cover everything up with a VR Room and obstacles.  Then the action starts, first your ceiling starts falling down.  If you look down at your hands you are carrying two ray-guns.  If you shoot your wall, you will blast a hole in it.  Same with the floor and ceiling.  Then the fun really begins, you soon get inundated with colourful furry balls with eyes.  When you shoot at one, it gets zapped over to a machine captures them.  It is quite fun and the balls will hide around your furniture.  This is a game where you have to get up an seek out some of these critters.  Because the game mapped your room earlier, you will not bump into your real life stuff.  The VR is fantastic.Not only does this to VR, it does AR as well. Augmented Reality.  In AR mode, you can see your surroundings and have application windows hanging in the air or up on the ceiling. You can have multiple windows open, and hanging anywhere in your room. The windows stay still and no matter where you move your head, they stay fixed where they are like a piece of furniture.  It is very cool.  This is now my new favourite way to watch Netflix.  I open Netflix, and move the window to where my wall is then make the window as big as my wall.  Now, it looks like my room has an entire wall that is a screen.  Here is the downside to the AR portion, you can see your surrounding, but it is an image an not like looking through a window.  When not looking closely at the real physical things in your environment, things look fine.  However, if you look closely, they look grainy, or they seem to shimmer.  This is one place where the Apple Vision Pro really wins - the video quality of your surroundings.One final thing, the audio is very good.  My hearing isn't fantastic, but I could hear everything clearly and without distortion.If you want to experience excellent VR for a reasonable price, give this a go.  VR is interesting when you see it on TV, or talk about it. However, experiencing VR is on an entirely different level, at least to me."
Couldn’t use it. Plastic controllers are cheaply made. No space bar when you’re trying to search for a game. Don’t even have Mario. What the heck.
"Good price, easy set up, plug and play, lots of pre-loaded games. Tried out a handful of them, okay response time with controller. My only issue was when I completed levels on the bubble shooter game, pornographic images were revealed. Definitely NOT safe to play with children. Can’t say if it was just that game or if there are others, but it seems highly suspicious that the one game I played out of close to 25,000 was the only one with that feature. Immediately returned. If you’re okay with that kind of stuff, go for it, otherwise stay away."
"It’s okay,  but. It earth shattering. Has lotsof low rated games.  No Nintendo games at all.  A few of the oldies,  mostly obsolete Chinese games."
"Did everything it said to do, and it still never displayed on the TV screen. Even watched videos to see If I did something wrong"
A lot of the MA games have pornographic images in them. I can’t give this to my grandsons. I’m having to purchase a different one. It does work and it does have lots of games but many of the games have very adult content.
"Although it advertises 20k+ games the true total is probably 5-6k with all the duplicates. Could not find any Mario games anywhere,so if anyone who has this and knows where there hiding please let me know. The controller sometimes works great and sometimes spazzes out for no apparent reason."
Instructions were pretty much non-existent. Played with it for hours trying to get it to work. The TF card was missing. Will be returning.
It didn’t power on and I could not use it. I was very disapoonted
"Games freeze after playing a few minutes.  Some aren't games at all, just demonstrations.  Returned."
Many of the emulators are missing or don’t work properly. This product is disappointing.
"There are lots and lots of ways to play classic games on modern televisions and this little unit is one of the simplest. The console isn't much larger than a typical USB stick and comes pre-installed with a SD card containing 20,000 games (we all know these things use ""funny"" counting). It comes with two PS2-style controllers (each needs 2 AAA batteries, not included) and a 2.4GHz dongle that plugs into the console. The console has an HDMI plug and an adapter do that it'll easily connect to your television even if it's up against a wall. It also needs power from a USB port (cable included). You can browse the games numerically if you have a few months or use the search feature to find your favorite games. You can also create a list of your favorite games. It has save states (load/save). You can also browse the games by each emulator (only Atari games, only MAME arcade games, etc). Some of the emulators are better than others and if you're into accuracy this may not be the unit for you; however, if you're looking for a ready-to-go system right out of the box, you can have this thing connected to your television and be up and gaming in just a few minutes. Would be great for gaming in the car or while on vacation. The controllers are bigger than the console!UPDATE: After using this device for a couple of weeks, I'm going to reduce my review rating. The emulation simply isn't very good. Lots of games stutter and shake when scrolling sideways. The music and sound effects are frequently off, and the game selection is a little weird. For example, there are only 10 Atari 2600 games (they could easily put every one on there for roughly the size of one or two SNES games). The PS1 games aren't a great selection and there's no way to add your own games. The way the games are organized is maddening and if you plan to play the ones you want you'll need to use the search function and build your own list of favorites unless you want to scroll through 10,000 fighting games every time you turn the unit on. I still say the unit is easy to set up, but with slightly more effort with a Raspberry Pi you'll get a much better gaming experience."
"Controllers are horrible they eat two new batteries every 40 mins, and they lag, would never buy again"
Broke after less than a month of playing.
"All games looks the same , my kids don't like it, the quality in the TV not good too."
"dislike the whole cheap system, waste of money"
Most of The games lag.  Not very good quality in picture.
It is super slow and freezes a lot
This has a lot of repeat games and alot of the options don't work.
"The HDMI connection keeps flickering, and the picture quality isn’t stable. Sometimes the screen goes black, and I have to reconnect the cables. Very annoying during gameplay."
"This console doesn’t have the classic games I was looking forward to. Instead, it’s filled with low-quality, obscure titles. If you’re a retro gamer, this is not the system for you."
"None of the games save your progress, so every time I turn off the console, I have to start from the beginning. This makes it impossible to enjoy long gaming sessions."
"Very excited at the idea of what this was, but unfortunately was glitchy.  Was not  smooth play and was not so enjoyable."
I just got the system at 5pm today and I was happy to turn it on and get up and running set up the wifi and was told the system had a Google lock pin so I needed the previous owner pin to get in to do a facility reset to be able to use this this a paper weight can't use it
"Biggest being that there's only 92 GB on board, and while you can expand via micro SD card it's only for roms and other media like MP3's and such. And with some android games crossing the 30 GB mark (COD Mobile and Genshin Impact for example) you really only have room to install a small handful of games if they're that size.Next is the Razer Kishi controller, it's not bad but it does feel stiff when attaching it via the USB-C port. I feel I have to be really careful not to break it when putting it in. Good thing that other usb-c controllers are also compatible. And the joysticks feel just like a Joycon from a Nintendo Switch, I do not like that as they're rather difficult to aim in shooting games.What I do like is this has quite a bit of power, meaning a lot of higher end android games can run with no issue (If you have the space for it) as well as emulation of PS2, GameCube and such will run just fine. And those kind of games you can run via the SD card. The screen is quite bright and very vibrant, and an update did improve the battery life. So it's about on average compared to a higher end smartphone.All in all, with so many Android powered gaming consoles this one is certainly one of them. But likely among the most powerful when compared to the Retroid Pocket 4 Pro and the Odin handhelds. Another benefit is the reduced price of $250 when I got mine, which is what others are selling theirs near or at the same price. Don't pay a cent more than that. Otherwise I think you'll have quite a blast with this."
"I use to be a razer fanboy but after the way they handled this product from launch to right now is completely scummy blizzard level crap!  If you say the device has expandable internal storage via micro sd than why would you leave out the fact that it’s portable storage and only portable. Wait they announced that next update will fix the storage issue and we can actually get use with this device awesome, fast forward a year still no update only to announce there will not be a update to fix the storage your stuck with the measly 120 g of storage which is 3 games maybe 4.  This could have been a game changer for android gamers but u guys fumbled and said oh well we forfeit! This is not a device for for retro emulation the specs on this scream genshin and star rail players. The size of the tablet the kishi attachment I was so excited to get this only to be disgusted with razer that I will never be a customer again u guys gave us the bird n said sucks to be you!!"
"Let me start off by saying that the razor edge is absolutely positively hilariously NOT the ultimate gaming handheld for android. That is false advertisement on razors part. And it is not for everyone.I will try to keep this simple as possible.I am an android gamer and I’ve had all the android consoles since the ouya released in 2013.  Razor marketed this device poorly and everything that it does can be done on any android device.The controller is great but does not require the edge to be used.The tablet itself is very fast and has a refresh rate that can changed60hz90hz120hz144hzBut not every android game will work properly when running at high refresh ratesFor example(Zombie catchers from deca games won’t play properly at anything over 60hz)The oled screen is beautiful and colors pop on itBut if your using the tablet for streamingThe refresh rate won’t be much use to you.The aspect ratio is 20:9 which is ok cause most phones have that but when streaming you’ll have black bars on the left and right. And when outputting video through usb the aspect ratio is the same which is very disappointing.The key mapper is pretty good but only works with the razor kishi controller and requires you to add your games to the razor nexus app in order to use the virtual controller. It is important to know that not every game will allow you to use the virtual controller.The SD card port is one of those crap ones that requires a tiny needle in order to open and for some reason and this is important“YOU CANNOT FORMAT THE SD CARD AS TABLET STORAGE” only as external storageI don’t know why razor decided to do that but it’s stupid and especially so seeing as they say it’s the ultimate android handheld.Overall if you are looking for a dedicated android gaming device I cannot recommend that you buy the razor edge, you’d be much better off buying an Odin Pro which is cheaper that the edge and features an amazing keymapper that you can use on any game and with any controller you wantSimply put the only reason to buy the edge is if you really really want the oled screen with 144hz"
"Works good for some games, but others require an updated version of android, which is still on 12 with zero signs of razer remembering or caring about this device.  DO NOT GIVE RAZER YOUR MONEY.  It's obvious they don't care"
Battery will no longer hold a charge and the touch screen is getting wonky as well. Have had for 3 months now. Considering the price I was hoping to use this device for at least a year
"Razer products are usually good but their tablet product is lacking for what describe as a gaming product. The resolution of the display is odd and most games have black bars to adjust for this. Games consistently crash. And the worst part was the light bleed on the edges. While I really enjoy the Kiishi controller, the tablet is severely lacking."
"Don’t buy if you plan on using for native android gaming like it’s advertised as. The device only has 128 gigs of internal storage and a slot for an SD card but however, you cannot use an SD card despite there being a slot for it  because the custom OS installed on the device by razor, does not allow you to use SD cards for anything other than file and photo transferring so you cannot download games to it. This product is borderline a scam and Razer as a company should be ashamed"
"Really nice device, however had the unfortunate luck of having a defective R1 button after only 4 days, not willing to try for a replacement as it seems these issues are pretty wide spread.  Poor controller quality control.  Will not be buying any Razer controllers, like I said device is great but controller not so much, buy a at your own risk."
"Upon receiving the device and turning it on, the fan kicks in and is super loud. The left side of the touchscreen gets uncomfortably hot after 10 minutes of Warzone. I would not recommend it even at $250."
Tried to buy a game from the google play store and wont work. Cant do anything with it. Do not buy! Buy a Steam Deck instead.
"I had this gaming tablet for less than 8 months, when all of a sudden it won't turn on, it won't charge, it's just a glorified paper weight. For almost $300 I expected it to last longer than less than a year. I've taken it to multiple places, hoping someone can fix it, and no one can even tell me what happened. About 2 months after I received it, the fans where so loud, like to the point where I couldn't sit in the same room with my family if they were watching a movie and I was playing on my tablet. Then it would just shut down, all of the time. Again, I took it to multiple places, and no one could tell me what was wrong. DO NOT SPEND THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY ON THIS TABLET!!"
