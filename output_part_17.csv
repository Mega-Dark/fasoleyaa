"Great looking 75 in TV but when we turned it on there were many multicolored streaks running from top to bottom and some blank spaces at the top.  The electrician confirmed it came damaged.  We returned it and unfortunately there were not any more of this model, so we had to order an OLED which was bigger (77 in) perhaps a little too big for the space."
"Defective TV had colored lines, going across the top and right side all the way down to the bottom, vertical and horizontal and  black mass in the top upper right. Returned but no refund yet."
the stand connecting piece  came with a broken tab.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Arrived broken twice.
"I cannot rate the item, because I've received it with damaged screen and I'm still waiting for the refund."
"Full disclosure - review is for the QN90B 85"", 2022 version, bought directly through Samsung. Just a word of caution for those in the market. I LOVED this TV. Until I didn't. The panel just went dead at month 23. Never in my life had a TV die. A $2500 TV with a one-year warranty. Thank goodness I purchased and had clawback through AMEX (they doubled the warranty) - they just just credited me $2100 (the cost estimate from Samsung repairer for panel replacement). If it died 3 weeks later, I would have been out of luck. I will never buy another TV in my life anywhere other than Costco. Online. Five years of warranty coverage is a HUGE deal when your $2K+ TV flakes out after 23 months. Debating whether to get another one or switch to a 77"" S90D... From Costco. Online."
"We bought a Samsung Frame TV in 2021. These TV's include a Samsung One Connect Box. Our one connect box recently failed. The model number is SOC1001A. Samsung parts does not have that model number in their system and denied its existence even after I sent them a pic of the label on the box that showed the model/pn. I spent roughly 4 hours bouncing around samsung departemtns before someone told me they 'thought'  one box model # BN91-23330G was compatible with my TV although samsung tech support could not confirm that. They found that part number at Samsung parts but they don't make it anymore. In short, I was told that there is no one connect box that is compatible with my TV and would have to resort to ebay or the like. Checking reviews on other Samsung TVs this is a common problem. Apparently, the One Box is internally designed for each TV. Reviews make it sound like the one box is a common point of failure and that getting a replacement will be difficult to say the least. We had a 3 year warranty and were a month outside of it be even then they told me they don't have, don't make, have never had (the SOC1001A) so getting an extended warranty won't help this common problem. If you still buy a Frame TV from Samsung all I can say is good luck."
"I had to wait 11 days for the unit, shipped from California. An ""expert"" installer set it up, three days later I couldn't get the tv to power on, the installer said it was the cable company's issue. Another two days, the cable person showed up and said that the cable box had been unplugged. That's funny, because it worked for four days prior. The cable installer gave me some tips, everything is fine. Two days later, the tv comes on but I can't select a program. I leave it off overnight, now it works again.Basically I can't simply watch tv; both installers blame each other for the problems, and every time I turn the set off I'm wondering if it's going to simply come on again."
A big disappointment. Short on promises. The documentation sucks. I cannot use TV headphone because it may use only one sound output.
"Purchased this TCL Model #32S350R, but couldn't locate a SN. Apparently, the TCL factory had neglected [italics] to attach the Serial Number sticker to the back, leaving the TV out of warranty. Must return to AMZN for exchange in order to get an SN and warranty.  TCL had the effrontery to lay the blame on AMZN [italics], stating they must have sent an ""open box"" TV. Go and figure. I can assure you that the box was completely intact, with tightly sealed staples. The edges and corners were not the least bit dinged up. But an AMZN employee must have been able to surreptitiously open the box, remove the sticker, and miraculously get it back into the box intact.As an aside, it's hard enough to get the TV back in correctly even when the box is open.Overall, it's an excellent product. I purchased this new TV b/c TCL increased the number of pixels from 750  to 1080. I currently own a 750 pixel TCL, which is a good TV, but the resolution on the new one is much better. The old one moves upstairs. In my previous experience, TCL has had outstanding CSAnyway, AMZN has been a champ, and is sending a replacement, even coming to pick up the return from the porch when the new one arrives.And to sweeten the pot, they credited $25 to my account for the nuisance."
"First off, the sound was poor. sounded like a 1970s fisher price kids tape recorder. This can be fixed with a sound bar. My biggest issue is navigating the channels. The only option for selecting live TV channels is to scrooooooolllllll up or down to find the station you want. We like to watch digital broadcast TV and to go from say channel 3 to 58, you have to scroll. then there are all the other live TV channels...a whole bunch of Spanish stations, all sorts of other stations I'm not interested in and so much other stuff. I want a TV with a remote I can punch in the TV station and it goes to that station. I was replacing a 7 or 8 year old Vizio that is compatible with a universal remote...This TCL does not recognize a universal remote. I guess I could go through the hundreds of channels and select ""My Favorites""...I Don't have time for that. I did call technical support and was connected with a virtual assistant which was absolutely no help.  After two days, I returned it. Probably go back to another VIZIO."
"There are no problems with the actual TV, but the Roku guest mode keeps getting stuck in a reboot loop at random times, causing major inconvenience for Guests.  We finally had to turn off the guest mode to avoid this issue.  That sucks because that’s the only reason I bought this brand TV."
My TV has been working fine until it wasn't.  Two months shy of a year the sound went out.  I reset my router & unplugged the TV without positive results.
I had 2 people helping me put this together.  It was not easy.  Other than that no complaints.
The picture is ok but the audio sounds like it's coming out of a tin can.
"These Roku TVs are great.  But what a nightmare it was getting it delivered!Amazon cannot select a carrier for you. They're kind of randomly picked.  I don't know whatever happened to Amazon merchandise coming by Amazon carrier.....right to your door.....withsignature requested?I wasted an entire day waiting in my lobby yesterday!  Only to get a USPS notification that my TVcouldn't be delivered so it was sent back to the facility for ""pick up.""  I'm a Senior, with two bad kneesand no car?!  How am I getting to their facility??? And that they attempted to deliver is a bold faced LIE.So, after much time on the phone, I was offered a refund.  Good, I could finally return to my apartment.No more watching for the mail truck.But this morning, I see that it's ""out for delivery!""Called Amazon again.  Is my TV on a truck, at a facility, am I getting my money returned as arranged?I feel I deserve a refund AND the TV just for all the aggravation.I did get a notice a few minutes ago that my TV was downstairs.  smhI found it on the outer side of an unlocked door?  WHY?  The Post Office knows how to get to ourmail room??Just a really sad experience.I don't hold it against Amazon or TCL.  But US Post Office........sloppy! Real sloppy work!My present 40"" is awesome. Great sound & picture.  Have had it about 4 months.  You can buy onewith confidence. : )"
"picture is great everything hooked up well. not happy that its a 36 inch and not a 40 inch as advertised,If your looking for a true 40 inch tv this is not it"
"You get what you pay for. The graphics are not great. It glitches from time to time but it gets the job done. Been using for exactly one year.Update on December 7, 2024:I am unable to launch any streaming apps. The tv won’t load them to even the profile screen."
"It's a basic 32 inch TV that gets the job done, and the only reason I bought it was because it has 3 HDMI inputs which is necessary for having two video game consoles, and Dish Network, it's literally one of the only newer model TVs at 32 inch size that has 3 HDMI inputs.What I don't like about it is the Roku part, I can really don't like it even though it's easy to use but blah. I ended up doing the factory reset OFFLINE, and will only use it OFFLINE - there's just too many damned ads in those video apps to bother with."
"The TV has a good picture and the sound is not bad. I have YouTube TV that is much better than cable, and more reliable than satellite TV.(had both years before I got this TV) I also have HBO, MAX, Prime Video, Netflix, Disney and Apple TV. But reguardless what I watch, the TV every so often will freeze up and go back to it's home screan. This happens every day several times a day. I have 6 other TV's that I have absolutely no problems with, 4 LG's and 2 Sharp. This TCL TV can't handle streaming of any kind, whether you're watching live TV and you pause what you're watching and then try resuming, or you fast forward through comercials it will freeze up and go back to the home screan. Not sure how it works with cable or satellite, but if you connect to the internet inorder to watch TV of any sorts, this TV may not be a good choice."
"The Roku portion of this thing is good.  Good picture.  Awful awful sound.  Probably the worst I've heard from a TV, ever.  I'm wondering if I got a defective unit it's so bad."
I have to unplug and let it reset itself every time it gets turned off won’t stay connected to the Wifi
"Needed to replace a 40 in TV. Website says 40 in. box said 40 in. took it out of box & seemed small. Set it next to the 40 in I had it was way smaller. So I measured it. 38 in diagonal. If you want  smaller TV, then it is functional. Sound is tinny though. Had to buy a another TV due to size & it took them over 30 days to refund my money.Smaller than Advertised."
I’m usually not picky when it comes to audio… but I’ve never seen a TV with worse audio. It sounds like the speakers are broken… there’s like a buzzy/rattling/static sound like a speaker makes right before it blows out. The audio is impossible to understand and the louder it is the worse it is. I hope I got a defective product because if this is the normal audio that is absolutely insane. There’s also a lot of background noise sound. It’s literally so bad… I hope Amazon/TLC can make this right because WOW this is awful.
"Original remote arrows for guide did not work all of the time.  In fact, sometimes ALL the arrows failed.  Remote did not have voice command.  TV buffered all the time.  Voice and picture did not sync after first 10 min. of programming.  Solution:  connected my exisiting stick roku device to hdmi1.  Remote for stick had voice control.  Buffering stopped.  Selection of guide using arrows now no problem.  I would have been forced to return TV if my stick roku device had not solved my problems."
"First Roku enabled TV I have purchased but I use Roku elsewhere and like very much.  Connected via wifi.  Till recently was great, but now intermittent video problems:  image becomes slightly ""blurred""/""softer""/fuzzier?  Tried to change frame rate and/or resolution but not accessible with TCL.  As experiment, connected one of my Amazon Firesticks [HDMI1] and have been using it.  No image problems.  So figure maybe some kind of wifi issue?  Tried original roku controller again and problem reappeared.  Again, intermittent.  I have not been able to find an appropriate setting to change to do further research."
"Upon opening the box and hanging the TV, we were impressed with the style of the TV and thought the picture and contrast were fantastic.  This was being setup in our nursery for occasional late night viewing, so its not our primary TV.  Setting up the apps was easy and everything worked great.... for a few days.So far we have only used it to watch Netflix and Paramount+.  Netflix is where we first noticed the problem - the show or movie would start, but after 20-30 seconds the app would close and the TV would go back to home screen.  Trying to open the app again and continue the show gave the same result.  No warning, no error.  Searching online, we found a button combination for the remote that would 'clear the Roku Cache'.  That seemed to fix the problem... but only for a few days.  Then the problem would start again, so we cleared the cache again. And so on - every few days we would have to clear the cache.  I tried watching a Paramount+ show last night, and the same thing happened - 30 seconds in to the show the TV went back to home screen.  So its not just a Netflix issue.The TV firmware is up-to-date, and I tried uninstalling/reinstalling both Netflix and Paramount+.  The problem persists.  We recently upgraded our modem and router to the latest and greatest, so I know its not a connection issue.  We don't have any connection issues on any other TV's in the house.  I'm hoping a new software update will be released soon and fix the issue, but wanted to document the issue.  I've also contact TCL directly.So for now, the rating is 2-stars and that's only because it actually does have a really nice picture for the price.  I update my review if/when the problem is resolved."
This TV definitely falls into the “you get what you pay for” category but for my basic needs it works. The most annoying thing is the built in Roku gui…it’s junk imo. Mine also regularly loses the wireless connection and I have to reset the network connection and reconnect to the WiFi network. I wouldn’t recommend this if it’s going to be your primary tv.
"The picture, color  is great. The sound is TERRIBLE.  Tried the different settings for audio and non work. There's a 'tingling' /echoing sound. The higher the volume the worse it gets.  I'd return it but I've had it 4 months and I'm sure Amazon will not allow returns  at this point."
If you are going to wall mount screws for stand will not fit . At the least tell me what size they are. Use common size ??
"Very thin and fragile, I'm afraid to touch it."
"This was suposed to be my bedroom tv . The designed flaw is the very very bright white light that comes on when the tv is turned off. The room is darken Then the bright light come on  and stays on untill the tv is unpluged Most tvs have a tiny red led indicating the tv is on . You say put some tape on to cover the light , then the remote will not work . It has a very nice picture quality and sounds to match . I  would not return this TV ,  but for that eye catching intense white light , when trying to sleep . This TV is not for the BEDROOM !!!!"
"This isn’t a bad tv so far. I’ve only had it for four days. The picture quality is good. However, the sound quality sucks terribly. It is very tinny. Sound quality is similar to that of an old transistor radio from the 1960s.  If you want a decent quality sound, be prepared to sell out for external speakers. The speakers on this TV of virtually tweeters with zero base or mid range.Aside from that given the price, the picture quality is decent, but the remote leaves a little to be desired. OK for the price considering something in this price range is basically a throwaway."
"I've had this since the end of October and it was working wonderful. But in the last day or so, a white spot has began to form in the middle of the screen."
The tv is great but my package was open and the batteries missing.
"The remote is clumsy.  Cannot change the volume without hitting the mute.  Frustratingly smaller than usual.  Even with better batteries, this remote is sticky.  Does not initiate action with a push of the button.  Picture on television is darker than normal.  Did a factory-reset and see if there was any more ""Brightness"" that could be had, but no.  It is a very dark picture on some shows, movies, etc..  The clarity is good.  The sound is excellent due to the soundbar.  For now, it will do."
"I gave the product a low review because its really only good for streaming. It's not coaxial cable friendly in the least. It keeps defaulting to the Roku live TV (streaming) from the coaxial line. The streaming is standard connection similar to other brands. I wanted it for satellite tv and it does not work well with my service providing limited setting options and often defaulting to streaming setting. I have a minor gripe with the amazon warehouse. Item was supposed to be in like new condition. It was missing screws to mount legs on bottom so I have to search around to find ones to fit. Also, one of the foam box support was broken and in pieces inside box."
"My wife's 15 year old Sharp 32 inch TV has a WAY better picture than this TV.  We played with all the picture settings and could not get as good a picture as her Sharp.  In addition the AT&T Uverse S10-S4 remote does not recognize TCL as a brand name so we spent 2 hours trying to program the Uverse remote to the TV.  The Uverse power button is suppose to turn the TV and the cable box on/off with one button push and it is not, nor will it control the volume on the TV."
"I used to LOVE Roku!  I stuck with them for years and years, while their platform steadily declined.  They used to provide a valuable search engine that wasn't influenced by outside forces.  They used to let me decide what channels were on my Home Screen.  But those days are gone.  The search engine is no longer helpful -- they've been 'paid off' to show only what the highest bidders allow.  And the TV constantly EXITS my show to begin loading another channel, or just adds additional channels without my permission and without asking!  What a shame.  I didn't even realize how much better things could be until we tried an Android TV and found something resembling what Roku USED to be.  It's not as good as what Roku was, for sure, but it's a far cry better than what Roku is today!  I'm done.  Roku sold out and it's just a cryin' shame."
It’s light and has sharp quality
"TV is okay, not great. Has 3 HDMI ports but no Ethernet port. Surprising. Was hoping for better."
you have to point the remote exactly at the TV or it wont connect. even a foot off to the side is inadequate. very annoying
"if you're looking for a awesome picture, this TV is not the one for you having trouble with it staying connected for streaming"
The tv is nice but if you have Roku get the one for Roku not apple or others. It will want to go to the others first then go to the Roku but it works good.7
"It’s a TV that works functionally, other than the fact that it lags and glitches from time to time; but that is not too bothersome for myself. Also in the image I have provided there’s this spot where pixels don’t work so it creates this lined square which isn’t too bad.I bought this TV because I broke our previous TV by accident and needed a decently quick and cheap fix for it and found this. From what I’ve read in some previous reviews about the issues I have mentioned are pretty common."
"I bought this TV to hook up a Raspberry Pi 3B+ to it so I could make a home dashboard using the DakBoard software, but when it switches from one screen to the next, it's very choppy when displaying it.  I've not heard of anyone having this problem with the Raspberry Pi or the DakBoard software, so it has to be the TV. Other than that, it seems fine."
"We’ve ordered two of these now and both have a small, A1 stamped on the screen in red.  It’s in the top left quadrant and can really be seen when the image on the screen is white.  We’ll be returning both of them but we’re wondering if anyone else had experienced this."
To many steps to get to local broadcasting.
I love TCL televisions but this one has poor sound. Very tiny. The picture is awesome.
Nice picture though sound is very poor. Sounds like coming through a speaker the size of a dime. No improvement by using any of the sound options available with the TV settings.
"Started with intermittent problems. Had to reset up every week,Then it went into power on loop. Tried all internet fixes. Didn’t fix problem. Product support had me repeat all of the internet possibilities.After talking to product support I’d give it less than a one, if possible. One thing that irritates is the old saw, ‘we are experiencing higher than normal call volumes and will get back to you within 3 days’.Update:Product support had me do everything already tried from the internet. They then said they would forward it to next step.Next step asked me to take video of problem. I did. They then said they would forward to next step. Next step was to send picture of serial number crossed out with current date. They said it would go to next step.  Next step was wait 5- 7 days for a replacement. Also, to update mailing address. I did.After not receiving anything I contacted them again. They said they didn’t have model in stock and would send check. Could I update mailing address and send picture of crossed out serial number.  I did. Still no TV,  no check.So, no check, no replacement, no follow up messages from TCL.Update:Last message from TCL:Will send to next step and about 5 weeks I’ll receive a check.Not a good buy. Not good warranty support."
Four and a half months in and the remote goes bad.  Did not ever have a problem with the TCL 36 Roku.  I'm having second thoughts about TCL.
Very dark picture! Can’t seem to get it light enough.
I do not recommend this product for an older person.Then remote control is small and has no numbers
The TV works fine but there is a “status” light on the bottom of it that is very bright.  I couldn’t use the TV in my bedroom because it literally lit up the whole room.
"Setup was very easy, connected to Wifi seamlessly. This set, however should not be used in a bedroom. There is a bright LED at the bottom of the set that lights when it is powered off; if you put a piece of tape over it the remote no longer works."
obviously not a high end tv.  great for a guest room that you hardly use.  very light weight but it is an inexpensive tv.
"It is a chore to watch anything on this TV because any app I use crashes the moment it has to load anything longer than 20 minutes. Max, Netflix, Hulu, and Peacock all crash constantly. My only saving grace is that I have the TV hooked up to my PC. It makes an okay second monitor.If I could return it I would."
"I have had my 40 inch Roku TV for 2 months. The first month didn't give me too many issues. However, for the past 4 weeks have had nothing but trouble. The TV doesn't initially connect to the WiFi, the picture freezes, the selected app stops working and returns to the home screen. At times, it just turns off on it's own."
It sometimes turns on but it likes to turn itself off. All the time. It's up to date but will close apps and go to the home screen or just turn off completely. Button pushes are extremely laggy. I knew it was going to be a cheap TV but I wanted something that actually worked.
"I will admit this TV is inexpensive so maybe that is the issue…maybe you get your moneys worth here! I purchased this for my elderly mother for Mother’s Day. I wish I had not! I ended up regretting it, the calls and texts I got because of the trouble she had not only setting it up but because she couldn’t hear it well and because the picture was horrible became a nightmare! She did all she could to prevent from having to return it, but in the end we had no choice. Honest I was hoping it was a her thing but when I went to check and see if her reviews were accurate…they were. Horrible TV. I would have sent it back the same day! She is a trooper for hanging on as long as she did, trying to keep it, and contacting customer service to “fix” the issues on a brand new TV. Smh. Mothers Day fail on my part."
"This is a review for TCL 32-Inch Class S3 1080p LED Smart TV with Roku TV (32S350R, 2023 Model. It shows a good picture but the HomeKit and Airplay feature do not work on TCL models even though they claim so. I mean, you can enable them but they do not work. I tried on different models. It works on the Westinghouse."
"I just purchased a Roku TV - for the Smart TV features, so I could view my AT&T uverse cable subscription - I Can’t do it!  Just spent 1 hr on the phone with TCL and then with Roku to be sure.  Roku has 250 other apps / but they chose to not do this one."
"We have had good luck with this brand before. But this TV is GARBAGE. It constantly freezes, buffers, lags and turns itself off. The contrast is awful and you can't see anything in darker movie/tv scenes. And, it often blurs live sports, I think due to an abysmal refresh rate. I'm considering replacing it less than 3 months into owning it. I wish they would only make good TVs or explain what is different with the more expensive ones. Hard to know what you are getting."
"Picture is much too dark and there are only 5 settings, bright, brighter, normal, dark and darker. I tried unplugging and restarting after 5 min….still very dark. I miss my old dead Samsung and Roku stick.My old Bose Solo soundbar useless with this TV."
Wanted another roku tv and this one had the right price to performance ratio
"I purchased TWO of these, one for each of my boys. I have to Factory Reset them over and over again. They always have network errors, they can never update apps, Netflix - which should be the easiest of all - will freeze and fail to reboot. Doing yet another Factory Reset while I write this review. I feel like such an @$$."
Not a good hand held remote..... remember  it's roko..not fire ..but u can still use ..but the roko remote sucks and you have to dial down  to get your TV number....like kiro #7 or channel 32 u have to press 32..because there is no numbers on the hand held..  again ..returning this
REMOTE DOES NOT WORK UNLESS YOU ARE UP CLOSE TO TV SCREEN!!!
For everyday viewing. Sound needs sound bar. Picture settings could be better.
"Absolute garbage. Network connection says it is fine. Every app says it has a network issue. This happens every single day.Whatever this pile of trash has to process information, it is the slowest, most unreliable thing they could find.Save your time and just light your money on fire. It will be far less stressful."
"The pic quality of the 40in. is good however, the sound quality is subpar. Good cheap TV for a child or bedroom. Definitely not for a living room or larger room."
The remote will not allow you to setup closed caption. To me that makes the purchase a no brainer: do not buy and I will never buy another TCL for that reason. I purchased an out dated piece of junk.
"TV graphics are horrible!! Think of motel tv quality, Even the letters have little boxes around them. I bought it specifically to use with my PlayStation, but when I connected my PS5, the TV couldn’t handle it. It kept glitching and flickering on and off until I returned to the main screen. There are so many better options out there. I would not recommend buying this."
The tv would not play and I returned it a month ago on the 7th of November and have not gotten credit for the return yet.
"TV looks nice but since they forgot both the remote and the paperwork, I can’t use it. Amazon will send a replacement but have to wait a week although if I just went and bought another one I could get it in 2 days."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It displays a picture and its fine, that's really the end of it. If you are replacing a fairly recent TV (2-3 years) you will be upset and how cheap things have gotten - even things like the power cord are completely integrated so those of you who had custom mounts or recessed setups ready to plug in you will be very disappointed.The TV is very flimsy, I have an articulating arm however the TV flexes and bends at the smallest pressure. I gave it a bit of force to exaggerate but you can see how it moves, the tv that it replaced did not start bending when you moved it."
"The TV suddenly went wierd with distorted horizontal and vertical lines. The phone support people tried to get it working but gave up and told me to contact the warranty people. I sent photos as requested and they clamed I had broken the screen and basically said it was my own fault, which was untrue because it remains in perfect physical condition. Now I get no response from them when I try to correct their conclusions. Bad purchase I am afraid because it is trash now after 4 months!  Buyer beware!"
"How frustrating! Second TV I have had to return. Thank God Amazon has such a good return policy. This TV seemed a little chinsey when I took it out of the box. The 24"" Visio I returned had a much better quality feel to it. But alas, that one would not connect to the internet, and I read some reviews for the larger Visio with that same problem. But to be fair, we were on Hughesnet then and in our downgraded period, and now we are on Starlink, sooo much better. I thought I would take a chance on TCL. Had a lot of good reviews. But right out of the box it has four weird black areas in the screen. Sure it was cheap, but I know that would always drive me crazy. I worked with the TCL support, but after various troubleshooting didn't resolve the problem. Of course they wanted me to send it back on warranty and I would have to take pictures etc. Screw that! I can send it back to Amazon. Was it just one bad apple? Maybe, but I think I will look for a more expensive name brand TV."
Idk if my is a lemon but mine has been crappy ever since I've gotten it. It freezes all the time will crash using the apps it's pretty bad. I hate it.
It was perfect size and super light. The box seemed like it had been retaped but that didn’t meant anything until I got it up and turned it on.No option for replacement soI started a return so I’ll update if the return goes smooth or if they try to fight me.
"Plan on buying a sound bar, the built in speaker is bad."
"The remote that comes with the TV isn't great, it's flimsy and feels very cheap. I switched it out with a different better Roku remote that has voice. The TV sound quality is like a 3/10. The refresh late looks fine. The picture seems to be a bit of white washed. TV brightness is fine in day but it is too bright still in very dark mode. And there is no way to dim it more. TV is extremely light."
"This tv has been disappointing. The default color setting are absolutely terrible to the point I thought the TV was faulty. I was able to change the color setting to make it more acceptable. However, the TV freezes and restarts with frequent FF and RW. It’s a real pain."
I bought this for my 92 year old mother so she could get rid of cable and stream. She has had nothing but trouble with it turning off constantly by itself and then not turn back on for periods of time. The worst part is dealing with TCL customer service which is a call center that goes strictly by script and wont respond to direct question or give answers that aren't on their script. They need a picture of the TV plugged in before sending out a technician but my mother doesn't have a cell phone and wouldn't know how to email a picture even if she did. So frustrated! Next step BBB
The screen was cracked. Had to return. Refund is taking forever.
Beware of those who are planning to buy this kind of brand….it only last the software less than one year ….terrible 👎🏻
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                I have NEVER in my life been bombarded with so many ads. Ads on streaming services I pay for. The tv is slow, commercialized, and just faulty. The buttons barely work. And the sound is horrible. I just pray I can return this garbage."
"Never got the tv to work. Nice customer service, but even they agreed that the product was a dude & they could not troubleshoot. Returned & will NOT repurchase."
Tv hooks to my networkHowever software will not load- no matter what I do.I’ve seen where the co took slot of these TV’s off shelves due to faulty software.After back and back with emails/ they have not solved the problemTv is crap
"The tv I bought came in broken, the tv screen was completely shattered and broken beyond repair, tried refunding it but I got no updates or a refund. Complete waste of money"
"THE BAD: not bright, dark scenes are hard to see even with brightness all the way up, no custom EQ, no hardware for anchoring onto a wall, poor sound that has only treble, slightly blurry picture because a TV this size needs to have more pixels than just 1080p.THE GOOD: VERY responsive remote controller with little to no delay in button presses, slim, compatible with almost all apps."
"Powers off randomly, flashes on and off white trying to turn it on. Dim picture that adjusting did not correct. Don't waste your money"
"This TV does everything it says it does with one major extra. It has a blue light on the bottom of it that can't be turned off that is extremely bright and at night lights of the entire room, this is extremely irritating. I thought it was small it is not. It's brig"
Very little use in spare bedroom.  Vertical and horizontal lines after 4 months light use.  Stay away from this model. 5 months old.
"I bought this TCL smart TV for my son’s birthday and there was an obvious A1 imprinted on the screen in the far left corner whether it was on or off,very annoying so I asked for a replacement and now this TV is the very same way.Needless to say I am very disappointed,now I have 2 TV’s that should be returned,but it’s so much trouble I will just keep one,not sure if this is intentional or not but once you see it you can’t unsee it.  Sincerely,Charlotte. Update —-  as of january 6th my son has decided he is so annoyed and unhappy with the A1 imprint on the second tv that we will be returning for a refund,I’ve already dropped off the one tv at UPS"
YouTube TV App keeps on crashing?Every other app works fine…
The picture and sound was terrible. There was also a delay so it kept getting blurry in the middle of watching. I plugged my older TV back in right away and returned this one. My older one is still better.
"It did not come with a remote control but we were able to call the manufacturer to get a replacement sent for free. In the meantime, we are using one of our other TCL remote from another TV until it arrives."
"I returned the TV because it was defective. It had lines to the screened at a dead spot in the upper right hand corner, then to add insult to the injury of dealing with a defective device I did not receive a full refund."
"1.) The picture is not a 1080P. It is grainy,and out of focus.  2.) In any setting the sound quality is buzzy and not clear. I had to put it in CLOSED CAPTION to understand any of the speaking. 3.) In the amazon ad it is clearly posted and shown that the screen is edge to edge. (left to right) IT IS NOT !! IT IS BLACK PLASTIC ENCLOSED AROUND EVERY EDGE ABOUT AN INCH !!  I am never going to believe another GLEAMING review of any product !!! I am so mad as this was for my bedroom as I am facing a very bad surgery NOW WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WHILE I TRY TO HEAL UP !!!!!!!!!! DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE"
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Bought 4 of these for rentals. Constant problems. Will not buy again.
"I was super excited for this tv, but because of the dent on the side of the TV when it arrived it permanently has this weird crack and display issue on screen (shown in image) I wanted to love this, but I shouldn’t pay full price for a brand new TV when it’s damaged, will be returning soon 💔"
Just wanted a cheap tv for bedroom. Tv is fine. Remote will not control tv unless 7 feet or closer.
"I have a TV that constantly freezes for no discernible reason, and I work in tech. After multiple 2 hour support calls, TCL continues to offer me new remote controls, claiming that the last remote controls have all failed in the same way. Surprise surprise, this doesn't solve the problem. For $179, I'm close to throwing this TV in the trash so I don't have to deal with the headache. Never again will I buy a TCL product."
Line running down screen
Picture is fine just like most TV's. Having other TV's with streaming sticks that are lightening fast this TV is like the old dail-up computers. Very slow!
BEWARE! You don't own this tv - ROKU DOES!  Unrequested update bricks the tv unless you agree to updated terms of service. no way to opt out. no way to return it now. Demand to accept just pops up and tv cannot be used unless you comply. you have to agree to new terms or you can't use you device at all for anything. they're holding the tv hostage until I agree to their demands. what a garbage company. Never buying from these thugs again.
We were not able to open the product until today & when we did; the tv screen was busted
"Everything else about the Hisense 40-Inch Class A4 Series is fine. The picture quality is good. I like the size and it's very light. However, you cannot turn off motion smoothing aka frame interpolation. After speaking to Hisense customer service it was confirmed that motion smoothing is built in which is beyond baffling to me. If something was shot at 24fps, I want to view it at 24fps. I don't want my movies looking like soap operas. The motion smoothing isn't as bad as I've seen in other TVs  but it's still there and it makes this TV completely unusable for movies and TV shows. Therefore I'll be sending it back which is unfortunate since I liked everything else about this TV. If you care at all about watching movies and TV shows how they were meant to be seen DO NOT BUY."
"Picture is fine, but sometimes it loses sound when we try to go backwards or forwards. We have to turn off the tv and back on again to get the sound to come back on. Ok for the price."
TV is completely unusable unless I give them my email and creat an account!
"The box say the TV is 40"". The TV is not 40"" it's 35"". The box it comes in is 40""."
I like that it's a roku. I like the price.  I expected a better picture. It is just so so. This is my 2nd hisense tv in under 6 months. The first one a 65in was great until one day it had lines . I had the tv for 2 months. Can not watch anymore.  No more hisense for me
I got it for a great price. Picture color is ok and sound could be better.
see above
"Got this thing hooked up yesterday.  The picture is pretty good but it is awfully hard to navigate the user interface.  AND, if you want to hook anything up to the HDMI ports it is really difficult to go from home to the connected device.  EX:  I hooked up a DVD player to the Earc HDMI port.  THERE IS NO WAY TO GET TO IT FROM THE HOME SCREEN.  You have to go to settings--power--and select that port.  Then you have to turn the tv off and then back on and it will be at the screen for the dvd player.  Easy enough to go from there to the home screen but what a bunch of crap.  Shoulda bought a fire tv..."
not bad， but the picture looks not very clear
The sound doesn’t work on the tv no matter what setting you have it on. When you unplug it and plug it back in the sound starts working again but this happens every time you stop using it so essentially if you buy this tv then you will have to unplug it and plug it back in for each use so the sound works
"Go ahead and spend the extra $30 for a new okay tv that has all the features.  This remote control does not have voice, so have fun spelling everything out."
"Purchased this TV for my mom about a week ago I get a call. She tells me there’s no sound so I had to drive 35 miles to check on this TV. There was no audio coming from the sound bar. There was no optical light from the optical cable that will tell you that you’re getting audio from the TV so I switched the sound bar off to use the TV speakers no sound from that. Return the TV but before returning, I did a factory reset to take off mom‘s personal information then all of a sudden the optical light came on the sound from the TV came on, but I forgot to tell you I did do a audio factory reset first, and that didn’t work.  If I had a problem within a week, there’s no reason to keep it."
Why keeps turning off ?
"There's apparently a known issue with Hisense tvs that they can get stuck in reboot loops, especially after updating, but can happen at apparently anytime. I took mine out the box and spent two days and a friend's USB drive to attempt every which way to fully update the TV and move past it, but no fix on the internet worked.According to people online, if none of these fixes work, there's something wrong with the power supply in the TV itself, which is INSANE for an allegedly good quality TV. Do NOT buy this, these products have unsolved problems."
The TV came damaged inside the packaging. There was no sign on the outside indicating it was damaged in transit. Which means Hisense sent me a damaged product on purpose. Plus they refused to replace the television
"Arrived with a defective remote that I had to replace and then less than 24 hours later the screen bugged out and made it completely unwatchable. Do not buy, go with a more expensive option to save yourself the headache."
Second attempt at buying this tv after first was defective. Now this one won’t sync with my cable remote like the first one did with ease. I even replaced the cable remote. Over all opinion is this is a crap product.
Return process is super frustrating. Wouldn’t just replace I had to return and buy another one. Now I’m out the money until I get the refund.
Not good for boomers or tech challenged. price is grat but roku tv not good for me!
"I cannot program to re my satellite channels. Terrible TV, I won't buy another one!!!Very unhappy and I cannot get any help with it. It goes in the box and the dump."
After 2 weeks the port broke? It won't work with a new cable. TV is dead.
Junk ... save your money .. sound it terable ...
As we was screwing the leg into the bottom of the tv it bent and broke
Been waiting for a credit for over two weeks.
I DO NOT LIKE COPYRIGHTIN
I purchased the 40 inch tv.The TV will not let me activate it so I can watch my DVDs on it unless I put a credit card on file.I have NO intentions of paying for games or other downloads that I'm NOT going to make.The ONLY reason I got the TV was so I could watch my movies.
"This TV cannot Directly stream PBS resolution adding a ROKU / fire stick, lower quality picture and an extra remote. This is not obvious anywhere I can find in LG's promotional literature for their TV."
It does not work smoothly. The screen randomly goes black and turns on. The connection with my home theater sound disconnects and reconnects.I am very unsatisfied.
"The first one I got the screen cracked the second one they came in, was very slow to respond to any commands and Wi-Fi was very slow even though I have a very high connection. It went back for good this time."
Horrible service. I was not given the option for a replacement TV.. and I only had 14 hours on the usage time. I inquired about a replacement within 30 days of receiving the TV and the only option I was presented with was a refund. I have to suffer for purchasing a faulty TV. Makes zero sense.
"This TV picture is dull not bright, may due to the QNED technology.  Try to adjust the picture with only limited improvement.  Otherwise, it seems to work ok."
I bought a brand new LG and the circuit board failed before 3 years
"QNED80 55"" not competitively priced. Better pricing elsewhere."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            We bought and delivery was ok. We set up picture was awful so called to return we had to pay return and get pickup scheduled. $350.00 TO RETURN WE HAD TO PAY !!!!!  Do not buy off amazon go to storesTv was $996 so only got $646 returned to us what a racket!!!
"This TV is affordable and has a great picture quality for the price. However, there are two main issues that bring this down to a 3-star review. The first is the sound quality. The speaker is in the back of the tv, so you end up hearing things after it's bounced off the wall. Secondly, the tv is just slow. Once you get to your media, it works great. But there is a noticeable lag when selecting something on the home page, for example.Overall, it's fine but it's probably worth the extra $50 to get a better set."
"Purchased to replace the older RCA of the same size for my wife who loves watching TV in bed. No issues with shipping and it pretty much looks like the pictures on the website. I ran into a problem getting my Direct TV remote to pair with this TV. The brand is listed but not the model and none of the codes (13 total) worked. That means she'd have to manage 2 remotes to control the TV and the cable box (Strike 1). Also this thing has a light that illuminates when the TV is off. It's located center bottom of the frame, is ridiculously bright and very intrusive when you're trying to sleep (Strike 2). Try as I might I could find no way to dim it or turn it off. I don't understand why they felt the need to add this light. It serves no other purpose. The last straw came a couple days later when she finally admitted that she didn't like the TV, thought the picture on the RCA was better (Strike 3). So the TCL is now sitting in my granddaughters room pretty much unused (She's away at school).  3 Stars for shipping and packaging"
"I disliked the type, quality, kind of music that came with it.  Old Fashioned."
Not clear as it can be.
"Someone somewhere made a lot of assumptions about what they thought I might want to do with a smart TV. And Amazon didn't help the matter any when they tied the in-home spy (aka Alexa) to the thing.  And if anyone sold a TV that was NOT considered 'smart' (matter of opinion), THAT's what I would buy.This thing relentlessly trying to steer me to streaming services I couldn't care less about. I use the thing as a computer monitor (let's face it, a 40"" computer monitor is outrageously overpriced) and I occasionally use it to view regular OTA TV. That's it.  BUT, every time I turn it on, it takes me to a whole list of BS that I don't care about and don't want to see. Nothing in settings appears to allow me to change this.Picture and sound quality is decent but that's about all I can say in a positive light."
"I’ve had this tv for probably close to a year now and it does what you need it to do as far as playing video games or watching shows and movies. The screen quality is decent and the sound is okay I guess. However it is kind of glitchy and is super delayed a lot of the time when you press buttons on the remote. Also occasionally when I turn it on the sound doesn’t work so you have to go into settings and hard restart it which is very annoying. Another problem I have with this tv is it has a power saving mode that can’t be disabled. So if you need to pause something to say, go get something to eat and you take more than 5 minutes the tv will turn off by the time you’re back which is also very annoying. If you’re looking for a cheap tv just to get you by this one is fine but if you’re looking for something nicer this probably isn’t the one for you."
"I bought the 40 inch TCL fire tv on prime day. It was about $20 cheaper than the original price. The tradeoff was a 2-3 week shipping time. No bueno, but I had time. I received the TV in that timeframe and went to the trouble of mounting it to my wall. I took the time to sign in on various streaming services and set things up to my liking. After a week, it was clear that roughly 1/4 of the time the sound didn't work, seemingly from startup. No amount of messing with settings would fix it. Rebooting wouldn't fix it. You have to walk up to the outlet and unplug it, wait, and plug it back in. Like old-school restarting your modem. I complained. They offered me a bunch of cop-out options that demonstrated a lack of concern for my time. No, I don't want a partial refund, I want a TV that works. After having to look like a jerk to customer service, I finally got a full refund and free expedited shipping on a replacement.  This time, it arrived in one day. I jumped through all the hoops of setup again. The same issue is present. It's clear they are offloading broken garbage. If I figured it out, I wonder if they could possibly be ignorant to it."
"While it did not surprise me, I was disappointed to find out that, in order to use the TV, I must log into my Amazon account. Not logging in means I only have access to five apps - Netflix isn't even one of them.Of course, it tried to upsell me five different times on different products before I could finish setting the TV up. And, as you would expect, Amazon asked to monitor the shows I am watching so I can advertise to me better. I turned it off, but they'll still monitor and monetize it just like they do all our viewing and shopping history.If you don't care about being reminded you're the product being sold here, the TV is fine. But I still find it unacceptable to learn that you can't use 95% of the available apps without connecting it to your account"
my other TVs are 4k. i really notice the difference in picture quality. i guess you get what you pay for. i would like to horsewhip the youtuber that told me amazon fire product were off the hook. amazon fire products SUCK! i like roku products and will only buy them in the future. i hate how if the fire TV is idle for a few minutes it will turn off. Rokus will display a cool screensaver forever if you don't touch the control. sometimes if i'm sitting in front of the TV sleepy it will hypnotize me and make me go to sleep. if i do that in front of these fire TVs i wake up in the dark. I DON'T LIKE WAKING UP IN A PITCH BLACK HOUSE I LIVE ALONE! Call me a chicken if you want.
"The title kind of says it all. There’s a light under this TV which is fine. However, that light is only on when the TV is off and when you want a dark room it’s not helpful. There is no option to disable it! Looking around people recommend taping over it. It’s crazy that they would overlook something so easy as this.However, the rest of it is good. Good picture and it’s very light weight. If not for that dang light I’d give it 5 stars."
"The picture is great.  However, there is an issue with the audio.  We keep having to unplug it and restart it, to get any sound.  Then it will be fine until the next time we turn it off.  I purchased this for my mother, who is in a nursing home.  She does not have the dexterity, nor the strength to unplug it, so she has no tv until someone comes around who can reset it for her.  I will likely have to return/exchange this, which will be a MAJOR inconvenience.  Very disappointed."
Very slow connectivity
"Great TV, however there is a bright LED light at the bottom that turns on when the TV is powered off. This light never turns off and will brighten up your whole bedroom at night. When the TV is powered on the light is off, but when the TV is off the light turns on. I did some research and it’s because the TV goes into “Standby” mode when you power it off (it never fully turns off unless you unplug it). So this is the “standby light.” In the Roku versions of this TV there’s a setting to turn off the standby light, however there isn’t a way to do so in the Fire TV versions (per TCL’s official website). This is a huge negative to the TV and I wouldn’t have purchased it if I knew this. Hopefully they do a software update soon that allows this."
"I’ve had this tv for just over a month and the sound has gone out twice in the last four days - no idea why, but unplugging it and plugging it back in brings it back to life. The remote control is extra sensitive or the tv is motion censored because sometimes it comes on by itself. I cannot watch local tv because I can’t download the Spectrum app.The bright side is it was easy to setup."
"There is no remote code for this TV for the Dish Network Hopper remote.  The Hopper remote will not control this TV.  Spoke to TCL, Dish and Amazon.  Each told me it was not there issue.If I had know this I would have purchased some other TV."
"I don’t like the Amazon layout, I’m used to Roku, and the sound goes out sometimes and we have to unplug and repower to fix."
"I purchased the TCL 40 Fire Tv back in November30, 2023 so the set is past the return date. I recently had the option to use the optical output with some new wireless headphones. The optical output would work then it would stop working. The TCL support team has been in contact with me, and we have tried several different options. I had it working one night, the next morning it was not working. Make sure you check all the output options when you receive your set. That way you will not be stuck with a set that doesn't work properly. The picture on the set is great, but I really needed the optical output to work with the new headphones. The headphones are not defective as I have checked them out on another set."
"The tv is ok. What I can't stand about it is when you turn it on and and say want to watch Netflix so you scroll to click on it, nothing happens. It's like a slow crappy phone, tablet or laptop very laggy. I end up clicking on the wrong apps I want to open. Thankfully it's only in my bedroom."
It’s not got the best sound adjustment and color.
Nice tv but super slow
If it runs for a really long time it will randomly just exit whatever you’re in & go to the Home Screen. I turned it off & back on & it worked fine
Shuts off 3 or 3 times a week. Have to turn off restart. Would not buy again  using as monitor for security cameras. Get what you pay for
There is a bright white LED bar on the bottom of the bezel that is always on ONLY on the FireTV version.  The Roku and Android version allow you to turn this off in the settings.  Amazon did not include this option in their FireTV software and confirmed this oversight on their help forum responding to complaints made as recently as October 2024.  Having to physically unplug or tape over this to sleep due to poorly implemented software is a miss.
"So I didn't do my research and bought this carelessly. I now know that I hate the FireTv interface and I would never buy another. Some of the many problems with it are the endless ads, non-intuitive interface, and more ads.It was easy to set up, lightweight, and had a decent picture for the price, but ultimately I feel I can do better."
"I really liked this TV until I had it for about 6 months. Every now and then I would turn it on and the sound wouldn't work. The only thing that would fix it was to unplug it and wait a few minutes before trying again. This is a bit of a pain since I have to pull everything out to get to the plug. It's in a hobby room so it doesn't even get used that much. The only other thing I really dislike about all FireTV's is how quickly they go to the screensaver mode, and then shut down whan you have them paused for too long. It can be pretty annoying. Overall, pretty disappointed."
"The other code needed to set up this account wouldn't send.  After literally 2hrs on the phone and 6 different ""specialists"", I still have no access to my channels.  It's a tv. No need for all the extra sign ins,  codes,  extra steps.  Absolutely ridiculous.  It's going back ASAP.  Pic/ sound quality seems OK but I can't really tell."
"We bought this for our daughter a few months ago.  The volume on this TV doesn’t work when it’s first turned on and you have to unplug the TV from the wall and plug it back in and then it will work. A month ago I reached out to TCL to see if they will send a replacement. We’ve gone back-and-forth in email with different requests from them. I had to show him a video of what happened. Send pictures of the tv. I asked them to send me a new TV and I would return this one. Finally, they said they wanted to send a tech out to my house to try to repair it. I don’t want this repaired I would like it replaced with one that works. It’s a brand new tv so it should work.  We still have not reached a resolution, and I feel like this is the most simple warranty claim in the world and could have been resolved right away. I will never buy an other one again."
"Needed an Amazon Fire TV. Pic is clear. I bought this TCL TV to connect to a TCL soundbar that I have., but it's not compatible."
"Out of the box, the picture was washed out, much too bright, and virtually no contrast.  After a long effort of adjustment, the picture (depending on what you are watching) was tolerable.  I know this is not a top-tier TV so I cannot expect such.  But, it was just not worth it.  I purchased a different brand, slightly more expensive, and it was a world of difference."
"I know this was an inexpensive television, but I'm very disappointed in the picture quality. Grainy an when scenes are dark extremely poor definition. I should have returned it."
You get what you pay for. I bought two of these and on one the sound stopped working while on the other the remote stopped syncing to the TV. The company is supposedly mailing another remote but it’s been a week.
"Excellent value for the $$ spent. However, the sound needs to be ""augmented"" by a sound bar.  But the TV itself has highly effective color and overall picture definition.  But still trying to figure out how to adjust ""aspect ratio"" on it...as nothing on the instruction cover that feature.  Manufacturer provided instructions for another TCL Smart TV...but NOT MY MODEL.  And, by the time they did get back to me....I had already returned the TV for a full refund."
The sound was terrible and the picture was lame. Ended up with a Samsung and am much happier overall.
This was a good product for the price. Taking some getting used to but I like it and have no complaints.
"This tv worked great when I first got it. After a few weeks, though, it’s started glitching once in a while where the sound won’t work at all unless I unplug the tv and reboot it, then it’s fine. It’s not worth the hassle of returning, but I am a little disappointed."
The volume frequently does not work when turned on. Most of the time it starts working if I unplug the TV for a bit and plug it back in.
The tv seemed alright for my kid’s room at first. Within a week of use the screen flickers regardless of resets or adjustments. Before the screen flicker started the overall quality of the picture seems less than 1080p. The darker areas are very pixelated and there’s noticeable banding.I wouldn’t recommend this tv to anyone for any purpose. Better off with a better name brand.
Had issues with the sound on the tv not working when you turned it on after about 3 weeks. Every time I turned on the tv I had to go into the settings and restart the tv. Returned it and bought another thinking it was a fluke and the new one does it occasionally too. Dont recommend.
"I've had this tv since September 27th. Yesterday the wifi just stopped. My network disconnected and the WiFi button will not change from off, no matter what I do. I'm getting an Ethernet cable but this is 🐂💩"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Update as of October 20, 2023- I guess after this review posted some one some where did a software update and the TV now has an airplay option. It would have been nice to be notified of that, instead of just finding out when my husband checked one last time before packing it up.I wanted to order a new TV during Prime Days in October. I researched this TV by search for TV with Apple Airplay, and confirmed it was a feature. It is in the Amazon listing, and is on the box that was delivered, but as the video shows, it doesn’t work. My spouse who is better with tech then me contacted Amazon, and after about an hour on the phone, it still didn’t work. The support person took his email and sent a ticket requesting this video and photos of the packaging, which was submitted. We haven’t heard anything, and still have this TV that does not Apple Airplay. If your thinking of purchasing so you can use Airplay DO NOT!!!I have worked with Amazon Support before and am surprise how badly this is being handled!"
There is always a bright light on at the bottom of the tv
"The TV itself was what you would expect for the price.  The remote on/off switch did not function at all.  Tech support could not help so I returned item.  The return was a nightmare by Amazon.  I requested a pick up scheduled for the next day.  I made certain to stay home all day and was.  No one came.  Later that night I noticed a first attempt sticker on my doorstep by UPS.  They never rang the door bell or knocked on the door.  Did they expect me to leave a TV outside my house all day long for any robber to pick up?  I was infuriated.  Be warned that Amazon does not care about pick ups.  No window of time provided, no monitoring of items, no message updates, nothing.  You are on your own and left to the incompetence of pick up drivers who can do whatever they want."
"The picture is good and the sound is ok...a little tin can like, but  I'm so disappointed that when it's turned off the remote sensor light is very bright.  I bought this TV for my bedroom and I have to get up after turning it off and stuff a thick cloth over the remote sensor because it's such a bright violet light it prevents me from sleeping. Of course the remote won't work when the light is covered. I would not recommend this TV for a bedroom if you like sleeping in the dark."
"Seemed like a decent TV at first. Setup was pretty easy and the UI is easy to navigate (albeit a little slow right out of the box). BEWARE, audio quality is pretty bad. It sounds like a mix of muffled and tin-y. Changed a bunch of audio settings but still couldn’t get it to where it sounds better than our super old prior TV.With how cheap the TV is, it wouldn’t make sense to buy a cheap sound bar as it wouldn’t improve sound quality. And if I were to buy an expensive sound bar, then I should have just bought a nicer TV.  Might be fine for a kids TV if you don’t care, but I care about audio quality so I’ll be returning this one and buying a nicer one."
"As those have mentioned, do not use in Bedroom as the power standby light cannot be disabled for this Fire TV version and it is BRIGHT!.  Hopefully a software update is release soon...."
"Amazon fire TV keeps freezing, I have had to reset multiple times. Slow internet connection doesn't run on high-bandwidth.  Amazon/ups charges $8 for pick and return they lost my last TV which I ended up paying $142.00. Amazon internal policy seems to trump the Americans with Disabilities Act as I'm disabled the closest ups store to me is 2 1/2 hours minumin by bus as can you imagine a disabled person with a large TV on the bus! To everyone out there spring for a Ruko TV, or Samsung as soon as I have saved up money I'm buying one of those and loaning this one to my roommate...."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The TV is amazing, picture quality sound and easy to use. Unfortunately, the light is a big problem for me. I have this TV for my bedroom and the light literally brightens the entire room. I need dark to sleep in. That is the only thing I don't like about the TV, and I'm ready to return it because it is affecting my sleep so much."
"The standby mode light under the TV is always on when the TV is off, and you cannot turn it off on this model.  It is so annoying"
Purchased this tv with the hopes of enjoying the tv its stuck on the registration page saying failedReached out to amazon got bounced around serval times said i should reach out to tcl and tcl said i should reach out to amazonUp to now the tv is not workingIdk how i will make it work to make it worst im not even from the USThis tv is not goodDont buy
TV is okay overall but I have been unable to get my Xfinity remote to control the power or volume.
This brand is the biggest waste of money I have ever spent! 45 days after purchase it has sound issues to the point not even a factory reset don't fix. Both amazon and TCL customer and technical service were a waste of hours of my time! They want a restocking fee on a defective item. PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND STICK TO BIGGER BETTER BRANDS AND DONT BUY THIS!
"This TV was a terrible purchase for my bedroom. Unlike the Roku version, you cannot disable the very bright light standby light that comes on whenever the TV it’s off. It stays on all night and is like a flashlight pointing directly at you. So bright I can cast a shadow with it. Unfortunately, TCL and Amazon don’t have a setting preference to disable the standby light. This makes zero sense considering I’ve read that the option to disable is available for the Roku version of this otherwise same TV. I wish Amazon or TCL would provide an update solution, but instead Amazon refers you to TCL and TCL just has a statement that equates to sorry, no solution and you’re out of luck. Otherwise, I’m pleased with the TV. It’s just like it shines the brightest unwanted night light in my bedroom."
"I swear smart tvs continue to get stupider and so far this is the pinnacle for me. Super glitchy, jumps all over the place, not ideal remote setup (who wants prime music on there over an actual streaming service?), bad sound quality. TV quality should be improving but this is the worst one I’ve ever owned. I wouldn’t throw your box away I’m mad I can’t return it now"
"TCL is JUNK and they do not stand behind their warranty.  After 45 mins on the phone performing steps to trouble my issue in order for it to be covered under warranty they want a video of me performing all the steps they had me try for the 45 mins.  Ummm, WHAT?  Say that to start with!!  Even through they walked me through all the steps.  And I'm supposed to remember all the steps in the 45 mins.  WILL NEVER BUY A TCL PRODUCT AGAIN!!!"
"The picture was pretty good for this price point, however, I returned this TV as the sound was terrible I mean, even watching a news program sounded like garbage. I would recommend if you do buy this to use a sound bar as it has Bluetooth capability."
"I purchased this tv about 4 months ago. It arrived promptly and on time. Unfortunately, it broke after about 5 months. I contacted Amazon and was directed to TCL customer service. I have been trying to get a new tv or my money back for the last month. I have had to provide numerous items to prove I bought the tv including a receipt, a picture of a non working tv(including a video), finding a white sticker on the back of the tv and writing the date and void with black marker(TCL complains they can't read the printing on an inch long sticker) and many other items. Even though TCL told me in an email that my tv was still under warranty I have not received anything but more emails requesting more items. DO NOT BUY"
Television has sat in the exact same place on in our room since it came out of the box. Turned it on tonight and the sound has suddenly stopped working!! Not a sound… even on the highest volume. Extreme disappointed that a practically brand new tv just stopped working for no reason whatsoever.
"This is a fine TV, but the LED light on the front of the set cannot be turned off. It’s incredibly bright at night and annoying. According to the manufacturer, there’s no way to shut it off. I won’t be purchasing more of these TVs despite the overall quality being pretty nice."
TCL is total junk. Spend a little more for a better quality TV. I’ve had this TV about a year and it won’t stay connected to the internet. I have No other issues with my other TV’s or devices when using the WiFi. This TV is garbage
"WHen you turn off the TV, there is a bright standby light that you cannot toggle off. Apparently, you used to be able to to, but a software upgrade made this go away. I have to physically unplug it every night when I go to bed."
You get the exact tv you would expect from this price point
"We like the size of the tv and it has a great picture.  However, it is always is updating!!!  I wish we would have gotten a TLC Roku tv instead of the Firestick version."
"I absolutely detest this Amazon Fire TV.  The home screen is cluttered with ads and suggestions, the app icons are TINY, and there are only a few apps directly on the screen. The WORST! WORST! WORST! thing is the SLEEP TIMER, which I use every night. On my old TCL Roku tv, I only had to press two buttons while the program I was watching kept playing. Now, I have to close the program, return to the Home Screen, scroll to display settings, down to the timer, back to the home screen, back to the program… I counted 26 selections to make!!!!!!"
Nice TV but doesn’t satisfy our intended use
I’m so irritated at this tv. I had to replace my bedroom tv after accident flinging the remote into it. I loved my previous TCL tv but this one is crap. The Five tv is constantly glitching. The sound stops working randomly and I have to reset the tv. It’s really annoying. And now they’ve implemented ads when you turn it on unless you pay Amazon $2.99 a month to remove the ads. Damnit. I’m pissed.
Took out of the box and plugged in screen did not work . Becomes a huge hassle as to have to return product that should have worked correctly to begin with. Would not recommend buying from this supplier to anyone
The tv has Netflix button on remote but it does not support Netflix or YouTube. Kinda disappointed.
Tries to attach to Alexa regardless of telling it no. Pluto often is grey screened (the channel I actually like). Going to traded it out for a RUKO.
"I wrote a previous review when I first received this. My review was bad because I wasn't able to watch it, no stand included and no bolts for securing it to a wall mount. It only gets worse. Had it for a week, was gone for a long weekend and when I got back, the picture wouldn't come In, faded out, was digitized or some other weird interference made it not viewable. After an hour of turning it on and off the picture came in but if you leave the tv off for more than a couple of hours, the whole process starts over. The picture I included in the review shows the tv on. I can hear the sound but no picture. The biggest p.o.s. of any appliance I think I've ever bought."
"Don't waste your money. After I loaded my apps, and started using the TV it had(s) an issue that requires me to unplug the TV and turn it back on for audio every single time. Notified TCL and one of the steps I was supposed to do was reset it back to defaults which would delete all loaded apps. Since I refused to do that they will not replace it. Like I said, don't waste your money and time."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Color periodically goes to purples and greens while watching tv. 5 months old. Customer service brings you through endless troubleshooting steps. Eventually it clears, then comes back a couple days later, so you have to start all over with them. Not worth the effort."
I had to send the TV back. I was having to restart the TV just about every time I used it. Sometimes the apps would not load and the screen would go blank. Once the volume was not there until I restarted the TV. These are just a few issues.
"I have owned this tv for about four months and the sound is gone. I have tried resetting it, turning it off and back on numerous times, clicking the mute button and a few other things. The volume has never been very loud but at least I could hear it."
Not user friendly for an 89-year-old. Other than that it's a great TV.
Missing parts and manual  messed up for a brand new tv
"No included remote. No buttons. TCL app wants access to your phone and pushes constant advertisements AND DOESN'T WORK. Can't setup fire tv remote. Can't setup another remote. Can't access internet to use app remotes because you can't setup TV without remote. This is the worst product ever. Who knows if it even works, you can't set it up. I hope these executives die alone, and they suffer long beforehand. Horrible, horrible, horrible."
Sound stops working when on apps like netflix . you have to go to live TV to get the sound back.
"I chose this TV because I was excited to get a 'bleeding edge' Bezel-less LED TV..This TV most definitely has a bezel, and it's performance is mediocre compared to my Toshiba equivalent with a bezel at the same price."
"This TV is used as a menu in a restaurant. When displaying the menu through the USB, the screen will automatically shut off after about 6 minutes. All setting have been changed, and there is no fix. I've had multiple people work on it, been all over the internet, and called in to TCL. I'm giving them away and buying something else."
"The colors on this set are washed out, the edge lighting is very prominent in dark scenes, there is no support for HDR content, and the sound is muddled to the point I have trouble making out conversations.  To make matters worse, navigating the Amazon Fire interface is extremely slow, and the UI is laden with so many rotating ads and useless 'junk' apps it is painful to use (much less see).If you want a small, inexpensive TV for a dorm room, this may be worth a look based upon price alone, but I would recommend spending an extra hundred and get something that actually looks & sounds a bit better."
Bought on prime Day. Worked well for 3 weeks.  Completely froze up next time i turned it on!!  There are other reviews of this same tv bought on prime day and same issue.  Seller was offloading a bunch of defective TV's!!  Amazon should be offering immediate free replacement TV's for marketing defective junk!!
"Purchased in Nov ‘23 and developed problems in March ‘24.  Problems are sound has diminished to where have to increase into 40’s, unable to view OTA channels.  If it wasn’t for the TIVO EDGE I wouldn’t be unable to access the local channels.  Takes a long time to turn on.  Sometimes there’s dual sounds like 2 channels on at the same time.  Sometimes while watching the screen will go black and no sound as if off.  Sometimes whenever it’s off sounds will come on which is creepy especially when asleep and end up getting up to unplug it. Have to unplug to reboot to try to get it back on track.  Aside from all that, it has an ok picture.  Wish I could return it but passed the window for that.  I will look for something else and trash this because it’s basically useless."
"The logistics of this tv are fine enough- but for some reason on the Fire TV model, there isn’t an option to turn off the standby light. We put this tv in our bedroom and the light is far too bright at night. If this drives you nuts, too, take a pass."
"I was excited about this purchase but quickly disliked it thereafter. I am unable to download HBOmax app on this tv, because of my location even though I have no problem downloading it on my other none fire tv devices. Had I known this beforehand I wouldn’t have made this purchase. Also, when watching YouTube it keeps buffering and freezing quite often, it’s not the WiFi because I don’t have these issues with other devices. I don’t like it and I’m disappointed."
Got my TV today was so excited. But as I put it together there is not a power cord. Ridiculous
I got a faulty TV and Amazon provided some tech support steps which lead to an escalation of support needed by TCL tech support which ended up rendering the TV completely useless. They opened a warranty case that took them 2 months just to tell me to call Amazon as they would NOT honor the warranty. Nonsensical runaround with HORRIBLE customer service.  Amazon was great and credited me for the TV.
I made the mistake of not opening the package right away. The screen was smashed and I got ZERO on the screen when I powered it on. Now I can't return it. Garbage.
"Ordered this television in June.  Sound quit working 2 weeks later.  Ordered a return/replacement, which came but in the meantime the sound started working again.  So sent that television back.  After doing that the sound has gone out again.  Trying to get a replacement again from Amazon is a nightmare.  Finally got the replacement and now the sound has quit also."
This TV has too much treble and not enough bass even with adjustments to the max on both. Really wish I would’ve made a better choice. No stereo sound whatsoever.
"I tried to use this screen monitor with my telephone and apps like Disney+ and Amazon prime video I don’t have Wi-Fi and I don’t need it when I tried to hook up an HDMI, cable and adapter I kept getting signals at it assumed I was copying the movie and wouldn’t function and scrambled the screen so that I couldn’t see it I was only trying to watch the TV from my telephone to the TV and it blocked me and said that I wasn’t giving it enough protection from copying. I would be careful if I were you but I called the manufacturer they said oh it doesn’t work without Wi-Fi and I said you didn’t put that in your advertisement  I wanted to use it as a standalone monitor"
…..unless you buy another remote to talk to the “system” to dim the led nightlight.  would not have bought had we known tv functions unavailable.
"Bought because it advertises as a special feature and shows a beveless picture and screen. I assure that's false advertising! I called the company and they said my picture is correct. It has a bevel on all four sides. So Do Not Buy if you expect a full 32"" screen. Also, since the first week, it shows errors for being out of storage and also for need to restart router. JUNK!"
Works great just wish I had purchased a bigger one.
"Not sure if the issue is TCL or Amazon - I've talked to both the manufacturer and Amazon tech support, neither were able to solve the issue and it sucked several hours away from life, because everyone has time for that.Troubleshooting -Setting up the TV:Step 1 choose your language.Step 2 connect to WiFi.From there the TV will automatically check for updates. Our other Fire TV has no issues with this and it's furthest from the router, unlike this TV which is less than 10ft.No matter what steps we took for setup...manual, QR code, basic TV, 6 factory resets, unplugging the TV & router, etc...everything results in the ""Unable to update your TV"" error in photo.It simply will not move past this screen rendering the TV wholly unusable."
"I have been dealing with sound issues since I bought this TV from TCL, the sound just goes off and you have to reset the TV to get it back on. I will advise you not to purchase this as the technical support will take you through months of ""trouble shooting"" while your return period with amazon expires. And they will keep going until you are fully furstrated with them. I had one support staff tell me that I needed to do the last trouble shooting which was to factory reset the TV and this was the last step of the warrantee process! After resetting my TV and resigning into every streaming platform, the issue still persisted. I placed a call to tech support for warantee and they told me I had another ""last"" troubleshooting step! What a joke!"
Glitches and grainy
"THE PRODUCT COME DETECTIVE , PLEASE SET UP EXCHANGE ASAP"
"The picture is okay but the tiny remote is worthless so you'll have to buy a good one, with actual buttons on it. The legs are too far apart and it doesn't look so steady on it's feet so I'm just hoping it doesn't just fall over one day."
"Do not buy this piece of junk. I purchased one of these TVs back in October 2020. Fast-forward three years, and the TV has stopped working. It went into a rebooting cycle, turning on and off every few seconds. From what I read online, this is a common problem with Samsung TVs. I paid $500 for this thing and got 3 years out of it. What the hell? Poor quality. My previous Sony tv lasted me 9 years. I will never buy a Samsung TV again. DO NOT BUY."
"Purchased this model Samsung, March 2021. The television is now a little over two years old and does not work. The screen suddenly turned black and the TV shut off and tries to turn back on then turns back off, then turns back on each portion of the cycle lasts about 8 to 10 seconds, but will never come on. I would have to assume the warranty is only for one year , possibly because of a lack of confidence in the product. it was great while itI was working but two years for that kind of money it’s not worth it. Of course I will get another TV as opposed to fixing this and I am quite certain I will not be another Samsung."
This is a very nice TV with fairly good reception my problem with it is that unless your acouple of feet away it's hard to read or see the channels and has a delay whe you change to another program and a number of times it won't go on then you will have to reset it does the same with the sound.Then there are times when I will change the Chanel and it will not be the Chanel I selected but I let the warranty expire so my advise is to  continue to extend your warranties because sometimes you may think it just may be one small glitch then other things start popping up.
"The 32S350G TV does not get along with YouTube Shorts.  Either the TV software or YouTube resizes the screen aspect ratio while playing YouTube Shorts.  The video's zoom in automatically and crops to resize, and half the picture is lost, and the figures on the screen appear long and skinny out of proportion .  I tried changing and resetting screen aspect ratios, resolution, app update, resetting the TV, and even called TCL customer service who could not resolve the issue.  I bought two of these 32 inch TVs and the issue is the same with both...  The only solution i was able to work out was to buy and APPLE TV 4K for $129 + tax.  Apparently the software in the Apple TV is compatable with YouTube Shorts and i have it connected to TCL TV via HDMI.  So here is but a TV expecting it to be fully function and now I am only using it as a monitor for Apple TV, and now have to deal with two remotes and devices.  Granted the TCL TV is reasonably priced , however the APPLE TV cost as much as the TV.  for the same cost of the TCL $138 plus Apple TV $129 i could have bought a higher resolution TV with more functionality at $267.  Very disappointed as use YouTube shorts a lot.  So far everything else works ok for the price."
"I've had this TV since June of this year and I am NOT impressed. First of all, the transition from app to app is painfully slow. I need to repeat my request more than once to the voice command feature and when the unit is OFF there is a blue/white light that stays on at the bottom of the screen which is very distracting. I thought I could plug in my Amazon Fire Stick and return to normalcy, but their customer service department said that wasn't possible. I'm super disappointed."
"For the price I didnt expect much, but I at least expected the TV to work on a regular basis. Instead, after 5 months, the TV is almost un-usable. The first and most primary issue is the remote. The remote has slow response times and only works at a specific, uncomfortable angle. Half of the time, the power off button doesn't work even when other buttons are working. Oddly enough, sometimes I hardly even tap the remote on accident and all of a sudden my TV is showing ""Tubi"" or ""TCL Channel"" (who even uses these services? why are they included in the primary remote functions?). There is no easy way on the remote to access any of your HDMI channels. Instead, you have to go all the way to settings and scroll down. This remote only works when you don't want it to.A second annoying trait of this ""TV"" is the fact its a Google TV. Suffice to say, I will not be buying a Google TV again. The TV frequently signs out of my google account, making the TV unusable, and it's tedious to sign back in; no options to sign in on another device. Google is supposed to be leading in technology but this TV is no step up from TVs 15 years ago. The visuals, color, is fine, nothing special. However, frequently the audio just doesn't work. When the audio quits working, you have to turn the TV off then back on again. Because the power button only works sometimes, this process can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes. Nonetheless, I feel like the least I can expect of my TV is to regularly play audio, but I guess I shouldn't assume.Quick tip if you do happen to buy this TV on accident (because why would you spend money on this if not an accident): dont use the quick play options on the home screen. The home screen will display shows you've watched recently for you to ""quickly"" get back to them. However, just like everything else, this feature doesn't work half of the time. Instead, if it manages to even play the correct show, it will play a random time in the episode, without regard to where you last left off. I have never left a review on an amazon product but this TV is so bad I felt like I had a moral obligation to do so. If you want a TV that only works half of the times you use it, then this is the TV for you! If you want a TV of quality, I suggest you buy literally anything else. An antique radio would probably bring me more use than this TV. Thanks Google."
"Was looking for a ROKU TV when this one came up in my search at a $40 lower price than the one I was looking at. Didn't realize that it was NOT a ROKU TV but a GOOGLE TV. Thanks Amazon for the search results! Anyway, by mistake I ordered it. Mistake Number One.I realized it was a GOOGLE TV when I saw the box upon delivery. I decided to go ahead and install it and threw away the box. Mistake Number Two.It took over an hour to setup the TV which began with downloading firmware, then checking it, then installing it, then asking for preferences, and so on. Very irritating but I figured I only had to do this once so on I went. At this point I could have retrieved the box but didn't. Mistake Number Three.Finally, strangely enough the GOOGLE TV doesn't get along well with YOUTUBE. Given the relationship between GOOGLE and YOUTUBE I would expect better. And there is a YOUTUBE button on the remote. The big problem is that you cannot SUBSCRIBE or LIKE videos played on the GOOGLE TV. I watch a lot of YOUTUBE and am more than a little miffed about this flaw.REVISION: The problems with YOUTUBE turn out to be that the GOOGLE TV will log you out of YOUTUBE and not let you log back in. Turning the TV off and back on did not solve the problem. Ultimately, I had to UNPLUG the TV before I could log back into YOUTUBE.In addition, the remote is poorly laid out (eg. the home button is below the navigation buttons where it is hard to reach if you use the remote one-handed) and the icons on several of the buttons are cryptic (ie. you have to play with them to figure out what they do).So, having discovered this, I might still have sent it back had I recovered the box from the trash but I was too late -- the trash pick up service had already been to my house. Mistake Number Four.All in all, I wish I had purchased a ROKU TV. I wish this TV had not come up in my search for a ROKU TV. I've had some experience with ROKU and much prefer it to the GOOGLE TV. Fortunately, I have a ROKU TV in another room and can always watch my YOUTUBE videos there.Am seriously considering purchasing a ROKU DEVICE and connecting it to the GOOGLE TV to overcome all of the problems with the GOOGLE TV."
"Great addition for wife's scrapbook room - Add a composting toilet, I'd never see her again. The Google TV is a waste of time and money. The Amazon Fire TV offering is much more user friendly."
"Picture and sound is good. Google OS is ok. My only problem is that the tv powers down quite often, maybe every other day or so. Tried all of the settings including factory reset. Sometimes I have to unplug it from the wall in order to get it working. Because of this I would not recommend buying this TV"
"The tv itself is fine,  its the way google has organized everything into a labyrinth of nestled apps has me confounded and upset more often than not.  The tcl button is a hair trigger where it is constantly bringing me to some horrible television show if the remote is bumped while watching anything else.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND GOOGLE PRODUCTS. Stick with search engines, your laptops are annoying also."
"I've had this TV for 3 days so far, and each day there's a new problem.  The first day I just had trouble setting it up, but that's my fault.  The second day I had to sign into it again on my laptop.  The third day, I'd turn it on and it would turn off again.  I finally got it to stay on, but it had no sound.  The Alexa thing is useless.  I finally looked up a fix on-line (evidently this is a common problem) and got the sound back, but I had to sign in yet again.  Can't wait (NOT!) to see what tomorrow brings.  Wish I hadn't bought it.  Too frustrating.  Update:  This may seem petty, but the control doesn't even have a pause button.  ????  After fighting with this TV for a week and a half, I bought a new Insignia Fire TV, set it up, and it worked perfectly immediately."
"Removed one more star due to lack of miracast. Should have spent the extra money for a better brand. The picture quality is what's to be expected from the price point, yet is exactly as advertised. It does the job. The software lacks certain features like miracast, and does include advertisements, but is not necessary. It's simple to utilize your own box or console and never have to use the OS."
The tv itself is fine but I don’t like the Google tv format.  Have a TCL with Roku that is easier to navigate apps.  Also there is no simple way to get to the sleep timer.  You need to move out of the picture and go to 4 different screens to get to it then back out of those screens.
TV randomly stops playing selected channel and returns to home screen. Customer service has me reboot the TV to fix it. Lasts for a day or two then reoccurs.
"I know that I ordered a ""cheap"" TV to replace my old one, but was unprepared to face poor quality video when I finally got it to work only because of calling customer support because instructions were next to worthless!  It's finally working, but video quality is poor at best!"
"The first one arrived with a cracked screen.  The packaging did not protect it.  You could not tell it was cracked until  you turned it on.  The second one worked well for 2 weeks before the color saturation adjustment would not adjust.  The picture was looking a little pale so I tried to adjust it. I called the ""help"" number on the limited paperwork that was included with the set.  They had me do this and do that and factory resets.  Nothing changed.  They had me send videos to prove what was saying was true.  They called the next day and wanted me to do more trouble shooting.  I told them I was sorry but I didn't have the time.  I packed it up and sent it back to Amazon.  I told them they could get it back from Amazon and trouble shoot it as much as they want.  Any manufacturer can have a problem with one of their units.  How you take care of the problem is what makes the difference."
I was replacing an older TV that had a crisp defined picture. This is full even though I worked the controls to get it right . Then ALL of my stream channels began to buffer. I was on the phone with cable ) who doesn’t love that? Then Netflix - then Roku then AMA on Prime TV at separate times. One call took over an hour only for them to have me call another company to fix the problem. It’s this TV. Only since replacing the old tv with this one - have  I had such problems. I already returned one tv bc I erroneously purchased the wrong  -I don’t even know what it’s called but I was told that I needed 1080 instead of what I originally purchased. So I sent the other new TV back to get this TV. I’m pretty unimpressed with this purchase.
"Overall good but the pictures (even the ones on the product box!) are lies.  It shows a nearly invisible bezel with the picture going nearly to the edge.  In reality, there is a 1/2"" blackspace to the edge like basically every tv.  It does not look like the pictures.  Otherwise, good cheap tv."
"Doesn't run well. Apps glitch, freeze and skip with great internet connection. Picture isn't great. Just all around bad experience."
I’ve had the tv for about five months and it’s already acting like the sound is going to go on one of them. It’s in my bedroom so there’s been no spills in it or anything like that. Kinda upset seeing how I didn’t have a tv in my room because I couldn’t afford one.
When you are watching it will blackout all of sudden. You will have to plug in and out then it will work.
"My concern is the sound.  Not just the echo-yness, but the frequent popping and crackling sound.  Expecting the speakers to give up right in the middle of my favorite show.  Time will tell.  Also seems to start in different places every time I turn it on, buy that's a minor annoyance."
Can only see picture clearly when standing in front. Wish it had a center base not 2 feet. Make difficult to angle on dresser.
I bought this and replaced it with another just like it. It works but the sound sometimes doesn't. I restart the TV and the sound works. Otherwise a solid TV. Remote is touchy. I like the overall user experience.
"I have 2 TCL tvs. 1 roku and this 1. Use Direct TV as my main app and there are days where this tv won't load sound, won't react to the remote, freezes, can't get off the launch menu. I'm currently in day 3 trying to watch my shark week recordings and can't get to them on this tv. Replaced remote batteries 2x. No issues with the other tv. Am about to buy a new one and put this one out for bulk trash pickup this week."
"This tv does not work well.It is hard to turn it on; it takes several tries to turn it on, and then  it does not work. The screen keeps turning itself off and on with no picture.I wish I had not discarded the box so I could return it.Do not buy this product!"
It works with a Roku stick. But when you turn on the TV you have navigate out of the TCL home screen. It doesn't go automatically to your HDMI where you have your Roku stick plugged in.
"The TV displays game consoles and streams videos at proper 1080p, but the main TV interface and any apps are stuck at 720p with no way to change it whatsoever."
"Picture is not as sharp as the description says. That was dissappointing.  It's a nice , regular picture.Light weight, thin frame, full frame pic."
"I have had 3 TCL TVs. They have Roku and I have always been satisfied. When my wife dropped our 32inch I bought this thinking I was getting a Roku, my mistake. This POS is the slowest and dumbest TV I've ever had. Trying to navigate with the remote is enough to drive you crazy. When you push a button nothing happens, not at first. So you push it again or push another button, then it decides to catch up and sends you hurdling through a frustrating ride into a surprise... Where will you end up? Nobody knows. We are talking 15-30 second delays. It's not the wifi, even navigating the home screen is worse than trying to walk thru the sand in steel toe boots.Remember dial up and AOL in the 90s? Did you like that? BC if you did you'll love waiting on this tv to sludge thru the simplest of tasks.Also, I cannot figure out some of the settings. We put the dog in the guest room when we leave and like to leave the tv on for him. This TV exits the app after 4 hrs and goes to the silent screensaver. I have gone through the settings several times, pointless. Completely pointless. Like trying to eat soup with a fork.Like I said, TCL are decent TVs... Just buy the Roku!"
This tv would've been great except I had to return because the hdmi inputs only worked sporadically. It would cut out while in use and i use hdmi connection every day to stream from my laptop. So annoying. Everything else was great.
"Absolutely the worst instructions, all 1 paragraph of them I have ever seen. The remote doesn't physically match the instructions. We use Antenna not cable or Google. Needed to be a PHD to get it to work, their web site doesn't have this model on it for help. After 2 days on my own I got it to work. from now on I buy from a store and see it work first."
Sad I opened the  box  nice tv  bur no remote control  are stand  or instructions  books. We'll I guess if I was going to get one of the four the television  is the one now I can spend the week trying to find replacement  for the rest of them.
"TV takes multiple tries to turn on.  Will ""turn on"" but screen stays black.  Takes a couple tries sometimes.  Can be very, very frustrating."
"No visible VOLUME CONTROL OR MUTE BUTTON!  After setting up TV, read all instructions.  Remote control shown in manual IS NOT THE SAME ONE THAT CAME WITH THE TV.  Chat with TCL for 30 minutes and had to send photo of my remote before they determined THE VOLUME CONTROL AND MUTE BUTTON IS ON THE SIDE and is not visible.Difficult to set up the entire tv, the settings does not address how to add favorite tv stations so I had to spend 40 minutes figuring out how to do that.  Google TV is zero help, they wanted to sign me up for paid answers.  Failure of TCL to supply correct manual led to a lot of frustration."
"This TV is a control freak or designed by one, it’s keep asking me to “Verify it’s you” select “sign in, switch account or network & internet” while I only used it as a monitor, now I can’t use any other functions to get through it.GOOGLE, DON’T BE EVIL!Now I notice the remote control acting erratically.Google, please, stay out of hardware!"
"It was a great price, and I have three other TCL TV's, what I didn't realize was, that there is a difference between Google TV and Roku TV and I can't find Discovery + on the Google TV, this is my favorite app, which makes the TV useless for me. What a waste of my money."
"This is the worst TV ever  nothing but problems. It’s slow, (no it’s not my internet or connection issues) it shuts down and closes programs, delayed response, it’s skips, and closes. It freezes then won’t turn off.It takes about 15 minutes to even get it to come on and load a show… if it even stays on.It looses connection with my Alexa 90% or more of the time.  I’m incredibly disappointed with this TV. Do not get the Google Tv. Regular TCL Roku tv I have is totally fine… this model is trash.Customer service was not helpful in understanding the issue or willing to help with a replacement or exchange."
"Nice little tv. Great price, but I use for streaming and it buffers alot!"
"This TV delivers all you can expect for the price point, but the slowness and instability of Google TV OS is suspect. Search speed is adequate but sometimes jerky to respond. Software updates take a while. And apps sometimes reset for no apparent reason. I'm a Roku user primarily, so this review is in comparison to that experience."
Got the package in a timely matter only to be disappointed by finding out that there is no remote in box or screws for the small legs to hold the TV upright. SMH
"The image quality is commensurate with its low price.  The only negative is the black colors, I have a 12 year old Samsung TV and they have better black tones.  Another negative point is that the TV sometimes turns off by itself, I don't know if it was an operating system error and finally some smart man decided to unnecessarily put a code sticker on the screen, which I had to remove with isopropyl alcohol 😒"
"I bought this for my camper. Very disappointed. I can't believe how slow it is. If watching a movie and half way through, the next day to continue you start again from the beginning. Would not recommend."
"Too much Google.  Set up takes a long time to go through all the Google screens.Once on, to get to the HDMI 1 port takes a couple of steps.I want to turn on a TV and start watching immediately, not have to go through several screens every time.I bought this by mistake, I wanted the TLC Roku TV which is much better.I returned it and got the TLC Roku TV."
"This device asked me to set up Google Home on my Android phone and from there it got worse. There are absolutely no setup directions, the print on the remote is tiny (and it has no numbers for selecting channels) Then it said I had to couple the ""TV"" with my Wi-Fi. It didn't work. When I finally figured out how to make it work without all that fuss, it still was very difficult, again because there were no instuctions. Then after I got it set up, it turned out that it was just a shill for Googles streaming resources, with an 800 item guide in very small print that had all of the ""free"" places you could go and buy various movies, etc. it seems like a scam to me, pure and simple. If you want a Google streaming menu with seveeral TV channels thrown in, apparently at random, buy it. If you want a TV where you can make your own choices of channels, i would stay away from this gimmicky contender."
"I've bought several TCL tvs and was very happy with those.  However, this time I bought the Google assistant tv and it's been a pain to set up.  In addition, I'm not able to download the Spectrum app...very frustrating."
The television is slow to process commands and to load the streaming services. 800Mbps download speed with Asus AImesh so it's not an Internet issue.
"Bought this to replace an older TCL Roku TV thinking that all streaming apps would be compatible. However, one of my favorite apps ""Kanopy"" for viewing films via the library is not supported by Android software.Also the TV frequently has glitches with the search bar feature requiring a full factory reset to fix.Picture quality is good but overall frustrating that the product is inconveinent to use (re: search bar) and not a true replace for Roku feature"
"Ordered this, unpacked it started setup only to find out you cant use it without a Google account. Not a fan of Google so packed it up and shipped it back!"
After doing all the updates getting the television set up. The speakers did not work. Super scratchy... Returning for a replacement
"We've had this TV less than a month.  Already we are having issues.  Random issues.  Sometimes when we turn it on, it shuts off right away.  This can happen two or three times in a row.  Sometimes when turned on, no sound.  Have to turn it off then on again.Would not buy this brand again."
"I was replacing a simple television with this one.  The old one was small, but I couldn't find one smaller than 32 inches which I can tolerate, but don't like.  It's a small space.  I hate the fact that I cannot synch it to my cable provider's remote so I can't get local news and the like, just these shows provided by the tv that I find terminally uninteresting.  I'm having a more tech savvy person come to see what she can do, but it should be simple.  So although the tv was cheap, it isn't a good value if it is impossible to use the way I want."
"About two weeks ago the tv stopped playing Hulu. I deinstalled and reinstalled Hulu. All the other TVs in the house, (TCL) play fine. Things like youtube work fine. All other devices in the house work fine. There is no solution to the problem. I am going to buy a TCL TV and throw this piece of junk in the trash."
TV arrived with a shattered screen. Forced to send this one back and had to purchase another one and wait for weeks to get my money back. Not a great experience.
This is great for fun and gaming. Not worth the money. Wanted a 2nd TV. Buy or search something elsewhere. Speed is slow. Fine using  Smart TV. It's junk.
"I bought this television about 2 months ago. I don't like it. The problems I've experienced are as follows: (1) the remote control is non-responsive most of the time; (2) the audio does not work consistently (very often there's absolutely no sound); and (3) the tv is difficult to turn on (sometimes I can stand directly in front of the tv, with new batteries in the remote, and I can't get the tv to turn on). These functions are basic to any tv."
"Does not perform the functions listed in the description. The photo slideshow only works if connected to a keyboard and after trying 9 different memory sticks, not one worked; the system kept looking for programs that can only be found on a computer.  Don't waster your time or money."
"This is shockingly terrible.  I am 50 and this is the worst item I have ever bought-not the worst TV-the worst ITEM EVER in my life. The picture quality was awful, it could not download Hulu, it buffered, the ""Smart"" feature were unresponsive, and I feel like I set my money on fire. In fact, doing that would have been more productive.  I do not know how or why this company remains in business as this was horrific. Run away from this or give it as a gift to someone you despise. I could not have made a larger mistake than what I did purchasing this TV.  Please learn from my lack of judgement."
Update: Found the missing items at the bottom after struggling to remove the styrofoam.Had to send it back anyway the very next day. Watched it the first night. It worked okay just had to get used the slow reaction time when using the remote. Turned it on the next day and there was no sound! Sent it back for a refund.
Screen was cracked on arrival
"There is too much demand for the processing power of this tv. Google TV is not right for this tv. Too underpowered.  I did had to restart the t v, unplug it replug it, to be able to get the sound to come on 2x twice since owning the tv for half a month.  I have a another cheap TV, that has roku installed which work alot better."
"This is the first review I’ve ever written, but that is how much I hate this tv 😅 I have three TCL Roku TVs and I figured I would give GoogleTV a try for this small space…what a mistake! Right from the start, just setting it up was an absolute nightmare and far slower than any TV should be in 2024. Some days, the volume doesn’t work, other days, it turns on to a blank screen and won’t take me to the main dashboard. I’ve reset the device more than 5 times in one month, compared to having zero issues ever with Roku operating systems. I truly expected more from Google 😕"
"Not very good picture, sound quality sucks."
Froze 4 times during initial setup. TV takes 10 to 30 seconds to respond to input from remote. Froze every time I used it over the first 3 days. I returned it.
Picture quality very poor.  Sound qual[ty is good.  Navigation is  very difficult.
"it is difficult to use,it deleted all my subscritions with no wat to recover"
"Worst TV ever!Have to turn off and on several times before it’ll finally stays on, It shuts off  on its own, when it comes on the volume doesn’t work, have to shut it off and restart, a couple times before you hear the volumeDon’t buy it!!"
Complicated TV to handle.
"Ordered this for my elderly mom for Christmas for her bedroom. We have had nothing but problems with it from day one. It turns off randomly, volume goes in and out...it's too late to return it now, I'm sure. Even my son looked at it (who was a Best Buy top TV salesman) and couldn't resolve the issues.I would never purchase this brand again, ever.No regret with seller....just the awful product/brand. Wish I could ship it back!!!!"
"Had good luck with all TCL tvs I bought, but stay away from this one.  Already one day had no sound.  Now can’t change channels.  I bought the warranty policy. We will see how they do. But for 140 bucks.  It’s not worth it at all. My bad. And Hulu fails to load virtually every night."
The TV is not the advertised 32”. Not even the box it comes in is 32” let alone the TV itself. It works great but I’m really dissapointed in the size.
"From the start, it was buggy.  The TV would randomly return to the home screen or just turn off.  It didn't happen too often,  but still annoying as hell.  Then recently, it had some kind of seizure with the screen flickering on and off.  After that, ther is no longer any sound.  I'd return it, but unfortunately I've had it too long.  I will not buy this brand ever again."
"This is a good TV however, the unit I received is experiencing intermittent audio.  To resolve the problem, the TV has to be completely unplugged for a restart.I simply want to have Amazon send me a replacement unit.  Sadly, this is not an option.  You would think a link labeled ""Return or Replace"" would have the option to select the same item purchased."
"This tv was a nightmare to set up, having to download and install another app. If you already have everything Google then you may be ok. Everything I have is Fire TV based. I will be paying better attention when buying another TV to make sure it is not a Google TV."
"the sound is hollow and high pitched, picture is second best , remote is difficult to handle and channels jump when changing 2 at a time and power on channel layout is hard ro navigate, run for the hills"
"The TV itself is fine but when I tried to download other apps than what was already on the TV it says “your device is not compatible with this version.” I wanted to download Hulu, Disney plus and Max but they were all not compatible??? I don’t get how if this is supposed to be a SMART TV. I had a roku TCL TV previously that was much better than this google TV. I wouldn’t buy this version."
They sent the wrong screws and as I was trying to screw in the bottoms one of the cheap screws snapped off in the TV. So now I have a trash TV in my house that isn't properly secure.
"1). Does NOT cast without wifi.2). Sound and reception from air attenea stopped working steadily after 2 weeks.3).  While moving the TV closer to reception, the cheaply made screen broke.Not worth it!!!"
"hook it up to my TV antenna you have a dozen or more ways to choose input , BUT THERE'S  NO INPUT FOR TV ANTENNA WHY MAKE THINGS DIFFICULT TO HOOK IT UP ,JUST TO WATCH TV  PIECE OF JUNK  !!!!"
"This thing failed right out of the box. That and the panel for the HDMI, USB etc was loose and wouldn't accept any plug ins. Customer service was horrible. Like they wanted me to just abandon any hope of help. I did, so it's going brice and I couldn't be happier (at this price point). ack. Today I replaced this junk with a Hisence TV. Same size, same price and I am very happy with that purchase."
Here's the TV in less then a year old what a piece of junk now I have no tv save your money
"TV processing is slow - remote response is super slow, everything is slow in the browser, etc."
"TV never really allowed a stable WiFi connection. After setting up the WiFi and entering the password the WiFi status showed disconnected. Go to WiFi setup and it shows connected. Then no access to internet and the status shows disconnected again,  Not worth seeing what eventually happens. Plus, the Google operating system is really frustrating to deal with after having a ROKU tv."
"After one hour of use, the internal speakers stopped working. I would send it back, if I wasn't planning on running sound through a surround sound system. I would recommend you purchase a different tv, as this one is a piece of junk."
Worst TV I've ever had. Shuts off by itself. Sometimes when I turn it on there is no sound. Have to shut it off/on numerous times for sound. Complicated to navigate features of TV. Would never recommend TCL TV.
Had to for 3 months want come on no power at all amazon want do anything TLC support is a joke so I am stuck with a 139$ paper weight if I could have rated it a zero I would have don't buy this tv
"Worst TV you could possibly get. The screen cuts off constantly, when I'm playing video games it says the hdmi Is bad but you can hear the game music coming off the tv. Would not recommend to anyone."
"Buyers beware: theyre claim that this is a ""FullView Metal Bezel-less"" designs is pure BS.The TV absolutely has bezels that are a good half inch in width and this cannot be changed.In the photos there is no bezel but in reality, there is one.Pure and unadulterated BS."
"I've never had a TV take nearly an hour to download updates and prepare for first use, this is unacceptable for 2023 TV! User beware, give yourself at least an hour to set up!!"
It's too technical for the average person. Also Google talks and I  can't find a way to stop it. Just bought another T V.
"I am sure I did not fully read the product information. I do not like the ""Google TV"""
Images are nice. Any letters or text files look like they were printed on an old low on ink typewriter .If you blow the text up their readable but who does that all the time.
Had this tv maybe 2 weeks and volume went out.
"What a piece of garbage.  If you think this is a ""deal,"" it's not.  The remote is the worst..."
"remote turns tv on.  thats all,sometimes it takes 4-5 press start for it to come on,"
"I'm at least 45min in from plugging this piece of crap in, and now the 3rd round of updates and setup.Absolutely ridiculous"
Quit working after a couple months
"Remote doesn’t work, trying to find an alternative. Don’t waste your money on this one."
My television came broke
TV all ready broke
I guess you get what you pay for. The integrated TCL is junk.
"The Vizio D model TV I've used as a monitor for the my desktop PC went on the fritz after eight years of service. Since the original Vizio (a D32-D1 model) was so good, I decided to purchase this latest Vizio D model as a replacement.The result was less than stellar.First, the new Vizio's resolution was far below my original unit, resulting in blurry text. No setting or adjustment I made corrected this issue. Second, each time the TV is turned on, it defaults to ""Game"" mode, forcing me to open the settings and switch to ""Sports"" (the best setting for use as a monitor IMO, since there is no ""Computer"" setting as on my D1). This daily setting change quickly became annoying.After a few days, I gave up and decided to return this unit, as it was beginning to cause blurry vision and give me headaches.Watching video or TV on this monitor was fine (as long as there is no text). If you're looking to use this unit as a computer monitor for your PC, look elsewhere.Note: As the seller of this item (not Amazon) has found my reason for returning it is an ""INCORRECT RETURN REQUEST"", they have imposed a 50% restocking fee. This, even though nowhere in the product description is the maximum resolution of the TV listed. So the only way to find it won't work for my needs is to purchase it, for which I am being penalized approximately $100. Let the buyer beware."
"The sound and picture quality is great. You can set up the tv in under 10 minutes and it’s easy to do.The remote they send you has a netflix button and a couple other obscure streaming apps as well. The only one that works is Netflix. The Home Screen never loads to manually select which app you want to use, so the only way to do it is with the remote button. So I ordered a universal remote which had the Hulu and prime buttons on it. Tried that - none of the apps work, still. So the only thing I can get on this TV at all is Netflix.ordered a Roku express to add so o have access to everything, and NOW I have all the apps but have to switch my input every time I turn the tv on.Super frustrated with the fact that this smart TV is not smart at all. the picture quality and sound are good for my one bedroom apt, no soundbar needed. But the fact that I needed to order a Roku to add to my “smart” TV is absolutely ridiculous 😂"
"I've been trying to get the screws all the way in to secure the first leg to the set and it's still super wobbly.  The cause? The plastic feet have holes for the screws and the holes were not cleanly drilled out of the plastic, so there was plastic sticking up above and below the surface, making it impossible to fully tighten them. That make the feet wobbly severely. I had to remove the screws and then sand and scrape the plastic inside the screw cavity and on the outer surface of the legs. Fun? Not. It was also tricky fitting little BLACK screws into a deep BLACK cavity. I needed one hand to  hold the screwdriver, one to hold the flashlight, and a third hand to hold onto the set to help guide the screw. I don't have a third hand!There are only instructions for setting up the programming once you put the physical pieces, plus a small ""Product Information"" booklet with microscopic font. In addition the packaging says don't touch the screen, but they attach a plastic bag over the set that's open at the top of the set,  rather than open at the bottom where the legs must be attached. The industry has done a huge disservice by switching from a solid base to these flimsy plastic chicken legs.Finally, I think Vizio is to blame for the more complicated access to channels, not displaying the local (antenna) channel number on the Info screen, and not having a truly ""large"" CC captioning. I can see it but it could be a lot bigger than their version of ""Large."" Disappointed in the software that is very different from how my older, smaller Vizio set works. Ironically Amazon Prime was the most difficult to get connected because of the super complicated menu options. Very confusing. But I have it working now that I have a stand it fits on; let's hope my luck continues."
"My TV took a very long time to get set up downloading and trying get set for operation.  It never was successful in getting my account set up even though I tried multiple times via the computer and mobil phone & app.  Guess it's not that important but I'm not sure since it was not successful.I hate the internal speakers they are terrible and I'm just using the TV in my bedroom.  Kind of hate using this TV because if I turn it on I have to listen to it's internal speakers and I often can't understand what words are being said.  I used audio settings to try to get the loudest/best sound I could based on others recommendations and my experimenting still audio is no good.  I had to order a sound bar which cost close to the price of the TV but now I have to wait for it to arrive and hope that works out.There is no Spectrum App in the installed apps and I could not download it into the Vizio control center, so I have to use a current Apple TV box.  Since you have to use a Roku, Apple TV, etc to add apps you have to use one HDMI port for that and the other for sound then you're out of HDMI ports.  The Apple TV with the Apple/Spectrum remote that Spectrum sent me works much better than the Vizio control center of apps and having to use the Vizio remote the Apple/Spectrum remote is far superior and it is lighted.  The DVR through the Apple TV does buffer, pause and shows freeze, I think it might be because this Vizio TV does not support 5G connectivity, kind of a turn off for a new TV purchased in 2023.The TV seems to turn on all by itself which is annoying and distracts me when I'm trying to work or concentrate on something important.There is an annoying light that lights up real bright at times and then blinks for several minutes.  When it's pitch dark in my bedroom at night and these lights come on it is not good, it is also distracting and annoying.  When I turn off all my bedroom lights for bed it's suppose to be a peaceful time.The picture quality seems pretty good but not as good as my 2008 Samsung 32"" 1080p TV which recently started malfunctioning.  But the sound of the Samsung was way, way better than this Vizio.  Others have said that the sound is so bad because of the very thin screen.  I'd rather have a TV with decent sound than have a TV with a thin screen.  Wish I didn't have to order the sound bar to hear the dialog in my shows I watch."
"Bought this as a main TV for my small, 1 bedroom apartment to replace a Westinghouse that died. On the plus side, the picture quality is excellent with both colors and definition very clear. There are some issues with the TV though. FIRST, setting up the connection for cable TV through the Coax connection was problematic. It took 45 minutes to scan and find the channels, and then, the first time the TV was shut off and then restarted later, all the channels were gone; had to rescan and now, all the channels remain available.The volume is not as good as it should be. In a small living room, I have to turn it up to 65% to be able to consistently hear dialogue. There are NO instructions whatsoever, so you have to go online, create a Vizio account and then download the manual. Only then do you find that as there is no ""pause"" button on the remote, the ""OK"" button used for selection etc. also doubles as the pause button. Also, sometimes, when you point the remote at the TV and press a button, nothing happens. You have to keep pressing before it eventually accepts the input; it is NOT the batteries as I tried 3 different sets.ALSO, it has the frustrating habit of occasionally ""freezing"" when streaming (NOT the internet connection as the problem doesn't happen when streaming the same channel on my computer). When that happens, you have to shut off the TV using the remote, which sometimes won't work, and unplug it from the wall & then plug it back in again to get access to the main menu.In short, the problems outweigh the benefits with this unit, and with the name ""Vizio"" on it, I'm both surprised and disappointed.UPDATE: After the stream freezing for the umpteenth time, the remote not shutting the TV off so I had to unplug it and plug it back in again, the TV is going back! Just bought its replacement on Amazon - and it's NOT a Vizio!"
"I bought this tv back in november of last year as an upgrade to my 8+ year old 24 inch vizio tv. At first everything worked fine but after three months it couldn't connect to my wifi. i would get constant connection failed and just by luck after over 20 times trying it would connect but by the next day, I would be back at it again. This persisted for several months but eventually it started getting better with every update to the tv's software. After 9 months with the tv it does connect to my wifi on its own. I get the occasional issue where i have to manually select my wifi, but it connects instantly. I've never had this problem with my old 8+ year vizio tv.Another issue i have is with the youtube app on the tv. It would randomly disconnect from my phone while im watching, and i would have to close the video on my phone, re-open to the video on my phone and re-cast it to the tv. This is another problem that i never had with my old vizio tv.Besides these two issues with connectivity being the worst, there are things i do like about it compared to my old tv. The streaming software loads quick. Casting youtube to the tv loads quick and controlling the app from my phone is pretty responsive. I like that it has two hdmi ports. I dont like that the power supply cord is built into the tv. My old vizio tv and power cord were two separate items that can be easily disconnected. If my tv no longer works, i would look for another brand."
"The user interface on this TV is the most aggravating, irritating and frustrating that I have ever dealt with. If you want to watch a TV show you better start 5-10 minutes early. First you get a black screen with a red circle that spins, and spins and spins until finally you get a whole screen of crap you dont’t wand. You get all kinds of recommendations and plus’s all the streaming apps. All I want to see is the last TV channel I watched, but NO. You then have to go to a long menu on the left side and find “live TV”. Now do you get your last TV channel I?— NO! Now you get a blue screen with a spinning circle that goes on forever. Finally you get a page with a tiny screen (upper right corner) of your last channel, then you have to click on the channel and then you you get the full screen of your TV channel. Want to change channels? Punching in the channel you want does not take you to that channel. Your get a number keyboard with the number you entered on your remote, and now you have to scroll to the bottom on the keyboard and click OK.  After all this, I just want  throw something at it. I’m going to donate it to charity and buy a TV that works like a TV .should work. This picture quality is OK once you finally get there."
"This TV isn't bad as far as picture or volume quality, for a bedroom, as far as I can tell, at least. I did originally rate it at 5 stars, because when it first arrived we of course took it out of the box and plugged it in and everything to make sure everything on it worked, which it did, so it went back in the box for a little while until we got moved into our new place, which is why we bought it to begin with, but after setting it up in the new place finally, now it keeps randomly turning itself on, somehow. At first we thought maybe one of the cats stepped on the remote that was on the bedside stand or something like that, so we finally decided to put the remote in our dresser drawer to make sure it didn't get ""accidently"" turned on again, but it is still randomly turning on, which we realized is the actual TV itself turning itself on, somehow, and nothing to do with the cats or anything else, since the remote is in the dresser drawer now, and the dresser/chest it's sitting on is to tall for the cats to jump on and get anywhere near the TV, so at least once a day we end up having to shut the TV off, after it turning itself on. I'm not sure what could cause such a crazy issue with it, but just make sure to keep an eye on it and don't think you're crazy if it happens to you, because you most definitely are not! I wish we would've tested it out a little better during the 30 day return window, even though we weren't going to be using it during that time period, I just like to plan ahead, so I probably bought it much sooner than I should have, but anyway, the moral of the story is to just make sure to properly test it over a few days time period, and don't make the same mistake we did. Other than it doing that crazy stuff, the TV itself seems nice (would definitely be a lot nicer if it didn't randomly turn on by itself, but what can you do, lol). That's the only reason I changed my rating to 3 stars now, from 5 stars previously, though. Good luck! 🌝"
"I'm sure the TV itself works fine, except mine arrived with the screen totally crushed.  Didn't like dealing with the Seller who send me a shipping label requiring me pay the shipping.  Amazon got that fixed.I have other Vizio TV units and they are 5 Star but dealing with this Seller is the 3 Star rating."
"I bought this for our kitchen, to replace another Vizio product. The picture quality is a nice improvement! The sound quality is ok for watching the news and basic viewing, but don't expect to be blown away by the sound. This is no surprise given the diminutive nature of the TV and the fact that the speakers do not face forward.The big downside for me was the Vizio UI. My previous Vizio had a Roku Ultra streaming box hooked up to it, and everything went through the Roku (so I didn't use the Vizio UI). Within 5 minutes of powering up the new TV I realized just how horrible the Vizio UI is! Not only could I not add apps (that were advertised as being available with this TV), I could not remove some of the Vizio bloatware. While this does not affect performance, it is irritating to have to look at all this junk on my screen. Vizio tech support was quick to answer when I called, and we were able to resolve some of the issues. For others (specifically the bloatware) there is no solution, you just have to live with it.Also irritating is the issue of powering down the TV with a particular source open (for us YouTube TV is our go to source) and when powering up the TV the next time having to re-select YouTube TV again. There is no way to ""default"" to a particular app upon power up, so it's a click fest on every start up to get to your desired programming.I initially was inclined to return the TV, but I did like the picture. The solution for me was to stream through the Roku box again, even though I had hoped to reduce the clutter on the counter by getting rid of it. Not ideal, but much better than the alternative product that Vizio offers."
Very good picture.  A long lag time using the remote.
"I have had this tv for almost 10 months. The picture quality is good, reasonable price however the sound quality is terrible. I have to turn the tv way up just to be able to hear. I’ve always had Vizios with great luck but this hasn’t been great. I will be looking into replacing this tv in the near future."
"From the description on Amazon, I was led to believe that this smart television would allow me to download the DIRECTV app. It does not. Other than that, the television works OK. I would hope that VIZIO will add DIRECTV to their App Store sometime in the near future, and then I would give the television a higher rating."
"The picture and sound of this set are easy and intuitive to personalize -- and the on-air tuner pulls in most of the broadcast channels in my area, and the image is clear and sharp. The dimensions of this unit are also just about perfect for use in a kitchen or small bedroom.Switching channels is also fast, and most parts of the menu system are intuitive and easy to negotiate.(However .... )My vision is better than 20/20 in both eyes -- but even two meters from this set, the numbers and letters on the screen are impossibly small to read as you enter channel data using the remote.  Rectifying this problem was ""the opposite of intuitive,"" and required my utilizing zoom/adaptive features that allow you to only view the center (not the corners) of the broadcast image.And, the (plastic, weak) stand components did not fit correctly -- screws to secure them had to be forced into the edge of the screen: a scary moment, during which I worried that I might crack one of the plastic parts.Generally happy with the value; but not with the on-screen data presentation or the fit and finish."
"Bought the 40"" Vizio back in June of 2023.  First one came in with some screen issues, so that one was returned immediately.  Second one's picture has now gone out.  So, it was a decent cheap option for a little over a year.  Now it's time once again for a replacment."
"It generally works fine, the picture quality is good. The system is slow, streaming takes longer to buffer than if I run the same apps through my Chromecast. Some apps are nearly unusable, some either can't load reliably, or the sound equalization is non-existent. Which isn't necessarily the TVs fault, but is still the reality. The volume adjustments have a frustrating amount of delay between the button press and the adjustment. It's irritating to get advertisements in my home screen, and there doesn't appear to be any way for me to set up a child friendly or parental locked home screen or profile, so it doesn't work well as a playroom TV as I'd intended. All in all it's been frustrating, and I wish I'd gotten something else instead."
"So, I felt like I struck a good deal when buying this TV. And I sort of did.It displays pretty clearly, volume is crisp and clear. It easily runs the PS5.There's just a few downsides.1. It will randomly freeze up and/or turn off.2. After a few months of use there is sometimes a random line of black across the screen. I haven't left it on paused or anything, and the blocks of black come and go. No matter what I do, I cannot seem to get amazon to allow me to upload images of this. Just know you may have random areas where the display is darker or where it is blacked out.3. Updates are annoying, but don't take terribly long.Though I am glad I purchased this TV because it is an okay purchase, I plan on investing in a better one for my living room and moving this one to my bedroom. I wouldn't purchase this again due to the darkened spots that appear every so often, and the fact that it sometimes just shuts off.If you are on the lower side of income and are looking for something decent, I'd recommend this for you, but I definitely want something more reliable at some point."
"Overall I thought this tv was going to be a good tv.  I wanted to watch over the air free tv channels and one of the latest updates now merges over the air channels in with Vizio Watchfree+ app and makes it difficult to watch JUST the over the air channels, because they are part of the WatchFree+, so when you choose the input of antenna it defaults to the Vizio WatchFree+ which means if you have internet connection it is using data for this app.  According to what other people said, this is not how it used to be, as you used to be able to choose Input of antenna and watch JUST over the air channels without having the Zivio WatchFree+ load as well.  This is cumbersome and not user friendly and freezes at times, especially if you are in an area of poor or no internet because then it just spins onscreen trying to connect.  If Vizio doesn’t address this, it makes this tv kind of useless for over the air, which is one main reason I bought it to use while camping in areas where there is little to no internet but access to over the air channels.  I do like the built in Air Play and have added a Roku stick to it which seems to work.  Picture quality is just ok unless it is a good HD channel.  Sound is tinny at best when you go higher in volume.  If it wasn’t for this debacle watching local channels I would be somewhat satisfied, but right now I wish I spent the extra money and bought a Samsung or other brand without this app issue.  Vizio - PLEASE CHANGE THIS!"
"I will start off by saying, I have been a fan of Vizio Smart TVs for the last 15 years.  When you get one that checks off all the boxes, they are great.  My old Vizio that I had used for over 10 years to excellent performance, finally gave out on me, black screened.  I was intent on buying a new and updated version.  Unfortunately, when it arrived, since it was only wireless (why they removed the Ethernet direct connection is beyond me), and I was riddled with endless connection issues, despite my wireless connection on my TV showing all 5 bars, my modem being less than 4 feet from it and with no devices in-between to interfere.  I contacted technical support, tried all their advice, it would get better for about 2 hours and then go to hell again.  It is absolutely appalling how bad it is.  Meanwhile, any other device that connects to my wireless, is full speed ahead.  Not to mention I have a 5G connection, this TV only supports 2.4 connection which I did connect it with to no avail.  I could not even stream to the TV from my smart phone, it was so bad. I am incredibly disappointed their wireless technology is this bad.  I returned it in exchange for a Smart TV with an Ethernet Port, so I wouldn't have to deal with this kind of poor design decision and non-sense.  Sorry, Vizio, you just lost a long-time customer."

"A TV that has a mind of its own.  The software behind this is set to capture as much personal information as possible.  Settings enable, or disable, access to channels based on the level of intrusion you allow.  The remote isn't dependable, working one second and then not the next.  Clean and new batteries don't change this functionality.  If an update is required the TV will start freezing and won't function well until you update it.  The manual is online and the intuitiveness of the programming is very poor.  Would not have purchased it and would have returned it, but it was for the guest room and wasn't aware of the bizarre functioning until it was too late to return.  There are many comments noting these same issues, not worth the $$."
"I use a TV in my kitchen while I cook.  This TV was buggy from the first time we plugged it in.  I almost returned it but I didn’t want to be “that person” because it did work.  But, the WiFi will not stay connected to the internet.  At first it only disconnected once every few days.  Now, I have to fight with it every single time I turn it on.  Yesterday it took me 45 minutes to get a show going.  I have never been so frustrated with a TV in my life. We bought this in October 2022 and I will be throwing this one away and getting a new kitchen TV this weekend."
"I was excited to put this Vizio TV in our kitchen, and the 32 inch size was perfect. My advice is if you intend to use this TV with only a wifi connection, don't do it.We just upgraded to fiber optic cable, and every other device in our home is working great. This TV had a LOT of difficulty connecting to our network, even though our router is split for 5ghz and 2.4ghz connectivity. I tried connecting multiple times to both, and after calling our internet provider to make sure everything was stable on our end, the TV finally made a connection.Almost every time we turned on the TV, it would have to buffer to make a connection. The picture quality was good, and the remote works well, but I couldn't deal with the slow wifi connectivity.If you're plugging a coaxial cable directly into this TV, or using it with a digital antenna, it should work fine. Just don't depend on its wifi capability.Grateful to Amazon for easy returns. Went with a Samsung TV instead, which connected to our wifi flawlessly and has been working great."
"I recently mounted a VIZIO 32-inch D-Series Full HD 1080p Smart TV in my kitchen, drawn by its features like Apple AirPlay, Chromecast Built-in, and the promise of a crisp picture. True to its claims, the TV delivers nicely on picture quality, making my cooking shows and morning news much more enjoyable with clear, vibrant visuals.However, calling it a ""Smart TV"" feels a bit misleading due to its restricted app ecosystem. The main downside is the limited selection of apps available. Unlike other smart TVs that offer a wide range of applications, this VIZIO model limits you to a handful of pre-approved apps, which feels like a way to nudge you towards their subscription services. This was a bit of a letdown for me, as I expected the flexibility to download and use any app I wanted.I found myself purchasing an Apple TV to bypass this limitation and access the apps I needed. While I appreciate the TV's quality and performance, be prepared to invest in additional hardware if you're looking for a truly smart experience with unrestricted app access."
"We are having issues getting an exchange on this TV. It was bought for my 74 yr old mother and we waited to set it up. Had to rearrange her room to get the TV to fit on her shelves. We left the TV in the box and didn't check to see if there was any damage to the TV. Well upon setting it up, the plastic frame work around the top and bottom of the TV are cracked and bowed. Amazon told me since it was after the 30 days and even though I purchased the extended warranty that it was a Vizio issue. (trust me I will always check my items within the 30 days to make sure everything works, never again with this headache) So I contacted Vizio and they are telling me it is an Amazon issue. I am getting the run around. I just want a TV that isn't messed up so my mother can watch her shows. I didn't purchase a TV, to waste my money. I am getting ready to contact my credit card company and see what I can do. If Amazon doesn't resolve this after yet another message to them via their seller than I will do what I need to do.This makes me made because we bought another TV previously through the same seller and no issues, so I won't be using them again. I will leave this as a 1 star review until things have been resolved. I would give half a star if I could. I hate getting bounced back and forth between companies. Neither wanting to help the customer. Do they forget they wouldn't be in business if we didn't buy products from them."
"Works great, but I can't read the screen unless I stand less than 6' away. I didn't consider this when purchasing so another lesson learned."
Got this TV for the kitchen so I could see it if I was there doing my thing.Here is what i like and dislike about this little 24in TV.Yay:Supports many streaming apps.Has many free streaming channels to watch.Chromecast built in.RCA Audio Video inputs.3.5 MM Audio Jack to connect external speakers (with variable and fixed options).Has 2 HDMI inputs. (one of them is ARC.Includes 2 AA Duracell batteries for the remote.connects to WiFi.Picture Quality is decent for the price.Nay:Requires a 1GB+ update at initial power up.A bunch of annoying registrations you are asked to sign up for after 1GB+ update.WiFi only works on a 2.4GHz network. (this can cause slow loading)Power Cord cannot be detached from the TV.No Ethernet Jack.Small text can be hard to read on the screen.Ads
"This is my first tv in 12 years.I had been using a 10 "" tablet screen with an external jbl speaker for the longest, but the tablets battery could no longer keep it's charge. So time for a 40"" screen TV.One good thing, I already had the floor stand assembled four months  in advanced, attached the brackets to the backside, easy peasy.Online instruction setup, easy to follow.I'm somewhat disappointed, because this brand doesn't  have Bluetooth, the TV sound is not great, it's really bad. I like surround sound, my Jbl speaker wouldn't can't pair with it, although it's attaches to wifi.  Recently, I ordered a vizio soundbar and hopefully it's worth it when it arrives. Extra money out of pockets, despite the cost of the Vizio smart tv. Perhaps this TV is an older model or something."
"I was surprised this cheap little smart tv packs a punch! If you see this just get it. It has all the plug-in ports you need for gaming and video watching. It’s a smart tv so you can watch your apps right from the tv. It also has airplay so you can cast movies to the tv. It has a headphone jack so at night I can put my headphones on and not wake anyone. It has a crystal clear picture as well. It has many color/brightness adjustments as well. I absolutely love this tv and am surprised at the performance. You can download the Vizio app and operate this tv from your phone. It looks just like a remote, plus the vizio app has tons of great movies etc. I just love it! Better than Roku in my opinion!UPDATE: The picture is very pixelated on dark scenes but so crisp and clear on bright scenes. I’m honestly thinking of returning this. Dark scenes look so blotchy and awful. Dropped my rating down to 3 stars due to the pixelated mess!!!"
"The good: seller stood behind their product, the bad, the TV spontaneously turned its self on about 5 times a day, including in the middle of the night ( always with the volume on medium). I tried an unplug reset, and factory reset, it still it turned itself on.  All our other TVs are Vizio and are great, this one not so much.  I contacted the seller and got a full refund.  I plan to reorder another and hope it works.5 star seller1 star TV, at least the one I got.  Hopefully TV 2 is 5"
"The only way this TV will work is if you create an account with an email address and password. Hate this in light of all the hacking going on.TV is okay, but the only way I can use my own antenna is to re-program the channels in settings EVERY SINGLE TIME I TURN IT ON or agree to their privacy statement.  Apparently, the reason this is so cheap is because of data mining. What ever happened to watching TV without big brother watching over your should?"
This does not have the pictured hookups for DVD player.
"This was my first ever TV, and it gets the job done, but there's some notable areas where it could use improvement.pros: I love the built in chromecast, the sound is strong, and the picture is good enough.cons: After a few months of use, it sometimes freezes and doesn't respond to the remote. It also has limits on the apps you can install, meaning that I have to rely on the Chromecast to stream certain content, and the user interface is a mess - it's constantly advertising and autoplaying trailers for movies and TV shows that are on streaming platforms I don't have, but won't even let me add all of MY streaming services to the tiny ribbon of apps at the bottom of the home screen.I would probably get a Roku or something if I had it to do over again, but it's not so bad that I'm looking to get rid of it and buy something else. Still, it's worth spending a little extra money for something with a better picture, performance, and interface."
"I bought this 24-inch TV for my 17-foot travel trailer.  I installed it and used it for two weeks.My #1 criticism is that the photo here on Amazon shows that the input jacks are on the side of the TV.  I was counting on that when I chose to order this particular TV.  They are not on the side as shown.  They are on the back.  I purchased a super flush wall mount and the jack locations created an issue for me.  I had to buy a 90-degree antenna jack adapter, a 90-degree HDMI adapter, and a two-way HDMI switch to make this work.  One of the HDMI ports was not available to me because my mounting plate covered it.  This was not supposed to be the case because the ports shown here on Amazon are on the side, not the back.Next up is the built-in Chromecast.  Turns out this feature only works if the TV is connected to the Internet.  Since my install is in my travel trailer, this is not the case.  Thus, Chromecast won't work for me at all.  I had to buy an HDMI to mini-USB cable to hardwire my phone to the TV in order to show downloaded Netflix content.All these adapters etc cost me a lot more $$ and still left me lacking in functionality that I thought I would have.With the above drawbacks noted, the TV otherwise worked well in my trailer."
"Vizio will not take care of a problem that's being complained about by people on online forums; they don't seem to care... The dialog on any DVD/Blu Ray or even streaming movies has the same problem: You have to first turn up the TV to about 70 just to hear the dialog; then you get deafened by a car screeching or something like that, a gun shot, etc...There doesn't seem to be a fix for this problem expect maybe buying a separate EQ which would cost another $100...This is a great price, I'll give it that, but it's not like the Vizio I bought in 2011, not at all... Also, I got the warranty, and the HTMI cable doesn't always work on the blu ray, and, two of my top Watchlist movies here on Amazon do NOT show up on the TV unless I deactivate, which is a quick fix... but then BOTH movies are gone from the list...I would avoid Vizio and go for a good old fashion Sony if you want decent sound..."
"This is a decent 40” flat screen, but it has no antenna input. I bought two different HDMI adapters, so I could hook up an antenna. I could not get either one to work and returned them. It’s a good tv if you don’t want to use an antenna. Good picture, sound and price. Good luck. Thx."
"Pro: full HD (1080p) screen resolution.Cons: everything else! Especially OTA TV support and [the total lack of] Visio technical support.We bought this TV to use in the small bedroom on our RV where anything larger would be too big. We wanted a Smart TV for occasional streaming, but most importantly, we require solid support for OTA channels so we can watch local weather and other travel critical information.Well, while this TV technically supports an OTA antenna, Visio seems to have gone to great lengths to make sure it isn't suitable for OTA channel watching.The setup process was unnecessarily convoluted, and after finally getting thru it, the TV did an update that made OTA surfing, to say the least, difficult and frustrating.Normally, when using the up/down channel buttons, an OTA TV will show you what channel you are on. Nope, not on this set. That requires the annoying need to constantly reference the guide (loaded with disruptive advertising) to figure out where you are and find where you want to go.Visio has this ""Watchfree"" operating system that definitely does not favor OTA watching. If you don't care about OTA this may not be a problem for you, but overall I was completely underwhelmed and downright annoyed compared to other more mainstream TV operating systems.Another major flaw IMO, is this set only supports 2.4ghz Wi-Fi. Really?To top it off, a request to Visio service via Amazon went totally ignored. I for one will never consider purchasing another Visio product based on that fact alone.We ended up instead buying a Westinghouse 24"" Roku TV set that is incredibly more user friendly and very nicely supports OTA. When surfing OTA channels, you get not only the channel numbers displayed, but signal strength, resolution, the time, and even basic programming info. And it supports BOTH 2.4ghz and 5ghz Wi-Fi. The Westinghouse Roku set also acts as a DVR (pause live TV) if you plug in a USB stick. Even better, the Westinghouse Roku set was 30% less expensive than the Visio! A much better choice IMO.On the downside, the Westinghouse Roku set was only 720p, but on this small size screen the picture clarity difference is not really noticeable to ordinary humans."
I just want to what I want: Cable usually but some streaming. It’s too easy on that tiny remote to have a streaming button pressed. Funky to get back to cable especially if it goes into a menu.
"The TV is OK overall and great for the price. Picture quality is OK, and sound is OK. My real issue is, what sort of ""smart tv"" does not come with built in Bluetooth? What modern device in today's world doesn't have Bluetooth? I like to wear headphones because I cannot hear the tv over the outside noise, I live next to a train sadly, had I know this tv had no Bluetooth I wouldn't have bought it. Now I have to buy some sort of adapter for the most basic of features in a modern device, even more so for smart tv. I can only imagine this was done so you buy their soundbar."
"I had to refuse shipment on this because I figured that any modern TV with a USB thumb drive capability would play .mkv files.But after I ordered it I decided to check with the manufacturer and they told me no, it does not.So I had to refuse shipment and order a different TV.Any modern TV should play MKV files because they are the most popular format for converting video files to play via USB."
"Over the years we have owned several Vizio smart TVs. Our experience has been that the larger, more expensive sets function beautifully. Although they do require a soundbar, they have a bright screen and function quite well for our needs.However, we have found that the smaller ones such as this are quite temperamental. Each one eventually has one problem after another and away they go to be recycled.I have this exact TV in my den. It's been fine, but glitches quite often. It's an ongoing joke in our house. The other set we had of this size died within a year.Forever an optimist, I decided to give Vizio one last shot with this set. Maybe we'd get lucky?Unfortunately, we have found ourselves in the same boat as prior.I purchased this TV for our workout room to exclusively play exercise DVD's. Plugged in the DVD player and the screen came right up, they play perfectly. We installed a soundbar and this also functions properly.The issue is connectivity. We are a large household with a myriad of devices, a strong internet connection and several boosters throughout the house. My password for my router works for all of our devices.Not so with this TV. After several attempts we finally gave up and have relegated this set to purely workout DVD's. Thats fine for our needs, but the set should connect regardless.At this point it's far past time for our family to move on to another brand.  We gave it our best shot."
"I purchased this tv as an economic choice for a bedroom. The picture quality is good, it had to connect to my guest network much like smart plugs, etc that cannot connect to the 5ghz network. My major issue is with the flimsy plastic legs/stand. Full disclosure:  I am a middle aged woman but I’ve successfully put together furniture and electronics many times. I couldn’t get these legs screwed in securely after several attempts. Even if I could - I think the tv would still feel wobbly given the weak plastic the legs are made from.  Other than that - a good tv for the price."
"I wanted a small TV for my 91 year old mom to have in her kitchen.  We have it on a roku stick so she can stream the cable channels, but the vizio operating system is intrusive and we always have to go thru a bunch of steps to get to the roku.I would have bought a Roku TV if I could have found a small one.  I would avoid this one if you are at all technically challenged."
"Lets go with the good stuff first:Great picture. Sound form the TV is above avg, I added a small sound bar and it worked will.  Remote... I know this may sound odd but there is not a ""hey by feeling this is the front of remote contour to the remote."" So when it is dark and you are holding the remote, it is a 50/50 shot if you are holding it correctly.Bad stuff.Wi-Fi Only.It is advertised as:Connectivity Technology: Wi-Fi, EthernetIt does not have an Ethernet port."
"There really isn’t a ton to say about this TV. My old Vizio was getting long in the tooth and I got this one on a sale.The new software is really intrusive and detracts from the viewing experience. When I turn on the TV, just show what I was watching last. Also stop randomly disconnecting from my soundbar. So annoying.Anyway the picture is on par with other TVs in this price range."
"The performance of this TV seems good. The color is good. The sound is good, not great.  However, if you’re planning to use it with a Wi-Fi network, run, do not buy!!! I have to reboot it, unplug it, leave it off for a while sometimes several times an hour! Sometimes I might get a few hours where it runs consistently. I thought maybe it was my Wi-Fi system, although I have never had this issue with other TVs or my laptop, tablet or other technology, until I started googling “ Visio tv not connecting to Wi-Fi” and discovered pages and pages of questions and discussions about this exact issue. So it is a known issue with this brand, yet they haven’t fixed it."
"Bought this to replace a tv that went bad in our kitchen. Hooked it up today and watching NFLplayoff games. I use Chromecast to stream and the built in Chromecast in this TV worked perfectly and was more than easy to set up. In fact as soon as I went through the initial set up process the TV already knes I had chromecast and the TV responded as soon as I used my phone to start streaming. I was a little concerned about sound quality from other reviews but in my set up its really very good. Remote is fairly simple and intuitive. Its a very lightweight TV and worked really well with the TV wall mount I also bought. Only negative is I wish the power cord had been a little longer. But overall very happy!Update - after using it for a few weeks I’ve noticed the built in Chromecast device is not the same as a “regular” chrome cast. On many channels it does not download video and audio at the same rate, so the video lags noticeably behind the audio, and it gets worse the longer you watch. I’m talking several seconds after watching 2 minutes. I plugged in my separate Chromecast  into one of the hdmi ports and now the problem is gone. Still like the tv but it’s disappointing I need to have another device plugged in to make it work properly. I’m going to contact the manufacturer to see if this is normal or the set is defective."
I am very frustrated and disappointed in this purchase.  This tv is not reliable----and it did not come with a booklet to help in learning to use it's features.  One example is that it suddenly shuts off in the midst of a show I'm watching---and does not resume.  ---with zero explanation.I've ordered many many many wonderful and dependable items from Amazon.  This is not one of them.  I can't return it cause it's past the date.  it also does not show the channel the program is on---like most tvs--shows what channel is being used---up in the corner of the screen.
I really regret buying this television. I purchased a Vizio TV purely because of convenience and the need for a small television. Vizio is all cluttered with too much going on on the home screen. Half of the apps on the home screen are useless to my household but the only option is to keep scrolling through them Plus it loads too slow. Roku has me spoiled. Their televisions are great
I liked it initially but it gave off an oder that I was not comfortable with. The information said the oder would subside in a few days but for me it was still there after a few weeks and it was a little bit much for me so I didn't keep mine. The company service was very accommodating and responded well to my concerns.
It was delivered August 30 and by September 29 it started acting up. Twice today and I turned it off and it came back on by itself a number of times! The first incident it came on at least six times after I had turned it off. The second incident it took three times before it would stay off. I’m not sure what to make of this issue. Any suggestions?  I did a factory reset on it and it seem to take care of the problems for now.  It is now the middle of December I have had this TV for 3 1/2 months and I have had to reboot it six times! It is slow to load when you turn it on even though I just booted it! It freezes the screen. I’ve never been so disappointed with an appliance in all of my life and I’m 56 years old.  UPDATE: 2/10/2022Turned on the television this morning and it told me that it’s services were not available. I am now trying a factory reset again to see if that will help clear up the problem. I’ve never had so many issues with the television in my life as I stated earlier. This is the biggest hunk of crap I’ve ever wasted my money on! I only bought it because I wanted a larger TV and 40 inches fit the spot that I wanted to fill. Never ever ever ever ever buy a Vizio product you will be disappointed!  Update Sept2022: still a piece of crap but now it will not update and I cannot use it at all. I wish it was heavier so I could at least use it for a boat anchor. Don’t waste your money on this crap!
"Just spoken with Vizio support and they informed me that they will not be warranting the product unless I purchase an extended warranty due to a third party company. The product is a Target purchase , has to be purchased directly from partner stores and not from third parties. I would like the seller to see to it that I have a warranty and/or refund me for a replacement."
"I got this Tv to make sure I could use with my headphones. Even though in the description under specs, it says that it has a Bluetooth it doesn’t. I contacted Amazon customer service and the team supervisor was extremely rude. Almost accused me in trying to keep the TV and get refunded.  No help so far."
Get the Westinghouse instead.I have both and the westinghouse is much easier to operate.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Update: there's also no Bluetooth capability , this tv is 35 inches not 39. Nothing. I will be returning for a full refund! It's a scam! Mmm I'm not really impressed.The remote is TERRIBLE AND LAGS UNCONTROLLABLY. There's also no mic on the remote, but claims to have voice control. HOW SWAY?! It's giving FALSE ADVERTISING.SOUND IS HORRENDOUS! No matter how you try to adjust it, more than likely will only sound good with a soundbar. I got this for my bedroom, & I'm really disgusted. Sounds like static noise behind what you're actually listening to.Color could be better, adjusting settings don't make a big difference.HD quality is actually really good. Does work with Alexa, and the app is okay.It's not giving 40' inches to me, looks small. I will measure it and update.I got it on prime day, even as it being ""discounted"" I feel like I wasted money. Mmmm don't know how I really feel just yet, but I know I'm not impressed.You're better off with a Samsung, and investing your money. I have a Samsung in my living room, that never misses. Sound on 20, but it relays like it's on 50. Picture quality & color immaculate! Depending on the model you get, the remote may or may not have a mic.SN: last picture is my mounted Samsung in my living room."
"I have had this TV for less than a year and I HATE IT!  Every time someone wants to watch this TV, they have to start fooling around with it 20 minutes before the show they want to watch.  Every time we turn it on we get the death spiral for a few minutes before we get the notice that it can’t connect to the internet.  Then we have to try to uninstall the WiFi and reinstall it.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t.  If we are lucky enough that it does work after that, you can bet that at least 4 times between 8 and 11 pm, we will lose the signal and have to restart the TV and go through the install process again.I thought it might be my router, so I bought a new, more powerful router but that hasn’t helped at all.  The internet provider was out and couldn’t find any problem with their equipment either.If we do get this thing to work, it is difficult to navigate a streaming movie.  There are no fast forward or fast rewind buttons.  Instead you have to click on the circle around the ok button to go forward or back, but it is difficult (with my big thumbs) to do that without going to a menu below and eliminating all the rewinding already done.We have a small TV in the kitchen and an older TV in the master bedroom and we never have any issue with either of those.  They turn on immediately and have access to the internet.  No uninstalling and reinstalling every time.I will never waste my money on another Vizio product."
"Possibly one of the worst TV’s I’ve ever used. Every single time I turn it on, I have some sort of issue with it connecting and even just loading the Home Screen. So because I can’t use the TV properly, I have to AirPlay most things, but even then that cuts out every 3 minutes. On top of that, I don’t know if it’s how I have the TV positioned or if it’s the TV itself, but the sound is really muffled sometimes when I have the volume up. Having so many regrets trying to be cheap and getting this TV."
"We bought this because our old tv, which had amazing pic and sound, would not allow us to stream anymore because it was pre-Intel chip. Thanks evil Hollywood. We don’t watch much TV so we thought $150 was enough to spend. We had low expectations and they were met. The sound is terrible, this is 50% Vizio’s, fault and 50% the horrible sound quality of the movies and shows. The picture is less than clear or vibrant. You feel like you need glasses. Oh yeah, I WEAR glasses and It’s still unclear. My husband doesn’t wear glasses and he can’t see it all that week either. And God forbid, they make the very tiny remote readable in low light. Remember when you pressed the remote and it lit up? So you could see what you were looking for? How much did that technology cost? 3-5 cents? Yeah the greedy execs and stockholders 86’ed that at Vizio. If you want to see the remote you have to turn a light on. So $150 is too much to pay for this TV, but if you don’t spend more this is what you get!"
"It's a TV. So when it works it's ok. Picture quality is really bad with dark screen pixelization! So you get those blocky halos all the time, otherwise it's ok quality streaming, better for gaming and dvds or memory stick! The biggest issue is how slow it is and it's always dropping internet without the option of auto reconnect. It also won't recognize any phone wifi Hotspots for some reason?! You get what you pay for...and for 150 or whatever it was we payed I should've opted for a more expensive model...Samsung, LG are where it's at imo!"
"Total disappointment and waste of time and money. I also purchased the added warranty from Amazon. It is all just AI and neither one is offering support to fix the blue tooth and other features that are supposed to be included with this TV. Setup is very unusual. Turns on and off for almost an hour. Plan a huge amount of time if you are going to purchase this for set-up. You need to be present just to press a button to get it to continue set-up. Sound is very tinny/sqeeky. Picture is beautiful. That is about all it has going for it. I have no idea why Amazon suggests this TV. I don't think the TV I buy to replace this will come from Amazon. I am so disgusted that they say they offer support and they don't. This TV might be good for idk what, holding paper down? Laudering money? Getting rid of extra hair on your head because you pull it out dealing with set-up? Wasting gas because it needs to be driven somewhere for return? Adding to landfill because it is useless? Scrap plastic?"
"‼️6/5/24: UPDATE: THIS NEW TV IS BEING RETURNED FOR THE SAME REASON AS REFURBISHED MODEL - THIS PARTICULAR MODEL HAS A PROBLEM WITH THE SCREEN GETTING CLOUDY & BLEEDING THRU THE PICTURE - AFTER ABOUT 25 DAYS OF USESo I returned the refurbished model I ordered in April, which was clearly not repaired - updated my review on that TV - ordered this new TV - was delivered last night, BEST PART: the Amazon delivery driver called several times, but didn’t leave a message, my phone stated it was SPAM, so I didn’t answer - then I got a text from Amazon to state I did not respond to their driver’s calls, so I need to call Customer Service.Called Customer Service & asked them to reach out to contact the driver by phone to return because I’ve been here, but I don’t answer SPAM calls.I asked if ALL Amazon Delivery Drivers phones have the exact same phone number in Caller ID, she said YES - so I told her I will go to my list of calls & ADD that phone number to my existing Amazon Contact Page under ‼️DELIVERY.I got a call about 20 minutes later - Caller ID showed Amazon ‼️DELIVERY - so I picked up & he was outside waiting for me to give him a specific code number for this package - Excellent Outcome.Set up this new TV after boxing up the defective TV & so far, so good -putting it thru the paces. Great sound - LOVE the new super EZ set-up process, much better than years ago, when you needed to call to have someone walk us thru the set up process.Vizio is a good brand, this 40” TV is replacing a Vizio 32” 15yr old TV. The sound from the speakers is better, with better placement.I don’t feel comfortable with the tiny little legs that all these new TVs come with. I bought a FABULOUS pedestal from Amazon which is heavier than the TV, it swivels from side to side & there are drilled holes in the post so you can choose the height that you prefer. This pedestal gives me comfort for the safety to support a larger screened TV, than those tiny little legs."
"Knew going into the purchase that at under $200 this was not going to be an amazing TV. Initial thought when I mounted it was that it felt cheap and plastic-ee - but also, who handles your TV, so not a big deal since it looks like a very regular TV with a normal if not slightly thick frame. But I just intended to use it in my office, so again, didn't need anything flashy. The biggest problem is the software and the connectivity.We get our content through wifi on apps like Hulu, Netflix, etc. To navigate to an app, you have to sit through and click through several options where Vizio tries to sell you stuff or get you to use their apps. I haven't had this issue on any of my other branded TVs - mostly Samsung. So it's annoying to turn the TV on and have to navigate for a comparatively lengthy amount of time just to get to the app that has the content you want to search through. The software is also slow but recently updated and is slightly faster. The second biggest issue is that almost 30% of the time, it doesn't want to connect to your wifi. Sometimes it can't find your network. Sometimes it just doesn't like your password. Sometimes it doesn't want to respond to inputs on the remote. If this were my main TV, I'd be unbelievably angry and I should probably rate this TV 1 star. But because it's an office TV, and don't rely on it, I'm not weighting the connectivity issues as severely."
"Honestly it’s fine I knew it was a cheap quick buy, but Vizio has really let itself go. Audio quality is trash, and the in tv app schematics are super boo boo."
"The tv came in one peace looks great setup took longer than it should but it's a smart tv and everything needs to update. picture quality is really good the back light bleed has its moments where its noticeable to being very impressive. sound as well isn't bad. it's a thin tv small speakers its more treb then bass but overall, for the price and size it was better than I thought.so why the two stars? not being able to replace the power cord in case of damage or wanting to make it longer is unacceptable its nothing more than ewaste. most if not all people will toss this tv out and not attempt to fix it. cats, dogs, vacuums. who knows maybe when moving it gets smashed or ripped on and now the tv is junk.second is only being allowed some apps.. no crunchyroll or internet browsing just casting from the phone. but I don't want to always be on my phone. it would be nice to be able to sideload or download what I want on a tv I bought and not have to use not only my phone and its battery life but the remote control. what's the point in a smart tv if I have to buy a device to make my smart tv smart? makes zero since to limit so many apps to this thing for no real reason besides money.if this is a tv you're buying for say games, movies or the listed supported apps like FUNimation, Netflix, Hulu, Disney + then this is a great option. but if you want Crunchyroll, moviebox pro, or anything else than looks for something different or spend some more cash on a firestick."
"I have owned this tv for 8 months and my hatred of it burns like the heat of 10,000 white hot suns.How does this tv fail to live up to expectations you may ask?Mobile app - on the odd occasion the mobile app is able to sync to the tv, be prepared for extreme lag time. Think the volume control isn’t working? Just wait and 30-60 seconds later your sound is plummeting down or up in response to the buttons you’d pressed minutes ago on your phone.Searching for shows - yeah, good luck. We have about a 20% success rate compared to our Roku tvs on whether the Vizio Smart TV interface will be familiar with the show we search and be able to match it to the appropriate streaming service.Now you may think, “oh these are just smart tv problems, I plan to use this like a standard tv, no worries.” Ah, think again my friend. AV jacks, none responsive.How about a simple think like fast forward or rewind? Surely the good people at Vizio can’t screw this up. Ah, challenge accepted! Your remote lacks buttons for fast forward and rewind. You instead can use the back and forward arrow buttons. Which is basically the same thing if you’re ok with it taking 5 times as long to advance through a title.In conclusion, we get what we pay for. If you seek a poorly made product, lacking in quality, created by a team of designers who scorn user testing, all in the name of saving $10 compared to a comparable tv that you won’t want to drop kick off a cliff; then indeed friend look no further, this is the TV for you!"
"I had recently moved my belongings from long-term storage and my old TV screen unfortunately cracked in the moving process. I needed to buy a new one, but was unable to spring for something super-expensive. I was drawn to this for the size and price point, and I was happy with my old VZIO model. I liked how I had the option to pay for the TV in installments, which increased the affordability for me.Setting it up was typical for new electronics — rather tedious — but once I got it set up, it was easy to log into my streaming apps. I do not have cable or play video games so I can’t speak to that, but it does seem capable.I use the TV in my bedroom and don’t need to keep the volume loud, but the sound does distort a little if I put it over 25. External speakers might fix the issue, but I don’t have any. Since I bought it in January, there have been two times in which the sound cuts off completely out of nowhere. This was annoying, but the old trick of turning it off, unplugging the power cord from the outlet, waiting a few mins, plugging the cord back in and turning the TV on worked each time. Just an inconvenience to consider.Sometimes I do have issues with the HBO app specifically, even after making sure everything is updated. I’m unsure as to why that happens.Overall, I wouldn’t use this TV in the living or family room, somewhere where it’d get a lot of constant use. But as an extra TV for the bedroom or office, it’s a good size. You get what you pay for.UPDATE 9/2022: Please don’t buy this TV! Don’t be roped in by the low price because you’ll end up paying more in the end by buying this. The return window is a joke (less than 1 month) and I can’t in good conscience try to sell this to some sorry soul on FB Marketplace or Craigslist.ALL streaming apps are super laggy, despite a strong connection to the fastest WiFi. The SmartCast Home Screen consistently has issues loading which, you know, is kind of important if you wish to use this TV for streaming (as most customers do). The remote has buttons for Disney Plus, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Pluto TV, iHeart Radio, Tubi, and Vizio’s WatchFree Plus app, which is convenient — but only when they work! Even when the Home Screen is down, those controls only decide to function 25% of the time.Don’t settle like I did - use your money elsewhere and invest in a TV that is reliable and that will work as advertised for longer than a few months. I now realize that TVs are a major investment. LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE - I implore you!"
"This was by far the worst television experience I have ever purchased, but as they say, you get what you pay for. I bought two, and within two hours of delivery they were both back in the box, and were prommptly returned to the UPS store the very next morning. (Tracking shows both were returned to Amazon on 1/3/24, but only 1 of 2 has been ""received"" as of 1/25/24. Update: the 2of 2 was finally ""received on  1/26/24. I've ""chatted"" five times with Amazon assuring me credit will be applied. Still waiting for Amazon to ""receive"" something that per UPS tracking they have had for 23 days. Then I get to wait another 5-7 days for the credit to be applied. Amazon customer service basically told me to eff off, dictated their super lame Amazon centric return policy, and to just wait out the 30 days. If I'm lucky I may get my refund sooner, but thus far nothing despite their repeated assurances.) Back to the TV, the Visio processor is painfully slow.  How slow?  Slower than molasses going uphill in the dead of winter in a bucket with a lid on it.  That's how slow.  Worse, the Visio simply won't stay on the settings you select. It turns itself off after set up forcing you to reinitiate every setting again and again. What about the picture? I really couldn't tell you. I spent all of my time repeatedly working through the menu. What about the remote?  Who cares at this point?  I couldn't get it back in the box fast enough.  I'm pleanty tech savvy, and I can easily manage all of the computers, routers, and other smart devices around my home. This Visio purchase was a complete waste of my time and money. Buyers remorse? You bet. 100% pure regret.  I don't see how anyone could possibly be expected to give this experience a positive review. Did I mention I'm still waiting for Amazon to refund my money?"
"When I received the TV it looked as if the box had been opened and than closed. After opening it I noticed that there was no Remote Control nor there was any instructions. I had to program an Xfinity Remote Control for the TV to work. Also it was very difficult to program the control because the TV did not accept the number inputs. After it was programmed, it seems to work well. I am giving it tis poor review because I bought a NEW TV, not an OPEN BOX TV."
"So this TV overall it’s pretty good TV but thing is with the auto receiver and stuff like that with the remote it has a slow reaction it’s delayed when you click the button on the remote when you try to turn the volume you have to hold it down for like five seconds, and then the volume will pop up on the screen But I like the fact that when I turn on my PlayStation five, it automatically switches HDMI to the PlayStation but other than that if you want a fast TV this wouldn’t be the choice if you want TV that’s just reliable and good enough maybe something to put your kids room  or guestroom. Perfect TV."
"I got this as a 'refurbished like new' TV and when I turned it on the picture quality was fabulous. Today I got my new modem so that I could finally use my TV and watch my Amazon Prime movies on this. When I attempted to set up this device I got an ERROR 9 message. I tried to do all the troubleshooting with this possible including turning off the TV via the remove and unplugging for 30 seconds, turning it off manually and unplugging for 30 seconds, turning off BOTH TV and modem and unplugging for 30 seconds, trying to fix this on my Xfinity app, (didn't work) trying to fix this on my Vizio app (didn't work) going to X finity Website on desktop didn't work and trying to fix using AI Vizio (It gave up and referred me to a 'human' who is supposed to call me tomorrow. We shall see. All in all, have spent at least 3 hours trying to set up my TV.  Also, the remote control only now turns the TV off and on. I tried using the ""Tool"" button to reset and no buttons work aside from off and on. And yes, I did the final thing I was told which was to take out the batteries on the remote and press each one and then put the batteries back in. I felt like I was doing some childish, wishful thinking 'magic' and thought, am I crazy to go along with this? But I did and it too didn't work. Heck, I was willing to rub my stomach and rub my head at the same time if it would get this to work but it didn't. I tried to save money by buying a 'used/like new TV but possibly it is set to someone else's home WIFI and that is what went wrong. I have NO idea what is the problem as I have done everything I was told to do by ViZIO and Zfinity. I just want a working TV."
This tv sometimes u have to press the on button several times before it comes on and takes long to start up
This package came minus the screws to mount the feet to the tv. I contacted Amazon support and their idiotic AI bot gave me the runaround. I finally gave up and was passed to VIZIO support where I had to endure talking to a foreign national who was totally non English speaking and in a foreign country (I could never ascertain where because I could not understand him).Get your act together AMAZON & VIZIO.
If you purchase this tv you will need sound bar or stereo speakers added! No volume at 100 should be 45!
"I noticed the coax receptacle was moving when I first plugged in the antenna cable. A few months later, when I moved the tv to another room and tried to plug it back in, the antenna didn’t work. Apparently the internal wires did not connect with that loose receptacle. VIZIO says it is out of warranty even though I’ve only had it for 9 months."
So after less than one year of use. The TV will no longer connect to WiFi. Which is the main reason why I bought it. It’s just to watch shows and games during long breaks. No cable source by me. Worked fine last night watching football. Now today it won’t connect to any network. Did a factory reset and everything.Looks like I’m avoiding Vizio from now on.
Well most of the tv's in my home are Vizio's so when I saw a sale I thought let me get one in each room. Got them up and running and it's been an interesting set of events the tv's work they only can get the apps that are there so that's not cool I have to watch my tv in livingroom to watch my xfinity app. They take a few to respond to a request from remote control. These are good for a guest room that is not used much or kids room. I will be looking for new TV for my bedroom.
"It will get a good 1080p picture, but setting it to look good was a challenge. The plug ins on the back are the main reason I went with this (usb, 2x hdmi, coax, and headphone/computer speakers) The built in speakers aren't great. Don't use smart features, for me its just a hookup to my pc. It's ok, not perfect."
My main TV is a Sony OLED Bravia TV. I LOVE it. It is easy to use. There is a TV a button on the remote. If I want to watch a local TV station I select TV on remote and the stations show on the bottom of the screen. The last channel I was on immediately comes up. I can arrow left or right to change channels. This Vizio TV does not have a TV button on remote. It isn’t easy to go to TV. It’s a multi step process and is a lot of work and the last channel viewed does not come up. I will probably be returning it because of this.
"The quality is great, but I am in Ecuador and the TV doesn't work fof the region, should have an option to see the home page ans select app to select and use. Also, the App is not available in Play Store for the regions and is not possible to use. I had to adapt an Android TV."
It's a little bit big for the size of my kitchen. Has all the features.
"I’ve had to factory reset this tv multiple times. It’s glitchy and very slow. It has jammed up several times, during its first week with me it kept resetting itself so i had to sign into my accounts again and again. It will tell me it can’t find the network even though it shows that it’s connected. I periodically have to turn it off and then back on to restart it when it jams. It’s iffy about casting, sometimes it works, sometimes it jams up. I told customer service about this, it was a refurbished Amazon deal, and though I told them I’d already factory reset it several times. So they told me to factory reset it, so very helpful. I just gave up. I’d already thrown out the packaging by the time it started glitching so shipping it back was going to be hard anyway. At least it’s cheap, but it’s definitely cheap for a reason. The picture is good from the front but dims from slightly to the side. If you’re very patient with this special needs tv, its fine but I don’t recommend it. You can’t switch between screens very quickly, the processor is obviously junk. I checked online and these issues are common with this tv. I’ve had 2 other Vizio tvs, my oldest one is the best by far, it’s 10 years old and even now it’s far better than this one. Not going to buy a refurbished item againUpdate: when I turn the volume up or down it usually doesn’t register right away but like 3-10 seconds later the volume will start changing. If someone who doesn’t know this tries to change the volume, they’ll over press the button trying to get it to work and in 5-10 seconds it’ll get going and go way loud or way quiet.Final update: after almost three months this tv is still acting up. Some days it just won’t work and I have to unplug it for ten minutes. Then it works. I really got a bad tv. But looks like tons of people got good ones so I guess just hope you’re luckier than me :)"
"I bought this TV for my daughter's birthday on May 2. Her birthday wasn't until June 1st, so yea, my fault for buying so early. However, we were going on a couple vacations and I was trying to be ahead of the game. Anyway, we didn't actually use the TV until June 23 and I registered it with Vizio. Upon the 2nd day if using it, it disconnected from the network. I tried for an hour to get it back up and running. It wouldn't even recognize the wifi. I factory reset it, powered it down, messed with settings. Etc...  nothing. I reset the router and nothing. A few days later, reset it again and it worked.  Then 2 days after that, it disconnected again and I went through the same routine. I see that Amazon gives you a 90 day warranty. So I chatted and was told to contact the manufacturer.. seriously!? What kind of 90 day support is that? So I tried the TV again. Nothing works to get this TV to go on the network. $165 wasted. So I contact Amazon again.  I'm told that the 90 days is support.. ok I said, so if I still get support and it doesn't work, I should be able to return it. Right? Nope!! Call Vizio, I'm told again. Vizio put a ticket to help but I've heard nothing again about it. I just want to return the TV and buy my daughter a different brand TV that will cost more.. Amazon would make out on this deal, but they want to be difficult and not help a customer out. I understand the 30 day return policy but this TV is faulty and I should at least be able to return or replace.. Amazon is going down the tube and as much money as I spend .. an exception wouldn't hurt them, but it would mean a whole lot to me and a little girl who just wants to use her birthday present. Shame on Amazon for selling a faulty tv and not standing behind the product or having good customer service... I read in a lot of forums, that this TV has this known issue.. wish I knew before purchasing. So buyer beware!"
Too smart to set up easily!!!! Opted for an LCD tv
"Functional TV that is a very affordable. You get what you pay for though. It has all the features, but with heavy lag and often disconnects. Probably because its full of adware and selling your information to make up for how cheap they are selling this TV."
Really good picture and the Wi-Fi connection is great. Screen mirror from phone is awesome and the remote control app on my phone is cool. Only downside is the sound quality is sub par but easily fixed with a small sound bar
"The TV had a great picture, but just died almost 3 years to the date.Bought Dec 21 2021, Died Dec 11, 2024.  I have older big screen TVs by other brands still working."
"This should have been a plug and play. Instead it turned into a 2 hr event with Vizio demanding download of apps and info and request cc, etc. Very annoying when all you want is essentially a monitor.Instructions are woefully inadequate and incorrect. Attached cable and it is not an option on input settings. Instructions say to go to ""menu"" button on remote but there is NO MENU BUTTON ON REMOTE. It the says to select TV from input options but there is NO TV option. WTF???"
"the screws that you use to attach the legs to the tv were both too long and too wide. Like the ones that came in the box specifically for that. I stripped the holes they go in trying to fit them.  I had to spend 35$ on a separate tv mount and dry wall anchors in order to watch the tv safely. So if you buy this tv, you’ll need to add a wall Mount to the cart too if you want to watch tv the same day it’s delivered."
"The OS is crazy slow out the box and never seems to get any better so I just use it as a tv for my Xbox, it goes back to the menu when u turn it on instead of staying on the hdmi input and not sure if it’s just me but often times it turns itself on which is annoying or it will say no internet connection which isn’t that bad since I don’t have to navigate the crappy OS. Like it’s really really really bad it’s like a first gen fire stick with present day updates struggling to hold on for dear life actually I think the fire stick is slightly faster and has more apps, this thing doesn’t even have all streaming apps Crunchyroll, Funimation, HiDive the fire sticks even allow you to download 1,2 or even all 3The TV just as a TV is fine colors are vibrant and black is pretty dark about as close to true black as u can get without selling a kidney for a TV."
"Ok, I’ve had this for a few months. The remote lags, tv freezes up frequently, apps quit on me and I’ve had to reset or update it several times to fix. I will be getting rid of it as soon as I can afford a better tv. It is in my bedroom, so it’s not used as often. Mainly annoyed because I have an older Vizio in my living room that doesn’t cause me near as much issues as this one does."
"The box had no packaging around the tv, just thrown in a box much larger than its size, no remote, no legs. I'm honestly surprised it even works. The screen is shoved in slightly on the corner. I gave it two stars for showing up and actually working."
"The sound vibrates and hums as if the bass is too high but adjusting the bass does not help. There are no sound setting adjustments I can make that will fix it.  It happens during certain noise/sound levels like music or sound effects.  Very annoying to me.  So far have not been able to set up a bluetooth speaker instead-don't think its bluetooth capable.  Otherwise the TV works well, good picture, no other complaints."
"TV itself came in perfect condition and with everything needed. Good audio and picture quality. I found the setup process very long but not difficult. My fault for not researching, but I was surprised to find that some apps are not available and cannot be added. It is fairly inexpensive to get a Roku or Fire Stick etc. to get access, but might have changed my decision to purchase if I knew."
"We’ve had the tv for several months now.  The overall value is good and at a fair price. The picture is very good…clean, sharp, good color. The WiFi connection gets lost often and we have to unplug and replug to get it to reconnect. The Home Screen interface is slow to respond as is the volume adjustment. Also, the Home Screen is not customizable. The sound quality is shallow."
"I'm 67 and although not computer illiterate some of the new technology can be a challenge for me however this was incredibly easy to set up. But then I could not figure out how to get the sound on.. I watched every single video that there was about getting your sound to work troubleshooting what you could have done wrong what you need to change. Nothing worked. So I rarely ever do this but I took a chance and called them. Someone actually answered the phone and I actually had a decent conversation with this person who told me I needed to send my purchase information to a certain email which I did. I think that was 2 days ago and this afternoon I received a call from vizio. Unfortunately I was not able to take the call at the time but I will call back on friday. I'm just saying that this customer service is great and nothing like I have had  in years. I still don't know whether  they are going to help me fix his TV Thst I have only had. for about 40 days or provide ma  with a replacement or neither.But at least I've had positive experience so far.They did! Initially, they wanted me to give credit card information. Just in case I was scamming them. And I couldn't figure out how to get it in, so actually they sent me a replacement t. V trusting me to return the non-functional TV which I did. And I'm so grateful!And the reason why I couldn't return It through Amazon. Was because I had been in the hospital and By the time I got out of the hospital. I was past the 30 day return window and this is how I wound up getting the assistance.And the replacement from vizio!!"
"So listen, I had an idea of what I was kind of getting into with this TV after reading mixed reviews. I didn’t really need a high quality television that was super large, so I settled on this one. Ha ha… Thank God I got it on sale.1. It’s very small and very frail2. Believe the reviews that say that it is slow and or lags very hard. It also tends to just freeze.3. At one point, after having the tv for almost 2 months, the bottom half of the remote, from the “Home Screen” button down, stopped working.  It took over 20 minutes and a few taps on the side of my couch (literally) to get the remote to pair back to the tv.Literally, at this point, it’s doing the bare minimum job of what I need it to do, I got it for half its worth on sale so I’m just rolling with the punches ha ha.  But if you’re looking for a good quality television, even for a smaller size, I would pass on this one.Update: just today as I write this review the remote once again has stopped working from the home button down so I’m not able to turn the volume up or down Baha! I mean first world problems but still…this tv would be worth about $50 at best!"
"*Update 7/26/24 - I degraded this TV from 3-stars down to 1-start and wish I never wasted my money on this piece of GARBAGE!  Constant sound issues - generally NO SOUND AT ALL!  I've done every ""fix"" Vizio has advised on and it works one day and them no volume AT ALL the next.  I don't have time to waste setting up this stupid TV on a daily basis!  I want to REALX in my family room... not fight with a TV literally every time I decide to try and watch it.  So frustrated at this point.This TV is just OK.  It serves its purpose and was a decent price, but there are some things people should be aware of if this TV is on their shortlist.  First, the sound is not great on this TV.  It's tinny and even with adjustments it's OK at best.  I bought an external sound bar that helps (thankfully).  Also, if you are an Xfinity customer, you cannot use the Xfinity app directly.  :O  You have to use an external streaming device such as a FireStick or Roku Stick and download the Xfinity app via the other device and use it from there (so stupid!).  Oh, and if you go the FireStick route, you need to have a FireStick running Fire OS 6 or higher, or it still won't work (learned that the hard way).  So be prepared to spend $160 on the TV itself... but possibly more if you like decent sound and are an Xfinity customer with an older FireStick."
"I wanted a small smart TV for my bedroom and it was just right. The good ... It has good features and streaming options. The bad ... the functionality is not user friendly. 1. It takes a long time to power on. So long, over 30 seconds, till I question if the on registered so I click on again only to realize that I just turned it off! 2. Finding PBS app once installed was like finding lost keys ... where is it? 3. Volume is so low! I don't really like it to loud, but except commercials and talk/game shows I need to turn up to over 50% of max to get a comfortable setting. 4. Changing channels is a manual pop up menu and another 30 second pause! 5. Impossible to read small screen fonts and there is no way to adjust font size. Enough said. Would I buy again...NO!"
"The picture is great and once you're connected to the internet, it works fine. The problem is that EVERY day when I turn it on, it says it can't find the network. Mind you the internet box is 6' away and it somehow manages to find it as soon as I ""forget"" it and re-enter the password, which, as you know, is never a fun job with a remote control. Once you get past that first experience with it every day, you're good to go. So I guess whether you get it depends on how much you enjoy re-entering your internet password every single day."
"I didn't expect much from this TV because of the low price and my expectations were accurate.The picture quality is fine enough but the sound quality is truly horrible, as is the remote for controlling the sound.This was supposed to be a master bedroom TV but will now go into one of the guest bedrooms while I search for a better replacement."
"TV was fine for 2 years of normal use until one day while watching a movie it cut the screen in half and started restarting non-stop. All troubleshooting tried with customer support and nothing worked.These Samsung TVs are known for malfunctioning after a couple of years of used, highly recommend staying far away from them!!!"
"Becareful when buying one of these tvs. I bought a 32 couple years back that lasted 2 years till it started turning on and off due to motherboard frying , then went and bought this one back in June 2023 just for the same thing to happen just a couple nights ago. Would not recommend for long use and wish I saw the real reviews on this and not of wasted my money on something that can't last for 4 years."
"This was my family's first venture into having a smart TV. We've always had dumb TVs, we hooked them up to the DVD player and to a computer for streaming services. Well, we decided to get with the times and try a smart TV, and wow, I wish we hadn't.The software on this TV is way more buggy than it should be allowed to be. On top of that, the UI is baffling. I'm generally very tech literate, and I find the UI almost unusable. Settings seem to be laid out in the most nonsensical way possible. I constantly laughing in utter disbelief at this TV, I can't believe that a QA tester somewhere used this TV and decided it was good enough to roll out. I'm about to move out and I'm scared what's going to happen when I leave this TV with my Gen X/boomer parents. I don't think they're going to have the patience and intuition to figure out how to do even basic things on this ridiculous TV.The search feature is absolutely awful. It must be biased towards certain streaming services, because for half the titles you search, you get terribly optimized results. Often, you'll only get things like the sing-along version and a YouTube clipshowas you type in the title. It's only once you've typed in the entire title perfectly and completely (using the arrow keys on the remote!) that the search feature begrudgingly shows you the movie you want to watch.Now, maybe this is just me being behind the times, but I was shocked when this TV showed up without analog audio output. It didn't even occur to me that someone would make a TV without that. They really want you to get their Bluetooth speaker, I guess. No thanks, I've got a whole audio setup already. We had to get a digital-to-analog adapter, and the audio is kinda buggy when I put it through that setup. Might be the fault of the adapter, but still, how ridiculous that the TV wouldn't have analog output.I also just kind of assumed that it would be easy to hook the TV up to a computer and switch to HDMI input for a nice, simple monitor. Nope. You have to navigate the awful smart TV UI in order to open an app that shows the HDMI input. Tried to watch something from my computer last night, and it just wouldn't work. Took something like 20 minutes and a weird workaround to actually get both video and audio playing.At this point, this review is just a screed against smart TVs, but dear God, if we're going to keep doing this smart TV thing, can we at least make them work well?"
"The tv is fine for the price. You can tell it’s a budget option, but it works for our family. The remote is so annoyingly finicky that I took off two stars. You have to perform couch Pilates just to get the remote to find the eye on the tv, and believe me: it has to be an exact aim, and even then there’s often a delay. I truly hate it! I have remotes that work around the corner and in my pocket. Why is this Samsung remote so technically deficient? It’s cool that the remote is rechargeable, I guess, but the solar charging feature is useless in my house, for various reasons. That’s not Samsung’s fault, but the remote puts me in a bad mood so I thought I would complain about that.Customer service deserves a slashed star. When our dog bit the already dumb remote, it seemed broken, we called and were promised a replacement, but that it would take 10 weeks for a then brand new tv! That remote never came. It was never shipped. They just forgot. To be clear, this is Samsung CS, to which we were directed by Amazon. Luckily, I was able to fix the remote myself. It works just as crappily as it did before the dog bit it."
"Overall, the TV picture is good, sound quality minimal….you really need a sound bar!  But the remote control is bad…I’m not able to adjust the volume with the remote, have to ask Alexa to increase the volume and the response time for her is slow.  When asking Alexa for a particular program, typically the wrong program comes up, so the voice command isn’t recognizing my wording….I’ve read other people have this same issue.  Fortunately one can replace the remote with a better one, but Samsung needs to up their game on this!!"
"Great television while it lasted. We connected our TIVIO into HDMI 1 port and our Roku into HDMI 2. The TIVIO gave us our local station via an HD antenna and the Roku all our Internet services. Life was good as we could easily navigate between the two HDMI ports. Most of the Internet services like Netflix, Prime, Disney, etc. were available via the Samsung apps on the television but we were used to our Roku. Anyway, all was great for 10 months and then the television stopped switching between sources. I'd hit the Home button on the remote, which used to bring up the menu to switch between sources, and nothing would come up. I tried everything to fix the issue from replacing batteries in the remote, to resetting the remote, unplugging the television for 5 minutes and then plugging it back in, was on the phone with customer support for over an hour and even did a factory reset of the television. Nothing worked. I could go into the settings and choose to setup sources and while doing that switch between TIVO and Roku, but that is a huge pain to do every time you want to switch sources. When next I decide to invest in a new ""Smart TV"" I'll think twice before going with a Samsung."
"This is the second time that I have had no Volume. Only purchased on March 21,2023Had to unplug and wait 20 seconds. Plug it back in and Volume works. Only 8 months old and I have to do this? Very disappointed. Sometimes I believe that they sent me a refurbished TV at a new TV price. Last time I purchase a TV from Amazon."
"I may have been spoiled by my Panasonic Vierra Plasma for all these years. I finally jumped up to the 4k tech, but with this TV, it’s just not a great quality picture. Specifically, it’s not bright enough, has poor black levels, and the “clouding” affect of LEDs, which I was unaware of, really is a major detractor with my unit. You basically can’t watch the TV unless the room is completely dark. Even then, the “clouding” affect on mine even makes dark-room viewing mediocre. Plasmas also aren’t good for non-dark viewing, but they’re (at least the one I have) far better than this, even as a long defunct 1080p tech.If you can afford it, make the extra investment in an OLED. This purchase was very disappointing."
"So no bolts included for mounting to tv bracket unfortunately.  They do give dimensions which I went to hardware store to buy.  There's a picture her what you need.  Or buy a mounting bolt kit for more money.The software is extremely slow.  Glacial.The TV tuner for over the is broken after 2 weeks.  It will only tune to one channel, trying to change channels only goes to TV plus channels.  Have reprogram and rescinded over the air channels. There are about 50. But the tuner still does not recognize them and the channel guide doesn't work. I reset the software and updated software no help. I didn't buy a project!!The menu on this TV is much less user friendly than previous models.  More clicks to get where you need to go.  I bought a 50 inch which really,  is quite small. But I guess you get what you par for.Bluetooth speaker has to be manually connected each time TV is turned on.This TV is GARAGE!!!  I have a $4000 series 7 Samsung and this TV is nothing like that one."
"This is the third Samsung TV I have owned. I started with the curved screen model when it first came out. Loved it. I bought a flat screen a couple years ago, no problems.Then I bought this TV and it’s been nothing but problems!It’s the most aggravating TV I have ever owned.It does not recognize TIVO when it tries to program the inputs. It tries to, over and over and over and always fails. I’m fine with HDMI INPUT2 just being input 2 but the TV isn’t and I spend a lot of time waiting on it to setup the TIVO, almost daily, knowing it’s gonna fail.Once I add input one and input two to the Home Screen within days the TV deletes it and I have to add it again.Picture is beautiful but this Smart TV is too smart to make it consumer friendly.I’m moving it out of my TV room into the Den over the fireplace, where we never watch TV and moving my old curved Samsung back into the TV room. It’s less complicated and it does what I tell it to do! No arguments!!!"
Purchase Samsung product for elderly mother with Alexa Voice control to make control easier.Spent $650.00 for disappointment of needing to replace SAMSUNG PRODUCT IN 2 YEARS OF USE.CALL SAMSUNG TROUBLE SHOOTING TO NO SOLUTION.MUST PURCHASED ANOTHER TV. (VERY EXPENSIVE LESSON)
"I thought that this remote with the solar charging capability would be awesome.But the tv informed me the battery was low and to replace batteries.Now the remote doesn’t work with this option.I have to plug it in now to charge.I would give a 5 star rating.Remote with self charge sounds great but not workingUPDATENow I plugged the remote in for charging…..Charges but you have about 5 minutes before the tv tells you battery lowGoing to by original, AAA battery operated remote"
"This TV was a pretty big disappointment. It was difficult to see the screen in a bright room- especially in dark scenes. The remote is easy to lose and easy to break. Additionally, the internal operating system is not user friendly. Then, after having this tv for only 2 years, it developed a thick brownish yellow stripe down the screen. Just purchased a new TV from Hisense. Save your money and look elsewhere."
"We loved this TV, the picture and features were perfect...  In fact, we liked it so much that we purchased a second one for our Daughter as a Christmas gift.  However, after only 18 months the screen went dark and the sound went out...  That's right, in less than two years, our nice new $600 Flat Screen was dead...  Why two stars instead of one?  Well, it was a great TV while is lasted...So I'm writing this review just so that others will know that you may be spending your money on a product that simply won't last..."
"The amount of times we have to unplug the tv to reset it is more than it should be for a tv of this caliber. It constantly drops connection (often in the middle of streaming live sports), while my other (much cheaper) TVs don't. The picture quality is great and I appreciate Samsung's Smart user interface, but if I didn't have to unplug it every week, I'd give it 5 stars.Updating: changed my review from 4 stars to 2, as I can now say that this tv is an absolute piece of trash. Apps continue to crash, and software continues to malfunction. Done. I don't even want to call customer service because Samsung is trash and I know they won't fo anything about it."
"How can I get Alexa to turn on the TV?I installed Smart things on my phone.  That gives me some control over the TV but doesn't let me turn it on.I installed the Smart things Skill for Alexa.  (Which had some scam advertising).I can turn the TV off with Alexa but I can't turn the TV on.  If I can't turn the TV on with Alexa, then I need to grab the remote.  How can I fix this?"
I purchased this TV from this seller on amazon.  It stopped working after 1.5 years.  I was sold a lemon and they refuse to do anything about it.  BUYER BEWARE.  DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS COMPANY.
I have a very old Samsung and love it but this tv drove me nuts. There is a delay in the sound or the picture is too fast. You have to click through nearly 20 apps to get to the sleep timer. It does not work well or easily with Roku. I returned it. I hope Samsung listens to so many of us who have complained about the same thing and makes some adjustments.
I wanted a really sharp Picture which is what I was l lead to believe I was getting but even though the picture is just ok it’s not what I expected. My old 15 year old Mitsubishi has just as good maybe better. The remote is horrible to operate. Where with my old TV only required 1 remote to operate everything now I have to have 2 to even change the volume. Returning TV & will go with an LG
"Picture and screen are great as expected. But the UI is awful. It's slow, clunky, unintuative. Constantly having to reload apps when they suddenly stop mid stream of a show or a game and just closing out and restarting apps is not clear. You aren't sure if the app is just backgrounded or actually killed off. Many times the app is still running so you aren't restarting the app like you want. Just bad UI. Unfortunate. Whatever at this point. Shame."
Remote is terrible….my old old remote was so much better..this one you have to be careful of where you point it…miss by by 2” and push the buttons again…I will take my old one any day…this new green Sol or one is crap….
bought thinking being a smart TV it would be easier to use - wrongmore steps and a simpler remote are actually harder to use .I also have a problem with amazon considering they changed my purchase tofinancing rather than give me the 5 percent reward - not honest
"I replaced a 6 year old Samsung with this New one, and I'm disappointed Big time. Don't misunderstand me...I'm a Samsung Buyer when it comes to televisions, so ... no this tv is Not BAD OR FLAWED...IT'S A BEAUTIFUL and QUALITY TV...Just didn't Blow me Away, and was no better than the 6 year old one that i replaced..."
"I would pay a premium to buy a TV from Samsung that doesn’t have a UI, for the sake of having picture quality and longevity. After using this Tv for two months, I can tell it won’t last two years. It’s laggy, frustrating to use, and Samsung TV Plus is garbage that curses the device. Focus on hardware, pull back from UI, and let Apple and Roku specialize in app/UI development. I want to buy a tv that I can use for ten years, not this thing that has great picture quality today but won’t turn on in three years. I how smart TVs die out sometime soon, because none of the major manufacturers are capable of making one that doesn’t fail after a couple years, in favor of their spyware."
Got the black screen of death on this just 2 years after purchase.  Good thing the support warranty expired right at 2 years.  They weren’t a day late.
"The included remote stopped working entirely about 5 weeks in. The only available replacement looks like it was made in the 80s.Essentially none of the smart features work at all and do not sync properly with Samsung, Google OR Amazon applications. Zero chance of integrating google assistant and Alexa. Samsung's menus are convoluted and make it a nightmare to connect just about any device, even a Bluetooth soundbar.The picture is just average, I could tell essentially no difference from my older 55'' Vizio that was much cheaper. Not immersive at all even from only about 9' away.This is a big TV for the price but terrible UI, smart integration and a junk remote make it not worth it."
I have had more problems with this television than any other I have ever owned. The motherboard had to be replaced in the 1st 6 months of ownership. I then had to have the Wi-Fi module to be replaced. Samsung sent out a technician who charged $150 for the service call and $109 for the Wi-Fi part. The should have been underneath Warrenty. Now 9 months later. The streaming function and the Wi-Fi internal to the television only work when you hold down the power button for 5 seconds and the entire television resets. There are other times when you press the button and it comes on. I am not interested in technology that works when it wants to work. The aftermarket reseller of this product did not honour any of the duties and responsibilities as designated as a Warranty
"I would return this TV if I could. I waited too long trying to make it work. It is crazy that a tv freezes up and support tells you to turn off the tv, unplug it, wait and plug it back in to reset the TV. If this was a one time thing then no big deal but I have to do it at least every other day.  As soon as I can afford to I'm going to trash it and buy another brand."
I really like the TV … the remote makes no sense. There are no numbers on it to be able to get to a station quicker. I honestly would not have purchased tv if I knew how bad the Remote was going to be. All my TVs are Samsung and I’ve never run into this. Very disappointed
It’s as if it was created to enrage users.  When trying to find an app or a show it will literally source results for all things but what I said or typed verbatim.  I loathe this tv. Don’t buy it.  Samsung sucks.
"Like most Samsung products, stay away from this one. Within two years it decided it wanted to turn off and on repeatedly."
"I hate this f TV. It takes a few months getting to hate it and by the time you do, times up on a refund or exchange. Biggest gripe would be the very sensitive remote buttons and the picture sucks. Look elsewhere or spend a little more and get a tv better than this crap. I thought Samsung was the best out there. Even if selling a tv at 500-600.00 you still need to make sure it’s the best or don’t sell it at all."
"This tv is not good, the picture is fuzzy tbe blacks have alot of shadows and it is not bright enough.  Alot of glare."
Tv is fine except all the clouding. There’s a lot of it. I was told it fades in time. It does not. Tried ‘massaging’ the screen with a soft cloth. Pretty much all the stuff they said would help doesn’t. The screen is warped a little. Not sure if it was shipping or just a crap tv.
"Is not what is supposed to be, hdmi problems as you see it, resolution, connectivity, is a mess"
"Since I purchased the Samsung 65 inch TV, it continues to randomly turn off.  All timers are off, I upgraded to the latest update of software, unplugged and replugged the set, and it continues to turn totally off.  The set can be on all day and it just turns off after a few hours, or just the first15 minutes and it turns off. I would like to request some assistance with this problem. There are no numbers to call either Amazon or the insurance I purchased.  it is all very confusing."
Don’t buy. The rechargeable remote control did not recharge!!  I had to buy a new remote for $39.
"I purchased the TV and paid to have it mounted to my wall. After two days, the HDMI port went out, so I called Amazon to report the problem. Amazon then transferred me to Samsung technical support, and I was instructed to reset the TV to resolve the ""Glitch,"" as they called it. The reset fixed the problem, but the HDMI went out two days later, so I returned it and replaced it. When the new TV arrived, I noticed the screen and bezel had plastic protective coverings, which the first TV didn't. That's when I discovered that the first TV I purchased had been USED before I bought the replacement. When I called Amazon to complain, their answer was, ""our system shows the TV as new.""Bottom line, I bought a used TV, lost money having the TV mounted and taken down for return, and Amazon had nothing to say but ""Sorry."""
The picture is crazy good. UI is very slow and non responsive. Remote randomly will spas out and go crazy.
"Set up procedure is very cumbersome, not complicated, but lots of steps required."
"The Smart OS is slow. Navigating to the home screen takes up the entire screen and exits the application you are currently using. It pushes ads on you, especially Samsung TV+, which I would never have any use for. Sometimes the entire TV app controls freeze and the TV has to be rebooted by holding down the power button on the remote for a few minutes."
"I hate this TV. It's horrible! So much RED! No matter what we did, no matter what we tried, every color was tinged pink. We tried adjusting the color, the brightness, the contrast. We tried adjusting the color using the advanced settings...not good. We used a DVD that professionally helps you adjust your TV color. Nothing worked. We could not get rid of the red. Then, only four days after getting it, the left speaker blew. I was playing a game, on normal levels of loudness (like, around 20 or something) and POW! The speaker blew. Everything sounded fuzzy after that. We had already decided to return it. I'm glad to be rid of it. I'll be looking for something else."
3 of the 4 panels started fading after a couple of weeks.
Hello I ordered this TV because my other TV that was five years old have very good color so I thought this would be a good change and it turns out that my TV that I had for five years has a better picture than this new one which is a QLED very disappointing and the return process is the worst still trying to get a return have a nice day Mike
"After just 3 months, this 'smart' TV continually crashes during viewing - the screen goes black and the streaming program needs to be reinstalled !!  My entire family hates this TV...I bought it for the picture quality - which isn't so good.  I wish I could return it !!!  Save your money and buy a TLC"
"Picture developed a discolored area 8-10” from top of screen to bottom.  Took several days before Samsung processed a trouble ticket.  Then several more days before Samsung handed ticket off to their service provider.  Several more days to order parts.  Parts took about a week, then took 3 days before calling to schedule repair.  Repair appointment was scheduled out two more weeks.  Very poor customer service on a warranty!  We’ll see if they actually get it fixed the first time.  I’m very upset and disappointed with Samsung!  Don’t recommend!"
"The power rating is not global (110-240v), as claimed in the product details when I was procuring it. It is a US power rating (110-120v). This is very disappointing because I purchased a total of six TVs and I had to procure a stepdown transformer for each."

"The TV looked fantastic, however it measured 37 3/4 inches tall and would not fit in the entertainment unit 37"" high TV space.  So sad I had to return it!"
Less than a year.  Dead
"This television turns itself off and on. So the only way to stop it is unplug it; it’s the reason I ordered a TV because the TV I used to have although at least I had that for years would do the same thing. You plug it in, it turns itself off and on every five or six seconds. The TV I got yesterday…it didn’t even show a logo - when you plugged it in. It got light and it went dark. Over and over again.So this is the third TV to that bought, the last two this week!!!!They are manufacturing issues, clearly."
"Have had the tv for less than two years. Remote charges by solar or usb-c. A while back it wouldn’t charge - this went on a few days and then started working. Recently, It quit working again and won’t charge. Can’t use the tv without the remote"
We have owned this TV for less than two years.  Yesterday the picture would not come on and power would randomly turn on/off.We now have to decide if we should pay to have it repaired or buy another tv.  It won’t be a Samsung if we do.
"I bought this 70"" TV to replace a 6-year old Samsung and assumed it would be dramatically better.  What I have found is a huge amount of content has a jerky motion that can't be controlled with the video options. I've tried every possible variation of settings and zero improvement.  It's so disappointing when you're a long time Samsung fan to buy a $1000 new TV only to see the picture is worse than your old model.  If I could, I'd trade this in for a 120 KZ refresh model but strongly recommend NOT buying this TV."

I bought this TV for my mom for here birthday. It only lasted two years and has had issues constantly. If you buy this TV you should get a extended warranty because Samsug has bad customer service. The tec said that it would cost $945.00 to fix it and the original cost of the TV was $600 plus. Lasted Only 2 years what disappointment.
This TV has poor backlight bleed/blooming in dark scenes/letterboxing all over the screen. It’s severely distracting. And the menu with all of the smart apps is so slow and hard to maneuver compared to older models. Definitely not worth the money.
"Overall solid TV picture wise, but for some reason a couple apps periodically don't want to work within the TV's operating system. Got the TV two weeks ago and have already had to reinstall the Netflix app multiple times because it and others will randomly become unresponsive which is really annoying."
When watching Amazon prime videos the aspect ratio changes depending on material and there is no clear fix to my knowledge.Samsung does not support the NBA TV App either
"When we received this product it was definitely a used one.  The box was tapes, the TV didn't work, there wasn't any cables, remote or paperwork in it.  It was a present for our 85 year old dad for his birthday and several family members gathered to set it up for him.  Very frustrating and disappointing.  Returned it and just got the replacement.  Will write a review on it once we get it set up."
"Beautiful picture but, is not user friendly. I really dislike this tv!! I should have bought a Vizio like I have in the past!"
"I purchased a tv 2 weeks ago and the issue is while watching a live game it freeze and i have to turn off plugged and open again. In addition, the tv changed channel by itself without pressing remote buttons…."
"The TV standing is not firm, so it is shaking i.e., if you want to clean dust out of the screen! But more importantly, the TV remote is charging with solar and I was not able to charge it after even 2 days exposed to sun/light! And they did NOT include charging cord to charge it otherwise❗️I do not use any Samsung devices, I have to pay for that charger as well, because greedy Samsung corporation did not include a simple charger 🔌 in a $1000 item❗️"
"Loses connection and shuts itself off constantly.  My 2 samsungs are the only tvs that do that, out of 6 total in my home.  Very unhappy, I wish I had returned it."
need to reset this tv all the time if you use Bluetooth most of the time the sound not out from the tv to bluetooth you always have to reset the tv i am not happy for that
"The TV was severely damaged. The glass window was shattered and detached from the LED base in both lower corners. Looked as the TV has been dropped. The back of the TV had a hole in it, the entire back was in very rough condition. Extremely disappointed to receive this item in such rough condition."
"The TV is awesome, beautiful picture and paired well with our Vizio sound bar. The reason for the 1 star is the remote. It “solar” so I left it by the window to recharge and still doesn’t work. Plugged it in to charge using a USB it says full and then when we unplugged to use it dies out. And if you leave it plugged in for long it still doesn’t work."
A shadow appeared on the left hand side of the screen (covers about a foot into the screen). Definitely should not be having issues like this only a year after purchasing! Very disappointing
Can’t make the color lighter.
I bought this TV June 2022 and now the TV has gone black and wont turn off just randomly flashes.... I'm really pissed right now cause it's just a waste of money... Won't be buying another Samsung tv
"The TV started to have glitches shy of 4 months. Vertical lines, shutting on and off. Was transferred through customer service for hours and their solution was to give them (samsung) all my information for a call back in two days to “assess “ IF the tv was damaged. Terrible experience"
TV is great if it will work past 6 months. I've bought 2 in one year.
TV lasted less than 30 days.  And to make matters worse Samsung's service department was impossible to deal with!!!!!  Kept giving me excuses as to why they couldn't schedule a tech to come out to troubleshoot.  This will be the last Samsung product I'll ever purchase.
"unfortunately this large yellow splotch never went away, even though if you research about these tvs this yellow splotch is common, but supposedly goes away over time. ours has not, so we returned this tv."
Wi-fi stopped working after 2 months
The picture quality is awful. I wish we didn’t but this.
The sound stopped working when you changed the channel. Would not come back for around 10 min. I don’t know if this was just a faulty with my particular one or if this is an on going issue. So take this review for what it is.Definitely a major inconvenience.
Do not buy this. The operating system is absolutely garbage. Barely ever can connect to the internet and when watching live programming it cuts out every 20 minutes. Really regretting not getting something else.
"Picture is choppy, at best, do not waste your money. I regret ever buying, It has been relegated to the wood shed brought back the 10 year old tv."
"TV is super unresponsive,  slow despite my fast  internet speed and the remote stopped working,  then melted when I tried to recharge it."
"Pigments of black are shadowed, not clear at all times, not a great picture for the price. Did Amazon sell reject tv's?"
There was something wrong with the Samsung tv. We returned it.
Tv was defected have not got refund very disappointed Pick up on  July 22 time 15:05
Poorly made. Didn't last a week
The media could not be loaded.
White blooming everywhere
"Returned, the lag is unwatchable"
Bought this TV in July of 2023. Since then it developed lines across the TV in several spots. LED panel is no good according to smasung but since I was 3 months past my 1 year warranty Samsung refuses to do anything. Never buying Samsung again.
"I’m very disappointed with the television and Samsung customer service support.. I was sold a lemon, right before my warranty ran out lines appeared on the screen.. no biggie they sent out an technician, an replaced the screen.. not more than 2 months same problem happens again.. they sent out another technician and screen.. at this point I’m a little annoyed but they replaced the screen so ok.. however, within 3 months of watching tv on the replacement screen another line appeared on my screen.. called the service team NO HELP .. saying your warranty ran out a week ago and my only options were to trade in the old tv and purchase a new tv… for over 1k or be stuck with a broke tv…like are you serious.. some help ..YOU guys sent out 2 janky screens to my home on 2 different occasions .now you want me to pay for your mistake...it’s really sad a case"
Screen started going black within a minute of turning it on. First and last Samsung product I purchased. Just over a year old out of warranty
"I bought a new hisense U6H, and it has some glitchy behavior but generally a great picture. I decided to get a Samsung instead figuring they were good quality and have the bugs ironed out. Well the Samsung picture is dark no matter what I do, the motion blur is noticable and clear motion makes everything into a soap opera. The remote is an abomination and has limited buttons that require going into settings menus to change anything. Geez Samsung, put an input button on the remote at least.Very disappointed in this Samsung TV. I really wanted to like it, but its going back.  I put the hisense U6H back in its place and its picture is 1000x better than the Samsung."
"I’m not sure why this TV has such good ratings. it’s not intuitive to use at all. Drives me crazy. I’ve had it for a month and I cannot figure out how to watch local channels if I can at all. I haven’t watch the today show since I bought the TV into my favorite morning show. It took me a couple of days to figure out how to disable the hideous motion smoothing that I can tell you as someone that works the film industry, SHOULD NEVER EXIST.The worst thing is that it’s not intuitive. I constantly get frustrated just trying to use this TV. The older TVs were better. In short, It sucks."
"I like that the stand for the 55” is a solid middle stand rather than multiple legs. It’s got 4K but not 120Hz and no HDMI 2.1. So this is not a high-end spec model, but the thing I’m most disappointed is on how the device upscales non-4K content, which is what most TV content is."
"I’ve had Samsung TVs in the past which are working for 10+ years and this one started powercycling (on for few seconds then off for 10 seconds, basically unusable) last even after less than 2 years. Samsung support said it’s out of warranty and I need to pay whatever it costs to get it fixed. Super lame. Don’t buy this TV and if you buy any Samsung TVs make sure to buy extended warranty which I made the mistake of not buying :-/"
I’ve owned 4 Samsung TVs.  Each had a great picture and sound.  I had to replace the remote on every one of them in the first month or so.  Poor response and buttons stick.  When you spend over $1K on a TV you should not get a $5 remote in the box.
"The warranty and customer service process with Samsung is HORRIBLE. I recently bought this television and it was damaged following the process outlined by Samsung for a television this large. I call customer service thinking they would honor their warranty as the TV is new. Greatly disappointed. They voided the warranty as it was deemed to be ""physical damage"". After speaking to three customer service representatives and submitting a service ticket (the service ticket was to see how much it would cost for repair) I receive an email from Samsung Electronics America stating that ""Samsung has given a one-time accommodation to cover the on service transaction [service ticket number]"". You could probably imagine the joy and relief I experienced. The next day the service ticket was canceled. I called customer service to understand what happened and turns out they are reneging on the email they sent. They're claiming that email should have never been sent to me and that I should disregard it...excuse me? 90 mins later, after talking to two supervisors (the last of whom was outrageously rude claiming that I didn't have the money to fix the TV out-of-pocket and asking if I needed her to read the warranty out load) they refused to standby the email they sent. They're claiming the email was sent via a technical error, which is far-fetched. Even so I've NEVER experienced customer service where they take back a one-time accommodation to appease a customer or don't honor a mistake that was made on their end. After this I'm NEVER purchasing another Samsung product as their word when it comes to customer service is meaningless. I wish I could give zero stars..."
"TV lasted 3 weeks. Then it wouldn't turn on just flashing blue screen. Could not get any support. Had it fixed locally this time lasted 1 week. He fixed it again, tested for a week. I got it back lasted one day. Only thing it is good for is recycling maybe not even that."
"Despite the high cost, these models are designed with cheap components and have known power-board issues. TV has broken 2x and each time it has taken over three weeks to fix.Samsung ""customer service"" is non-existent and their repair contractors are incompetent and slow. Both try to make the repair process as tedious and time-consuming as possible to avoid spending $ on warranty repairs.The ironically-named ""smart"" features are moronic. They ghost certain popular apps (Spotify), hard-sell the content SAMSUNG wants you to watch,  and data-mine like Google on steroids.Not only would I never own another Samsung TV, I wouldn't even accept one as a gift."
I thought the entire setup was wireless. I shoulda paid more attention. 😪
"This speaker setup is awesome! The sound is great, music and movies are awesome and the sub is even better than I'd hoped for. For this price, I really don't feel this system can be beat. But... Klipsch makes awesome products but their customer service leaves a lot to be desired. In my experience and opinion, they hardly seemed interested in the problem and once they finally decided to fix the issue, it took them a ridiculous amount of time to ship the replacement. But they did, *finally* come through. (Maybe they're more responsive to customers who are dropping thousands for a setup?) So the missing star in my review belongs solely to whoever it is that manages the customer service department at Klipsch!Bummer! Right out the box, it was obvious the speaker on the sub was damaged. The surround (the soft ring glued to the outer perimeter of the cone) was deformed. (This can affect performance and lead to premature failure of the speaker.) In my view it seems like a manufacturing defect. The rubber seemed warped, twisted, or stretched, not crushed. I don't believe it was a shipping problem. (The box wasn't damaged.) It may have been a (factory) packing problem as I noticed the molded Styrofoam blocks seemed to have been forcibly pressed against other packing materials that weren't aligned properly, slightly crushing some of the packing material. This makes me think that the people or machines doing the packing don't know their own strength.The real let-down is that Amazon wouldn't cross-ship so my only option is to wait for them to receive the return before a replacement can be mailed out.I will update this review once the replacement arrives and everything is up and running!Update 1 (2022/08/31): I returned the first system and ordered a replacement. It arrived today. I inspected it only to discover it has similar (but different) damage in the same area. Both units came from the same seller (Woot) but I don't think they are to blame. I contacted Klipsch and they are sending a new, replacement sub and I'm sending them the damaged sub. I have also sent them photos and evidence I have that has convinced me that this is a packaging issue. I will update again with news...Update 2 (2022/09/06): Klipsch is a frustrating company to deal with. On one hand they said they would replace the sub. On the other hand, I contacted them to see if they'd shipped the sub yet and they told me that it will be from 7 to 10 days just for them to approve the replacement. It may turn out that Klipsch is a bad bet for anyone buying a receiver at the same time because by the time you finally get your speakers, your receiver is past its return window (which is important if something were to be wrong with the receiver). I will update again with news...Update 3 (2022/09/16): The replacement sub from Klipsch has arrived, I've tested everything, and its all working, just one day before the return window closed on the receiver I purchased. (Nice to have a little bit of luck...) For more, see the top of this review."
I unboxed and plugged everything in. The speakers sound great but the sub doesn’t make any sound even though it’s powered in and plugged in correctly. Could be a faulty output on the receiver. Very disappointed.Update. Klipsch sent me a replacement amplifier for the sub still didn’t fix the issue. Ridiculous
"The CNET review from 2018 (""Teeny Tiny Speakers Will Blow Your House Down"") must be regarding a differrent version of the Klipsch Reference system.  At original retail of $999, I thought this was a great deal and easy solution for replacing a failed LG soundbar system.  I think the front/center/surround speakers give reasonably good sound for the under $300 price.  However, the subwoofer is just annoying.  I have adjusted every level setting in my surround sound receiver, and the crossover and gain settings on the Klipsch sub and either I get very little bass effect, or I get BOOMP BOOMP BOOMP vibration that is less like sound reproduction and more like getting stuck at a red light next to THAT car.  If you are watching a movie with things blowing up, maybe this is an exciting surround effect.  If you are listening to music, it is just an annoying indistinct low end thud.  It is an 8"" sub speaker in a 12"" cabinet.  I don't know my music tech, but this is surprisingly poor reproduction of any low end.  I have tried to use just the sub with a pair of low end Polk towers as well.  The sound is better with the subwoofer turned off.  Probably a reasonable value for $284 for movie watching.  Klipsch must have downgraded something in this prodcut because no one would pay $999 for it."
Had the product for about two weeks and everything was awesome. The sound was great and set up was real easy. Fast forward past the two weeks and all the speakers started to have static interference when playing. Tries contacting technical assistant and no help from they. Their solution was to send my brand new product into repair to a local repair shop and I would have to pay all the expenses to ship it. Absolutely no help from them and after only having the product for two weeks makes no sense for me to pay more money to fix a problem with their product. Customer support is really bad with this company and have seen that in other reviews. Be careful purchasing this product. It works great for a few weeks and goes bad.
The home theater receiver did not work when it was first set up - displayed a message to call customer support and produced no sound.Called Customer Support and they advised me to return the defective product to swap with another new receiver.This is not a good way to start my customer experience.
"Subwoofer is last item to remove from the box. Top of subwoofer top had a scratch about 1"" long. Subwoofer wrapping paper arrangement gave the appearance it had been removed from box then returned to box. Sub woofer sound is scratchy. Followed instructions to the letter but the sound was poor quality. The 4 wall mount speakers and 1 center of the speaker were well wrapped and deliver a full clear sound, mounted easily per instructions. I will not use the subwoofer, it will interfere with the sound from the surround speakers. Kept the original JBL 8"" subwoofer in place. It & the surround speakers work well together. Smooth & mellow, or loud vibrate the walls. Voice, Bass guitar, & other instruments clear at all sound levels."
"Everything about the purchase of this product was about 5 stars, until the conclusion. Arrived on time, good product, good sound quality, etc.But there was a little problem that turned into a nightmare! Each one of the “legs” of the subwoofer should have a “rubber foot”, which is probably one of the simpler and inexpensive parts of it, and one was missing! It’s not glued, just inserted under pressure.Why is this important?If you put the subwoofer on a hard floor (my case), without the 4 little rubber feet, as it fires down, the subwoofer loses stability and the unprotected leg hits the floor, creating a noise that shouldn’t be there.Klipsch customer service initially was exemplary, and immediately sends a replacement! But the replacement parts were wrong, not even belong to this subwoofer! Contacted the second time, and made sure they have the correct subwoofer model. They double check on their side to make sure all was right this time. The attendant apparently understood, went to another department to verify “what went wrong” and assured me will work this time!Wrong part arrives again! Since the third time's a charm, this time I send pictures with arrows pointing the rubber foot and a schematic sketch so they could recognize the mysterious part.Klipsch email answer: Go find this part on the secondary market… REALLY?Because of the time spent, I can no longer return the product. To make even better, they lowered $100 of the price. Klipsch customer service was polite, but incompetent. I am using the system with a piece of cardboard under the leg, so I can repeat this story to all my friends, if they decide to buy anything from Klipsch."
I received the onkyo tx-rz50 that was previously opened.  I order a new one. The onkyo tx-rz50 seems to be working fine.
"I bought this system in August 2021.  As soon as I set it up, the subwoofer started making a loud, random popping noise.  I researched and researched, trying to figure out what might be causing it.  I tried plugging it in to different outlets, using a surge protector, anything I could think of, but the popping never stopped for more than a couple of hours.  Then, one day I switched it on in the hopes of watching a movie and it worked beautifully – no pops, good bass.  I have no idea why it suddenly started working properly, but I used it happily (the system sounds good when it works well) for over half a year.Then, with no warning whatsoever, about three weeks ago, the subwoofer started popping again – in the middle of the night when I was asleep.  So I was back to trying to figure out how to stop it.  I discovered that the subwoofer popped even when not connected to the receiver, and that it also popped when I plugged it in in the kitchen rather than in my study.I wrote to Klipsch about the problem, but they have not bothered to return my message.  LOUSY customer service.So, I gave up and replaced it with a Polk Audio Polk Audio HTS 10 Powered Subwoofer, which I received a few days ago.  It's working beautifully and the whole system now sounds good.  I’m considering dropping the Klipsch subwoofer off a 40-story building, just to hear it pop one last time."
"I purchased these to replace a Monoprice 5.1 system and after installing these speakers, there were pros and cons. I appreciated the sound quality and clarity, particularly for mids and highs. The provided sub was incredibly powerful and had to be dialed back considerably when I manually calibrated the speakers. The problem with these speakers though, is that the center speaker lows were extremely high. So much so that any male vocals from watching films were very distracting and unbearable to listen. Even my kids and wife complained. As much as my receiver and media player would allow, whether it was a gaming console, blu-ray player or streaming app, I reduced the bass levels as much as possible for all the satellite speakers but it still would not resolve the booming lows coming from the center speaker. I went ahead and removed the center speaker and replaced it with my old center channel speaker. I would definitely recommend this system otherwise. However, I would purchase a separate center speaker option."
"Arrived without speaker cables...could it be more disappointing? I can't connect the speakers..I checked the boxes, still in my house, for an hour, but no."
"Out of the box I hooked the sub woofer to my PC and ran a sound check with some brown noise. Something inside the sub rattles. Tried everything I could think of to make sure the problem wasn't with me and was in fact the sub.All the other speakers worked perfectly.So now I have the dilemma of returning it for replacement or keeping it, opening it up, and hoping I can fix whatever is loose myself.Not exactly my idea of a quality product."
The subwoofer is actually pretty good.  I have it in a large room and it puts out a lot of bass. The other speakers are mediocre at best. Probably okay as satellites but not as front and center.  If I had paid the original price of $1000 I would have been upset.  For around $350 I probably got what I paid for. I would have returned them if the seller accepted returns.
Tried to set up my “home theater system” only to realize there is additional equipment needed that was not included. More experienced home theater enthusiasts may realize these are only speakers and a receiver will also be required but for a novice like myself the term “surround sound system” seems misleading. The description should note “receiver not included” or “additional equipment necessary”.
"Would have given it more stars had the sub not come with a cap missing on one foot and scuffed up on one side. Woot did made good with a $70 refund so I'll take that and fix it myself. I'm very happy with the surprisingly clean sound on dialogue, especially for a $379 budget system being used in a 2nd room. The sub is a bit lacking in quality bass but that's to be expected at this price point though the wireless feature is very handy in not having to run a long cord. I can always upgrade the sub."
"One of the satellite tweeters has a lot of static/scratch in it, so I guess this is a 4.1 system now unless someone from Klipsch or Amazon wants to trade a single speaker out of the set."
Doesn't come with the wiring that you need to set up.  Return the product cost $65.  I've never purchased a worst system.  Why no one has shared this in the other reviews I do not know.  I've never been so disappointed in a a product.  How do you not include all the wires that you need to make you product work.  Do not purchase big mistake!!!
"center channel is muddy and terrible.  If you go with this kit be prepared to replace it asap.Everything else is decently good quality and the subwoofer wireless hookup was really easy to deal with.  I have my doubts about how accurate the sub performance actually is but I have just started playing with it.the very first thought I had was ""this center channel sounds like utter garbage."""
Used product for 1 day. Liked it. Would not power up 2nd day.  Tried to contact seller with no response. Would not even honor request for receipt. Will never buy from this seller again. I use Amazon because I thought it protected buyers. Not this time
"Sound quality is very average, not at all as crisp and clear as I had expected or hoped for. Pretty dissatisfied overall. Used as 5.1 setup with a top end Pioneer receiver. An old multistereo set up of a pair of JBLs and a pair of Polks sounds infinitely better although connected to an old Kenwood receiver and sub."
This AV receiver has given me nothing but issues. Why does it have to be so complicated to set up?Wish i had gone to a brick and mortar store for my purchase.Not recommended!
Mounting kit that said bought with don’t work with it had to go buy longer machine screws vary disappointed waste of time
"Super misleading. These are advertised as wireless speakers but they’re not. You need to purchase wires (not included) and maybe some other devices. Also the setup instructions are nill. No step by step setup. If you’re experienced, maybe you’re ok with this and know how to set it up. But not for novices . The speakers do look cool, which is why I gave it 2 stars, not 1"
"This is listed as wireless but upon reciept it states that only the subwoofer is wireless (it just has a wireless adapter even not built in) They need an additional ampliflier for each channel as well!!! All the other speakers need to be hard wired, and then to top it off- after requesting a return they only sent label with me having to pay shipping- Just wrong!!!"
"I have tried to lower the sub volume, its either to lower for any sound to come through the sub or it is just a loud pop and hum. Changing the gain did nothing either. I don't have the know how to fix the sub woofer, so I am going to return the speakers. Am I just going to get another broken sub woofer?"
"The subwoofer has not worked since I took it out of the box.  Been waiting a month to get a response out of Klipsch.  The other speakers provide great sound, but it just isnt right without the bass"
I want to be fair but I was a little disappointed.  This was supposed to be an upgrade on a really cheap kit I had.  Its a little better but not the best.  The center speaker sounded a little odd.  I've since upgraded to a higher end center speaker from the dame brand and its much better.
"Bought these before Christmas and just had a chance to install. They sound just okay. Was hoping to get better sound out of these. Looks like I’ll need to update the budget to $1,000-1,500 to get what I’m looking for. But.... More disappointing is Amazon’s 30 day policy on the return. I just installed these and was disappointed in the product. Why I can’t return these for credit to spend more is frustrating. I’m willing to spend 2-3x more money, but instead I’m stuck with spending less and being unhappy with the product. Going back to brick and mortar for products like this from now on."
"So far, only the receiver came in. Hoping the speakers, etc will be here soon. Will update when they arrive"
"Compact size speakers, easily placeable, easy to hook up. Fair deal. Myself, I think I'd go with some larger FR, and FL speakers. High frequencies were reproduced well, and the bass (with separate volume control) work fine. Just couldn't produce the mid-range (5 to 8K) enough for me.  All in all, though, pretty good deal for the money."
"Bought these to wirelessly connect to new AV receiver, the only speaker that is bluetooth is the subwoofer. The rest (including surround speakers) have to be hard wired. Shipping was very slow, took twice as long to arrive as estimated. Sound is average but not anything special. Overall, very disappointed."
As soon as I picked the box up off the porch there was something heavy rattling it the box brought it in started un boxing and it was the sub woofer (maybe magnet fell off) I don't know and didn't care to find out. I boxed it right back up and returned it..... 3 weeks later still waiting on a refund call Amazon and they said this is normal??? Do not recommend 0 out of 10.... but I did end up upgrading to the Dolby Atmos version and glad I did that one works perfectly and sounds great
Do not buy from this seller.
"These speakers do not sound very good at all. Very weak. I would say these might be great speakers for a computer but don't cut it for movies and other media. Also, to my surprise I learned they cannot be returned. Take serious caution purchasing these. I will be very cautious making Amazon purchases in the future with poor return policies like this device."
Sadly had a problem with one of my speakers little over a year after buying and I’ve been trying to get help on the problem or replacement for over 3 months. I’ve emailed countless times. And the number they have never works always gives business hours to call back no matter the time or day. Why I gave the product one star. No matter how good a product is if there is no way to get support to fix a problem.
My husband said the subwoofer didn’t have a great sound. Other than that they were great.
"Item arrived defective. Lows and mids work, but the highs are not working. This is a non-returnable item and I'm stuck in limbo right now. I purposely purchased through Woot because other buyers ran into issues with returns. Woot's return policy is as follows, ""This item is non-returnable, but if the item arrives damaged or defective, you may request a refund or replacement.""I contacted Amazon who sent me to Woot's ask a question through the seller page.Still waiting on a response."
This was a hard one to rate. On the one hand the speakers are fantastic but on the other the  subwoofer is weaker than anything Ive ever heard. I wish they would have used a different company for the subwoofer/ amplifier combo.
The system is amazing but came without the wireless adapter for the sub. I reached out to the company that sold me the unit only to be ignored. If you want to buy this amazing system. DO NOT BUY IT ON HERE. Had a Tec  look at the Klipsch sub. Well it’s a Onkyo sub in a klipsch sub box. Sending everything to klipsch on Monday and dealing with Base tech
"They provide a free shipping label but you pay for the return. Which would’ve cost me close to the price of the item itself. No response from manufacturer when I questioned this, either. Not worth it, stuck with this now and can’t use it."
"Tried everything even auto set up, bass sounds like rumbling garble of trains  on the track or the rumble of an earth quake. Paired it with a Denon AVR-S540BT."
The system is good for small room perhaps student dorm.
no way to hook up subwoofer
The Logitech Z625 sounds a lot better.
"Voice coil was fried in the subwoofer. Klipsch Refused to replace the subwoofer due to lack of inventory, although the same item is available for sell. Sent me a partial refund of $77 for the subwoofer which did not cover half of the repair cost. Klipsch makes great speakers, but that quality stops with customer service."
"When I bought these speakers, I expected to be able to hook them up and be good. They do not work at all. Looking at the set-up instructions, it looks like they are not completely Bluetooth and I now need to buy a receiver as well."
"This system is not wireless, like the product advertises.  Only the subwoofer is wireless, not the speakers.  The speakers still require wires from a receiver, so this system is simply not wireless as advertised."
requires Amp to work. Says complete surround but not true so had to send back cause was not going to spend hundreds more on an amplifier
Be careful when buying.  Seller has some options chosen where it won’t allow you to return.  3 of my speakers are not working properly and finding it a big hassle trying to return a broken product.  Do not take the risk PLEASE!!!!
Just as others have said my Subwoofer stopped working and Klipsch will not do anything about it as they are not authorized resellers. DO NOT BUY. GET AT COSTCO WHERE YOU GET ACTUAL SUPPORT.
"I was looking for a completely wireless system, but couldn't return the package even though it was unopened.  So, I just have an extra system that I overpaid for that I have no use for."
Subwoofer was defective in this new package. In addition to this as soon as we connected the subwoofer to receiver it messed up the our Onkyo receiver and pushed it to Amp Diag mode. Had to spend hours to make the receiver work again.
**DO NOT BUY**  The seller is not an authorized seller of Klipsch product.  My sub went bad and I contacted Klipsch. They informed me that because this seller is not an authorized seller of Klipsch product the warranty is void.
This item is not wireless as described.  Sellers refuse to pay return shipping which is $75-$100.00
"This product is probably amazing, but I cannot use it due to improper advertising...even if I could use it, the product tells you at setup that it needs extra parts."
"Literally only speakers came in the box, everything else is up to you to get. No Power cables, no audio cables, no manual, nothing."
"Subwoofer didn’t last, quit working. I thought maybe the wireless box was out, so I wired directly, nope subwoofer dead. The warranty period was over, didn’t last 10 months."
This worked fine for about 2 weeks.  The Subwoofer quit working after 2 weeks!
bought this and did really fit in area. So I decided to return. oh but wait I cant its not Returnable.
It's not worth the money now Ling enough so I can't return 2 of the speakers went out. Very disappointef
"Boughtbin error, thought it was wireless total BS"
"Its not a plug n play, you will need a receiver"
Unclear descriptions and can’t even verify the product is functional
everything 0% F------
"After tons of troubleshooting, the sub is definitely broken."
"Very misleading product, not beginner friendly at all and only good for audio snobs. Makes you think you can just buy speakers and it would connect wirelessly but no, you’ll have to have wires all over your place to get true surround sound environment and that sound isn’t worth sacrificing making your living room look like a tech supply room"
Disappointed not to sound I was looking for
"Just received the RSB-11 soundbar combo that Klipsch sent me as a replacement.I would like to say that Klipsch customer service is dung and Klipsch product is dung.I purchased a Klipsch R-20B soundbar combo, new, from an Amazon store, just like most of the world is doing right now.Compared to Costco, Walmart and Home Depot, where product returns and warranties drive customer satisfaction, Klipsch has no interest in being a company that supports customers.I initially reached out to Klipsch to ask if they had other products that I could link to the R-20B soundbar. Klipsch never responded. In comparison, I can purchase a 2-dollar pack of seeds from an on-line seed store and have them email me information of why the seeds are not growing. But Klipsch casts a sense of disdain in answering questions regarding their products.One year after purchasing the R-20B soundbar combo, I wanted help figuring out why I was experiencing a “ground feedback loop” issue. I am no engineer, but following diagnostic procedures found online, I guessed that I had a ground feedback loop.As soon as I contacted Klipsch for help resolving the problem, I was met with disdain. Not only did it take several email attempts to get a response from Klipsch, but when a response was finally sent, several weeks later, I was told that Klipsch will not honor warranties, on products sold by “an unauthorized dealer”. How the heck am I supposed to know who Klipsch chooses to sell their garbage to? Do I work for the company? Besides, no matter who sells Klipsch’s garbage, isn’t it a fact that Klipsch is still profiting from the sale? Doesn’t Klipsch produce the product?The other issue that the R-20B had, was that it switched between input signals on its own. Even after being manualy set back, it would switch continuously between Bluetooth and optical inputs.When I contacted Klipsch, I was looking for a manufacturer to stand by their product and provide competent, knowledgeable support. Instead I received a cop-out, telling me that the self-proclaimed “keepers of the sound” will not warranty their product. And only after stating that I would never mention Klipsch in a positive light, that I received a reluctant email from Klipsch telling me that they are willing to send me a new soundbar, after I ship back the R-20B soundbar combo that I was having problems with.I spent almost 200 dollars sending the heavy wood and iron R-20B soundbar combo back to the Klipsch facility.Having me ship the soundbar combo back to them, Klipsch implicitly recalled it.This leads me to conclude that the R-20B soundbars had inherent design or build problems that Klipsch did not want to attempt repairing. Otherwise, I do not understand why an appliance manufacturer would have me spend almost 200 dollars, shipping the product back. Instead of sending a repair person to look at the problem, or diagnose it over the phone. I could have brought it to one of their retail outlets or certified repair shops, like all other appliance manufacturers do. Just like Samsung did with a 42-inch TV I purchased.With the original price of the system and the shipping, I am out 600 dollars. When I contacted Klipsch about a refund for shipping, they refused.For 600 dollars, I could have done better. I am willing to bet, that if not for the staged acoustic auditoriums, where you can compare the Klipsch, side by side with other brands, when the Klipsch is in the house, people would not be able to differentiate between a Klipsch soundbar and a different brand at same price.The replacement RSB-11 soundbar combo it is also dung. When connected to my turntable through the RSB-11 auxiliary, 3.5mm input, marked Analog, the RSB-11 plays for about 10 minutes, and then turns itself off.After setting up the soundbar according to the online Klipsch, RSB-11, owner’s manual instructions and using the HDMI-ARC configurations provided, the soundbar turns itself off taking the TV with it. It does this about every 20 minutes when no sound is being pumped through the soundbar. After being manually turned back on, the RSB-11 soundbar reverts to a very low volume setting, not the level previously set. As I am writing this, using my tower computer and my TV/Monitor, the Klipsch soundbar is turning the TV and itself off every 20 minutes. This is not an issue with those cheaper soundbars.When using the Bluetooth connection, volume commands from the linked device are ignored by the soundbar. The soundbar will stream the music and link-up, but will not change volume when prompted by the linked device.A company with poor customer service, no sense of ownership of product, disregard toward customers’ unwarranted, outrageous expenditures and disregard towards honoring warranty, along with dung product hiding behind a historically established brand-name, is not a company on which I would like to waste my time and money."
"I bought a very nice Klipsch 2.1 set of computer speakers. The speakers began buzzing after 25 months. The sound is terrific but they didn't last. The day I bought them, they went on my book shelf and were never used above background noise level. Customer service told me the problem is with the sub woofer. It was out of warranty and the sub woofer wasn't worth repairing. They got that right. Bose next time."
"We just moved in to our new house and I’m finally getting my home theater set up.  These are NOT wireless speakers!  Each speaker needs to be wired to a separately-purchased amplifier.  There is no power input on the speakers to set them on the side of the room without running wires along the floor or ceiling.  In my open room, I can’t use these without laying a throw rug across the floor alongside the sofa.I have no idea of the sound quality because they’re not usable."
I really wanted these speakers. Because I know they are a better product than Logitech's similar $300 offering. But why is the only way to connect through an audio receiver? Not everyone purchasing these is some fancy person with a home theatre. Personally yes I could afford an audio receiver. But I only have the space in my room for the speakers and subwoofer. Some people just want to use these to listen to music. Would it really kill you to include an aux cable input? I believe that is a 3.5mm Jack. What a shame because I was all set on buying these speakers but I feel like that's pretty ignorant to exclude people who don't have an audio receiver for whatever reason. It surely couldn't raise the price that much to include a simple aux port
Was gonna return item I got for Christmas and it's $200 to return then 50% restock fee I was gonna go with the 7.1 but nevermind it ain't even worth to return it to get 75 bucks back now it'll collect dust
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Received the package and the subwoofer is completely busted. Whatever is inside the subwoofer case is completely loose. There honestly might just be a brick inside the subwoofer that was added...
One speaker doesn't work.  I'm trying to go through the process of replacing it.  Not much luck so far with automated responses.  Good value for the cost.  Minimal footprint.
The bass speaker didn’t work everything else did
"I've always been told to build your sound system around a good set of speakers. I had a 2 ch stereo mini unit using 2 Oontz Angle 3 ULTRA speakers and they sounded good when I got these speakers hooked up you could really hear the those 'small things' that makes music more enjoyable, like the hi-hats, the thump of a bass drum, etc etc. Then I bit the bullet and got a true 5.2 ch unit and it's like 'you are there'. Being in a one bedroom unit (think big man cave) and these jewels put out more sound than I'll ever need. On sale they are a bargain and yes I recommend Klipsch.***UPDATE***  3/20/2023 The sub woofer worked for about two weeks then emitted a loud pop and stopped working. Speaking with Klipsch to line up an RMA I was told this unit is out of stock and no longer supported (the paper work that came with the unit shows 2012) and in order to have it repaired I need to go to a 3rd party repair shop, in this case GlobalBatterySolutions, called them and found that any repair will be out of my pocket and not covered under warranty thru Klipsch. Thats a fine how do you do for a new unit. So I am going to have to edit my review and say I can not recommend something that is new (to me and sold as new) that does not come with any warranty.To be fair though Adorama did offer a refund upon return of the product. I have decided to repair the unit and not go thru all that hassle. Luckily I found another amp on eBay."
"I was really excited to upgrade from my Sony's but this was a downgrade and twice the cost sadly.The rear surround are too bright and hurt the ears even after using the ypao mic on the receiver.I have to max the volume out on a Yamaha receiver to be able to watch a movie at an adequate volume, I wish I could push them harder."
Did not came with the necessary wireless. What I am going to do with the system that I can’t even connect and get to work. Don’t buy it . Unless you want to go through the hassle.
"Set up was easy and the speakers sound great. The receiver didnt come with an owners manual, and i couldnt find it on manufacturers website. Had to google it. Bluetooth keeps cutting out and eventually cuts off completely. Also cant get the setup screen to go away"
Speakers sound great when watching DirecTV but receiver doesn’t work when I switch to streaming services.
"Received this surround set this week and my husband began setting up the system once we received some ceiling mounts for the 4 small speakers. We were very excited to get a great surround sound system finally since our house we built 4 years ago was pre wired. Unfortunately the subwoofer is blown right out of the box. It appears to be used/open box item. I noticed before unpacking the box that the styrofoam seemed loose as if it had been unpacked before, and my husband noticed a scratch on the bottom of the sub. Sure enough it doesn’t work properly, sounds completely blown. Contacting seller for replacement sub, I’ll update my review once I get resolution. Seems like a great system so far if we can get the sub replaced."
"I was disappointed that this sterio did not have E-ARC.  Hooking it up to my TV was not very seamless.  The speakers are to tinty with poor lows.  The sub woofers are to rumbly and don't sound good at all.  I have a similar receiver in another room with old school, big speakers that sound a lot better.  I'm ordering some bigger speakers.  Hopefully it will improve it."
I got this. Right out of the box I got an NR L error. Then it would shut down. I went on the website and they said it was a bad board. That I had to return it.The company that sells this there's only one company. And they are really bad. Amazon does not want you to know this. They do not want me to post anything bad about this seller. Stay away from them. They are horrible.I doubt that this will post. As Amazon does not want you to know that this seller is bad. And they're the only seller that sells this. Stay away.
It only plays sound on tuner and bluetooth nothing else works I want it replaced asap
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            What a disappointment, I opened it up today and it is not working at all, seen some video of the same model with similar problems, wish had seen them before I ordered it."
"Wife got me a Samsung sound bar from Wallmart for christmas, (samsung hws50b)  It was nice with crisp sound and a nice punch with action and gun fire.  First time trying a sound bar with synthetic surround sound and it was ""ok""  The sammy was great but would cut out often and the blue tooth connection was trash.  So we returned it and I started researching and settled on this Sony System to go with my Sony TV thinking it will have better compatibility with rear speakers and a subwoofer,  Sadly the Sammy sound bar had better sound.  I haven't tried blue tooth on this one yet and connected via ARC.  For some reason I have to crank up the volume level to almost 80-90% of its range to get any decent surround sound effects and still be able to make out the voice.  The bass on the Sammy had more punch than this one.  While the rear surround is better it seems soft and weak. Not the performance  I was expecting from a 600W rear speaker set up with subwoofer.  I'm not impressed and debating to return this one.2/27/2024:  Product is garbage do not buy.  I am passed the return date . Now we can't hear voices or any speaking via blue ray DVD player, amazon,  DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!"
Random popping sound through speakers. Dealing with sony customer service was a pain. Hold power button and up button for ten seconds to reset to default for everyone’s knowledge. Still does it but not as bad. Sad because it is such a lovely speaker system.
"The soundbar is just a set of center front sounding speakers.  The remote speakers were a very low volume. The subwoofer did not deliver a solid base response ( I adjusted to the maximum volume) and it was integrated with a front speaker.  In order to hear anything resembling a movie theater, the volume had to be set very  loud.  The connection concept for this soundbar was very interesting..  I have set up a lot of soundbars that delivered a much better overall sound experience even though this one was rated very high.  The voices were precise through the center speakers, but the spatial effects through the remote speakers was very poor. I did an A to B comparison with another soundbar and this one failed miserably.  I have another soundbar from Sony and I was very satisfied.  I would never buy this particular model again.  I gave it away the very next day after I received it."
"The back speakers will only connect to the front if there is 0 interference between them. I mean, if you walk with your cell phone between them, they will lose their connection. The front works nicely."
Have to turn up volume to high 70’s to even hear what is being said on tv.
Overall quality is acceptable but Tweeter speakers Crack randomly around every ten minutes. I have to return this.
"Update: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. And if you bought it and are frustrated that it doesn't work, DO NOT send it in for repair, just return it ASAP.We purchased this product and had nothing but problems with it. When we requested to send it in for repair, Sony said they would provide a box, then after multiple emails and calls we were told they would not provide a box, and we needed to pack it ourselves. We then paid $30 to have FedEx to pack it, and shipped it off. It was received and United Radio proceeded to send several emails keeping us updated on the status, letting us know they couldn't replicate the issue. Then out of nowhere, they decided the item was damaged during shipping. At this point, after multiple calls and emails to both Sony and United Radio, they will not provide us proof of the state of the package on arrival and are stating that there is nothing else they will do. Now we have a product that doesn't work AND that was clearly damaged while in the ""care"" of United Radio. I'm so disappointed in the utter lack of respect and care from Sony. I'll never buy another Sony product again now that I know they simply don't stand behind their products or their customers.---Be aware, the rear surround amp/BT receiver does not work very well.I have mine in line of sight with the subwoofer 8’ away on the floor. I am plagued with random connection issues, sharp audible digital chirps.The main front speaker & sub sound good for the price but the surround is virtually useless. I’m going to contact Sony to see if my surround unit is faulty. It’s possible mine exhibits abnormal behavior but if you buy and experience the same results, feel confident in a return."
The Bluetooth speakers get random pops from them
I wasn't expecting a lot when I purchased this but I was expecting a little better sound. First it doesn't sound like true surround sound its more like a stereo experience. The soundbar doesn't do a good enough job of separating the right and left front speakers. The rear speakers serve more as an extension of the front speakers and offer little in terms of surround sound even after playing with the settings. The bass from the subwoofer has to be the biggest disappointment as it fails to provide any sort of knock. I have a small Polk Audio soundbar with subwoofer that fills a room better than this for half the price. I would not recommend this for $300.
"This system checked all the boxes for me. It was just as I had hoped when I received it. After configuring my whole living room to the sound system, I had it all working, and it sounded pretty good. In the morning, the remote stopped communicating to the subwoofer. I contacted Amazon and they eventually gave a partial refund to try to order a new remote since they didn’t have one. Sony finally sent me one from back order after a month. This did not fix the issue as the receiver in the subwoofer must have failed. No way to update without a working remote so no way to test that. Amazon would not send out another one as they said they had no new ones left. All I could do was get a refund and send it back through ups. After all of this I am committed to this system even with how the last one played out. Finally after a couple days it is back in stock at $30 more than I originally paid. Having no option I had to order this one and am waiting on it to ship. Overall I liked what I heard from the day it was working good, but almost 2 months later with $30 less and waiting on a new system leaves me wondering if I’ll be going through the same issue again."
"Have purchased many Sony items in my life and normally very pleased. But not with this speaker system. Was very easy to set up. BUT when I started to listen, I questioned whether I set it up correctly because sound was so underwhelming. Subwoofer was barely putting out any sound. Switched from HDMI ARC to an optical cable and that didnt help. I then realized there were plenty of settings to play with as far as adjusting volume of speakers and distance. Took several hours of playing with settings to start to get some decent sound from system but still not happy with overall sounds. There is hardly any difference in switching from the different sound modes. Rear speakers don't actually give a surround experience as it is more of an extension of the sound bar sounds. Overall not very pleased with this Sony product but stuck with it because I had to wait a while before I had a chance to set it up."
I hooked this up and used the Bluetooth feature but the sound quality isn’t as good as my other surround sound systems. I made adjustments to the settings but it just doesn’t have great sound clarity no matter what I do.
"The transmitter is merely 10' away but the rear channels often emit extremely high pitched pops or short bursts of noise.  Being older with some hearing loss means I don't hear it as much as my kids or dogs but it's extremely unpleasant for all.  Some days it rarely acts up, other days it does it so much that we unplug the rear channels.  Spend your money elsewhere."
"Would not recommend, the sound was better from the $129 Visio that it replaced. Seriously disappointing for a Sony product. Sound is very muffled and washed out. At maz volume it is nothing at all special. 90% of the time the rear channel surround speakers don't make any sound at all, and yes....I am putting Dolby surround into the system and know how to set it up properly. The menu system for changing the settings is impossible to use without looking at the manual due to the whopping 4 character display. Good luck finding out what SUSN or DSMP mean without dragging out the manual to look. Only gets two stars from me as it does actually make sound....all be it crappy sound."
Sub woofer and sound bar works great the tweeter Crack all the time.
I bought mine in November and it has now since stop connecting to my streaming box. It is a good system and it plays loudly.
"I'm a musician and anyone who says this system sounds ""amazing"" needs to get their ears checked. The bass is okay but the mids sound clunky and there's a shocking lack of high end. You'd think with speakers that small the one thing you'd have plenty of is treble, but it sounds dull and I have a hard time hearing what people are saying even with voice enhancer on.  Very disappointed. I realize it's only $300 but I expected better from Sony. Best thing about the system is the full bass and the (sorta) wireless rear speakers. But if it's quality you're after, I would not recommend this system."
"Bought a  new 85 inch sony tv and moved my entire existing 65 inch tv with sony blu ray home theater system to the bedroom.  I ended up buying this sound bar surround system so everything was new.  My old system is way louder and had never given me any issues with sound quality.  The blu ray player has started to act up but in its defense,  it's about 10 years old.  But as a said the sound was always amazing.  This new system had started showing signs of poor performance within about 5 weeks.  Conveniently just after my return window closed.  My next step is to reach out to sony and check the manufacturers warranty."
"Disclaimer: I dislike having to write bad reviews. I believe that this is my 4th bad review, for any product, in 15 years.I have had this product for about 14 days and there are two major issues that I have.1) For 14 days I wake up to my Samsung SmartTV being turned on by itself. After turning the tv off every morning, for 14 days I come home in the evening and the tv has turned on, again, by itself. Nothing else is plugged directly into the tv and this has only occurred since purchasing the Sony.2) Sound quality: the bass was excellent when I initially plugged it in but, the high-end frequencies are awful and almost non-existent.I bought an affordable-priced product, I got what I paid for. Lesson learned."
I've always liked Sony but these speakers are the worst. My TV speakers sounds better than these. Be aware and get ready to send them back.
"I bought this set after I found out my new Sony tv would not acknowledge any sound system that was not Sony made.The blu tooth speakers 'pop' and you cannot adjust the volume like you can other speakers with bass, treble etc.They are just speakers for more sound by your head, slightly better than the tv speakers."
Very easy to set up but sound quality is poor considering the brand. Has no real surround sound to it. I will be returning it
Thee sound doesn’t kick in until my tv volume hits 70 out of 100The left and right speakers are very low I can only hear the right one .. it’s basically all subwoofer.. I should have just got the 2.1 ..my friends Samsung 2.1 bar and subwoofer sounds better and he paid half of this ..
i got this thing in and hooked it up--it doesnt have much sound coming out of it until i get it turned up 800 out of 100--dont know why this is with a system thats total 600 watt system--i had a vizio 300 watt system that actually sounded better than this one
AREADY LOOSES VOLUME AND CRACKLES NOT EVEN 6 MONTHS OLD !!!!  NO FRONT AND REAR SPEAKER ADJUSTMENT !!!  LOOK ELSEWHERE .............
"This buy was a huge letdown. Between the  lack of connectivity options (there is no HDMI-passthrough) and awful menu system, this sound system was not worth what I paid.More than the aforementioned problems, the sound is hollow. The sun fills in the low end, but there is no clarity or brightness to the sound. Movie dialog is muddy, even with the supposed presets (that don’t really change the sound at all.)That’s all something I could deal with, were there an EQ menu that would allow me to attenuate the mid tones and increase high-end. But there is absolutely no option for custom equalization.Unfortunately I’m not able to return, but to others I’d recommend avoiding this product - especially if you need dialog clarity in your movies."
"Music sounds great on this system.  But, when watching TV, the dialogue is far too low. No matter how I adjusted the settings I could not hear the dialogue as it seemed to always be in the background. I sent the system back for a refund."
The rear speakers aren't wireless.  There's a receiver attached and the speakers are wired to it.The sub is right out front so it can be Wired to the sound bar. Then the HDMI has to go to the sub!Terrible design if you like your living room without wires.  I'll be sending it back.
"Just set this system up. The sound quality is good, but the connection for the optical digital cable (new and high quality) does not connect easily (to the main box,) and sound cuts in and out. Very poor connection, poorly made. Have been jiggling it around for 20 min, and it will cut out whenever. Bought a good cable to avoid this, and both our old cable and the new cable work great with our old $40 sound bar."
Very easy to set up this system - and awesome if you like constant echo from all of your audio sources... making everything from low-fi You Tube videos to 4K HD movies sound like they are playing 100 feet away in an auditorium.Garbage. Do not buy.
Great sound for the price but way too many wires in todays technology… returned it..  if you don’t mind wires this could be a good choice for you
I bought this on feb 1 2024 Nov 14 2024 the subwoofer stopped working and the wireless speakers are staticy
Easy to set up but the sound is muddy and creates feedback playing older titles that require the volume to be increased. Do not recommend.
"This is a Sony product, the sound quality is great for the price point. The problem is the design. The sound bar does not have threaded holes, so it can't be mounted to a TV under-mount. The wiring is also messy unless your TV sits on a console table and you plan to have the subwoofer nearby. The sound bar has to plug into the subwoofer (cord #1), and the subwoofer has to run back to the TV (cord #2). This is not ideal if your TV is mounted or you are attempting a cordless look. The subwoofer connects wirelessly to a box, which is wired to both rear speakers (cords #3 and #4)."
Please do not buy this item!! I had to send it back to “Sony” and they couldn't fix it. Subwoofer did not work.They sent me a new one and the subwoofer still sucks even when it is as loud as it can go.No MOVIE or BASS sounds at all.. Im gonna just chalk it up as a loss of $300 and buy me something else.PLEASE DON’T MAKE A MISTAKE AND BUY THIS BECAUSE ITS A  name brand “SONY”. They also make you pay for packing materials to return it. I’m still waiting for them to refund my MONEY….IT DON’T EVEN RATE ON TOP 10 SOUND BAR WITH WOOFER FOR 2024..
"After about a month of using, one of my rear speakers started getting a random popping sound.  I sent in for repair via Sony's site - some 3rd party in New York.  By the way, packing this up again was a pain - they required I send in the entire unit and not just the rear speakers.  Woofer was damaged in shipping.  I just hooked back up and still have popping even though they said it was repaired."
"Worked great for a couple of months. Chirping started in the 2 small speakers then they stopped working. Barely get any sound out of the soundbar. Sony asked to ship the whole unit to them, the shipping alone was almost as much as a new unit. There never was a menu option on the television for the controls."
"System very difficult to pair and it unpairs on its own, when pair the sound quality is horrible, the Sony TV speakers sound better than the system, I am a Sony product person for over 4o years now i am very disappointed with this product."
I wanted to love this thing the subwoofer is amazing and the wireless amp is awesome but the speakers make a terrible chirping sound its aweful.
Can barely hear rear speakers
The sub speakers have a lot of crackling sound.
"The rear speakers provide very low sound, even when adjusting them to highest db in settings."
"One would figure that all of the speakers are wireless, but one would be wrong. The rear two speakers are attached to a receiver with wire, so you cannot place them more than about 10 feet apart from eachother. The rear speakers have a super loud popping and squeaking sound if no audio is playing. I pause a video for more than a few seconds and the ear piercingly loud squeaks start up. Resume playing anything, and the squeaking/popping stops. Now I am unable to use the rear speakers and I didn't have time to go through the hassle of returning in a timely manner, so I guess I am just stuck with this waste of money. Broken out of the box."
This is NOT a wireless speaker system as described. Very misleading and disappointing.
"I'm not a incompetent person, I know my way around electronics. This surround sound system is pretty bad.1. The speakers cherp randomly and it's very loud2. The volume response adjustment is terrible it takes 3-5 seconds for the volume to change.Please do not buy this it's an awful product and should have never passed QC."
Man I really wanted to like this so much but it was so bad My TV volume was louder than the sound bar The base was virtually non-existent The surround speakers would pop and crack and I really can't believe it's Sony very unimpressed I cannot recommend in fact I returned mine and got my money back Hope this helps!
"The soundbar is muffled and not clear quality no matter what setting you chose that they provided, you also can't adjust treble level or any other settings besides the ones that they provide and they all sound the same, the surround sound is non existent unless you put your ear right next to it. Keep looking"
"Just get a sound bar, the wireless amplifier to use the speakers in the back doesn’t stay connected.  If someone walks past it it will discount.  It is not like a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connection and requires direct line of sight to Sub.  Also the range is suspect as it doesn’t work mounted on my wall."
not happy with the sound at all. Unfortunatelly the 30 days have past and I can't return it anymore.
I have a 7-8 year old song sound bar and speaker that is great. I figured with the extra speakers this would be even better. WRONG! I turned it and the subwoofer up as loud as it would go and that wasn’t near as loud as my old one and the bass sucked. The quality of the sound was also much worse. Sonys product quality has significantly decreased.
"Constant cutouts, wierd static and strange double voices.There are better sound bars for this price, i have 2 different vizio sound bars that im happy with.Im no audiophile and im not picky, but i returned this soundbar within a couple days and replaced it with another vizio."
This system sounds more like 200 watts. My room is not very big and when I hooked it up. I needed to use the volume to the max to even hear the bass. The rear speakers you need to hold them to your ears to even hear them. Very disappointing for Sony. My last home theater was a Sony and loved it it was 10 years old. So decided to get a new one. I will be giving this to my kid. To much to return. Don’t buy!!
"Sound was terrible, the rear speakers popped continuously, it was bad.  It was so bad it took away from anything you watched."
The sound quality is not bad but the volume could max out a bit louder and it's extremely annoying that the controls are set on the subwoofer I have to point the remote right at it for it to register any commands. Very poor design if you ask me.
"like i’ve seen others mention, my back speakers also make popping and high pitch chirping sounds. based on others saying repair didn’t help, im reluctant to even do so, and it’s few and far between but just enough to be really annoying… probably will just go with another brand. not worth."
"First off there is no equalizer option and is not too user friendly. You get what you get. The sound difference was barley noticeable between my TV and the speaker system. It has been hooked up for 72 hours and the speakers are chirping, popping, & cracking. I’ve done all the troubleshooting tips and I am still noticing the sound issues."
"Absolutely terrible quality, very staticky my $60 sound bar is louder and has better quality! I contacted amazing about the matter and got a 30 dollars refund!!!!! For the inconvenience yes 30 dollars! For something that cost over 300 dollars! Aside from the terrible customer service, the overall performance is just rancid, it’s not even real surround sound!"
"I thought I could always count on Sony for a great sounding product. Not this time. The sound bar looking thing which contains 3 little wimpy speakers is tinny, has no range and makes my old transistor radio sound as good as a boom box. The subwoofer adds no bass.600W? I think not.Don't buy this hunk of junk."
"This worked great for about 4 months. Now the rear speakers fade in/out, they make a really loud squeaking and popping noise. Had to disconnect them and just use the sound bar. So pretty much I spent $300 on a poor sound bar. Very disappointing!!!!"
One of the back speakers started tweaking after a month. Horrible sound. You have to turn it above 60 for dialogue and down when anything action packed comes up. I trust Sony but this item is very poor in quality for the prices.
"These speakers sound good, but the rear wireless speakers constantly cut out and pop.I would not buy these again."
After using this for a few days the tweeter popped. I read on another review that this happened to someone else. Sounds good but if the small speakers are junk I wouldn't recommend
not any better than old system being replaced.
The music was fine the voices on TV was distorted and didn't sound very well had to turn it up really loud to hear the talking then the music blew out of the room Very poor quality don't purchase
Cracking sound in rear wireless speakers
"I was happy with this product for about 10 months, but now all it does is make a loud, high-pitched noise"
"I don't like much, I am disappointed"
The sound quality is terrible it sounds like they’re talking in a coffee can with an echo
"I am extremely frustrated and disappointed with my Sony soundbar and woofer system. For about two years, it worked flawlessly, delivering excellent sound quality and enhancing my home entertainment experience. However, out of nowhere, the system just stopped working and hasn't turned on since.I have tried everything to troubleshoot the issue, from checking all the connections to rebooting the system multiple times, but nothing has worked. It's incredibly disheartening to see a product from a reputable brand like Sony fail so suddenly after working so well for so long.I expected more durability and reliability from a Sony product, especially considering the investment I made. Unfortunately, my soundbar and woofer system are now just expensive paperweights. I hope Sony can address this issue and offer a solution for customers experiencing similar problems."
Can hardly hear rear speakers  Too late to return  NUTZ!
"The speakers on my TV are louder than this setup. Easy to setup, and thought maybe I needed to adjust the settings. Once I reached max volume and could barely hear what people were saying, I knew this had to be returned asap. Honestly the audio on my phone is louder than this thing."
It's bad. The mids are ALL THE WAY UP. Kinda sounds like it's inside a tunnel.
"Didn’t have the sound quality I expected, not user friendly in this day and age!  Back speakers kept quitting for no logical reason and would not repair when I ran through the instructions!  Bass was weak!  The remote menu is a joke to work with!  Took it back to the store for refund!  Third system I tried all were over priced junk!  Very dissapointed!"
"I expected power output being rated at 300 watt .  Unit gives off 10 watt if lucky .  Ok sound quality just no power to volume, like last output power amplifier not putting out.  Running max volume and sounds like medium volume tv.  Very disappointed."
"SW is not powerful at all, the only decent piece of the system is the soundbar…. Configuration is also a pain…. Not an app to configure the system remotely…. Very dissatisfied from this “promising” Sony product."
Bad product do not buy from this seller
"The overall experience is good but the hiccup is the rear surround speakers which are really good when you cannot or don’t want to wire them across the room but feels weird when they make crackle sound sometimes while intense movie scene is going on. You can clearly understand that crackle noise is the Bluetooth noise due to connection, I have made sure the installation guide is followed properly and the installation team was also agreeing that the location is correct for the receiver. Still the noise is there.I guess I am stuck with this system, hope firmware updates fix this"
After pay 20 k up to price 😡No sony app support 👎Good bass with deep 👍Excellent 5.1 surround sounds 🤝Room completely fill with sound 🫶But treble is seriously missing 😭Not in Equaliser when set up to clarity😳😭Actually i want to exchange another like samsung and jbl sounds system
Sound quality is normal like as usual regular / normal brands - went for sony to experience difference but unfortunately experience is like a regular woofer and system
"As they displayed in images and descriptions, this model is not true wireless. Instead of connecting from subwoofer, there is an amplifier to connect with wired speaker which again is a wired one. Could have explained it better in description by the product company or atleast by seller."
"Connected by cable, rear speakers don’t work. Service requests logged by Sony don’t get honored and I continue to face issues in getting answers or service !"
Installation प्रोसेसिंग is very bad
Sound quality okay but rear speakers not performing upto standard. Installation team still not contact me for installation. Very worst service.
"I bought S40R home theatre from Amazon on 15-Jul.1. Product delivery was promised next day but I chose 17-Jul so that I could stay at home and accept the delivery. I stayed home whole day, Amazon kept saying it'll deliver by 9 PM. At 9 PM when I tried reaching Amazon mentioned there is unexplainable delay and it'll be delivered next day. This is 3rd time this has happened with a large appliance. We cannot stay at home forever and Amazon chooses to deliver whenever it wants esp when delivery date was chosen. Anyways after multiple followups and escalation product was delivered on 18-Jul.Ever since then I have faced several issues with this product.2. Installation was delayed and no one called me withing SLA. Upon escalating service centre came for installation but couldn't do it as connection needed a electrician to setup new power connection for rear speakers. No issues I called my electrician but installation visit doesn't happen again.2. I got it installed myself using my own electrician on 2-Aug.3. Withing 2 days, one of the speakers started giving cracking sound. I complained immediate on 3-Aug or 4-Aug. Service centre person visited on 5-Aug and asked me to replace the product with Amazon.However I couldn't get it replaced from Amazon seller due to delay in installation. I tried to explain this problem to amazon in couple of calls but both calls got disconnected.The Service center person then created a job sheet mentioning that the speaker will be repaired.4. Despite one week passed no one called me or informed me of the status. When I tried following up on 12-Aug I am informed that some parts are unavailable and there will be further delay. No date was provided and company helpline kept asking me to call service centre or visit them.5. Meanwhile, one more speaker(this time from the soundbar) has started giving cracking sound from 8-Aug (ie 9th day after installation) Customer care took complain but still kept saying part is unavailable without even understanding that it is new speaker.I am failing to understand what sort of quality check does Sony have.It is supposed to be premium quality international brand. But such poor quality is not expected.6. I am still asked by customer care to wait and keep following up with service centre.If 2 out of 5 speakers can default in just few days and I'm unable to use this product for a month now for multiple issues, I don't know if this product will work ever or not.Now I still here having installed this product with my electrician at my cost through proper concealed wiring. Again calling the electrician to remove it at a cost again. And Sony gives reasons for the delay.Despite almost one month from purchase unable to use the product so expensive and premium.Ideally I should be given a refund, but I am asking a replacement and a quality assurance from Sony that product is quality checked.So far no luck."
"Worst sound quality low bass, look like a road side speaker"
"Build quality good. But comes to performance Center speaker is not clear and loud in sound bar. There is a provision to increase or decrease sound in surrounding speakers upto +6.00bB to -2.0dB.Unlike surround speakers there is no provision to increase or decrease centre speaker volume. More over it is not clear even though put the audio to VOICE mode. Rear speakers some times producing irritating resound ,we feel it like may the speaker is torn or defective. Very irritating while watching movies.Apart from above , linking rear adapter with subwoofer is easy and effortless. Surround sound is excellent, but tell you centre sound is very poor.I tried so many settings but no use.It's your choice to buy or not this product. I recommend it to buy below 18000 rupees."
Only slightly nice in music ...not best in effects or bass
Sony didnt send person for installation. We tried reaching out (as the number was shared with us). They didnt pick up the call nor did they call back. This is not a professional behaviour. Very bad from Sony for this. We had trouble doing installation on our own. Hence i will be rating the experience and services low.
Very Very Poor Box quality and No...wear any pack with material like card box and polythene etc. No doubt Soundbar is Very Good but issue only packaging. Sony is Big Brand No doubt but care and transportation performance against Amazon is very.... unhappy and Poor service for packaging parsal.
"Best sound , good product , quality is very goodBut install guy was not good in installmention they dont't know where back sound should be installed he was installed 6-7 feet from ground enven the elevation of both sound speaker not matching it's look weard. After I setup again from the help of YouTube. Cutting two star for that only.."
"Decent product but not very great sound, could have been better"
There is no Warranty card in box
I bought this last month but not satisfied with the product because my Sony TV is louder than this Home Theatre. Very disappointed with the sound quality.
But my 2 speaker and amplifier not wall fitting and any it is its ok service.
Sound quality is not as per money.
"Pros:1. Great support from Sony service center.They followed me up for installation and no tips accepted.Cons:1. I am writing this review after 6 months of usase, the sound quality is not to that professional level, don't mistake me when I say this, if you don't care the perfection then this is par to your expectations. But when you know what sound you are hearing then you will be bit disappointed at times. For example there is sound distortion when I am watching Amazon prime videos, if there is distortion when watching premium content then there is a problem. I used to use Yamaha HT before and i absolutely had no problems with sound but problem was with service.2. Why you see good ratings to product is bcz the service guys force you to give 5 star and ask for a screenshot.3. I'd suggest this if you are bounded by budget, else I always suggest for the professional brands. My choice is Yamaha, but be coutioned about service in Bangalore, I had pathetic experience.4. One more point to be noted is , there is an option in menu auto-sound-increace this is required to maintain the quality consistently, but times you observe sound level is inconsistent and you will get headache over the long run, if you turn off this feature then you need to compromise with sound dts quality.Hope this helps. Thanks."
Expected sorround is not working
"Never buy from this seller terrible experience. I was originally going to buy only the main speakers but decided it would be nice to upgrade so I got the pack. The mains work great. The surrounds were very small and not great. The center channel was shipped DOA and kept shorting out my receiver. I asked for a replacement and they offered me 25 dollars, the speaker they sell for 150 dollars. Now they will only return the item in the original box, but this issue with the speaker was not discovered until the box was already recycled. Never buy from them again and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone. They should be shipping me a new speaker that actually works since this was their mistake and I could easily return the non functioning speaker in that box but this is apparently too challenging for them."
"It is a great speaker, but I had to change out the center speaker with an upgrade."
"I contacted the seller to inform them that the speaker cones in the attached picture on the front speaker do not work! I just got the system on 11/6/24. I never heard back from the seller! I am VERY disappointed by the lack of a corrective action, and will not buy from this seller again!"
Got 7 boxes should have been 8. The center speaker did not get delivered with the rest!! Super pist off about it!! Now I have to wait for a response!! Not happy!!
Do not use this product as packaged. Incorrect packaging makes this product useless. DO NOT ORDER@!!
Really hoping the rest of it shows up.
"Not the best sounding speakers for the money. I'm hoping with time they sound better,  if not I might have to return them."
"Box’s had taken damage and it hurt the finish of the speakers.Here’s something I thought was pretty stupid.When screwing in the wood screws the first two the heads snapped of. I saw where they said don’t over tighten. The screws were only half the way in. The screws are that cheap. It makes me wonder how well the actual speakers are built.Easy fix but really scrappy screws and paying $1200 for the speakers???I would have returned all of the but were into a total inside renovation and it’s a mess. So yes I’m keeping them but I wouldn’t buy them again.I’m now day plus one, I mean what I say you cannot touch the edges of the speaker box’s and peels the Very CHEAP black coating.This was a $1200 dollar speaker but and I’m not a high fidelity expert but I know quality and since I’m in the middle of a whole house renovation I just don’t have the effort to box and take them back.My opinion you don’t want these.As of Oct. 4.  NEW!!!I opened one of two tower speakers and remember on an earlier post I showed the box being torn from top to bottom? Well when taking the speaker out of the box I found a silver rod with a ball bearing teflon wheel. It was not from anything I ordered and I do feel bad for the person that had their shipment come in was less one “wheel”???Also to note that I only received two cables, one for the calibration and the other the FM antenna. How thoughtfull.I don’t know highly like most of you but I know quality so when screw heads turn going into particle  board, corner and edges banged up and ,… well what I’ve written above.Even though I bought a roll of 16g. wire and terminated the end with what I think is good connectors I cam to the end and found I still have to pick up a standard banana plug. Without it no subwoofer. The cable connectors are a different diameter.Be safe out there"
Very disappointed to find one of the towers had significant damage to the enclosure.The cardboard shipping box was fine. No damage.The seller offered a measly 30 dollars for me to keep it.That doesn't cut it for me for such high end speakers. I want a replacement. This is a factory defect.
"While I am happy with the performance of the speaker kit, one of the standup speakers arrived damaged (dent in corner of housing).  When I contacted Adorama (vendor) I was given the option of returning the speaker or receiving a small refund.  Since these are a matched pair of speakers I wanted to return BOTH stand up speakers for a new set.  I was told that they were no longer available (I had just purchased them a week or so prior) and they offered me ( what I considered) a minimum refund, which would not come close to purchasing a new replacement pair.  I finally decided it was not worth the time and aggravation and accepted their offer.  I simply will not purchase from this vendor again."
Everything was perfect until I had to put the bases on the 625 speakers..China or klipsch put screws that sheared before seating so I have to fix brand new speakers because of restocking fee to replace or ship whole set back...not happy with Amazon or klipsch  as tech at klipsch said only way to fix water into mdf and rip out screw and get screw that works...unacceptable. cheap screws crack
"I wrote a better review that Amazon rejected and can't tell me why. So we're dropping down the stars to 1. Speakers are great, buy them,  seller was fine no issues.  Wood screws included with speakers are cheap and will break off at head during install. Buy your own wood screws or don't use included stands."
"This is a kit sold by Costco , I was suprised to see the label and when I looked it up sure enough it is and of course less there."
"The set sounds great, except I couldn't use the smaller box speakers, were damaged in transit"
"The speakers are solid at what I paid at Costco, but not SVS or anything else great. I got them at Costco for $799 which is a fantastic price. If you pay more than that you’re overpaying for these period. Now…The bottom of the speakers requires you attach plastic feet, yes plastic on these expensive speakers. Klipsch provides these terrible plastic stabilizers with cheap screws. The slightest torque can snap the screw while attempting to secure the legs. I checked numerous forums and it’s an issue Klipsch is very well aware of yet continues to ignore the problem. I had to return the entire set for a replacement over one screw. I called Klipsch to see what’s the best method and to inquire about the issue.Klipsch customer service is nonexistent and I wasn’t able to reach anyone. The automated system will place you on (screw this customer hold) and you’ll be forgotten. After 30 minutes for the second time, I hanged up and returned the speakers to Costco for a replacement. Don’t buy these anywhere that doesn’t have a good return policy, because if you run into an issues, you’ll be screwed. You can email Klipsch and maybe get a response in the year 2080, but highly unlikely. By far the worst customer service I’ve dealt with especially at this price point. This company has gone downhill and it’ll be my last purchase from Klipsch. I reordered for two reasons 1. I got them at Costco 2. I paid $799 for a set and that’s totally worth the risk…Again"
"I have owned this model for a few months now. I have to say that this system is just that ""ok"" you get what you pay for. The sound is alright. If you are looking for that (feel like your there sound) with the full dynamic sound, this is not the system for you. There is no base at all. Very disappointing. It was the main reason I bought this system (says it has great base) if you are looking for a system that has base, than, again this is not the system for you. The system gets loud but not really loud so don't expect to get loud (  thumping music) I really had hoped this system would have met higher standards but unfortunately it fell short."
"Subwoofer stopped working after the first hour. Tried all of the different inputs including bluetooth. Tried the good old unplug it and plug it back in and again, nothing. Smaller speakers work fine."
Been using for a couple months and the sub blow already and it’s been at level 8 since I’ve gotten it so I’m not happy with that little speakers work great but the sub is not good not worth the money really. Probably one of the worst subs I look for the lifetime of the sub and this is horrible life expectancy
Not as good as it said it was.  Sound is very bad.  Not theater sound at all!
Sub woofer work for 3 seconds doesn't work can get in touch with anyone to return it unprofessional
Set everything up for a hour! And it only worked for 2 HOURS & it just stopped! Felt like it overheated & would not come back on. I even left it off overnight & nothing! Quality is not good!
"These speakers come with a very short, fixed cable for connection. No way to use speaker wire. If you only want your sisters a few feet apart, I guess that works... But I don't live in a cracker box. What a useless design."
"Stereo line inputs worked, the 5.1 line inputs didn't. Avoid until they get their act together."
difficult set up and very poor bass response
"The sound quality is not particularly good, but most annoying quality is that the screen isn’t on the same side as the speaker. So if you face the speaker towards you, then you can’t read the screen when changing volume etc."
"Worked good for about 2 years then started making weird sounds like it had feed back problems, then one day nothing no sound what so ever."
My subwoofer stopped working and just makes a bunch of noise
Very nice stereo . Had bad sub !! Still trying to return it ! Return shipping over half of what they will refund!!!
One of my subwoofers wont power on and one of the tower speakers came with 2 front feet  so it wont sit level it rocks back and forth  don't know how to go about it but way 2 difficult to have to send everything back outside of those 2 things looks great has great sound
Very excited to arrive. Day came and.receiver was not received with speakers. And  no ides if getting before  big weekend event.
"Bought the bar 8 after much research out on reddit and reviews wherever i could find. Arrived without any damage but looked like it was a returned product as some of packaging was already open. Setup looked pretty simple with the app. Only thing was software update took 40mins easy and stuck at 65% for most time. The sound was great but for a 5.0.2 channel config. I am used to my master series a90j sound thats great and bar 8 sound was instantly dissappointing. Spent whole day tweaking settings on tv and bar 8 but couldnt justify since bar 8 couldnt sound same/better than my a90j from 2021. In a medium-large living room this just wasnt cutting it. Maybe sony doesnt want to undermine the master series sound or bar 8 is for those computer monitors, i just dont understand its placement anymore and the discounted pricing of $700 now makes more sense. Just get the 7.1 system(sonos arc or bar 9) and avoid bar 8 altogether if you have similar or better setup than me. No wonder not many people are talking about it online, i was considering building out with bar 8- rear speakers and sub but i dont see a point now."
"I had a Vizio Soundbar with the subwoofer first generation…..great sound!!!!. All my Music equipments and TVs are Sony including Laptops….so I decided to move on and buy this Sony Soundbar and Subwoofer expecting the best not only because it was Sony but for the price tag…..well I couldn’t be more disappointed!!!!….in 2024 cloth….really!….set up was easy, functionality like a $175, value not quite close for what you paid….the app doesn’t help much, the 360* is not there.My leaving room is normal (30x20x12) and the volume didn’t fill the room even almost at maximum.I will say that for a small room is fine. Now, the sound was clear and bass great sound but not enough.Sony dropped the ball here….. I do really hope an update/improvement here."
"Sounds great when it works - DirecTV issues!Soundbar constantly loses signal from the DirecTV box to the TV. Screen goes black and get intermittent sound. This happenes when pausing, switching channels and sometimes on startup. Sony cannot answer why or provide a fix. Takes several power cycles of bar and entire combo to get it sorted out. Once sorted bar sounds great but I dread pausing or changing channels.For a soundbar at this price it should just work!!!"
"I received this today and am returning tomorrow. Tested with TV (The Office) and Movie (Red) and am left feeling disappointed. The sound is very hollow, and honestly not much better than the built-in sound from my new Hisense U7N with 2.1. I'm sure it would sound significantly better with the large subwoofer, but I'm not committing another $600+tax to find out. It should sound full as-is. In comparison, I used an older Sonos PlayBar before which does not include the advanced Atmos/360 Spatial sound but still sounded better overall in its tone and depth to average ear."
"I have always used Sonos, however with the latest app update I am unhappy with the Sonos so I ordered this for our second home.  Many of the reviews raved about this.  I am not impressed with the sound quality.  The app works great but I need to add a lot more components to this to get quality sound especially when playing music."
Shipped with manufacture packaging and not strong enough to ship with UPS. I returned first one due to missing parts (not one - several) with one speaker damage which was ship from PA to NY. Second one was shipped from NJ to NY and missing one piece only but inside box contents are not in place as normal package area. Luckily no damage.Wireless connection is not strong enough and need to setup with wired connection.Sound quality and 360 sound is great compare to regular sound bar.
Unpacked it but it wouldn't even power on? never worked.
"Sounds decent, but not compatible with the Sony Music App ( eg to enable multi-room speakers) despite calling customer support. Only bought a Sony soundbar so it was compatible with my other Sony wireless speakers. Attempting a return."
Constantly switches to TV speakers every 5 minutes. Pretty damn infuriating for $1400 of sound equipment.
I don’t know how the Soundbar is because the frigging app won’t connect it to my damn phone that is supposed to control everything. What an absolutely abominable idea!!
This thing is failing to turn on when monitor is turned on.  Have to use the tv remote to link.  Works for a few weeks and fails again.  Using HDMI 3 ARC connection.  Way too much money to have any problems.
"Box showed up pretty beat-up, but manageable.Opened it and it seems like there was... Barbecue sauce all over it? One speaker wasn't wrapped and got it the worst. I'm guessing this was a return.Hoping to order again when I get a refund."
"This Sony BRAVIA Theater Bar 9 Soundbar with 13 Speaker Units, Dolby Atmos is just okay. It creates a problem that shouldn't exist in that it is only a soundbar, with no subwoofer included. I can definitely understand having an optional package for the rear speakers, but to omit the subwoofer is absurd. This sounds meh since there's no bass or even mid to low end sound at all. Overall, I would pass on this or any soundbar only system. That simply is not reasonable omission or the manufacturer staying relevant in 2024."
"First let’s start with the goods. The system looks very good, it’s thin, it can easily be wall mounted, high quality all around. Bravia app experience was good, and installation was straight forward. Edit: I have an iPhone, can’t comment on Android experience.The demo sounds, and anything with the spatial 360 sounds amazing. All 4 speakers are identical meaning the rear speakers should be as powerful as the front ones.However the reality - 4K Dolby content from Disney, Netflix, and Prime video (the ones we use the most) is … good? Given the price range good does not cut it.For reference I have the Q990C (Samsung high end soundbar, rear speakers and sub). That system usually runs less than half of what this is. Attached pictures shows the size of these speakers in relation to the 990C sub, and one of the rear speakers.The 360 audio demos and music sound better with the Bravia Quad. It’s more immersive and really shows what having real full size back speakers deliver. It is surprising how loud they get despite being so thin..What I tried:- Disney: Avengers End Game (various action scenes)- Netflix:  Rebel Moon (20 minutes different places)- Amazon: Wheel of Time (action)In general terms even if we exclude the sub (which I don’t have for Sony) the Q990C gave me a better movie viewing experience. The biggest disappointment for me with movie content is the rear speakers. I had a lot of hope for the full size speakers being used in the rear, and how noises from the back would come alive with this system. This is not the case. In fact there was virtually no difference in listening experience (I placed them in the same location as the Samsung ones) between them.Noises from left and right front have more separation than the soundbar. But the soundbar does better center channel…Even the rears when there is racing or fast moving objects, it seems like Samsung does a better job at making that experience more immersive and moving the sound from rear to front.Other weird things about Bravia Quad:- Sound varies greatly by content type. While a movie in Disney Plus requires audio at level 50-60 for an enjoyable experience, that volume level is super loud on their demo music and TV interface (I have a Sony tv) , which means I’m constantly having to adjust the volume level between applications. I’ve never had to do this for the Q990C.- listening to music from Spotify and Apple Music was a pleasant experience, but the rear speakers were muddled, singers voice and most sounds come from the front speakers. This seems like it could be fixed via software as this is not the experience you want for your music. This experience is much better with the Sony music one which brings me to why it’s 3 stars and not say 2 stars or 4-5 stars.This system is great with the 360 audio and other Sony demos, but common movies, common music from popular third party services, is good… but not great and in my opinion worse than competitors provide at less than half the cost.As it stands unless you have a space constraint, want a really good looking sound system, or love and are deep involved in Sony 360 sound sources, there are better alternatives to this."
"At this price range I was expecting an out of this world experience. Unfortunately it did not deliver. Is it better than your TV sound, of course but is merely on par with sound bars. Read the full review to understand why.The Sony BRAVIA Theater Quad Wireless Speakers are an intriguing addition to the home audio market, offering a blend of aesthetic appeal, convenience, and modern design. With their sleek, compact form factor, these speakers are designed to complement contemporary living spaces without compromising on style.Design and AestheticsOne of the standout features of the Sony BRAVIA Theater Quad Wireless Speakers is their design. The speakers are small and thin, making them easy to place in various settings without overwhelming the decor. Their minimalist design allows them to blend seamlessly with most home theater setups, particularly appealing to those who prioritize a clean, uncluttered look.Wireless ConvenienceThe wireless nature of these speakers is another major selling point. This is particularly advantageous for those who appreciate a tidy living space free from the tangle of wires commonly associated with traditional speaker systems.Self-Powered FunctionalityThe speakers are self-powered, which simplifies the installation process by eliminating the need for an external amplifier or receiver. This feature is particularly beneficial for users who may not be technologically inclined, as it reduces the complexity typically associated with setting up a home audio system.If your TV is wall mounted - installation ChallengesA notable downside is the potential difficulty in installation, especially for those with wall-mounted TVs. The process can be cumbersome, requiring careful planning and possibly additional mounting accessories. Users may need to navigate the intricacies of aligning the speakers for optimal sound projection, which can be a frustrating endeavor for the uninitiated.Sound Quality - What we really look in a high end speaker systemWhile the Sony BRAVIA Theater Quad Wireless Speakers offer a range of convenient features, their sound quality is not the best. They provide a satisfactory listening experience for casual use, but audiophiles and those seeking high-end sound performance may find them lacking.Streaming movies and shows is not ideal for audio listening comparison because streaming channels CRUSH the audio to save bandwidth for the image. Honestly most audio streams (not dolby 5.1) most of the time sound like an MP3 at 64kHz.I streamed American Idol and a movie on Netflix on both the Sony Bravia and it sounded mushy. I decided to use Spotify on the TV and stream Hanz Zimmer - Mountains (Interstellar Soundtrack). Spotify is one of the least compressed streaming apps available. I played the song on the Sony Bravia and recorded it with an Audio Spectrometer on my phone (Galaxy S22 Ultra). While not 100% professional it was again something more real world comparison.The Bravia bass performed quite remarkably being such a thin speaker but you can also see that the mids and highs are sort of mushed together.For my listening taste (I’m used to high end speaker systems) Sony Bravia was unfortunately disappointing.Pros and Cons SummaryPros:1. Aesthetically Pleasing: The small and thin design allows the speakers to blend seamlessly into modern living spaces without detracting from the overall decor.2. Wireless Convenience: Eliminates the need for extensive cabling, providing a cleaner, more organized setup.3. Self-Powered: Simplifies the setup process by removing the need for external amplifiers or receivers.Cons:1. Trouble Installation for Wall mount TV: Setting up the speakers, particularly with wall-mounted TVs, can be challenging and may require additional effort and accessories, especially where to put the control box which is huge for what it is.2. Moderate Sound Quality: While adequate for casual listening, the sound quality does not meet the high-end standards expected by audiophiles.ConclusionThe Sony BRAVIA Theater Quad Wireless Speakers is a solid choice for users seeking a visually appealing and convenient wireless audio solution for their home theater systems. However, those who prioritize top-tier sound quality and ease of installation with wall-mounted setups may need to look elsewhere or be prepared for a bit of extra effort during the installation process."
"If you have the full setup with the back speakers and the subwoofer this soundbar sounds great. If you don't, well then not so much.The biggest problem I had was that the audio would jump around from one part of the soundbar to another and you'd get weird fishbowl sounds.Setup was really easy (until I added the rears and sub which is a whole different story).With the full kit though it sounds really good and I am happy with it. So go all in or don't bother in my opinion."
"I really like the Bravia Theater Quad Sound system. It sounds great (I bought the large subwoofer). It is advertised as having better dialog sound, but the improvement is minor. It is hit and miss when turned on. Sometimes the sound comes on right away. Sometimes no picture or sound for a minute or so. I use it with a Sony A9L TV. The center channel connection to the TV is OK, but weak. The latest feature is I heard an audio pop while watching TV. Everything went black with no sound (this happened ocassionally in the past without the pop - probably an eArc resynchronizing issue). Then the picture and sound came back after about a minute, but without the center TV channel. Without the sound system on, sound comes through the TV ok. I suspect the base unit stopped sending a center channel signal. I will be contacting Sony Support on the issue and update the review in a few days. I really want to give the Bravia Theater Quad a five-star review for the sound."
"I have a Sony sound bar and a sub and they've always sounded really good for a lower end model. So, the price of this and the ad I thought great this one should be fabulous. It wasn't all I thought it would be.The ease of set up was very simple and easy and I liked the app. The sound was okay but not enough bass really for a 13 speaker unit. I was unable to set up my sub with this sound bar. The remote control works but is pretty unnecessary when the television remote works it as does the app, but it works. The clarity of the sound is pretty clear and sound crisp, the sound does not have to be blasting to hear talking on the shows. It's okay for music but I need my sub to work.I think this is overpriced for what it is. I love Sony products but when they make it so only some components that are newer work with it, I find that irritating. Maybe I'm doing something wrong with the pairing of the new sound bar and my old sub but I've never had that problem before."
"I have to say that I am really unimpressed with this sound bar.  We have been using a $300 sony bar with subwoofer that is only 4 years old and thought this would take the sound up a notch or two.  The first problem was that it would not connect to the subwoofer we already have.  So we would have to shell out additional funds for a new subwoofer and that just seems like a money grab by sony to only have two options available to connect to this bar.  There is almost no base on max with this bar and the treble is way too high.  The sound optimization feature on the app did nothing to fix the problem.  At almost $1000 I would expect a huge improvement.  We are going to live with it for awhile and see if it grows on me, but I have a feeling we will be putting the less expensive sound bar back up as it had a much better sound quality."
"It's easy to set up, connects effortlessly, and looks slick. The sound is clear, but not grand... I expected much bigger sound for the price, but I was disappointed. I may need to add subwoofer to improve the sound quality."
"Review for: ""Sony BRAVIA Theater Quad: 16 Total Speakers Home Theater Surround Sound System with 4 Wireless Speakers, Support for Dolby Atmos/DTS:X and 360 Spatial Sound Mapping (HT-A9M2)""Little of my background on Home theater:I have a full blown Home theater in my living room, Dolby Atmos 7.2.4, with JBL speakers and SVS & Martin Logan Sub. It has Dolby Atmos processor, Digital Mixer and QSC Power amplifer (total 11 channel @ 700 watts RMS per channel 4 Ohm - 20Hz - 20kHz / 0.05% THD). It sound clean and details even in high levell.In my bedroom, I have a small 3.1 system consist of Denon AV, KEF reference  and Sub. It is very clean and pristine sound for both music and movies.I try this Sony Bravia quad, because it is smaller package and has wireless setup and it support Dolby Atmos.Reference material: I have a Plex Server in my NAS that I have all my favorite movies Ripped from 4K Bluray Dolby Atmos. My reference are: Avatar, Bohemian Rhapsody, Elvis, John Wick 4.Short version of review:I almost return this Bravia Quad because it doesn't come with Sub woofer, and the sound is thin. No low end bass. And there is no way to connect my Sub woofer. I have to admit the sound produced is actually nice, flat and clean. For the asking price $2,500, without Sub woofer, it is no way near my small 3,1 system.Rather then return the item, I just buy the Sony wireless Sub woofer SA-SW3 for $400 (No other Sub can be connected to this system, no matter how hard I try).My connection is, from 4K Atmos TV, I connect the eArc (the old Arc cannot support high bandwidth of Dolby Atmos) channel to Sony Bravia control unit. So all the reference source material I play using Plex App from TV connected thru eArc.After finish setup with the sub woofer, I give it a try again. Now I definitely like the sound it produce. The Avatar dialog is so clean and crispy, and the Dolby Atmos is really simulated nicely. And off course the mid bass and low bass now more pronounced balance with the rest of the frequency range. Bohemian Rapsody and Elvis is very enjoyable to hear. The music is clean and punchy. John Wick 4 is also nice to watch with all non stop action.Conclusion:As it is (without Sub woofer), this is not recommended for the asking price ($2500). Especially there is no way to connect other Sub woofer.Adding sub woofer (SA-SW3) make a night and day different, and for this it deserve to get full 5 stars.So, I only can give 3 stars (without Sub) because for the package it doesn't perform because it lacks the required bass, and there is no way to connect any other Sub.If It comes with SA-SW3 build into package, then it is a solid 5 stars.Complete review (with Sony SA-SW3 for $400 extra):It come in a box, that partly open. The spacer to attached the speaker into the base is scattered all over the place (It supposed to be inside a bag like the screws. Anyway, thanks God, nothing is missing, otherwise It render useless, because I cannot install it without a missing proprietary component.Apart from the scattered spacer, all other component is in a good condition. Just need to screw all the base with spacer for all the speakers and it is ready to go. It only need one cable for each speaker to connect to AC power source. The beauty of wireless speaker. The connection to TV is using eARC HDMI, so it can pass thru Dolby Atmos content, and at the same time I can just use the TV remote to control the Sony Control box. All source Material (mostly Plex, but I also try Netflix, Youtube and Amazon Prime) is played using the TV Apps, and it pass thru the Audio stream as RAW into the Sony Bravia control box.To setup it needs to download an App from Apple Store called BRAVIAConnect. Make sure to use 5G wifi, because when I use 2.4G wifi, it is not stable, and disconnect in the middle of firmware update. Luckily nothing goes wrong.Setup is simple and straight forward, it can see and connect all the 5 speakers and automatically update the firmware of the Control box. Then it will setup the build in DSP to match the room environment. After setup, it give a chance to hear a Sound demo which turn out very good.I start with playing Avatar and I am amazed with the dialog clarity, it is so clear and have the best articulation among speakers that I have. The Atmos sound simulation is also render nicely across all the speakers. Then I tried Bohemian Rhapsody and Elvis. Wow, the music sound so realistic. I am very impressed on how linear the frequency range to the upper end. The bass is punchy and the low end is actually nice for the small Sub like the SA-SW3. Nice surprise, The last test is John Wick 4, which has lots of action from beginning to the end. This system can perform nicely without being fatigue.Conclusion:Why it is only 3 stars? Lacking a Sub woofer on the package, and no option to hookup external Sub is total disaster. If at least it give a 3.5mm line out for Sub woofer it deserve to get 4 stars.It should actually come with at least SA-SW3 for a solid 5 stars. But I know that Sub is the older generation, and is not color match to the package. I suspect they are working with the new gen Sub that will complement nicely into this package and issue a new version called HT-A9M3.Is there something else need improvement?For my liking, I missed the center channel. Even though the L+R channel can simulate the center channel, but if we don't sit in the center position, we can hear it from L or R speaker depending on position.There is a 3.5mm output for Center channel but, it is line level, so it is a hassle to install another power amp and center channel speaker. I wish they will design the Control box as a Center channel speaker with build in class D amp, and then it is absolute 5 stars +++"
"FINAL SUMMARYAfter a week with the system and dozens of hours both using... and trouble shooting... I hope you find the review to be helpful.  It is recommended to read everything if you want to understand the entire experience.GOOD for you if: you have a new SONY Bravia TV that will function as a center channel, do not want to run wires all over your home, prioritize a minimalist, 'clean' look, are okay with spending another $600 for proper bass, are not looking for 'reference sound' - just something that sounds good**.  (The speakers sound great, but this is partly achieved by creating data that isn't there in the source and amplifying the rear speakers for a more noticeable effect.  Christopher Nolan movies, for example, are mixed in 5.1 and DO NOT have height sounds... but this system can fake it for you.  In my opinion this sounds good, but it is not the data the director put on the disc.)BAD for you if: you want the best sound for the money, you want a center channel and don't have a new Sony TV, you want to integrate existing subwoofers or any other equipment, your TV doesn't support HDR, Dolby Vision, or ATMOS return via the eARC output, your TV doesn't have multiple HDMI inputs, you use a projector (due to limited inputs), you want to use for gaming. 5.7.24 UPDATE:The system is now working again.  No rhyme or reason - just started working again.Tested with a gaming PC.  GSync does not work if connected directly to the Hub from graphics card (not surprising).  Therefore, if your display doesn't have an ARC HDMI return (or one that supports HDR/ATMOS for those features) you will not be able to use variable refresh rate.  I didn't test Free Sync or regular VSYNC - but the results would be the same.The system does support 120hz, and I didn't notice any lag or video degradation if you want to pass through the HUB to your display.  BUT... some games will recognize the hub as a small TV and not allow you to make the appropriate selection in the Audio menu (in fact this may also happen even if you are using eARC...).  Also, as a general note about ATMOS and Windows 10/11... it can be difficult to get this to work properly; for non-video game ATMOS output you will need to buy a $15 program from DOLBY and it is a pain even with this program.Tested with an HDMI splitter/audio extractor and 3rd party subwoofer.  This worked - just run a RCA cable from the audio-extraction output to your powered subwoofer!  From my perspective this is the biggest win for the system, and the reason I will be keeping it.  But... you don't have any controls over the sub: you can't fine tune it as part of the overall system and are limited to using the crossover knob on the sub itself, and adjusting the volume with the subwoofer gain knob.  ***You should be able to run the audio extract to a preamp and then the sub, which would give you some more control - but that is getting a little crazy.Main take-away from the HDMI sound extractor device: if you have a bunch of Subwoofers and ""Butt-kickers"" it IS possible to utilize them with this system.  Big bonus.Music:  Not good.  But maybe good enough for what you need.  Better than a blue tooth speaker or TV.No Center Channel: big disappointment.  Sony does a good job of 'faking it' with movies, but if you're watching someone speak (news for example) it just sounds off.  And you lose the ability to adjust the volume of dialogue specifically.Limitations if your TV doesn't have multiple HDMI inputs and an fully functional ARC output: in this situation you're stuck with 1 input via the Sony hub.  Even casting from a phone won't work correctly if your ARC doesn't support all features.  Using a receiver as a HDMI switching device (though silly and expensive and not recommended) did not work for me.  It is possible you could plug your devices (Disc Player, Streaming Device, Xbox, etc.) into a HDMI selector, and then change your output to the Sony hub as needed... but to get such a device that supports ATMOS, HDR, 120hz, etc. AND has more than 2 HDMI inputs can be very expensive.****I'm going to keep the system.****  People really prefer the sound of Sony's processing over traditional multi-speaker ATMOS systems, and the ability to run subwoofers (though limited) is what convinced me.Good luck!5.6.24 UPDATE:I received this product free of charge as part of Amazon's VINE review program.  And I will likely be returning it.  I've left 2 stars because it sounded amazing for the 20ish hours it worked.The system has had ongoing problems after the first day.  It stopped turning on with the TV.  It stopped playing sound from the TV.  It randomly started, and got stuck with no resolution, on ""Pairing.""NOTHING has changed with my TV, and there are no other devices involved - this is purely a problem with the BRAVIA system.  It cannot connect to the speakers, the APP, etc.As the product comes with no instructions, I have had to go through all the steps directed by a SONY rep on the first day of setup: everything from simply pushing the 'pair' button on the speakers, to resetting the device and speakers, to removing power.  I've uninstalled/reinstalled the Android APP.  I even used the special code (that is written nowhere) the SONY rep told me to ensure the antenna is on.  NOTHING IS WORKING.At this point I have spent more time setting up/ trouble shooting this product than actually using it.  It sounded better than anything I've ever heard during the 18ish hour period it worked -- but I am going to return it if I cannot resolve this by the end of the day.I recommend holding off on purchase at this point.  See below for my initial impressions on day 1.5.1.24 - there are no reviews out on this product, and many people are interested.  I have only spent a day with the system so far, so consider these my first impressions to help you make a choice.  I will update this review with more information as I spend more time with it - but I wanted to get this data to everyone ASAP!When considering this product you need to consider what you are looking for: do you want a simple, elegant system that will give you incredible sound with minimal* hassle; or, are you looking for components that can be integrated to your existing audiophile system?Are you okay with a proprietary, closed ecosystem that requires setting up a Sony account and a smartphone App --as long as it works... or do you want to connect your very expensive subwoofers, transducers, etc for.the best possible experience?What this system does: once you get everything setup* the sound produced is unbelievable.  Not just for the tiny size of the speakers -- in general, across all systems I've tested.  It just works; you are in a dome of sound and it doesn't even make sense to me how this is possible???This is tested in a wood floored room with average height drywall ceilings: about 15' by 24'.  The speakers were mounted on top (see pics) of the existing system speakers, so they are a little above ear level for some people.  The mounting height is about perfect: they aren't just sitting on a TV console 3' from the ground, so keep that in mind.  However, with Sonny's claimed processing this shouldn't matter anyway.The majority of testing this far has been with a Sony 4k BluRay player connected directly to the hub.  To summarize, I watched Alita: Battle Angel with Atmos.  3 minutes in my wife turned to me with a grin and said ""don't get mad... but this sounds way better than any setup we've ever had."".  She doesn't lie.Now why would I be mad?  Because I've spent countless hours over the years researching components, assembling systems... and drilling through walls, ceilings, floors to run high gauge wire to high power speakers.We currently have a higher-end Onyko receiver in the basement powering higher end dual 8"" + horn Klipsch mains, and marching center, surrounds, ceiling firing, 2 300 watt Klipsch subs, and 'Butt Kicker' transducers for a 150"" projector screen.  This is my pride and joy.Upstairs we have a mid-grade Onyko receiver paired with a mid-range 5 speaker Jamo system and a 15"" $300 sub.  No Atmos in this system, but it sounds great.  At least it did...Regarding the Sony Quad system: it makes you feel like you are in a bubble of sound (her words).  You don't necessarily hear sound specifically coming from a point in the ceiling - but you do hear things flying overhead.  Watching the Godzilla remake had 2 cats and 1 dog looking all over the room - including at the ceiling - to try to find out where those sounds were coming from.  First time they've looked around like that.  People who say up-firing Atmos speakers don't work haven't experienced Sony's magic!!!The sound itself: gets very loud - wouldn't want to play over 80/100 volume.  Never distorts.  Feels incredibly crisp and clear.  And loud.  Other systems seem to overwhelm you with powerful but inferior sound: the Sony system just cuts through with perfect clarity.The bass/mids are on one hand very impressive.  At 70 volume an ottoman was vibrating - not from sound transfered through the floor but through the air.  The sound is full: you will not be disappointed...Unless, that is, you are doing A/B testing with a big subwoofer.  The Sony system is indeed magical - but it cannot reproduce the deep mid-lows and deep lows of a traditional tower/sub setup.  It just cannot... despite all Sony's processing power, physics gets in the way.  The sound never falls apart or distorts, but you will never feel like you're being punched in the chest, that there is pressure on your ear drums; you won't feel Godzilla's steps on your floor.It is what it is.  The SO, always honest, prefers the Sony approach to the ""sound you can feel.""But, objectively, from a home theater perspective, you are missing out on some content/data.If you are moving up from a soundBAR etc. you will never know the difference: this will be the most incredible experience you have ever heard.  But those who know ... well they know.Sony sells a 300 watt subwoofer, from last year, to go with this system: $600.  Now, the tech employed in the Quad system itself may warrant its $2,500 USD price tag.  But the tech involved in a subwoofer does not - there is no magic processing going on there, it is simply handling the sub 100hz frequencies like a normal sub.To really get a theater experience with this system you need a sub.  I refuse to spend $600 on what Sony is offering: enter the closed system dilemma.  I am going to attempt to get a signal to my existing subs and will report back if I achieve success.Sony could have made it easy to add a sub.  They could.have made it easy to add a center speaker - they did not.  The only way to get a center channel is to buy a Sony Bravia TV!!!  Closed system!!  How is that going to work with a projector?Expanding on th closed nature of this system, the setup, which is supposed to be a piece of cake, was the most frustrating audio gear experience of my 25+ years in the space.I almost returned the system.1. There are directions on mounting.  There are NO DIRECTIONS on how to setup, tune, etc.  apparently you are supposed to notice a tiny barcode-url that brings you to download the ""Official Bravia App.""2. The App is the only way to set up the system.  To use the app you need to provide a bunch of personal information, confirm your email, and (probably) consent to unlimited data collection.  This is where I expected many of you will ""Nope Out"" and look elsewhere.--Unlike every other piece of equipment you have ever used, you can't just hook up the cables and go.  I wasted an hour and a half trying that.3. Once you've resigned to signing over your life, you are at the mercy of the APP.  When you get stuck during setup with the app... you're screwed.  There are no directions anywhere else; the app will only tell you to ""press the link button on the speaker"" again and again and again.  I wasted another hour struggling with this.4. I finally had to call Sony customer support.  This was a terrible experience, but at least the people were nice.  They had me do things like reset the device -- this isn't documented anywhere, if it was it is something I might have been able.to.resolve hours ago - but the only way to gain this info is to spend an hour on the phone with a tech.  We finally got to a point where the color of the speaker LED had changed, but the APP wouldn't progress any further.  Enter customer support level 2 with Sony Japan...5. Nice people.  But ""tell me the model number, it is.on the bottom of the hub"" resulted in 5-10 minutes of back and forth about what is actually written on the bottom of the hub.  It says ""Model No. YYXXetc"" very clearly - I can read - but I was instructed over and over again to find a non existent number that started with H.- At lvl 2 we tried all sorts of things that are not written down anywhere (so take note).  The nice rep was clearly winging it - often trying my suggestions.  At the end of the day she was really trying to diagnose a problem with the Android APP by resetting etc etc the speaker system - this was never going to work.  And there was no way to advance, NOTHING outside the app to get it working.6. Finally we.got disconnected and I decided to try restarting my phone and starting over.  I did this 2x, then, somehow, it worked.7. Now, to calibrate the system you need use your cellphone.  Hopefully the microphone works well...8. After an HOURS it works.  But, you still need to use the APP if you want to make any adjustments/fine tune/etc (the remote has volume and bass levels tho).  What happens if I'm out of town?  Does my wife download the app?  And then sign in with MY Sony account???  I don't even want to think about this.As far as.setup, the desire to create a cool, seamless, modern process was an absolute disaster.  It depends on Apple/Android - and Sony is in no position to diagnose problems with Android or iOS.  Mine started working by chance.The rep even called me.back after the disconnect and gave me.this advice ""press input, volume down, then mute - in that order, and it will change.the wireless on/off.  You can do this in the future to check the wireless is on - if there are problems..."". Thanks, I guess?  I suppose I'll write that down?  For $2,500 USD + tax, this product should come.with a leather-bound, glossy manual with all of this info.  Using a cellphone WITH a Sony account should NOT be necessary to use the product.I was very close to sending this back.  I had to take time off work to resolve this...  Time is also money.At the end of the day the sound is unreal.  It the setup stuff is okay with you, if the style is okay with you, if the price is okay with you, if the lack of a subwoofer is also okay with you -- you will love this system.  It is literally magic.Look back for update attaching a separate subwoofer, v-sync g-sync pass through for gaming, music evaluation, and more.I hope this first look was helpful!!"
"So I made this purchase a few weeks ago. It took two weeks to receive the product. I was a little disappointed, but it was fine. It arrived while I was out of town for work and was waiting for me when I got back home. Easter Sunday I woke up and said, let’s open it up. It was packaged wonderfully. Everything was wrapped neatly as well as securely. I tan all my wiring, plugged it in and was quite impressed. The sound quality was very nice. Everything was working perfectly. It was about fifteen minutes in that I went out into the living room to see if I could hear it outside of my room. It sounded like a movie theater inside the room, so I needed to check the loudness. As I was walking back into my room, I noticed there was no sound. I thought, hmmm, what could be the issue?  Well, it turns out that while I was checking the lower on the back, as well as the power chord and outlet is was plugged in to, I noticed a burning smell from inside the receiver/sub woofer. It completely died. Fried up and didn’t even have it hooked for half an hour. So I contacted the seller. It has taken another week to get everything situated. Took a week to get all the shipping information and labels. Now I still have yet to receive my refund. I would have rather just had another receiver sent so I could send the old one back, but instead, I had pull everything back out, repackage it, and send it all back. This has been one hell of an experience and will never purchase anything from them again. I needed up going to Walmart and purchasing a Vizio surround that actually sounds better, plus, it was a little cheaper. It would be a great product if it actually worked. Buy at your own risk."
"While I really wanted to love this system I just couldn't. Yes, the bass bumps and while that is nice it's painful how many frequencies the back side speakers buzz on even at very low volumes. It just doesn't process them properly and with no EQ settings you can't even try to correct it, the individual speaker volume level control isn't nearly enough, but I'll get back to that.While those two speakers were a disappointment, I will say that I was very pleased with the other three speakers and the sub. The quality of sound out of those four pieces is fantastic and I've really enjoyed being able to hook it up to my T.V. for watching movies and have my music playing. This unit easily fills my little apartment with sound.The trouble starts to set back in when you need to adjust the audio levels so you can hear the dialogue in a movie or get a little more clarity out of a song.. You need to adjust each speakers volume independently to draw out or decrease that speakers natural frequency range, but seeing as the three good ones seem to operate in the same range all you can really do is decrease or increase all tones aside from the bass, or the bass itself. My back side speakers live on -10 and still buzz all the time on all sorts of frquencies and if I even want to really turn it up I switch the unit to 2.1 and/or disconnect them entirely. If you just need to tweak the bass this isn't so bad, you just turn it up or down. While there are EQ + and - buttons they seem to have no function, upon further investigation it only seems to work through the USB input and accesses the devices eq.. not sure how you switch which part it is altering though.The head unit which is also the sub has almost no controls, which I knew ahead of time and was fine with until the item arrived with no remote control which was extremely frustrating. They did manage to get me a remote after a handful of emails. It took a few weeks to get here, but no big deal. My issue is more that the remote only seems to want to work from about 5 feet away and has to be pointed right at the unit for it to work, and even then it often seems takes a minute for it to realise you hit a button and often have to press, wait a few seconds, press,  wait, press, etc. It gets moody..Though, I must say, the absolute weirdest thing about this system.. it will pick up CB radio and ither similar transmissions when it is in Standby mode. So if you live near anyone that makes use of radio communications you may need to go to great lengths to identify the source and find out if they can switch they're broadcasting channel or you'll be sitting in silence on morning, sipping your coffee, preparing for your day and suddenly a booming voice asks if you copy. Made for an interesting day at least.It wasn't the worst purchase I ever made and while I don't plan on changing it out any time soon.. looking back.. I wish I had gotten something else."
"Stopped working about two months in, I wouldn’t buy again honestly. Was easy to set up, has blue tooth connections, when it worked the sound quality was great. Size is perfect for any space."
"If you have a 5.1 true surround system, this is not. If you never had one this one you might like. Pro's and con's coming later. I returned it, got a refund with no problem, but if you have to return it you need to re-box and same box and take it to Fedex pick up spot. Dollar General was the only place near me, she gave me some crap that box was to big, I smoothed talked her that it would fit on they're return shelve . I had to take it in myself and put it on the return shelve, it fit, but a very close call, if it didn't, I would had to travel 20 miles to a Fedex drop off. So save the box!! Ok, it say's 1,000 watts, no way, I've had 1,000 watt systems in my life and this is not a 1,000 watt system. My current Samsung unit's are 450 watts and are louder then this thing. Current units I have, have the rear speakers wireless to the front main unit. This unit you have to run wires form the rear to the front. That's a pain in the butt (think about how you going to hide them?) I tested this unit just by running rear wires over the carpet to make sure a gave it a fair chance, it was ok, but not good. No 5.1 sound, if your use to 5.1 sound. Again, if you want it for a garage or it's your first sound system you might like it? For me I thought this could kind'a be ok, not what I'm use to. For me my next one will cost a crap load of more$$$$!  lolPro's: Not bad for the price if you know what your getting!  Everything worked  Lights are cool, and your able to turn them all offCon's: Shipping back could be a problem?"
I have some Logitech Z series speakers I like better. The RGB on these are a little wonky but it works. For the price it is decent but wouldn't personally recommend.
"Subwoofer blew after a month and a half, bass was not that good even. Kinda pissed off about it."
The woofer sounds like a rattling inside
"I purchased this unit on September 23, 2020 for $169.55. I hooked it to my pc worked great sounded great. As of the beginning of march 2024 this unit is dead. It started to have a buzzing noise followed with a scratching noise that started in the sub woofer and then cascaded to the rest of the speakers. Couldn't turn the volume above 20 or you just couldn't hear anything over the speaker noises. A week later its just dead no sound what so ever. Tried all the other inputs just to see if any other input worked. Nothing, all inputs are dead even the radio, no sound at all. Ya it worked great for almost 3 1/2 yrs, just expected more than 3 1/2 yrs of operation I guess."
"I had a bit of a dilemma writing this review. I have a lot of love for this product, it's made with great quality parts, has an amazing style and led program, and was at a great price. That all aside I have to be honest with myself and for those who read this. The sound quality is mediocre at best. Not only does it not get very loud but it has no equalizer or settings whatsoever that allow you to change the way it is. Thankfully there are many third party apps and programs out there that will allow you to do so and you can get them and use them with a simple touch of a button. Just be careful and knowledgeable about any sound modifications youake as you don't want to blow your sub or speakers. While without using that outside source for sound settings I can't truly endorse a purchase of this product, if you don't mind a low volume generic sound or downloading an app to fix that then I highly recommend buying this"
This product only gets 3 star I purchased in March 2021 on july 17 2024 it just stop working can barely hear the sound I check others review one customer only got three years also I also took the speaker off to check the fuse it's not blown
"Straight to the pointThe GOOD:This is a really good first time budget surround sound speaker set, like if you are in college or have a small budget or have a computer you play video games on,  or have a small room for Netflix and chill times, you can turn each speaker up or down individually, the blue tooth works pretty decent and connects, but this surround sound is nothing extraordinaryThe BAD:*This is not real 5.1 surround , the reason its called 5.1 is because it has 5 speakers and 1 sub lol! all it does is just split the channel left to right all the time when you plug it in*It has outdated connections! you can can not use HDMI, YOU CAN NOT USE OPTICAL, (unless you get a adapter , GOOD LUCK FIGURING WHAT KIND) and you barely can use the red and white RCA cords , i have a hisense smart tv and the only way i was able to get this semi-surround sound to work was to plug the adapter they give you from the red and white rca's into the headphone port of my tv, good thing my tv has a dual out so i don't have to have surround sound on 24/7 but some tvs wont have that luxury :(*The Back Speaker wire is not that long for a living room , its only long enough for a Bedroom unless you splice and extend it, but who wants to go through all that, and if you do splice it, the Blue LED's will not work*The Remote is the most terrible layout ever! the volume button should be where the ""Turn down sub button""  istrust me you will get mixed up every time you go to turn down this device only to see that you are turning down the sub instead of the volume*it never actually shuts off, you will see 2 led lights blinking in the dark like a alarm clock that needs to be reset*The Led lights are cute at first but its no option to turn them off only unplug them from the back of the wooferTHE UGLYTHE SUB RATTLES! unacceptably! you have to turn down the sub to like -10 (which is its lowest setting) if you dare try to put this sub on -3 or above (or at its highest +10) while watching a action movie , it will sound like a car trunk rattling with subs! Terrible! Terrible i will upload video soon!*The L.E.D. on the main sub woofer is a gimmick , it turns a few colors and thats it!So in conclusion only get this if this is going to hold you over till you get a better surround system, it  will do the job mediocrely for the time being , and the people who are praising this either never actually had a real surround sound 5.1 or they got one for free..and there  you have it! you have been Warned"
"Got this to replace a cheap old art+sound system I had when the cheap credit card remote stopped working, and you couldn't change any settings.  I initially tested it and it was a lot better then my old one. So I would recommend it to people who just want to try out surround sound instead of just your tv speakers.Now if your actually a movie watcher of LOTR or Starwars, or GOT and ect.  You will be disappointed.As some others have said in the reviews, this is not a true 5.1 system, and you need to change the setting on your tv (think it's PCM).  But the main part I hate this system is it seems like they put a substandard subwoofer that ""bottoms out"" and makes one hell of a rattling noise during certain bass heavy scenes.  Granted from what I've read LOTR will put any sub to the test.  I have already taken the sub out and checked for any looseness in the system, and found no issues.Other down side to it is your volume does not really get loud till it hits setting 50, and it only goes up to 60.  So if you want to rattle your house down you won't get it from this.On the plus side the remote is awesome and you can change anything on the fly. (which comes in handy if you don't want to blow the sub)Now if you want real knock your socks off I would save your money.  I was able to by a sony receiver from a guy at work who was upgrading for 150 and I got a kipich system on here for around 300.  And I can only turn it up to 60 ot of 100 till my hears hurt and everything hanging on the walls are falling.I ended up putting it on my 2nd tv in the basement just cause I didn't feel like returning it and it was a upgrade for that cheapo tv, and the lights are cool for my bar down there. So after I pay off my credit card I might look into upgrading and throw this thing in the garage.Overall,  Not bad, but not great.  Needs matching sub woofer to the amp, and just a little more power."
for the price it sounded great. i was using it for my computer. the manual was had lots of info but the ones that would help. on screen info was hard to figure out. but on day 2 front L & R channels starting hissing super loud and started to smell a odd smell from sub. i never turned the volume above 30. if the amp didn't have problems it would be good. for any one. really wanted it to work .
"So, I've purchased this unit 2x.The first unit lasted about 5 months and turned off!!! I was at work.. wife was watching something.. at the time baby was 8 months, I have a small dog, and well if it can't be broken my wife will prove other wise. Ok so I say ehh what ever the ghost in the attic broke it..I reorder a new one because the speakers are already in place, decent sound, what ever the ""ghost"" did shouldn't happen again...LAST NIGHT 7/31/2020 (purchase date 6/30)I'm watching Dave and Ava.. I hear a faint pop.. and lose all sound.. I check device, manual power off.. unplugged it re plugged it nothing.. checked with my hand for access heat or any sign Aston what could go wrong.. nothing. Hoping item can be returned at this point...Sound quality: 6Good small apartment, garage, man cave.Sound control: 3Presets that can not be used in aux mode.Basic control volume up or down.Bluetooth: 8Easy find when searching, simple connect (Alexa, smartphone,laptop tested)Card reader: 4Some times starts with first folder.. sometimes play from randomContinuous file counting, no id, no visual display..Setup: 8Fairly easy, old school rca connections as seen in pics.. allot of wiringLights: ...I don't want to see you I want to hear.. get rid light and make led display!!Pros: great system for movies, video games, smaller area listening and stream to it devices..Cons: doesn't appear to last long, and when you power on volume automatically jumps to max level.. so beware of having sound to device b4 powering on. Uses allot of energy in standby.And I don't think I've used any other features... Well aux cord.. and it's a aux connection.."
So I'm not bashing on this thing 2 hard its honestly not 2 bad especially if you turn up the treble as default this thing is very muddy for the money it's kind of to be expected if you plan on running this in soround sound just know you will need some  way to decode a modern non 2003 era  signal from digital to analog or use it as party speakers which is what I'm doing as comparison it's just as loud as my 200$ refurbished  lg 5.1 system it's not nearly as clear its muddy and lacks any real treble  but if you have a 200-400$ TV it probably sounds alot better then the TV bass is good the components soldered on the PCb are all over the place it's pretty auful heatsinks on tiny transistors that are not power amplifiers allways screem  they needed to use another solution but were 2 cheap I'm not expecting this system to last more than  9 months or so especially if you blare it I was playing it at medium volume I let it sit for 15 minutes took the screws out of the back of the sub to inspect the  pcb that heatsinck was HOT and 2 small for the rated 200 watts rms through a class ab amp which this appears to be overall it's a old design time for a new model Rockville I recommend a much beefier heatsinck better qc on your PCB more filtering somewhere hell anywhere 70db signal to noise ratio is auful and get rid of those component hookups in the back let me run my own wire you don't supply enough
Works awesome! Sub bumps! Downside might have got dropped or bounced around a few times 2 of the speakers crackle when it's up high. Other than that all n all very nice product would buy another just for 💩 and 🤭!
"I had my rock rail for eight years and now the audio is gone in it. The LED lights work perfectly, but no audio. Only one speaker is working. The rest of the speakers are not."
"I bought this product for just under $200 after taxes. And delivered on time. It sounded amazing for the first four months. Then it started to crackle and pop. At 50% Bluetooth output, and at 50% master volume it would crackle and pop so bad I would have to turn the unit off. Contacted customer service and he told me that you cannot play the Bluetooth audio more than 80% and the master volume at 80%.I explained that the issue occurred well below that volume, and we never ran the unit at 100%. Literally we never ran the unit at 100%. Also it should not be that big of an issue for a brand new unit if someone did run it at full blast….why manufacture it to blow itself up at high volumes….no warnings about full volume damage or anything. I read the manual.I got the answer of after year one year warranty runs out they do not fix the unit anymore and you cannot extend the warranty. So if you have major issues with the unit you might as well throw it away and buy another one.Or go ahead and choose another company, if I would go back I would probably buy the three-year warranty for a ridiculous amount of money, and also cost me $15 to ship it to them, with their shipping label. It should be free. Or go with another company. I’m not trying to bash anybody but we use the stereo for four months, then I had major problems, I just sent it off last week because I could not afford the $15 shipping label as I am broke. I had to save up to 200 bucks to buy the stereo in the first place….."
Lasted 2 1/2 years of lite use. Not very impressive
"For the money, this is where it's at... I noticed a question about ""true/directional sound"". It does have individual speaker inputs so if you dvd player or whatever has the output, that seems possible...First off, you may need to buy a Hdmi to aux converter like I did to play my tv audio on this.Secondly, and this was very annoying ro me... THE LED LIGHTS FOR THE SPEAKERS OTHER THAN THE BASS DO NOT TURN OFF. I resorted to covering them simply with electrical tape. They happen to be exactly the same width. It's a simple but necessary work around because they bright blue is distracting and starts to sting my eyes... It's extremely lame to render them useless but I didn't buy this for the lighting... Even though they'd be rad if they were able to be controlled because I already have Led strips up and initially thought I'd be able to use them together...This doesn't have settings for different sound quality like others I've seen... it's very straightforward but I'm okay with that.It does come with fairly long cables that are simply plugged into the bass; nothing complicated.. Very simple but helpful mounting brackets. The speakers were larger than anticipated and seem pretty durable.I'm mainly disappointed by the lack of LED controls. It sounds pretty good and clear... I figure make the LEDs controllable or drop them all together and add some settings like ""movie"", ""gaming"", ""jazz"" rock"" etc.Compared to the others on here. I'd recommend it. Just know what you're getting into."
"I use this system mainly to listen to music, watch TV and play games. The sound quality is noticeably better compared to my TV speakers and the sub really packs a punch.I've had this unit for a while now and I've noticed a lot of degradation.  I've never used the system above 45 (the top being 60) with sub at level 4 (the top being 10). Yet there is a noticeable buzzing/rattling that was not there beforeRecently, the Bluetooth stopped playing consistently. There are noticeable breaks in the music now, even with me in the room, compared to when I got the system and I could walk downstairs and around my house with no interference.There is feedback coming from something. A loud ""dudududdu"" sound (sorry 😂😭 I had no other way of describing it) comes through the system. At first the sound only happened when I left it on but now it's even happening in standby mode. I have nothing with around the recievee that I can say definitely causes interference so I'm unsure of what to do.Finally, the system is never actually off. It's always in standby. There is no switch to actually turn it off."
"Right up front, I feel like I need to be very clear, this is not a surround sound home theater system!  This is a stereo matrix unit.  I have a lot of experience with home theater, at one time owning a Marantz Pre-amp, Emotiva amplifiers, Klipsch speakers, and SVS subs (had to sell everything because we were in a budget crunch).  I know what I'm talking about and I know how to hook this stuff up and what settings to change and/or adjust.I hooked this unit up using the optical port on the back to my XBox One X.  The settings on the XBox were on stereo uncompressed, when I changed it to bitstream to force Dolby or DTS it made an unholy, god awful, digital screeching noise.  So I left it on stereo, but even with that setting, any surround unit with at least dolby pro-logic type dsp processing would still separate information from the front speakers to a mono channel in the surround speakers...this was not happening.  Center channel information played out of every speaker.  I tried using the RCA inputs and Optical output from my TV to this unit and made various setting adjustments and nothing changed...this is a stereo matrix unit.All this aside, if you're fine with a stereo matrix unit for home theater...I still can't recommend this.  The sound is horrible.  The highs seem to fade above 2KHz, and there doesn't seem to be much around 500Hz, all in all it sounds muddy.  The sub is very sloppy, not tight, not ""controlled"" at all...it booms...but it's very ugly, it doesn't go very low either.  Oh, and the EQ only works on the front USB/SD input, lol!  ...And, no, You can't go to the USB input, change the EQ, then go back to your other input.The Bluetooth input on this unit was the worst input by far, I could barely hear it, even cranked all the way up...yes, my phone was all the way up too.Y'all!  I can't even recommend this for the price!  If you want an actual surround unit, actual, discrete, 5.1, with better performance all around, get this: Vizio SB3651n-H6 5.1 Soundbar with Wireless Subwoofer!  It's $160 right now.  I bought one at Walmart last year after I sold all my other gear.  I wasn't expecting much for the price, but my god!  I bought this Rockville unit thinking I was going to replace my Vizio one......that's a hard, ""HELL NO!"" folks."
"I am writing this review ONE YEAR after purchasing this product. And BOY am I glad I waited!This is a fair stereo system. I HAVE NOT hooked it up to my TV. This was purchased as a sound system for Bluetooth/karaoke purposes. So please take this review for those purposes ONLY.This system is still running decently, FOR THE MOST PART. About five to six months after purchasing this system, the LED light went out on ONE speaker. No big deal, right? It’s only a light. About two months later, the speaker that had the LED light go out also started getting sketchy regarding sound. It would flicker in and out. Never really knew if we were gonna hear anything out of it or not. We’re still having issues with it to this day.As of today, BOTH the ports for the karaoke microphones are shot. This stereo has been used MINIMALLY for karaoke purposes. I have tested MORE THAN ONE mic to be sure it wasn’t just a faulty mic, including both a wireless mic AND a corded mic. None of my microphones have worked AT ALL. Don’t know why. The karaoke ports weren’t really used that much, so for neither of them to work is pretty bogus  :(So, long story short, if you’re looking for a stereo system (NOT JUST A SURROUND SOUND SYSTEM) that’ll last over a year, DO NOT buy this particular system. The speakers will give out on ya. If you’re looking for something for karaoke purposes, you REALLY (I can’t underscore “really” enough) don’t wanna buy this, as even the most minimal use will kill it."
"I really like this product for a few reasons, the first being the price. It was priced right it sounds good and i love the different color lights and the ability to change them and their sequence in which they are displayed. They are super light weight which make them feel cheap but it still is good quality in my opinion.The cons are minimal but important:First they are so light they movie if set up but not anchored down.Sometimes the blue tooth connectivity has to be attempted a couple of times.Lastly i would strongly recommend getting a completely full wireless version of this product, ultimately you will enjoy it more if your not having to hide cords and speaker wires!"
"Ok, I REEEAAAALLLLYYY wanted to like this system! What initially attracted me to it was the design. This is the best looking speaker design hands down! With the angelar, futuristic speaker faces and the electric blue LED lights, they just scream ""I'm going to BLOW YOUR MIND!!!""Then you power up the system and... They sound like 1983 in an empty auditorium. Like many of the reviewers and YouTube vids mention, they are loud! But hollow sounding and even worse, there are no EQ sound adjust options. Ok, you have 5 EQ settings but they are only available when streaming music from and SD card or USB drive????? (So now we're in 1998). Even if there were just basic bass & treble adjustability that would go a long way on improving the sound. Unfortunately even that was left out.My subwoofer in particular had a broken tab on the exhaust port screen so it rattled horribly when the volume went up which made the hollow sounding tracks sound even worse. Lastly, the connection options are limited to rca & a/v style connectors. No HDMI or IR so very limited on what you can connect to the system. I streamed via Bluetooth and the a/v connected my tv. Both sounded mediocre at best. I replaced this system with a similar less wattage one that was $50 cheaper but with bass/ treble controls and sound was outstanding! Especially for this price point.Pros:- loud, thumpy bass- beautiful futuristic design- LED lights- BT ConnectivityCons:- very poor sound quality- limited sound adjustability- antiquated connection options- tech support wasn't even familiar with EQ configurationWith the appearance alone I'd pay $300 for this system if it just had basic modern sound adjustability! So much potential wasted."
Looks nice but everything feels cheap and doesn’t get very loud sounds ok save you’re money get something name brand.
"I definitely wanted to wait till I had this thing for over a year until I wrote my review.. and boy is it worth it LOL. The first time I had to send it in was close to the time that the warranty was about to expire.. for some reason there was a loud humming noise, and it would get extremely hot on the back. There was also a tear inside the netting that is in the subwoofer which created a rattle. After having to contact tech support for quite some time, and even getting to the point where I took the back of the stereo apart myself found the piece that I could smell and feel burning inside of it, and take a picture of it and send it to them to directly tell them what they needed to fix. (Mind you I have no stereo experience other than hitting the play button). After I had to pay shipping to send it to them and waiting a few weeks (they did however send me a discounted UPS label), it came back and seemed to be okay (other than where you could tell that they did a sloppy job at repairing the nutting inside of the subwoofer herself, it almost looks as if they use something to try and ""melt"" it back together.... Until I noticed that one out of the ports was not working on the back of the stereo which would prevent one of the surround sound speakers from producing audio. Once again I had to contact tech support, buy a shipping label, and send it out. A few weeks later, it returns and I haven't had an issue with a since, and I sure hope I don't considering my warranty has expired lol"
"Well now let me tell you about this pos.. I got this to put out in my garage. When I got it looked ok cheap but ok going in garage so didn’t care to much. When I get it set up and all the speakers plugged in there was one speaker that did work. Wasn’t really happy instead of saying something and sending it back I took the front cover off pulled out the speaker and found the speaker wasn’t connected wire anymore I re Soldered it worked fine after that. Was surprised that it sounded like it did. Wasn’t spending a lot for something to put in my garage that’s going to get dirty from work I do. Then things starting happening. It would change inputs on it own, would change radio channels on its own would turn off on its own. There isn’t anything around it that would inter fear with it I have a big shop internet sucks in there. I would go out to do some work in the morning and radio would be on. It really was like someone hiding in a corner with a remote messing with me. Iv had to rest it a few time turn the power off a couple time and unplugged it a couple time to make it work. I turned the power off on it the other night so it wouldn’t come on on its own and went out turn power on now it won’t come on at all. Iv opened it up see if anything got unplugged inside and found nothing. Still not working at all. With it having a mind of its own Iv gotten so P off at it trying to work and listen to Music and would change or turn off couple times I wanted to take it and smash it in to pieces. Don’t by it. I’m tired of all this new stuff focusing on putting colored light on everything I want a decent sounding radio in my garage don’t care about lights and that seams to be what everyone focuses on anymore is the lights.. now I’m f cuz it’s way to late to send it back"
"First off, and most important... it is not surround sound 5.1. It isnt even stereo 2.0. It is in fact a mono amplifier that has separate volume controls for each speaker. The exact same sound comes out of all 5 speakers. If you disconnect one of the RCA cables you should loose one side of the sound. Instead, you still get the same sound from all 5 speakers. Ive tried it with both RCA cables and optical cable with the same results. Ive also tried it with 4 different audio sources to no avail.  Another major problem is the power supply! It has a really nasty 60 Hz hum... no filtering at all. Even with the volume down to zero (on both the amp and the source) it has a hum that is very annoying (about 25db). To make matters worse, when you first turn the amp on from the rear switch the unit is in standby mode... and thats when the hum is supper loud (about 60db). Its loud enough that it makes my dog run away! For less than $1 they could have added a pi filter to solve this.  The description says that this unit has 5 EQ pre-sets. No it dosent... your stuck with factory settings.  Then we come to customer service... THERE IS NONE. I phoned 3 times and emailed twice to see if I was doing something wrong as far as the 5.1 surround, and how to change the EQ pre-sets. All my efforts were ignored by the company. This leads me to believe that they know this unit dosent do what the claim, or they just dont care!  The only thing I can see this unit being good for is if you like to BlueTooth music from your phone and blast it to impress your friends.  So... if what you are looking for is a good sounding surround sound unit for home theater I would definitely look elsewhere. This aint it...!"
"I dont write reviews.  Unless, on the RARE occasion a product has made me emotional on either specturm. This is one of the worst products i have ever ordered.  Not only is the sound unpar but the entire product suffers from defects.  I cant get in FM in a reliable form, this was out of the box.  Dont care right, only wnat to BT to my alexa..... this product has constant problems with that.  To be honest this product i now have to pay to get rid of.  Completely garbage.  Spend the extra cash get a real system, let me learn this lesson for you."
"I have only had this HTS56 for a week now but here it is so far; I have it hooked up to my computer through a Toslink, I do not get true 5.1 surround. Center, subwoofer seems to work just fine but the left and right channels are well... left and right - both the front and back right play together same with the left on numerous audio tests. On mine the left channel and right channel had to be switched as if the printed identification on the subwoofer unit was misprinted backwards. That might be the Toslink so I am ordering 3.5 plugs to RCA to see if that might fix the issue of both the front and back speakers playing together. For that I take a star off. I take another star off for how long it took to get to me... now I understand the problems with shipping, xmas time and covid but not getting it here when they said it would be delivered and then weeks go by with no updates... yeah lost star."
I was happy with the sound.  Packed a pretty powerful punch. 2 issues:  1 - Optical connection was hit and miss.... felt loose for connection and if it was a little off it would take some adjustments in pointing laser properly (then don't touch it)  I wish this unit would have lasted more than 3 years.  Bought it Nov. 2020.  3 years and 2 months a buzzing sound took over in the sub.  I am glad I didn't purchase the 3 year warranty plan.  Maybe I am too old school but I feel we should be able to buy electronic products that can last longer.
The product was ok not to my liking I won’t purchase anything use no more it’s a waste of money!
"Never actually got the chance to listen to this system as after I unpacked everything, I noticed speakers have no mounting brackets or at least a hole in the back to mount on the wall. Item one in set-up states that brackets are preinstalled on the back of them. No they are not. They do come with plastic brackets and extremely tiny screws where you would drill into the back of the speakers. No thanks."
"Very cheap feeling and lightweight speakers, I had my doubts as soon as I opened the box, but I thought hey maybe what they saved in materials they put into the drivers. But no. The subwoofer seems like it should have decent oomph to it based on the size and weight but it doesn’t do much. I turned the balance down on all the speakers and all the way up on the sub to get it it to a decent thump. The satellites sound incredibly tinnny and weak.Definitely not true 5.1 either. It sound like each speaker is playing the exact same thing.Better off getting a soundbar with a subwoofer at this price point. I don’t think 5.1 speakers under $500 will be able to match what a decent soundbar can do."
I can't get it to work and I have tried everything. And just thinking about getting another system because this one's not working I did the optical cord I did the Bluetooth I can't get a sound of
"I love this unit, a replacement for my Pioneer that did not work with this tv, and  was ready to send it back.  It was not compatible with my TCL TV.  After numerous emails with the seller, contact with Rockville and TCL, it is working.  How? My computer speakers did work with the earphones jack, so I found a similar one on Amazon with rca.  (The two converters I purchased for the TCL did not work with this unit). Now both the Pioneer and Rockville work.  No longer needed it, but kept it for Bluetooth.  Also, I spent over $35 for cables and converters, and suggest purchasing it from a seller  that provides  assistance beyond the return deadline, who advertise the limitations of their product.

"I had to replace my old RCA 1000 watt system which was almost 7 years old, with the silver metal ends which broke off. I would've bought another one, but it's not made anymore, so I had to make do with this one. At 1000 watts, I've had two noise complaints in my apartment building. Too bad the system wasn't 2000 watts or more, or I'd have to move to the next county! Totally satisfied with my new system!*UPDATE*I gave a 5 star review at first, but now I had to downgrade to 1 star. Even though it is an awesome system, there's a MAJOR flaw: the subwoofer breaks down and stops working and the optical port gets stripped so it won't hold the cord in place. I bought my system over a year and a half ago, January 2023. The sounds became muffled and distorted. I turned off the main power switch in hopes that it would do a reset, but nothing worked. The system still lights up; just no sound, so the speaker is gone. The one-year warranty expired, so I'll have to buy another system. The Rockville website has parts available, but I'm not trying to hassle myself to fix it. I'm not going to buy this model, but another Rockville model in hopes it'll do much better than this one."
"first off I was very displeased with how long it took to get it to me I ordered it on February 26th and it ended up taking them almost 2 weeks to get it to me it stayed in Bloomington California since February 28th and I had difficulties with customer service both with Amazon and audiosave on trying to figure out the solution to where it was and I just got it today March 13 2021 and I'm also not very pleased with the sound quality of the surround speakers they look generic and they look like they could break very easily they're not a rubber type speaker they're more of a paper speaker  the subwoofer is okay it's got some good bass to it that's about the only good thing about this system only goes to 60 on volume not what I was expecting for 1,000 watt stereo system so yeah I'm not a very pleased customer with this product it's okay it'll do but I would not be recommend this system to any of my friends or family it's not worth the $164 and the time it took to get it to me and Amazon customer service was supposed to call me on Friday March 12th to figure out the solution to the problem and they never got in contact with me to try and work out a refund or something like that so yeah not very pleased I'm a thumbs down on this product."
"The sound quality is there and the price point is reasonable.  However, I can only rate this 2 stars at the very most because of one issue.  To have access to all of the features, YOU MUST HAVE A WORKING REMOTE which should have come with the system.  So here’s what happened.Ordered it.It arrived.Unboxed and set up.Remote doesn’t work.  So I can’t control the radio, individual speaker volume (only master) and other necessary components.I emailed the address on the warranty card.  NO RESPONSE.I called the number on the warranty card.  NO RESPONSE.I emailed through Amazon, and the response I got was they were on backorder.Three months later, STILL no remote.  Emailed again and they got one sent.Got a 2nd remote, DOESN’T WORK, there are parts rattling around inside and cracked to the point where it looks like a baby used it as a teething ring.The only reason I didn’t give this 1 star is because I found a 3rd party remote programmer that was able to get me a programmed 3rd party remote that was able to use most of the features.So… it sounds good, but based on this experience, I will definitely consider other manufacturers if I ever decide to move from 5.1 to 7.1."
"Unfortunately and compare to the Sony BDV 3100 I've had for 6 years, rated the same, this sound system doesn't hold up. The RCA input is definitely a point of failure for this device. I bought the first one, it failed, sent it back, received a new one and the same issue happened. So i solder the inputs myself which then worked fine. But now since i did it myself, im sure i voided the warranty. So make sure you know what you're doing, by this item if it's for the bare minimum you're using it for. IF you want true surround sound, but an old system. I recommend the Sony BVD 3100 which came out years ago. Still holds better than this device"
"Horrible! Once again I made a mistake by buying stereo stuff online. The only way is to hear it first in the store. I haven't even tried this with a movie or TV for surround sound, I didn't bother, it's already back in the box to be returned. Not at all what is described here. All of the very in-depth details and the majority of reviews made it seem way more (and better) than it is. I connected with Bluetooth and played a few songs, tried tweaking the minimal settings with the remote and equilizer and sound settings on my phone. Then tried on my Samsung phone, which has the awesome sound settings for music including Dolby Atmos, and didn't matter, the music sounded basically the same. The bass does kick up pretty high but each unit you go up/down is a dramatic difference.. there's no happy medium and once it gets passed a certain level it's too much and sounds, for lack of a better word, ghetto. (Lol) and LOL is basically it. I'm LOL-ing at myself for buying this. I mean you can tell by the pics how it's going to sound. I just had a little optimism that day and loved the price and the reviews sold me. But they are LIES ALL LIES!! LOL Hope this helps someone in the future like me. I usually don't write reviews but I had to for this one. Don't be deceived (judge it by the way it looks-- CHEAP) I really wanted a good surround sound system but I think I'm gonna go with the jk onyx studio 6 Bluetooth speaker. It's only 1 speaker and only $50 more and completely annihilates these speakers and then performs a badass fatality on them. FATALITY! (for the uncool, it's Mortal Kombat yo)"
"It quit working after few weeks after I ran speaker wire through the wall, the left channel quit working and I just wanted to do a recover exchange but, this company wanted everything back., and I sent this to Amazon for review it was ordered on the 8th got here by the 15 sent it back, and I wanted a refund then but, rock ville said that the window was closed for return and they sent me a brand new one. That I didn't want, so if you can send me a brand new one, why couldn't I have a refund. It took me a day to run wires through the wall. And that long to take them out,"
"I paid $150 for it and wouldn't pay any more. I like it for the price. The people that give it five stars and compare it to their $2000 systems either have lost their hearing, or need to replace their old pricy systems. The power mostly comes from the subwoofer and not much of it is distributed to the other 5 speakers, which gives it solid clean bass (it doesn't make it loud just because it shakes your drywall), but muddy, low mids and low distorted highs. The speakers sound cheap. The volume goes from 0 to 60, and only starts getting loud at 45, and distorted at 55. The Bluetooth will cut off or 'skip' if the phone is blocked by even your hand or if you're navigating your phone, phone must be still and unblocked for uninterrupted play time. It's not a bad system, it's perfect for $150. But no, it's NOT 1000 watts..Sounds more like 250-300 watts."
I love Rockville products  but this is the second item I'm not happy  with..one of my surround speakers was not playing. I didn't  want a refund because  I got this  item for the superbowl. So with that being said I inquired could  I just return  the non playing  speaker but I was told I have to  return  EVERYTHING  in its original  packaging. I didn't want  to do this because I'm not sure if I would  had gotten my item  back in timeI wished  they had individual pieces  I could  buy just buy for situations  like this  but o well....
"I've had this set up for 3 weeks. The sound isn't too bad but the remote totally sucks. You have to point the remote directly at the power box and can't bounce it off walls or anything else. I have a 2 person bean bag laying in the middle of the room so when sitting in my recliner, I have to lift my arm way up in the air to get a direct line of sight for the remote since the power box is sitting on the floor directly under the TV. Any little deviation loses connection and the remote won't work. Also after 3 weeks, the front face of the power box fell off. The screws were still attached to the front face and the MDF board that the screws went through had broken all around them because MDF board is garbage and not strong at all! I now have the front face zip-tied to the power box so it won't continue to fall off since I'm not paying to send it back or wait weeks/months for a replacement. You also can't adjust the bass or treble like the other 2 Rockville systems I have. This is extremely dissapointing because Rockville was always known for quality but now it's just cheap crap. Also, the radio scans in all kinds of static/bleed overs from stations so you have to go through way too many stations of noise to find real stations. They also need to include an optical plug so you don't have to buy all sorts of adaptors and cables to connect your TV with good sound. Again, this is on the other Rockville system I have but that one isn't a surround sound system."
"When the speakers have audio run through them, they sound good.  However, they have large boxes for no reason...  and worst of all, when not in use they have a loud hum.  It's audible from the door to the room.  Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.  It's on an optical input, it's got no other wires / cords near the speaker wire to the center speaker, and yet center hums the loudest.  All of the speakers hum some.  Extremely annoying.  This is setup on one of the comps in my office, and now I get an annoying hum in the background when using any other comp in the room."
"Do not buy this garbage. It should work because it's new, but Rockville and there customer service sucks. They don't make quality products and they don't help there customers. There a bunch of crooks trying to scam people into buying garbage."
"I wish I had read all the comments before I purchased this system.I wanted a true surround system for watching movies.  At first I was delighted with the really great sound from these speakers.  The subwoofer is great and each speaker can be controlled individually.When I started watching movies, however, I noticed that the true Dolby 5.1 sound experience I was expecting was not there.  A sound from the source which is designed for an individual speaker is spread out over others.  I kept hearing dialog from the movie over the rear surround speakers.  I thought I had done something wrong until I read a few comments here.Bottom line, the sound from this unit, especially for the price is excellent.  My problem was the true Dolby surround experience I was expecting was totally disappointing."
"The system can definitely go loud that’s not a question. Easy enough to install and overall isn’t bad especially for the price. However, if you’re looking for a real home theatre system (crisp surround sound) this isn’t it. Only negatives: I got the receiver and there is no spot for an HDMI or optical cable (they did make an updated version that has an optical cable port, I’m not happy they sent me the old version) There is no sound adjustment options other than raising/lowering volume (the biggest flaw in my opinion) The remote control frequency mixes with my ROKU TV so when I turn the volume up it turns off my tv (very annoying)Other than that it does the basic job. I’d recommend this more for an outdoor patio, garage, bedroom, etc but not your main living room"
"Buyer Beware!! The Rockville 5 in 1 home theater system has a very misleading advertisement! When reading the description a person would be led to believe that it is a Stereo Surround Sound System. On the contrary, you may be 'Surrounded by Sound,' but it is Not Stereo Surround Sound. You'll hear the same sound through all 5 speakers! Keyword, look for DOLBY! Their play on words in advertising it are very misleadingly which to my husband & I is false advertisement! When we inquired to others concerning this system, thinking we were missing something or doing something wrong, eventually we discovered we weren't. Sadly, there are customers out there defending the system saying it is surround sound. I'm sorry, but they are completely mistaken. We told the guy who worked for the company our grievancess'. And, he admitted the wording was misleading and he was going to try to get that fixed. He said Dolby was very expensive & again acknowledge that it wasn't true surround!  We do not know if they have actually changed the misrepresentation or not. They emailed a free shipping label to return to moon system back to them . After packing everything up in the original boxes and taking to FedEx location, eventually our refund reflected on our card. At least they were decent about that. Oh, and the remote didn't function properly. When we muted it, it changed the Channel on the T.V.  We read other reviews after this bad experience and found we weren't the only one's. Good Luck & Happy Shopping!"
In a week the system started acting up. Sound going in and out base rattling ect. Took it to a professional and he took it apart and found that most of the solder joints had little to no solder at all.  He then resoldered the joints and it fixed every problem.  I would pay extra to get something with better quality prior to buying this again.
"Well, I finally got my Rockville surround system all connected and in working order. It took me a little while to get ALL of the speakers working at the same time, but Rockvilles customer support team ended up walkin me through how to set them up via email. While it wasnt the smoothest or timely customer support I have ever received, it was successful all the same. Last nights episode 3 of Game of Thrones, was our first opportunity to really see what the speakers had, and thats exactly what we did! The battle scene was amazing, the surround sound truly made it feel like we were on the battle field next to Jon Snow and Co. I would definitely recommend this system, if you're looking to stay under $150."
"It was great at first. Loved the sound used it everyday for 3 month. One day turned it on, just static. Now it doesn't work at all. JUNK"
"The remote was only partially functional. I replaced my old system which became frustrating when the volume up and down would not work on the remote. I bought this brand new system, only to receive it with a remote with a non-working up and down volume! I think there are other instances of this reported online. I tried calling them for support - they did not call back within 24 hours as promised. Long story short I was given the choice of shipping the entire unit back and waiting for a new one, or just waiting for a new remote, possibly for weeks! A defect in a product (particularly a known issue) should be cured immediately. Apparently, this company does not believe the same way."
"The sound system was fine on its own until it wasn't. I bought it about 3 years ago and it worked flawlessly until one day it didn't. I walked into the living room and heard a bad ground noise coming from the subwoofer. I turned the unit off, and the next morning when I turned it back on it had no sound. All the lights came on, but no sound was coming out of it. I checked to see if there was a fuse I could replace... nope.TL;DR - Randomly died and has no fuse to replace. Best advice, get a unit that lets you replace the fuse."
It worked great for the first couple months then started randomly cutting out on separate speakers. Clean connections and stock settings... sounds great but not for a couple months of quality use for the price
"The sound is amazing, but all the speaker cables are 1 to 2 feet short than what is advertised and also stated in the product manual. Tried to contact ""Rockville"" for either some patch cables or at least a partial refund. Have not heard from them since sending them an email. If they were the correct length, I wouldn't have a problem. I ended up having to shell out more money to go buy several RCA cables to make up the difference in the length. Hopefully, they will be capable of powering on the LED lights in the speakers!"
"Larger than expected and that wasn't a problem.  The bass is amazing.  The high end sucks, mainly due to the speakers.  My left front speaker gets a horrible noise when treble is being received.  It's like it has a busted speaker straight from the manufacturer.  I would love to give this system 4 stars, but that one speaker grates my very last nerve.  I didn't try to return or have replaced as I don't feel like the hassle.  Would be nice to get something that works properly on first try.  I hope the manufacturer reads this and upgrades/changes to another supplier of speakers and/or improves QA."
"it's a great STEREO that surrounds you.  NOT a SURROUND SOUND system. It's just LEFT and RIGHT sound, if in the movie there is sound behind and left it will only register on the speakers as LEFT speakers front AND back.  Anyway my front center speaker blew out and sometimes the Bass speaker/receiver heats up and starts to glitch out.  Now it's just paper weight, lasted one year, I might rip it apart to use the magnets for nails and screws in the garage.  People read everything before buying, marketing is real slick, like Snakes.  I hope this company reads it, and mock me by saying ""we are really sorry you are unsatisfied with our product... blah blah blah.""  mock and laugh you already have my money."
Ok for the price its loud and if u have an eq app that helps. But the 5 speakers that make up the surround sound are super cheap. They have a plastic sound instead of mid range. The balance between the speakers is off balance. Fronts are so loud while rear speakers have very little sound. Center speaker hits and misses. Meaning one song to loud next song barely there. The volume control for each speaker does little. The kids love the leds. Bluetooth works good. The remote control barely works. Better aim it just right. Tried 3 sets of new batteries no difference. The 8” sub is under tons of stress and does distort randomly. So longevity doesn’t seem like its gonna survive. The surround sound works partially. I use the barber shop sound test. Its not headphones there is separation. Very weak. Its not capable of sitting in the middle of the room and hearing him move all around me. That means the chip is cheap. If you like music this system is very difficult to get even close. If its just back ground noise buy it.
"When it worked, this was a good product, however, I resent the short life span of the product and the general ""disposable"" mindset with products that push for greater consumption. When I ordered a part to fix this, it was beyond my skill set to replace as the amp board connection were all glued which meant breaking it to fix it. When I brought it to an electrician - they quoted me $150 min to touch it. Not worth it."
Not sure if it’s a faulty product or a common issue but it makes a weird popping noise every 10-20 seconds which sucks because the product is otherwise perfect.
"I was super excited about the 1000w as advertised.  But I am overall disappointed about how loud I have to turn it up to actually hear the voices in a movie.  The surround sound speakers are not as loud as they are bulky.  And the subwoofer has a rattle in itself.  One of the surround sound speakers had the mandatory decorative blue lights go out in it already.  The bass does sound good though, better if it didn't rattle."
"Now don't get me wrong, the sound is astounding. However this system doesn't seem to support surround sound for my particular setup. I own a 4k LG Television with bluetooth support. Now this sound system supports bluetooth and was the reason I made the purchess expecting bluetooth surround sound, unfortunatly while connected via bluetooth I am only provided stereo sound output. This makes the second surround sound system I've owned that didn't provide true surround sound while gaming. That said. The sound alone is well worth the buy, if you do not mind standard stereo sound."
"While this seed has great sound it severely lashings when it comes to Interfacing with modern electronics. Namely smart tv's. It only has rca jacks. There is no optical Jack, and no HD Jack,. The set cannot be programmed inn to be used by your primary cable or satellite dish remote so took will always have to use the second remote to adjust volume and on off control. Three surround system does however heaves great sound and extra loud volume. It is a good set if you don't mind the few draw backs that come with it. Overall it's a good set"
"I like the product.. Sounds good for the price. Only disappointed with the LED features.. The head unit has RGB LED but you can only do the EQ feature on blue, the rest of the settings rotate through colors.. Why not make it able to fluctuate to music on green? Or any other color? Also none of the other speakers change color... It's blue or off.. As if rgb light strips are that expensive these days. I feel like they went the extra cheap road with this system and makes me worry about the future..."
"This product is a good quality for the price. It does not have the EQ like it says but instead has separate volume control for each speaker. The bass is great, but the mids and tweets are hardly there. It's BT is the easiest to deal with like they say. The wires are just long enough for what I need them to be. Over all it is a great deal for the price and a lot better than the LG I had."
System looks pretty good with the lights and speaker set up.  Appearance aside when playing music through phone it sounds pretty good however when connected to TV for watching movies or playing games it sucks.  There is a constant hum that I can't get to go away.  I tried 2 new and different audio optical cords.  Still there.  Tried hooking to another TV same problem.  So it has to be the system itself.  Got a smaller 2.1 sound system that doesn't have a hum when it is connected.
This is way too big!  It took up way more room then it needed to.
"Great system! Fedex delivery was horrible but that’s not on these folks. Took a long time to get it and fedex said the tried to deliver it but no one was home- we were outside putting up Christmas lights during the time they claimed they attempted a delivery. System was easy to assemble and great quality! If you don’t mind waiting for fedex to get their crap together, worth the price"
"First of all, contrary to what other reviewers say, these are 5.1, but it certainly matters how you hook it up. I have this configured in the ""DVD"" setting on the back, which is 5.1, into my PC.  The direction sound works just fine, that's not the issue with these. The issue is, music, effects, vocals--sound in general--coming from these speakers sounds as if it is coming from a hollow box, far away.  Bass is loud, but not full.  No proper bass balancing is happening/playing when sound is coming from the satellite speakers, it's as if they're not synchronized. No amount of balancing changes this. LEDs are generally, cool, though I'd like to be able to turn them off without having to unplug them. The remote is nice, and the length of the wires is great for my office.  The speakers certainly can get loud, but it's hollow, tinny--not full, and the audio out of them is just sub par for the price.EDIT:Just under 3 years of use and the speakers have begun to emit a very loud buzzing sound that will not go away. They are now unusable. Changing to 1 star, as these things have just been junk from start to finish."
"This does not have the highest quality booming sound that some might be looking for, but if you're on a budget this is great. We can't seem to get it to connect directly to our TV which is kind of a bummer but works through our XBox."
Where the fudge errrooooni is my speaker set up dog. I spent almost $200 to get circle jerked forgetting my password and logging into my Amazon account 7 times to check up on where the heck was this John. It probably got destroyed in shipping or something idk but ya. This blows. Anyway I'll listen to my amazon Elena for now that my girlfriend bought me for my birthday that has sweet as sugar baby yoga ears on it. Anyway got to blast. Enjoy your $200. It's probably all spent on butter fingers by now but I think this purchase taught me a life lesson. The lesson is to enjoy what you have and to not spend money on dumb items. Anyway. When these puppies do come in in a month I'm probably gonna spend at least 4 days setting it all up and enjoy the for shizzzz out of them. But for now ... we wait. You know what. I think I'm gonna do something productive today. Excuse me ladies and gents of the Internet but I have a plane to catch. And by plane. I mean train. And by train. I mean my own car.
Would be 5 stars because It has great sound with lots of bass. But the wires for the speakers are way too short. I have a small living room and the wires still aren't long enough. Especially on the center speaker and front left and front right speaker. If I hang them on the wall they are about 6-10 ft too short and can't be hooked up. Because of this I might need to return it and go with something else
I do not think it is a true 1000w system. The sound is still decent but I have had 800w systems sound better.
"Overall the unit does as advertised, my wife wanted it for Karaoke. Bower after hooking it all up, while the volume was high, the overall sound quality wasn’t. Not true 5.1 surround and sounded like everything was in a box. Not bad for the money, just not what we wanted quality wise."
"Well for starters, i was opening the package and when I pulled one speaker out there was and still is a broken piece of something inside of it. I probably should have emailed and mentioned it but honestly I have a feeling it would have just been a huge hassle. The sound quality is atrocious. I feel like I’m using seashells as speakers. There’s no highs whatsoever. But hey, what can ya expect for something so cheap. Would I recommend it for most use? Nah. Wouldn’t even recommend it for karaoke. I used it for maybe half an hour when I first got it and now it just sits there. So yeah, if you’re looking for something quick cheap and you could care less what it sounds like, then I’d go for it. Otherwise don’t bother... you’ll hate yourself after."
I bought a model that was supposed to have optical hook up it showed it in the picture on the website the one they sent me did not have optical. The return was terrible I took pictures send it to them had to re-wrap it all back up send it to them they had to inspect it and then send me the new model which took way too long they did pay for the shipping I was expecting it to shut off with my TVThrough the optical cable like my Sound bar did so you Control it with one remote like the TV remote on the unit is off it has two red flashing flashes on the front of it which is very annoying sound pretty awesome other than that stuff I mentioned
"The is a decent system for the garage or possibly the kid's room. One of the things I plan to do is to add some speakers I have in storage to replace the highs. the sound is not acceptable.  Don't get me wrong, I could have returned the system, it's just that, 1000 watts for what I paid ($85. It dropped one day) was good enough to keep."
"My first surround sound system worked without issue for over 10 yrs.  This Rockville only lasted 1 yr 11 months, not even 2 full years!  Don't waste your money.  Based on the short lifespan it's only worth about $50."
I didn't receive the EKM cable and the remote control was broken
Good for the money.
"This is the system to get if you want to upset your neighbors with booming bass. However, the other 5 high & mid speakers have very poor quality for a system in this price range. You'll also need a 2.1/5.1 decoder, a handful of ground loop isolators and as mentioned, good speakers. Though the remote has the speaker volume adjustments, the bass is always too loud and any dialog in the movie is hard to hear. This does not have optic input but only rca inputs, with an input for each speaker. Added my own old klm speakers for quality sound, added a 5.1 decoder and 3 ground loop isolators to get good sound. If I put a volume rheostat on the bass input it could be a good system. But @ over 300 bucks to get it to make quality sound, I would not recommend."
Average sound quality
Overall a good system for the buck. It takes time to adjust the speakers to eliminate the echo but once you do its pretty decent. Sound quality is alot better then the stock speaker on my 75 inch Samsung TV. I needed and wanted more power and thus system provided it. For the price it is a good value. Id recommend
"I purchased this product for my husband for Christmas. Upon opening this, he was very unhappy with it. WIRES!! WAY TOO MANY WIRES!!! It wasn't worth the time to even put all of this together. Not to mention the wires weren't long enough so we would have had to use extension cords to make things work! Might be ""okay"" for a bedroom. The worst part is the SELLER of this product!!!! We placed everything back into the original box & ready to ship back. BUT...the Seller denied my Return!! Saying it was past the period of Returning. Ummm....Christmas day was just 4 days ago, so how can that be!?!? Now I'm stuck with this system that is nothing at all like we expected & this Seller won't allow us to return! Very, very poor Customer Service!! So if you're buying this product, make sure you plan on it being a permanent purchase!! All of the years buying from Amazon & I have never had an issue with a return until now. Very unhappy Customer!!!!"
Nice system but Bluetooth connecting is very complicated and tough. It disconnects by itself and reconnecting is tough
I literally hardly ever use this because it isn't compatible with any streaming services. It comes across as static. I'm totally disgusted with the experience of buying this.
"We love the speakers and audio quality from this set. It's perfect for our bedroom. The only problem is that the optical cable plugin blew after 1 week. Now we can no longer use it for television sound. It is still absolutely awesome for Bluetooth and RCA aux sound, however."
I recently got hts56 it sounds ok not quite as loud as it was made out to be however still gd for the price the problem with this is if you turn it up the receiver moves all over the place and that's because bass is only on one side in the future if you design another system like this either put bass on both sides or make bass connect by itself so receiver won't move to one side.
"First thing for the money this system goes above and beyond my expectations. I'm very satisfied with the performance. It takes a minute to figure out how to control settings but not rocket science. Now the only downside is straight out of box one of the rear speakers does not work at all, I've tried plugging it into another spot still no sound at all. That's the reason for 3 stars is not fully functional but otherwise solid unit"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I received a faulty unit. We'll see if they give me a replacement or refund. If I get a refund I will NOT be purchasing this again and will go with a higher quality (more expensive) one. If I get a replacement unit, I'll follow up in this review to say whether my impression of this product improves at all.As of now, I DO NOT recommend purchasing. They didn't replace this because I had bought it before moving into a new house with a big living room that I planned to use for movies. By the time I was ready to unpack this and install it, I was past the Amazon return date and the seller wouldn't replace the faulty unit.The unit was completely faulty out of the box. I am just now finally ready to trash the whole thing years later, because of how frustrating it is to just throw $150 away."
I was terribly disappointed because the description indicates the unit is wireless and it is not. I did not have time to return it because my event was scheduled for two days after the arrival of the unit.
For the momey its great a little out dated. The only way I could get my tv to work on it is through aux I had to use a rca to 3.5mm Jack converter and got lucky that I can make my tv direct all of is sound though the 3.5mm Jack most newer tv have done away with the 3.5mm jack so I would look in to that before buying it
"The overall sound quality is pretty good, and this system will work for now, but the small speakers are made of lightweight plastic and I expected better quality materials for the price. There were no instructions for setting up the system, cable options, or the remote and no reference to a website for instructions. I gave this as a gift for Christmas and was disappointed it was not more user friendly"
Great sound if you want the same sound out of all the speakers. Says 5.1 Channel Home Theater System but that is not true no surround Sound at all threw the aux  or Bluetooth like the the Video says no matter  which source bummer since that is why i bought it the video should be corrected. how ever great sound but way over priced for what you get
"Everything looks fine but, the remote, controls my tv too and makes big mess, I am not able to use the remote control.For example u use the volume up button on the remote for the speaker, it works on speaker and at the same time turn on the tv too."
The optical does not work with my 75-inch tv(I get static and nothing else(using a high-end optical cable). Also can not connect to Alexa. great sound nonetheless through my phone. I wouldn't use this system if you are wanting high-end sound. Great for the money for your he/she shed or man/woman cave.
"DO NOT BUY IF YOU DON'T WANNA BE DISAPPOINTED. This product is garbage, the seller is garbage. 30 days after return and I still have to fight with Amazon for them to get my refund. Please take my advice and DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY."
The soundbar was not compatible with my tv.
The soundbar and subwoofer will not properly pair. The audio is choppy. Trouble shooting did not work and you are unable to reach the company. Would not recommend.
"This sound bar system is okay for the price, but there are a few drawbacks. The sound codec support it advertises is clearly an off-brand version, and it doesn’t handle the audio format for some movies, resulting in no sound. It’s a bit disappointing, especially when watching content with higher-quality audio.I’ve also had some issues with the ARC connection. Sometimes, the sound bar doesn’t sync properly with the TV, and I have to manually switch the input or power cycle the system to get it working again. It’s not a deal-breaker, but it does get frustrating when you just want things to work smoothly.Overall, it’s decent if you’re looking for a budget-friendly option and don’t mind some compromises. It works well enough for basic TV watching, but don’t expect premium sound quality or seamless functionality."
"This item worked great for 2 months and then quit working. It was difficult to set up for me because the subwoofer did not come auto synced like the instructions said. So i had to manually sync it. Once synced it worked well through ARC (that is all i used it for). Approximately 2 months later, the subwoofer and 2 back speakers stopped working and the LED status on the soundbar itself stopped working. I tried everything i could think of to try and reset as well as used the manual with no luck. I cannot recommend this to anyone at this point."
I have yet to get this put together for use. The day a 17 year old can't figure it out troubles me. I think at times instructions aren't as clear as they should be. I'm going to work on it more and see if I can figure it out myself. I know that I'm not technology savvy so I am not thrilled about having to connect it to my television. I have to come back with a review for the sound.
Works when it wants to. Junk
"The Bose Bass module 700 sounds like the speakers in it are loose or broken, sounds distorted"
"The Bluetooth doesn't work. Tried on several devices with Bluetooth 4.0 - 5.0 nothing can find Poseidon D70. Some of the AVR cables are loose and the speakers only work if held at the right angle/pressure. Very disappointed. To add, the instruction manual was in poor condition leading me to believe that this was a returned unit."
"I bought this unit after seeing several reviews and because I also purchased a Sony OLED TV. There are things to like about this AVR but it is the starter unit. Its price has been reduced to an attractive price. However as I have an Audiophile grade set of speakers that are extremely sensitive this unit produced significant hum in both my large L, C, R speakers and even the surrounds.  Additionally the ""sound"" was not as full as I am used to and am seeking.  So regretfully, I just returned the unit and have replaced it with a ONKYO RZ 50, which immediately out of the box is a keeper. I did like the simplicity of the Sony  calibration and was satisfied with the results.  The Dirac that comes with the Onkyo is a little more work but is also superior in its results. If you are a Sony person, the ES line would be your best bet, though the equal to the RZ 50 would cost $900.00 more at this point in time."
"I have been using Sony for very long time and this is my first negative review for a Sony product. Surely the experience with this product will change my perspective on Sony. I will think hard to buy another Sony product from now.My first unit had many issues. It shutdown itself multiple times without a reason. I doesn't turn-on/off automatically on the game port while it works with mediabox port. It bangs sometimes when it turns on. Sometimes it changes the connection to tv by itself.I contacted Sony customer support and followed their instruction, such as resetting the unit but it didn't work. The experience was not pleasant because I felt that they were trying to find 'my fault'. Eventually they agreed to take the unit. I shipped the unit in Nov'23. They tried to fix it but couldn't. So they sent a new unit. It took over 1.5mo.For 20 days with the new unit, it turned off itself 3 times. Yesterday, it became totally unresponsive. I couldn't turn it off and had to unplug its power. After reboot, there was no sound. So I had to unplug the power again multiple times before making it work.I contacted Sony for a refund because I don't have any confidence on this product but they refused and asked to send the unit back for a repair. I already tried two units and how I can be sure that the third one will work, but I have no choice but taking another round of the repair. I really hope that it works this time."
"(The attached photo was with the previous receiver)I bought this unit in March and have tried intermittently to make it work with the rest of my stuff, finally halfway succeeding last month.  My wife doesn't like having to push buttons after I've gone to bed, so she must stick with our familiar TiVo DVR for watching late TV.  When I do want to use the ""big speakers"", It takes several buttons to turn on this receiver to make anything happen; sometimes the Sony remote has to be punched hard several times to select the TV input.  So far I can access the TV, (along with using the TiVo remote), one BluRay player, and one 4K player.  I have never been able to access the speaker setup screen to finish the installation so I don't know if the Atmos & surround stuff works or not.  Additionally, one or two times per day the receiver turns on by itself and displays ""CAST""; I have never found out what that means or how to make it stop.  I tried twice to call Sony support, but after several robot answering machines that only wasted my time and a message: ""we are experiencing long wait times .."", I just gave up.  Another thing is the remote itself - I simply don't like it compared to others I've used.  At this point I'm about ready to toss this thing and get another brand, but I'll try a few more times to make it work.  I'm too old to comfortably re-do all that stuff."
"Unlike all the 5-star Vine reviewers who got the STR-AN1000 for free, I actually paid for it. I have yet to try it with Atmos speakers, but so far it is a letdown.I'm glad that I understood before buying it that ""works with Sonos"" means nothing. You can basically play songs using the Sonos app. It isn't like it connects to the speakers. You can't use existing Sonos One speakers as side or back surround speakers. You can't stream audio to a Sonos Beam in another room as Zone 2. At least I knew all that before I bought it, even though reviewers on other sites made it sound like Sonos wireless speakers were an alternative to Sony's.I did however think I would be able to send eARC audio to a Sonos Beam. The AN1000 has two HDMI outs. One is labeled eARC. But it can't send just eARC audio to a sound bar. I was really surprised by that. It is only to receive eARC audio from a TV. I have a projector and devices like PS5s and AppleTVs. I thought I could send secondary audio to a sound bar I already have. But no. That's not possible. It doesn't even have S/PDIF audio outs, so the Sonos adapter won't work. You need external hardware to split the HDMI signal into video and ARC audio, or video and S/PDIF audio to use Sonos's adapter. But then nothing higher than compressed 5.1 works.The virtual 3D audio using just 2 speakers is terrible. It is muddy and muffled, much like Windows spatial audio and Apple's spatial audio is. They just aren't worth it.It gets really hot. Even at low volume level or just siting idle, it really heats the place up! I don't think I'll be able to use it much in the summer (along with a projector and PS5 already overheating the place).It has an on-screen menu to choose things like ""audio"" or ""video"" and you can even hide the devices (inputs) like ""cable tv"" that you don't have."" You can even change the names, so ""game"" can be ""PS5"" or ""Xbox"" and ""media box"" can be ""AppleTV.""  But those only show up on the ""TV"" screen. On the front display, they still say ""game"" and ""media box.""The remote feels really cheap and the IR only works when faced straight on. It does have a port for an IR repeater, but that is sold separately.I do like that that has 2 HDMI outputs. It is handy to show video on a small monitor when I am just listening to music and don't want my projector on. But it isn't worth $900. It does have 8K and 4K 120KHz, but that is just future proofing for now. The audio formats will probably be defunct before that is useful.I'll try it with Atmos speakers before I send it back, but I think a cheaper $400 amplifier with a separate HDMI splitter to go to 2 screens, and another splitter to send eARC data to a soundbar in another room would be cheaper and more convenient in the long run."
"7.1 surround sound.The pc gaming dream.Well.It would be, if AV Receivers didn’t add audio lag.All audio will be desynchedAnd it will render your games unplayable.There is no fixOr work around.Buyer beware,a real use case for sound cards is here.$900 and they still can’t get 0ms audio.Pathetic and sad."
Does not seem to work right with HDMI 2.1 and TV
"Kinda works sometimes. Drops Atmos quite often, which is the reason I bought it in the first place."
"I really wanted to like this receiver and to be fair there is a lot to like. The 360 spatial audio is amazing. Onscreen menus are great. If you’re buying this primarily for home theater applications it’s a great option.Unfortunately for music I found it frustrating. Admittedly I prefer a warmer sound and Sony is brighter, perhaps closer to a live performance.What bothered me though was the inconsistency from track-to-track. One track could sound pretty good, while another would be very thin and tinny sounding even when the powered subwoofer was working. Which brings me to my second problem the crossover never really worked well some tracks would have thumping bass while some would have almost none. And it wasn’t a case of mixing I picked a set of 20+ songs across all genres that I know really well.I tried lots of recalibrations and tweaking in the wonderful onscreen menus, but ultimately I was never happy with the sound. While I’m no audiophile I expect to be happy for $900. So I picked up the admittedly more expensive Onkyo TX-NR7100 which happened to be on sale for the same price as the Sony and right out of the box, with no calibration, the Onkyo sounded better to my ear. It also sounded better to my partner who after I returned the Sony said “I wasn’t going to say anything, but I didn’t like the sound from the first one”Ultimately I do think it’s a matter of preference and for some people I think you’ll be very happy and if you mostly want to watch movies it’s a great choice too."
"**I've returned this product**The Good:SoundThe sound was great, I used it with a pre-existing set of speakers and after calibrating them with the included mic they sounded better than they had in years. I couldn't believe how good they sounded honestly.The Bad:Remote ControllerIt is terrible, I've had controllers that worked better and more reliable from a $9 set of color changing LED lights. Sony went with an IR remote and unless you have direct line of sight to the receiver the remote is useless. I expect more for a receiver costing 800+No Native AppSony elected to use their ""music"" app to control this unit instead of making a dedicated app. It's kludgy at best but at least it works better than the poor excuse for a remote controller. The app will nag you constantly to setup chrome cast if you haven't yet (at least on android) in an a very obstructive way almost keeping you from using the app until you do. Also there is no way (that I found) to turn off the unit from the app.HDMI SwitchingSlow, I mean upwards of half a minute and some times it didn't work at all and I had to switch back and forth to get it to work (this also could be because the unit is faulty). Also when you power on the device I hope you weren't planning on watching the last input you were on as it will more than likely switch and if not it will popup a display menu that you'll need the remote to close or switch inputs from the app to make it go away.ConclusionI think my unit is faulty, but that has no baring on the controller, the app or the sound review.  My 10 year old yamaha receiver has a way better remote and app (even though the app looks extremely dated). If I wasn't returning this for issues with it, I would have regretted my purchase and not returning it based on the inconvenience of using the device alone.I will list the other issues I experienced.  There was a loud banging every time I started it and when it seemed to have stopped (2 weeks later) I started having audio drop out or no sound when powering the device.  Another issue was when powering on my game console (which turns on my tv and my tv turns on my receiver)  my TV would loop constantly between inputs and wouldn't stop until I unplugged it. I didn't have this issue with my yamaha nor did I have it with a friends denon."
"Its tough buying an AV receiver. Spend too little and don’t get the feature you want or spend way more and get a bunch of features you don’t want. I went open box on this high rated Sony receiver, but it makes this Th-dong sound when turned on. Is this normal or will it die soon after warranty and I will have to buy again? I have a five speaker setup and I can listen to most shows and make out the vocals without blasting the volume. I do wish it had volume control, a night mode, for commercials and action scenes.It didn’t automatically switch sources when everything was turned on. I had to find it in the menu each time. I didn’t observe any benefits to using a Sony receiver with Sony TV and PS5."
"I recently purchased the Sony STR-AN1000 receiver, and after spending some quality time with it, I've gathered my thoughts to share. First off, the price point is quite decent, which along with stellar reviews from WhatHifi, drew me to this model. It promised and deliverd on the 360 sound experience, particularly when gaming. I've been playing Gran Turismo, and the sound quality really elevates the gaming experience, you can hear cars coming up from behind you. The eARC feature works flawlessly as well, I rarely need to pick up the receiver remote, my TV remote just worked with everything.The cons: the receiver takes an agonizingly long time to boot up, clocking in at about 2 minutes. As others have mentioned I've also encountered some bugs along the way; on occasion, there's been no sound output, and it doesn't always recognize inputs correctly. This means I've found myself having to manually switch inputs, something I've never had to do with a receiver before—it's been a bit like having to ""debug"" my own entertainment system. It can occassionally make a loud ""thunk"" sound when turning it on. The remote control also leaves much to be desired; it's a sad little rectangle, underwhelming in functionality, you're forced to use the on screen display if you need to tweak a setting. The only time I use it, is when I'm trying to debug why my receiver isn't playing sound.While the Sony STR-AN1000 offers some compelling features and sound for its price. The sound is really good, both for movies and gaming. The slow startup time, occasional bugs, input signal recognition issues, along with a sad remote, makes me regret buying it. This will likely be the first & last Sony receiver I buy."
"Having a number of issues for this. First, the menu pops up every time you turn it on, requiring you to select an input. My XBOX turns on the receiver, and it tries to display the TV tuner/antenna instead.Recently ""zone 2"" has started turning itself on constantly. There doesn't seem to be a way to disable zone 2 entirely, which is horrifically bad design.Makes a loud CLUNK sound when turns on, like a knockoff unit."
"I replaced my old sony 1080 with this as I’m excited with the center lift feature, but during setup, it was the same as the old sony receiver. You need front height speakers to lift the center. I should have ordered the yamaha V6A instead of this one. I still don’t know if I’m gonna return this or not."
"Update 6/7/2023: still can't stream music properly, and now crashes. Sony technical support has no answers.Update 3/29/23: to be fair, I started a trial subscription to Amazon Music Unlimited, playing the exact same recordings as with Qobuz, and the exact same problems happened. SONY PLEASE FIX THIS. It is YOUR problem, not mine. I don't think I've mentioned that I'm increasingly finding that the music-streaming issue is even more widespread, since separate movements of works don't load and play automatically. This should be an easy software fix for Sony, but it won't happen unless Sony fixes the problem.Update 3/27/23 : well, Sony did listen to me, but their tech guys claim they can't do anything. Now I have to decide whether to return the receiver or spend more money on a network streamer to add to itPLUS! It was shipped without an FM antenna. I called support. They said they would ship one to me. They didn't.I am now downgrading my rating._______________________First, I want to stress that I love this receiver and think it's great value.BUT BUT BUT, somebody really screwed up how it handles streamed music (I use Quobuz). This affects where pieces of music are segmented into tracks that have continuous music, like a Wagner opera. At the end of each segment, there's a slight pause while the next track loads, completely destroying the moment. Sometimes, the next track doesn't play at all.  This happens with both Chromecast and Airplay. I have never seen or heard this with any other piece of streaming equipment (and I have several). It is infuriating.I bought this receiver because it could handle Atmos for shows and HI-RES for music, but it is thus only half successful. I am hoping somebody from Sony reads this and can arrange for a software fix."
"I love the sound that the str an1000 delivers when paired with my klipsch 5.1 speakers.  That’s it.  I use it with a Direct TV Stream box and connect to my Bravia TV.  It worked ok for a couple of weeks.  The remote controls only partially link with the unit.  So, I still have to use all 3 remotes.  The Music Center app only does some things such as volume, power on / off and occasionally works with component selection.  Room 2 and Room 3 are a pain in the ass to use.  You are constantly trying to figure out which remotes to use and when.  Only a few functions work on each.  Now, I have to unplug and plug the unit back in daily otherwise it freezes up.  The unit remote stops working until it reboots.  I’ve searched the net and found plenty of people with similar issues but no fixes.  It has more features than my Sony 1080 but the reliablity is way off.  Also, the room 2 works so much better on my 1080.  Will see if I can return.  It’s been about a month."
"This Sony 7.2 receiver as well as the 5.1 receiver are only good for movies.  They are absolutely lame for music at a decent volume!  They both go into ""protect mode"" after just a 10 minutes or less at 3 quarter volume or not much more than half volume turned up.  DO NOT BUY THIS OR ANY SONY RECEIVER FOR MUSIC ENJOYMENT.  I am HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED with SONY!!  They are completely balless for music at a decent volume.  Only movies are good on their receivers & their volume range is so weak!  Absolute joke for how fast & easy their receivers fizzle out with the volume turned up.  The heat sinks in these SONY receivers are so thin and poor quality, that they should not advertise these for more than half the wattage they show in the specifications manual!  I will NEVER buy a SONY receiver again. PERIOD!!!  Save up your money for a MARANTZ receiver!  I will not make this mistake again and my opinion on SONY has completely changed with this purchase.  They only have good Blu-ray players small products in electronics.  Do not buy SONY for amplifying your music you love, they will burn out with not much volume at all. 😤😤😤"
"Update Sept 2024: I'm down to having to unplug and replug the receiver every day to make Zone 2 work, and now Zone 1 has stopped working at all. Less than a year, and it's pretty much worthless.This receiver is fine, great even, if all you care about is a single output. But I use multiple screens and bought this so that I could choose which input goes to which output at will. It does that, for a few days, then the second output (Zone 2) stops working. I've done factory resets, updated firmware, etc. The only thing that fixes it is unplugging the receiver and plugging it back in again. At first, that bought me a couple weeks. Then it was ten days and so on. Now I'm down to a few days between failures and suspect it will quit sending anything to the second output altogether before I've even had it a year.When it works, it's an outstanding receiver. And it's one of only a very few receivers at this price point that handles multiple outputs with video. Maybe I just got a faulty device, but bought it on sale and set it up a couple weeks later. By the time I realized the issue, my return window had closed."
"My home theater broke and I needed a new one. This one works well, but trying to figure out how to program it so it comes on without having to select the mode and setup is aggravating. I can't find any information how to program it."
"After a month, I can say that I'm disappointed and am kinda stuck since it's past the return period.I paired this with a 77 A80CK Sony OLED and a PS5. While the receiver integrates well; like being able to use the TV remote to control them all, the receiver occassionaly stops putting out sound till you do a hard power cycle. Also, sometimes it won't go on standby even if the TV is off and will just stay turned on.I'm not sure if this is just happening with my particular unit or these really need a hard power cycle every few days or so. I wouldn't have a problem with this but the AV ""hello"" reboot takes about 3-5 mins and that's  kinda a long time when I just want to turn on the news real quick before heading out in the morning.The denon 650h that this replaced simply turned on ready to go when the power came (I had that on a power saving master/slave power strip) when I turned on the TV."
"I purchased this receiver for my father for his 70th birthday and helped “try” to install it. The Bluetooth function does not work and I told seller. Tried numerous times to return but seller declined. Tried Amazon’s A to Z guarantee and was declined. Do not purchase anything from this third party seller. I even tried contacting Sony directly multiple times and they also couldn’t help solve the issue. $1,000 for a boat anchor if you buy this product. Buyers beware!"
"After spending an hour trying to get zone 2 speakers to work and another 90 minutes on the phone with Sony support, Sony advised in an email that this receiver requires a second receiver to power the speakers in a second room. Here is an excerpt from their email:""this is ******  from sony sound team, we have an interaction regarding your receiver in how to get sound from the media box to zone 2 , checking here with my support team seems like in order to get access to the zone 2 you will will need to connect the unit towards another  receiver in order to get sound out of the Zone 2 "".I'm pretty sure that most people who buy this receiver intend to use it for speakers in another room rather that use them to add rear a height channel in the same room as the other five channels. Based on the fact that there is a power switch on the remote to turn on a second zone, this unit probably does have the capability I expected. Unfortunately the support team lacks the competence to make it function properly."
"My old sony equipment worked flawlessly (pre 4k stuff) so I needed a new receiver to make my 4k sony tv get better resolution compared to the old 1080p receiver.  BUT, I watch cable 90% of the time and every time unit was shut down and turned back on, it always reverted to BD/DVD !!!  Many wasted calls to Sony techs, sometimes disconnected, one said it was a “Fios” issue and I needed Verizon to fix it, and others tried resetting TV and this receiver.  Even the remote would stop working !  Finally, after HOURS talking with techs, I was told this receiver will always defer back to BD/DVD even though the player is off and hasn’t been used..  I had to swap my cable hdmi with the BD hdmi….  This sucks !  Unfortunately, after wasting my time talking with Sony techs time after time, my 30 day return window with amazon closed..  I think there is something wrong with the receiver and thinking about buying another one.Anyone else have this issue ?"
"This receiver gave me nothing but problems from the start.  I have 5 speakers, 2 front, 1 center and 2 surround.  Additionally, I have the cable box, Samsung Smart TV, DVD player, Apple TV and Wii game attached to the receiver.  Setup was fine, but when I turned it on with the cable box remote (would not turn on with the receiver remote), a message appeared on the receiver saying something like, ""please wait"".  I waited and waited, from 2 - 15 minutes before it would come on.  Once it did start up my TV, everything played well - TV, Apple TV, etc.  But when I turned it off, and came back the next day, same message and same wait.  I called Sony Support 4 times.  They walked me through different setup's, but the same problem persisted.  I gave up and have returned it for a full refund.  I downsized to the Sony STRDH590 5.2 and have been very satisfied.  Everything works, and comes on immediately with the Sony remote or Cable box remote.  If you don't have more than 5 speakers, don't waste your money on the STR-AN1000 7.2."
Disappointment that this receiver can't pass-through other refresh rates like the Onkyo receiver.  Rest is fine.
"On several occasions the sound has just stoppped working and it puts a message onscreen saying audio system not available. I have to shut everything off and back on to get it to work again. Currently what it’s doing, is when I play a dvd, I hear the audio and don’t see the video. It is not the hdmi or the player, because if I hook the player directly to the tv, instead of through the receiver, it works fine. Really didn’t want to spend the $800, but decided to treat myself. I wish I had the money back. I should also mention , all of my devices are Sony, so there is no compatibility issue or anything of that nature."
"New Sony unit the first updated release in 5 years I was pumped to get itOpened box it at nephews he's your classic audiophile been collecting equipment for 30 yearsWe hook up a pair of B&W DM604 S3 towers and they sound great...so lets see what they can do.At level 5 on the volume control they started to come alive at level 6 we started laughing how good they sounded. Level 6.1 the receiver go into power protection mode and shuts down,he states its the chip protection kicking in leaving 40% of the power inaccessible. Rebooted a couple of time same result"
"In good faith, I will never ever recommend Sony ever ever again. This was the biggest Fn disaster I've ever seen in my entire life. This system will cause you to lose every bit of hair you've ever had. I'd always Love Sony but at this point I will never buy anything from Sony ever again. This is so extremely disappointing. I haven't got words for how miserable My experience has been with this POS."
Great for a 7:1 speaker configuration but Insee no way or output plug to plug in my Atmos speakers. Should have bought a 9:1 austem
Did not communicate seamlessly with my expensive Sony OLED TV. Failed to pass through the video feeds to the TV after only 50 days. This is horrific and a very huge disappointment in purchase.
Sound just randomly stopped. No integration with universal devices.
Everytime I turn it on it runs for a minute or so then shuts off with a protector error!!  Everything is hooked up properly!
"Product works good, however the front LED Panel went out just after warranty expired.  No replacement available!  For the price paid you would expect the product to last longer and for replacement parts to be available.  Since the LED no longer functions a lot of adjustments can no longer be made.  Won't Sony products in the future."
"Update 10/12/2023: I previously discussed how this receiver would pop a random speaking navigating within inputs. This occurred most significantly using a Roku Express and navigating within apps. I decided to replace it with a Roku Ultra, a more powerful unit, and the popping ceased. What a relief. It seems to have something to do with the audio switching or dropping for a split second in between selections in the apps. I would say the problem still lies within the Sony receiver since it didn't do this with my previous receiver, so I'm not changing the rating, but it doesn't seem to be an outright faulty unit.As is indicated, I'm reviewing a free Vine product. I was previously running a slightly older Denon 7.2 channel setup. I wanted to give this Sony a try since it had newer 4K connectivity. Overall, I didn't find much improvement in picture quality or sound, but I do prefer the Sony just a bit. The surround processing seems to sound a little better in the Sony.It took me a while to review this unit since I've found it to have a defect. Particularly on streaming apps, a loud pop will occur in one random speaker when navigating. It seems to mostly coincide with the audio changes when a preview occurs. On some apps you can turn this off, on many, when you stop on a show or movie, a preview begins. It also happens to some degree on each source: cable, blu-ray player, Roku. I've done a lot of troubleshooting to determine if it's a bad speaker, wiring, component but haven't been able to get rid of it. I'm certain it's within the receiver.I did online chat with tech support, but ultimately they wanted me to call them to also troubleshoot it which I haven't followed up on. I'm not all that motivated to send this in for warranty repair for something I'm reviewing for free when it didn't blow me away. I've noticed several other reviews indicating this unit can be defective. With all of the choices available, I'd avoid this particular model."
"Going form a Denon avr-x1700h to this Sony str-an1000. I like the added features that work with the PS5 and the ability to lift the center channel speaker is a plus. I never got into the multi zone nor do I use most of the other onboard technologies besides Bluetooth. All of my “multi room” speakers are Alexa's. I do not mind separating my home theater from the rest of the home as this receiver works with google assistant. As for sound, it is definitely better during game play on a PS5. Movies not that noticeable. Seems similar in output. The str-an1000 is for sure more efficient as it only uses 240 watts. I do like the Sony GUI and the setup. Having the option to connect wireless rear speakers and a sub is neat but either way the speaker will still need a power cord."
These units from Sony are pure garbage they are rated 1165 watts not with a 5 or 7.1 set up more like 90 watts per channel or less I know I purchased a str 780 5.1 & owned it for almost a year & wound up giving it to a good friend at work along with the speaker set up with it a Klipsch theater pack now I own a Yamaha rx a4a with a Klipsch rp 5.1surround set up I am running just under 1300 watts total 200 watts per channel with a dedicated osd Nero 5180 5 channel amp but I am only using 3 channels front left right & center cannels my surround left & right channels are powered by my Yamaha processor 120 watts per channel .do not buy electronics from Amazon.Check out crutchfields for all your electronics you will not be disappointed.
I just got this and then started researching to get the speakers to use it with.It will cost me 3 times or more to get the speakers than 1 of the best 7.2 soundbars and it comes with everything right out of the box. This 7.2 soundbar is about the same price as this.Not even going to waste my time or money on this outrageously over-priced control panel!
"Returned  the receiver,  Amazon was unable to provide a replacement/exchange .Generally Sound is as expected - very good , the the new Digital Cinema Auto Calibration IX and 360 Spatial Sound Mapping shine.Issue is with the HW quality, at start-up randomly the receiver would  make a loud clunk/thud sound , I have seen reports of the same issues on other forums, maybe a faulty relay.  Also once the receiver froze not responding to the remote or the the power button, has to hard-power off.  Sony Support was not helpful."
"Received my first receiver a month ago.  Did the setup and midway thru it, I thought it had completely frozen... but it ended up being the remote that died (the LED)Amazon offered me $70 off to buy a a replacement remote but couldn't get a replacement remote anywhere ...  Contacting Sony was a complete no go - would get an AI assistant telling me how to reset the remote then ""contact us again"" if it doesn't work...  but wouldn't be able to get past that.  Ended up having Amazon sending me a whole new AVR.Setup the 2nd one, super loud THUD when powering up.  Did the calibration, went flawlessly.  BT out is great with headphones as well.  Super happy with my purchase I plug everything.  Atmos is great, HDR, Dolby Vision, VRR, everything is working A1.Wake up the next day, turn it on, it starts to loop with loud thuds then gets stuck in the ""please wait"" screen.  After 30min+ I had to pull the power plug (which isn't removable!).  Maybe a fluke?Then, over the next 3 weeks, it would do that roughly 1 time out of 5.. requiring a full power cycle.The CEC implementation is also a bit odd.  I turn on the AVR... put my PS5 input (GAME).  Start the PS5... start my TV... the AVR switches to the eARC input.  All 3 devices are SONY too...Little details : the AVR has a Web UI, just open up port 80 of the IP of the receiver.  Was pleasantly surprised since the manual doesn't mention it but it's useless because it's 100% read only.  Probably a left-over from the ES version...  The ES version has a setting in the UI ""allow remote configuration"" that isn't there in the base model...So sad because for the price, it sounds great, easy to use, nice looking and fully featured but there's clearly QA issues... and it doesn't seem to be isolated to me..."
I'm not happy with the sound bar
"Despite the value, this product distorts at low levels, not the kind of distortion you hear with crackling, but the kind of distortion that makes voices and sound effects sound less real."
"The only reason I’m keeping this is because it took my son quite an effort to get it all together. I don’t like the sound quality - it’s clear and crisp but lacks the boom you need for that theatre feel when you are watching a movie. I have another sound bar and woofer without surround which has a better sound quality. For the money spent on this, not sure it’s worth it."
Not that loud. Little speakers don't do much
Sound bar is ok surround sound is nonexistent..  Speakers are very low sound.  Base tube is weak at best...  The app is useless. I should have sent back for a refund....
Tried for two-day to install and could not get it to work with our streaming service.
I had to put the sub-woofer up to my ear to hear it
No installation instructions and have not heard back from Amazon or the manufacturer.
Poor sound quality wooden pair the rear speakers
"I'm not a fan of this soundbar. The sound quality is very hollow and not much different than using the tv speakers. It can be adjusted in a multitude of configurations but none of them are that great. This unit doesn't always connect to my tv. Some of the functions don't seem to work at all. Bass is terrible unless you turn the volume up past 70. I rarely use this to watch tv. Sporting events are enhanced somewhat, but movies and dialogue sound terrible."
"Honestly with all of these 5 star reviews I was expecting much better sound.  The subwoofer is directional, I can hear exactly where its at in the room and it immediately bugs me.  The unit is missing HDMI, for this price point I expected both of those problems to have been resolved.  Trying to round the reviews down a tad here, as we can't let such mediocrity be celebrated as something great.It's a fantastic upgrade from basic TV speakers, as most sound bars are.  But that's about it due to the issues outlied above.  As far as actual soundbars go, this one's definitely mid range.  It's not great, its not terrible.  The surround sound is wireless though (other than between the 2 rears), and it does function.  Honestly I would love to use it, but the subwoofer issue bugs my ears too much.  I'm sorry to be so picky.  I was trying to replace a 2.0 sound bar with this for the surround upgrade, but my old soundbar has way more full mid-bass extension, to the point I could have a subwoofer blend in and disappear in the room.  This one can't do that, and won't do that."
"I've had a number of different 5.1 surround sound systems and soundbars over the years across a huge range of different price points. Generally where this one is targeted I would suggest people instead get a soundbar, though could I be won over by new name ULTIMEA?Set up first and the process is relatively straightforward - there is an app, which is fine but not great but the TV also recognised it straight away and there are options for other types of connection too. The build quality is fine but doesn't give me great confidence it would hold up to much.Sound wise, the set up is a little disappointing. The mids are fine and the product gets to an ok volume but the overall sound lacks depth and can quickly become 'tinny'. There is also a lack of range both at the high end and the bass, which feels flat.Overall I think this is a classic case of getting what you pay for - I would suggest there are better sound bars pitched at the same level."
The camera freezes when the SD card is inserted. It doesn't work even after I bought a new recommended card. It's terrible. Don't waste your time!!!
"The photo quality is terrible, nowhere near as good as described! It's too hard for kids to use, and even the slightest hand shake makes the already blurry photos worse. The instructions for each feature are vague, leaving my boy feeling incredibly disappointed while trying to use it."
"I honestly don't know what to say, but I had a different image in my head surrounding the wi-fi capability of the camera.It will NOT connect directly to your in-home wifi network, you have to go through a phone, or through another camera (what?!) or through their software. After learning all this I was a little frustrated, but I whipped out the instructions at that point to proceed knowing now that it won't be super easy-peasy. Instructions tells me to download the Android app first, ok no problem. Login via Gmail. No problem. Instructions now say to downloaded the Windows software from Canon's website. Got to login, but no login from gmail option. Had to start over and make new account. Got software to work but now PC can't find the camera, after troubleshooting about 10 minutes, I found that  you have to turn wi-fi off and plug it in... well I bought literally FOR the wifi but whatever. Plug is NOT a common USB (like USB-C for example it's something else). Digging through my cords another 5-10 minutes I find one! Good! Now it will work right?! Well, not really. The PC only recognizes for about 30 seconds then it shuts off. ugh. Ok, let's be quick this time... Nope. By the time the PC finds the camera, the software, doesn't have time. Maybe it's the cord. I find another one, lucky me! Nope. Same problem. And NOW it's connecting and disconnecting ever second or so.This whole ordeal took about an hour and that was enough for me to simply pack it up and ask fo my money back.Cameras have been around since, *searches Google* 1816. It souldn't take an hour to set up a camera. I mean it's a Camera... Phones these days are a billion times more complicated and it takes less time to ""set up."" Cameras are built into the bloody thing.The camera itself is probably fine, but I bought it to connect with my PC easily, ya know, since it's a digital camera and all, and it was THE most complicated thing I've done in a while, and I'm a Node.js programer, AND I didn't even finish.I'm not usually a giver-upper, but this should have been a piece of cake and it wasn't."
"It's fine as a camera, but you can't use the camera at the same time it's connected to a computer through USB or use it through WiFi without buying their EOS Webcam Utility Pro for $49.99 a year or $4.99 a month."
"First of all the app for sending shots to your phone not intuitive getting it set up. It was so frustrating I wanted to heave the camera through the window.Second, the screens are simple until you need to do something. Like changing the aperture. The issue isn’t so much the camera as it is with cruel joke of a manual. Seven YouTube videos later the light bulb goes on.Third, you cannot change the aspect  ratio of the pictures unless you switch to the screen view mode, something I had to purchase the For Dummies book for this camera to learn. Even in the fully automatic mode this camera cannot do anything remotely like point and shoot. If I could see, using the manual mode would be less involved. You should not be getting a shutter speed of 1/15 of a second with the flash.I have to believe this camera will work for me after I work through the For Dummies book a few times. The lenses are plastic, the camera is as light as a feather, and it is easy to attach the lenses.  One thing good about this camera is that it is affordable. I was looking around for a new Nikon entry level D3500 to replace this only to find out it has been discontinued. Nikon has stopped making entry level dslr’s. Buy this, but adjust your expectations.  Good, but be patient with yourself."
"Ordered this for my daughter's 15th bday. She loves her point and click, which she has had several. She enjoys ""old timey"" photos with the baked in date and time stamp, which is why we chose this camera. When I asked if this camera supported it, I got replies staying that it does....but they were wrong. It does NOT have a Date and Time Stamp feature that displays on the photos. If you are looking for this and it is a deal breaker, you will NOT find it here. I wished I wasn't miss lead by others, but here I am ($500 +) in and it's just a decent DSLR without the one major feature my daughter wanted. Other than that requirement, it's just an over grown point and click. Don't get me wrong. It's a good DSLR for beginners and the majority of the interface is intuitive, I just wish the info on here was more correct.If you're looking for an entry level DLSR that's easy to use and affordable, but don't require it to have the ability to embed the date and time stamp on the photos, then this is a decent camera."
"This looks like a pretty good camera but apparently I can’t use it out of the box. If I had known ahead of time, I would have gotten a memory card. I just assumed there was some memory."
"That the camera is not capable of supporting studio strobes was not mentioned anywhere in the product description. That is something that any serious photographer would want to know before buying a camera. The Canon EOS Rebel T7 is completely incapable of supporting studio strobes, but the product description failed to reveal that fact. Consequently, the buyer ends up trying an endless series of ways to figure out how to connect it to studio strobes, only to ultimately discover that it is not possible. That is a serious omission in the product description."
"It's an awesome camera overall, I don't think it was 100% new because when I removed it from the box (wasn't even wrapped) I removed the dust cap from the lens and it had fingerprints on it. Other than that, haven't had any issues so far."
overall this set seems to be good but the lens are terrible - especially the  EF 75-300mm Lens. this is useless as the picture is terrible for a professional camera. we are dissapointed
"Rating: ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (3/5)Pros:Affordable Pricing: The Camera comes at a budget-friendly price point, making it accessible to a wide range of consumers.Decent Image Quality: While not exceptional, the camera delivers reasonably good image quality in well-lit conditions, suitable for everyday photography.Compact and Lightweight: The camera's portability makes it easy to carry around, making it a suitable choice for travelers and casual photographers.User-Friendly Interface: The camera's intuitive user interface and straightforward controls make it beginner-friendly.Cons:Mediocre Low-Light Performance: In low-light conditions, the Camera struggles to capture clear and sharp images, resulting in noise and reduced detail.Limited Features: This camera lacks advanced features and settings that enthusiasts and professionals may seek, limiting its versatility.Slow Autofocus: The autofocus system can be sluggish, especially when tracking moving subjects, making it less suitable for capturing fast-paced action.Limited Video Capabilities: Video quality is subpar, with limited resolution options and no advanced video features.Build Quality: The camera's construction feels somewhat cheap, and it may not withstand rough handling or adverse weather conditions.Overall, the Camera is an entry-level camera that delivers average performance for its price. It's a decent option for those who prioritize affordability and simplicity but may not satisfy users looking for more advanced photography features or superior image quality, especially in challenging lighting situations."
"I am not a photographer but figured this would take better pictures than a phone! The product was fine and easy to use, but the quality of picture was by far better on my iPhone 14 and I can zoom in way more on my iPhone!I bought this camera because my thought was spending $500 on a product that is dedicated to being a camera would just overall take better photos than a phone.  I gave it a lot of time and even had others make sure everything is set up, before I gave up on it!Eventually it was not worth it and even more disappointing was my iPhone could zoom in way more than this camera. I would have to buy a 1,000 dollar lens just to have the same zoom in strength as my iphone!"
"I bought this camera to upgrade and replace my elder EOS Rebel XTi. The XTi was and still is an excellent camera but it had suffered significant pin damage in the CF card slot and I decided to upgrade instead of having it fixed.The T7 is an excellent entry level camera. While it has some lesser features vs the T7i it is still a very capable camera both in automatic mode and in Program Auto or Manual.The feature I was most disappointed in is the ""Built in Wi-Fi."" Yes, the camera has built in Wi-Fi. You can connect via infrastructure mode (through your home router) or Wi-Fi direct to a smart phone with the Canon smart phone app, to other Canon cameras, certain printers and to a Canon web service.What you cannot do is what you would think would be obvious. You cannot connect the camera via Wi-Fi to the Wi-Fi enabled Canon EOS Utility on a desktop or laptop, in order to download pictures to your computer wirelessly. I was a bit surprised, given that I had a Wi-Fi enabled camera and a Wi-Fi enabled Canon utility that the two would not work together, but apparently Canon chose not to include that feature in the camera's firmware. All the hardware is there to do it, it is simply a software feature not included.So, I knocked a star off of what would have been a 5 star review for the missing feature, and another star off for not making it clear that their Wi-Fi support didn't support one of the most obvious features. I would think anyone who is familiar with Canon's offerings would expect the Wi-Fi enabled camera to connect to the Wi-Fi enabled utility."
"Update: Less than 6 months after getting this I started having issues. It seems like it’s the lenses but could be the body. Canon wont fix because I got it on amazon. Amazon wont fix cause it’s past 30 days… So, I have to find some where to see what’s wrong. Will update when I have answers. Past this is the previous review…….(I haven't been able to do photography for a while. This was the perfect set up to get back at it. I have all the benefits of manual or if I'm not feeling all the thought process I can set it to auto and have fun. Either way it's perfect.  The battery last forever also which is great. I transfer straight to my iPad for editing.  No issues ever. Get the apps and no issues.)"
Still trying to figure out the camera then one day out of no where a green line appears through the center of the screen… returning to get a new one
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                I bought this for my wife because she wanted something besides her phone to capture memories. This is very easy to learn how to use, easy to use. One thing that bugged me is that I could not practice taking pictures or even test out any of the features until I put an sd card in. Takes great quality photos. Easy to travel with. And is light weight"
SURPRISE:- The LCD screen does not swivel around; it's locked into camera body.- The camera does not record 60fps- The camera saves video in .mov format rather than .mp4.- Batteries not interchangeable with former Rebel
"I received camera, but strange the LCD screen did not have a potective screen on. Power on the camera and London location was on. I ordered new but clearly this item is used. I'm returning."
Very big!!! the lens zoom in wasn’t  working it was blurry
"While the camera didn’t fit my needs. I don’t have anything bad to say about it.. I returned it, and that’s where my issue comes in… It’s been next to impossible to get a response let alone a refund.. keep that in mind"
"I know this is beginner camera. But I didn't realize it didn't have a flash card. It's a gift for a friend, but it is embarrassed. He needs to buy flash card...."
"This camera takes great pictures and videos, but what everyone needs to be aware of is that, in video mode, it does NOT record longer than 10 - 12 minutes, at which time recording automatically STOPS with no explanation. The only explanation I could find on the Internet was that, even with the highest quality 64Gb SD card, it records only 11 minute files and stops automatically; it does NOT initiate successive 11 minute files automatically. It just stops, and you have to hit the record button to continue recording EACH TIME. There is apparently no fix, firmware update or work around. So don't expect that you can just set it up on a tripod at your child's birthday party, hit RECORD, and forget it. You're going to have to check it every 10-12 minutes and hit RECORD again, and again, and again. Other than that, it's a fine camera."
"Camera is ok, although similar Nikons are better. The Canon Connect app completely ruins the experience though. If I hadn't missed the return window, this camera would go back. The app connection process is buggy and pathetically slow. Google Canon Connect problems before you buy this camera. I feel like I wasted my money due to a non-functioning app."
"I had to return this camera. It is way to complicated. Some reviews said it was a beginners camera and it is not. I have been using cameras for 60 years. Started with a Pentax manual that took film. Was so glad when digital camera came as I had put so much money into film and develement. I had a Cannon Powershot for 10 years that I loved. But it died. I decided to upgrade to the Rebel as I had used a friends and liked it. The one I bought did not even seem like the same camera. Way to much complicated instructions to do the most simple things. Charged battery, put in a new memory card. Took 25 photos and camera told me card was full. Normally I can get 300 to 400 photos on a card depending on how much vidio I take which usually isn't that much. I prefer taking stills.  I have never had a problem with a memory card but you never know. I put in another card that was new and a different brand. Same thing. 25 photos and camera said it was full. This was not good. I put those photos on computer and was disappointed with the quality. I could have done just as well with my cell phone.The zoom on the camera seemed to have a problem, too. It would take 10 to 15 seconds or more to auto focas on what I wanted to take a picture of. With still life or flowers or sceanery I would get the sakes by the time it would focas. I could find no way to turn off the auto focas. Even putting it on manual and sports did not do any good. That ment if I was trying to get a shot of something moving it was long gone by the time the auto focas did it's thing. Tried to call Cannon Support. No answer. Emailed them. No answer. I gave up on this camera and sent it back. Sure not worth what I payed for it."
"I ordered the bundle kit version for the Canon EOS Rebel T7. This should have included a DSLR camera, two different lenses (18-55mm & 75-300mm), a battery, a charger, a camera bag, and a camera strap. However, I only received one of the camera lenses and the camera bag. Ended up returning it for a refund. :("
"All the write ups about this camera and it's sharp pictures helped me make the decision to purchase it. I have owned a Rebel 3 and was very happy with it. However, on this T7 the pictures are not clear, not sharp with either lense. I sorry to say this one will be headed back."
"Ever since I first bought the camera, it was always frustrating transferring images to my phone.  It would work sometimes and not other times.  Very finicky, it's the only way to explain it.  Now the camera will not transfer images at all, it just never allows for import.  Do not reommend"
I am having issues with an SD card but otherwise its good
The camera takes excellent photos but the noisy shutter is aggravating to say the least
"Camera seems great but when I got home from work, it was delivered in the Canon box. Left on my front porch, the least you could have done was put it in an Amazon bag. I was extremely lucky it wasn’t stolen. Sincerely angry by delivery."
"It’s by no means a bad camera, but you can get way more bang for your buck for the $600 asking price. I ended up getting a refurbished $600 Canon EOS RP, which is both full-frame, mirrorless, and 26.2 megapixels. The obvious downside of the refurbished one is that it is the body/charger/battery only and no lenses, but honestly the kit lenses that come with the Rebel T7 aren’t really the best to begin with, so i’d just recommend getting the EOS RP and saving ur money for better glass"
"If you have windows and can use the software provided, maybe this camera can function as a decent webcam. If you use linux don't buy this to use as a webcam. You can only use a resolution lower than 720P. Some goofy, non-standard resolution. Since I can't use this in OBS studio, it's a paper weight to me. I gave it to my wife."
"I cannot use this and will return it. This camera does NOT include what you would think would be the standard 3.5mm jack for external audio that most people want to use for their videos, especially if you're doing any filming outdoors.It's extremely frustrating that this feature is not included. I think it needs to be made very obvious up front that this feature is not available or even compatible for this camera. You cannot even buy an adapter to make it work.If you are wanting to use external audio at all, then this is not the camera for you. Virtually all of the other similar Canons (and DSLR cameras from other manufacturers) include this standard. It's like air conditioning in a new car. Why would you expect any model NOT to have this feature.(Can you tell I'm frustrated?)"
I’m not a pro. I bought this to do photos for one of my listings. It’s okay!
"The camera itself is great, but I'm beginning to doubt they were stored in a great environment. There are two particles in the Viewfinder, that kind of look like bugs.The camera still works and those things don't show in the pictures or on the screen, only when viewing through the Viewfinder. I was unable to clean them through the exterior, so it looks like they are inside the Viewfinder.I contacted customer service for Canon, and there was nothing they could do besides offer to service. This is a terrible experience, as I got the camera new, and proceeded to travel to Costa Rica. It will get the job done, but just more annoyingly when viewing through the Viewfinder.I'd recommend to get this camera, but either not through Amazon, or power it on and work it before deciding to keep it."
Not great is all I can say.  It's okay...
"I bought this camera for my out of town trip not knowing it didn't have a battery charger. What little charge was on the battery, dissipated in less than half an hour so I packed it up for a return. I should not have to pay a separate fee for a battery charger. Also, the manual was not in English. The user is instructed to go online to view it there or download for printing. Again, why sell a product in the US without an English manual."
I return this camera because the pictures to me where not as clear as I thought they should be but that just me
I'm a field photographer and it was to hard to access the photos taken
"the quality of the pictures is really great specially if you're a beginner and you want to learn photography, it's really great what this camera in terms of taking pictures can do, but for videos it's really not that good that's why I only gave it 3 stars because making videos is important for me too."
"I bought this for my international trip, I didn’t open the box until I reached to another country and used it . Turned out it didn’t work the images I took look so red and blurry, I can’t return it because the return window was closed. I’m really upset, how could you sell such things like this, I’m a prime member. I’m really disappointed and upset! I rated one star because there’s not other choice but this one should get zero star !!!"
"I returned the product since the picture quality was not worth of the  camera price. But Amazon didn't refund the amount yet, though the amount is big not sure they delayed. The product was returned as it is with no damages or changes."
"I want a camera that is flexible, but not complicated.I'm not interested in a point & shoot, but there should be a mode that is basically that.I have a very difficult time getting the focus right. It's VERY rarely ""just right"", I've tried auto focus & manual. Same with the color. My cell phone should not take better pictures that a DLSR camera that I spent hundreds of dollars on.For years I had only Nikon equipment. I wish I had spent the extra & stayed with what I knew."
"The camera is ok. I was hoping for more. Most of the buttons don’t work because it’s just a base camera. The lens that came with the camera (18 -55mm), has to be adjusted by hand manually. If you’re looking for a beginner camera their are other brands that won’t set you back 400 bucks for basic videos and photos."
"Bought this for my daughter in high school.  She just started to truly use it.  I picked this camera because it is the same type as the school uses.  I knew she would be able to learn more quickly the bells and whistles.She's just now taking the class.  Using it a lot and treats it well.  All said, the camera corrupted the digital disk(s) and she lost all her pictures from a shoot.  Now she's running around trying to find someone who will fix it.Not happy.  Lost priceless pictures.  (No I did not buy the insurance.  I expected it to work and I expected my kid to take good care of it - which she has)"
"Brought this camera as a gift for my wife, first couple times we have been using it and receiving an Err01 message to clean the lens. We follow the directions to clean the metal parts within the camera but keep receiving the same message and unable to take photos"
"the color isnt too bad, but the dpi is 72 (6000x4000) and therefore pretty horrible pictures, and unable to make decent prints. I do urban wildlife photography and this camera seems a lot worse than my iphoneSE. Forget taking pictures of wildlife or animals with this camera, you'd have to be right up in their faces. the catapillar thing took several minutes to focus enough to take. Also it wouldnt let me change iso and the screen never showed me what i was taking a picture of, you have to use viewfinder. this camera feels mid 90s in quality and overly complicated to use for being an incredibly low quality camera, Im going to have to go with a nikon again. very dissapointed."
"Camera came with no cables no accessories at all, not being able to connect an external mic really pisses me off to no end. I waste my money on this and will have to eat this cost as it is useless for my video production.My bad, that I did not research this product better. I won't make that mistake again"
Have additional lenses that this Model Canon will not accept.
"I missed the return window. I don't like this item. The photo quality is horrible. Moving shots are so bad, videos are the worst, instructions are unclear. Do not recommend."
The lens broke after less than 9 months of normal use.
I was looking for a camera to use in the outdoors for both stills and video but when recording video you can only monitor it on the LCD screen and the eyepiece is disabled so it is pretty much useless during a sunny day to record video. I knew it was a bad omen when the UPS driver got rude with me when I asked him why he wasn't wearing a mask. I really wish I had not purchased this camera and waited until I could afford a better one. If you don't plan on recording video outdoors maybe this isn't a big deal for you but any enthusiasm I had for this camera is gone and I will probably replace it as soon as I can and give this one away. It seemed like a sweet deal but it was too good to be true.
I was expecting a lot from this camera but it’s not worth it for that price.
I think memory card always possible for any camera product even if that camera doesn’t detail for this product.
The Canon EOS Rebel T7 was described as a good camera for beginners - not true.  Only in Auto Focus is it a point and shoot camera and then it takes the auto focus 15 seconds to focus and shoot - by then my subject had moved on.  This camera definitely requires an extensive education in photography or much experience with this type of camera in order to operate in its many modes and settings.  Probably a great camera for someone with the education or experience - but definitely not for beginners.  Need to change this language in item description.  Returned item satisfactorily.
"This camera does not come with a flash, Memory card or a case. Plan on spending a lot more money as this package is a Skelton"
"I took about 20 pictures and the camera died !! The battery was fully charged and it wouldn't come on at all. Took the battery out and put it back in and it still wouldn't work. This was all done within a 3 day time period after receiving the camera. I have had a Sony and Minolta cameras forever. Just wanted to see how different the canon camera was compared to my cameras, I found out within a weeks time. I have over 150,000 pictures in my collection with both prints and digital. The rest of the cameras I liked was all over $2,000 which I cannot pay that much for a camera. thanks for all your help in returning this camera package"
I hate it. I've used other cameras like this with no issue but this one comes without instructions and I have not been able to take any pics I've  wanted  to
"This was my first ""professional camera"" but I did not enjoy it & ended up returning it after a few weeks. The picture quality is great, it takes a while to focus on the main object. Videos are a whole different story, the quality is not good whatsoever unless you're going to be standing in one spot."
Just simply put - the picture quality was top class with the given lens. There's more to offer for people who wants to go more deeper into photography but also very easy for beginners. If you are just looking to take good pictures this is the camera for.
We have used this camera for 3 months and now we have ship it back to cannon and pay for it.
"I discovered after receiving the camera that you can not connect an external microphone.Also, I have learned from another reviewer that the camera will not record videos longer than about 11 minutes. For these 2 reasons, I will have to return the camera."
"I am not a moron, but it was very hard to understand the instructions in the booklet.  I found it very complicated than the other Canon One Shot I had.I did return it after being so frustrated."
"The lens is not what I expected, I thought they’d be stronger.  There are NO INSTRUCTIONS!!!!  This camera is a lot more difficult to understand than my little SURESHOT.  My little camera takes better pictures than the Canin EOS 7"
"Focus. Just getting the thing to focus, no matter what setting. I don't need all the bells and whistles, and this really seemed to just stick to what you need. With the name brand, several models of history behind it, you would think they got it right. Maybe mine is a dud. And phone camera will take much clearer photos in a much quicker matte of time. This sees to be only good for a 8 foot fixed distance of still photography. Really disappointed hopefully this is a fluke. Returning."
"When I bought this camera, I was made to believe it was a new camera and it was shipped and delivered overnight. But when I opened the box, I instantly knew that it was a used camera that was deceptively sold as new. No manual, and the camera looked used. I have returned it and am still waiting for my refund. Since I need a camera to shoot some videos, I reordered the same type of camera but as a package with other items. The moment I opened the box I knew the second ordered camera was new. It looked new and clean, manual and other items were new and included.  I didn't make mistake in returning the first ordered camera. Waiting for my refund."
"The camera takes long to focus on a subject whether it’s a picture taken inside or outside, the camera should Atleast come with and SD card since it comes with a case and two lenses, i noticed my camera freezes up when i want to switch up the shooting mode"
