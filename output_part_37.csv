"I haven’t had this much trouble with a kuerig. I’ve owned three over my lifetime so far and I’ve never had these types of problems before.I bought this to replace a Keurig I’d had for 12 years. The first one we got came and the water pump wasn’t working. I called customer service and they sent us a new that worked but only for a month. The power just stopped working on the machine and now I can’t make coffee.I’m finished with Keurig and I’m moving onto a reliable company which sucks because I’ve grown up with them and loved this brand, but it’s not worth throwing 200$ at it and it not working."
"I bought this because it was on sale and looked nice. I followed the directions to run water through the machine both sides and seemed fine. Next day tried to make a pot of coffee. Water came out cold, heating plate never turned on even though light indicated it was on and the water coming out onto the grinds in the basket only came out in one spot and left most of the coffee grinds dry. I’m returning this and the second one I brought as a gift for my son."
Good coffee and everything …IF IT WORKED !!!!!!!Damn
The pot was great when we first opened it and used it but it suddenly just quit working after about 7 uses. It wont even turn on. I tried the troubleshooting tips and contacted the manufacturer for help but they couldnt figure it out either. The water tank didn't go dry and the outlet was working fine. Just suddenly stopped with no apparent reason. Return was super easy though but this is the second keurig we have had do this. Honestly I'm done with this brand. It is too expensive to keep replacing.
"Thought I would treat myself to  a really nice coffee maker,  big mistake!!  Coffee is so weak - doesn't matter what brand. The ounces reading is so far off, half a cup of weak coffee at best. Called and wrote to Kureg for some help and just got a run around. DO BUY FROM ITHIS COMPANY!!!!"
"The ""Reusable Mesh Ground Coffee Filter"" works just fine but the reusable pods are a different story. They appear to fit but closing the Keurig was difficult. I tried different positions but it was almost impossible to close the Keurig. I do not want to force close for I read that others did it and a loud pop was heard in the process. I have to avoid using them until I can resolve from Keurig or find replacements that will work."
It ran like a champ the first month I had it and now it keeps giving me two different errors. It tells me to put more water in the reservoir or it tells me to descale. I shouldn't have to descale a brand new product a month after usage. I can't use either side of the machine.
"Followed the startup directions and carafe side og my Keurig K Duo work for the rinse clean only. It has since not worked, it does not heat the water for the carafe side but the single serve sidenworks just fine. I have a replacement on the way. Hoping thisnis a one off but based on a Reddit thread I can across I rhink this is a quality control issue with this product."
"Still haven’t gotten my refund even though it’s been returned. Likely the end of my prime membership, just want my money back since it’s been returned. Also means canceling my Amex prime business card and prime chase card. Thanks for nothing…"
"Product stopped working mid brew. Other reviews show this is a common problem. Lasted 32 days, and the return window closed at 30 days. For $200, I'd rate the product 0 stars if I could."
"Machine looks nice . Ran water through it to clean as instructed. Now, I had to order a second machine. I did not get the first machine I ordered.  Got a picture of the delivery the second time. Not on the first delivery. I'm expecting a refund for the first machine I didn't receive."
We loved this until it broke just a few weeks after getting it. It was mid brew and just stopped. Tried multiple power sources and it will not turn back on. Really disappointed since we loved it!
Brewed a single 8 cup carafe of coffee with this maker after unbox and setup.  Burner plate never worked and then next pot of coffee brewed cold.Called Keurig for a replacement and of course that is going to take a week at least to process and ship.  Worst part is I threw my old coffee pot away.
Single cup side is getting warm but when we attempted to brew a pot the coffee brewed but was cold and the heating plate is not hot.  Called Keurig and it is broken and they are sending a replacement.  I'll update once we receive the new one.
"Packaging was not damaged, however the water tank was smashed on the bottom. It was taped in and securely packaged. It appeared to be broken during assembly. Returned."
"Unfortunately, this coffee pot broke within weeks of using. This is the third Keurig coffee pot my family has purchased with horrible results. I will never again buy this brand."
This is not working at all all it does is Flash c a l and none of the buttons work nothing we can do changes it. And it is brand new out of the box. It is obviously defective
It’s ridiculous at this price that you can’t buy a coffee pot that doesn’t leak when You pour.
After brewing one pot successfully it isn't working. The water isn't heating on the carafe side. Brewing cold pots of coffee. Pod side still working after using 3 times
"Stopped working in 30 days, complete waste of money!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!! Customer support for warranty is no help. Have contacted them 5 times already and no response"
Coffee is not very hot and have to go through all the auto brew settings every time instead of just pressing the button to turn it on.
"Was awesome for 2 weeks, then the Kcup side stopped working. Will be returning"
My product was delivered damaged and broke.
"I had high hopes for this machine.  I wanted to get rid of one machine on our counter and thought this would be the ticket since we use both a drip coffee maker and a Keurig.  Our 12 year old Keurig is still working but not as well as it was (pump is getting weak?) and our Cuisinart drip coffee maker takes too long (20 minutes +) to brew an 8 cup carafe.  Most of the reviews led me to believe this one would replace both and we would be happy.  Single serve...works great.  Carafe brewing...not so much.  We grind our own beans, and were happy with using 6.5 scoops to 7 ""Cusinart cups"" of water.  This machine...we keep ramping up the amount of coffee to get a similar brew, and it continues to brew a WEAK cup of coffee.  Another person said it might be the difference coming from a cone shape filter to a flat bottom filter.  If I put any more coffee in this Keurig, it spills over the filter and makes a mess.  Not happy and grumpy without my morning Java!"
"Bought it one day and by the next morning it was back in the box to be returned. I dislike everything about it. I thought it had a extra hot and strong setting, wrong! Come to find out those settings are only for the Single Serve/Pods. Can you select delay and it is ready, nope, its a 2 step setting.Only a 2 hour warmer, and holding the button for 3 seconds like the instructions state does nothing.Even the design of the carafe is uncomfortable for a weaker wrist. This brand/design is not for me."
I always have purchased Keurig.  my last one lasted me 5 years and it made great coffee.  I bought this new er model because I wanted to be able to make a pot of coffee when I have company over.  Coffee was wonderful.  This is not an inexpensive maker so I was disappointed when it just quit working.  I did not keep the box or receipt so Walmart wouldn’t give me credit for it.  Just bought another one and hopefully this one will last longer than 30 days
"UPDATED AGAIN: The water tank issue has become impossible to override and now the maker constantly says ""add water"".  If I had bought this normally instead of getting it as a review item I would have returned or replaced it by now.  It made excellent coffee when I could get it to work... but sadly it just does not work anymore.Down to 1 star******UPDATED REVIEW: The more that I use the coffee maker, the more that I love it, and I have found a workaround to avoid dealing with the tank issue.  I simply do not remove the tank to fill it.  I only remove the tank for cleaning and then I fill the tank while it is place in the machine after manually depressing the button when the tank is installed.It is an annoying issue to have to deal with and I am torn between 3 and 4 stars... but because the machine runs so smoothly with the tank being left in place and I get so much good use out of it I am much happier with it than I was at first before figuring out the workaround.Should you need to have a workaround on a brand new machine that costs $200? NO.  But the machine works so well otherwise.  It has simplified my morning routine and we're all loving how easy it is to make coffee now.  If they fix the tank issue, this would be a stellar machine.Up to 3.5 stars but rated at 4 because they don't do half stars.****Original 3 star review:The Add Water alert is always on for my machine and I have figured out why.  The button at the bottom of the water tank does not push the button down on the machine that lets the water flow from the tank into the machine.  Once I figured that out, I pushed the button down with my finger before installing the water tank and it worked correctly.The fix is easy, but it is also easy to forget and I frequently have to remake my coffee because only a couple of teaspoons of water went through the first time. I like the coffee machine and the fact that I can make single serving cups with the pods or I can brew a big pot the traditional way... but I hate that the water tank is buggy and needs to be fiddled with regularly to get coffee to brew correctly."
"This situation is completely unacceptable. I placed my order on December 3, 2024, yet the item was not delivered until December 17, 2024, despite my inquiry on December 8. It is extremely disappointing to open the package and find that the item was not even clean."
"9/2024. Well the second one broke exactly like the first. It would seem the k-cup side has an issue with intake of water. Both started to make loud noises before the first one started dumping water out the back and stinking of burnt plastic. The second wouldn't even dump water but lasted 8 months longer.  AvoidOriginal reviw: Originally we bought the metal carafe but the keurig side broke and started pooling water under the machine and out the cord port. This is really the same machine. Below is my review for the other machine. All in all its the same except for the glass carafe and the heating element. I am enjoying those two things more. I like the glass carafe because it doesn't pour coffee all over the counter like the metal one does. I didn't want the heating element in the first place but I do like having the same hot coffee an hour later and it does turn itself off after I think 2 hours, I have not timed it. Otherwise the same gripes I have with the other one still stand and are below.I bought this because our costco keurig special finally died. I wanted a pot of coffee option and the keurig option and this does it.  The best thing about this is the option to fill the included reusable keurig pod and the k-cup adapter. The k-cup adapter also holds a reusable k-cup which we find easier to use cause we have filters for it. The problem I have found with the included reusable keurig filter is that it overloads too easy and scrolls a large message across the screen, which is ridiculous it could be easier to read. The coffee pot and keurig side work great otherwise. The only other problem we have had is the clock and brew timer are ridiculously unlike any other clock and time you have ever set. It's not intuitive.  It is also ridiculous that you can't program the keurig side to auto brew, should be exactly the same as the pot side. This should be an easy thing for the money spent on this. And remember if you do set auto brew for the pot side and then later go and change it to the keurig side then you need to make sure to take the step to restart the auto brew and flip it back to the pot side, not a big deal but still stupid. If both sides were programmable one at a time then sure I get why I would have to make sure to switch it back, it should reset itself if it was already on. Why not one reservoir and choose how much coffee the pot makes? The reservoir for the keurig is easy to fill but the lid falls off easy. The coffee pot side reservoir is hard to fill like every other coffee maker in existence and the water levels are impossible to see without good light and being able to see over the top of the coffee maker. I'm six foot and still cant quit make out all the steps. We have the metal coffee pot, its nice, it does hold the heat, I don't have to worry about a pot of coffee sitting on a hot plate. The coffee pot is a pain to pour the last bits out of. There should not be a lip where there is a lip the design could be better. The coffee pot side holds the steam in pretty good but the keurig side is a steam engine. We just put out the whole thing from under the cabinets regardless, no one needs mold. Overall its a good machine so far and it better last 10 years. Buy a used/refurbished if you can save some money unless you want the extended warranty that was not offered when we tried to purchase the used one. This is why we went with the new one, otherwise I would not have minded a returned item in good condition."
"Hamilton Beach has been reputable for decades. The Flexbrew, although functional is a miss for Hamilton Beach.  I have owned Keurig's coffee makers for about 10 years with low maintenance,  just periodic cleaning. Maybe once a month.  The Flexbrew needs much more attention. I am always cleaning the piercing needle to prevent it from clogging which it has done several times in the two or three months that I own it. There are a lot of good features as long as you continually maintain it.  I now have got into a daily, and weekly cleaning and maintenance routine. It does have error messages when a problem occurs. Usually a clogged needle or out of water which helps troubleshoot.  The out of water message feature is good because once refilled it starts from where it left off."
"I'm about 2-3 weeks in on owning this coffee maker.It's good. I am not sorry for my purchase. But I don't feel like it is ""right"" for me but it could be for somebody.So here is what I have to say to see if it jives with you and your life.First, I am a coffee lover. Not a snob, not emphatic, but I love coffee. I drink it black, I can easily drink half a pot in the morning if I don't have to run off to work or anything.The brew on this coffee maker is okay. It doesn't make a bad pot of coffee by any means, but I also don't think there is anything spectacular about it either. I'm still playing with the subtleties of making my perfect pot, but it seems selecting the bold brew helps (I presume it heats the water a bit hotter than standard brew).I feel the opening at the top for the water reservoir is good, with plenty of space to pour the water in.I feel the carafe itself feels solid and pours well.The overall design of the pot is decently thought out and feels good.Most of my negatives have to do with the single brew side (which I will get to momentarily).There are two tiny things I wish were available on this model.One, I wish the power plug was at a 90 degree angle instead of a standard straight plug. Being so big and so wide it will go in front of my socket...which I don't mind if I could slide it all the way back to the wall but the plug gets in the way.Two, where's the white model? There isn't an option for that. But all of my appliances are white so it would be nice to have things match.A related potential ""negative"" I would say is that if you want to get a gold mesh permanent filter for the main brewer, it doesn't seem to fit well. They are fairly small and sit low in the normal plastic ""basket"" area where you put the paper filter. I find using a paper filter alone is far easier and more convenient. No big deal in the end, but I felt I should mention it because I thought I could get a permanent filter and have it be a nice match.The single cup side (keurig style) is a nice addition...with some caveats.It is part of the reason I chose this coffee maker, wanting that fast option if I only had time for 1 cup...or wanted to take it with me.It works, and I like the fact that it comes with it's own permanent gold mesh filter if you want to not use an actual k-cup or other brand (and yes, it will take any brand you buy at the market).That filter fits in the base under the single brew side (which holds the mug up high for less splatter or you can remove it if you are brewing into a tall travel mug). I nit pick that putting the filter back into the storage area is not convenient. It fits very precisely into the open space, so if it is off a millimeter then the container won't close. Not the end of the world but far more frustrating than it needs to be.There is a separate water reservoir for the single brew side, which is fine. It would have been cool to have a single water source, but that's not a big deal in my mind.What IS a big deal in my mind is that whatever water you put into that reservoir will brew. So you can't figure you are going to make 2 cups, one for you and one for somebody else and fill it 16oz. You have to fill 8oz (or whatever your desired amount) let that water heat, then brew your cup, then fill another 8oz of water and let that heat and then brew the second cup. It would have been far more convenient to have the entire water heat, then be able to select your cup size, oz of water to brew with, etc... like you can on an actual Keurig machine.It pretty much makes the single brew side literally a single brew side. You can basically use it one way, and one way only. That is a pretty bad design in my mind and removes the convenience of having that side built in.At the end of the day, it works. All of it is totally functional and I am not dissatisfied, but I am not totally satisfied either.The machine is big and takes up a lot of counter space, so for that amount of real estate I would probably rather have a separate pot brewer and single brewer machine and get better versions of both."
"We bought this coffee maker in February of 2024 in an attempt to consolidate counter clutter of having separate 12 cup percolator maker and a keurig. It's November now. The 12 cup percolator side works great, I love the delay brew setting. The k cup side of it, not so much. It often smells like burnt coffee when you use it, my husband has always complained about that. Grounds are frequently floating in the coffee. It doesn't seem to brew as hot as the old keurig, and I find I have to microwave the coffee after adding creamer or milk. In addition to the heat issue, it brewed a room temp cup of coffee this morning. Not sure what happened there. Maybe the coffee maker needed coffee. Probably won't keep this one long term."
"I purchased the Hamilton Beach 49902 FlexBrew Trio 2-Way Coffee Maker in August 2023, and my experience with it has been a bit of a mixed bag. While it has some notable advantages, I can't ignore the reliability issues that arose.First and foremost, I was drawn to this coffee maker because of its versatility. Being able to brew a single cup using ground coffee or K-cups, or a full pot for guests, seemed incredibly convenient. The machine's design is sleek and modern, fitting well in any kitchen setup. Setup was a breeze, and I found it quite user-friendly overall.Brewing a cup of coffee using ground coffee was a simple process. The coffee tasted rich and flavorful, and I appreciated the flexibility to choose my preferred coffee brand and blend. The option to adjust the strength of the brew was a nice touch, allowing me to tailor each cup to my taste.Where the FlexBrew Trio truly shines is in its ease of use and cleaning. The controls are straightforward, and switching between brewing methods is a snap. The reusable ground coffee filter is a practical addition, reducing waste and saving money in the long run. Cleaning the machine, whether by hand or using the dishwasher-safe parts, was hassle-free.However, my enthusiasm for this coffee maker took a hit when I encountered a significant issue. After just four months of use, the K-cup function inexplicably stopped working. I tried troubleshooting the problem, such as cleaning the needle and ensuring proper placement of the K-cup, but to no avail. The machine simply refused to brew using K-cups, which was a major disappointment.This reliability issue raises concerns about the long-term durability of the FlexBrew Trio. A coffee maker is an appliance that should withstand regular use, and a malfunction so early in its life cycle is disheartening. I expected better longevity from a reputable brand like Hamilton Beach.In conclusion, the Hamilton Beach 49902 FlexBrew Trio 2-Way Coffee Maker has its merits, including versatility, ease of use, and convenient cleaning. However, the abrupt failure of the K-cup function after just four months casts a shadow over its overall reliability. While it has potential, the reliability issue makes me hesitant to fully endorse this coffee maker. If Hamilton Beach can address and rectify this concern, it could be a top contender in the market. Until then, I would advise potential buyers to proceed with caution and consider other options with proven durability."
"I contacted Support through Amazon.  I completed the form provided and it referenced the product as listed on my Amazon account.  The form asked for a model and series number which were stamped in the plastic located on the bottom of the machine, which was full of water. The form said the numbers were optional so I did not provide them.  I got an email the following day which said they needed the model and series number and confirmation of my address in order to help me.  So I provided them.  The following day I got another email saying that they would replace the unit under warranty but that I needed to be prepared to wait 15 days to receive it.  I wrote back indicating that it only took me one day to get it in the first place and 15 days is a long time to wait without coffee.  They replied same day by email that it takes up to 5 days to process the order and up to 10 days to ship it.  They have no expedited shipping available.Amazon asked me to give feed back on how the manufacturer's support was. It asked only if they helped me, which they technically did, and if the manufacturer's information provided had been correct, it was.  Amazon gave me no place to make any comments about how unsatisfactory I felt the resolution was.  So, I am making those comments here.  Not very happy at all with Hamilton Beach support."
"Unfortunately this coffee maker was a disappointment. The carafe part of the coffee maker works great but I had nothing but problems with the KCup part of the maker. After a week the needle kept getting clogged and I didn’t even use it that much, plus coffee ground were always in my coffee cup. I bought a new needle which customer support refunded me for btw. I tried it today-the first coffee was fine but the sencond cup sounded like a struggle and sure enough coffee grounds were all in my coffee cup. For what I paid for this I expected both features to work. It looks like a just paid I lot of money for just a drip coffee maker"
"I love the optional feature of one cup or a pot, I have been using a Kpod system for over 10 years, my last one before this was an Amazon's basics which is still going strong.  With that said, I bought this to save counterspace and have the option of both.  I drink one cup of coffee a day, on bad days might be a few extra.  I love giving 5 star reviews, but for the price on this, not even a month later, I had to clean out the nozzle because it stopped working due to getting coffee in it.  This seems to be a common event with this machine.  I can understand after a year or even 6 months but I hadn't even used it for a month and I wasn't brewing a lot of Kcups.  The pot side still worked but I had to go in with... a paperclip after removing the piece that pierces the pod and clean the coffee out.  I would think Hamilton Beach would have come up with a better design.  So if your looking for a nice dual, its nice but don't plan on too many kcups or you will be cleaning this part just to make it work.  Wish I could give 5 stars but highly disappointed."
"At about the 8 month mark, the kcup side began having issues.  Overload messages were a weekly thing.  I make sure to clean and have replaced both upper and lower pod holder pieces.  I clean the needles regularly.Now it’s a daily thing, doesn’t matter what brand cups, incredibly seems to worse on Green Coffee branded pods.The drip side is excellent, works as expected.  I won’t be replacing it with the same brand/model."
"I just opened my box and made my first cup of coffee.  The jury is out for me on the flavor of the coffee it produces.  I'll be back to comment on that later.The one issue I have with this machine so far is with the buttons.  In all the photos of the machine one would assume that the buttons are easy to read, that there is white writing on black buttons.  VERY DECEIVING!  In reality, this is not the case.  The black buttons have gray writing on them making it difficult to read them unless you are up close and view them straight on.  These black buttons should either have white or silver writing on them, or they should be silver buttons with black writing.  There should be enough contrast to be able to clearly see the writing from any angle.  OR, better yet, the buttons should be backlit.  Otherwise, the overall design of the machine is fine."
I like the flexibility but there a couple things to consider. If you are making a pot you can not turn the warmer back on without brewing again if you want to make a single keurig style cup in between. Also I have only had it a few weeks and the single cup needle that pieces the top of the cups was showing a needle prompt to clean the needle already. This is somewhat of a pain using a small paper clip. I never had to clean my keurig needle but it was not as clean as thin machine. All in all I would still buy it again knowing what I know.
"Pros:The carafe side works great. I love that the coffee maker comes with reusable filters for both large and single serve. And that there is a place to store the single serve filter if not in use.Cons:Manufacturer needs to go back to the drawing board on the single serve needle design. The needle has to be removed at least weekly for cleaning or it clogs. Today I cleaned the needle and it immediately clogged when I stared my cup of coffee.  I now have 14 oz of coffee instead of 10, and 2 dirty cups.Due to the high maintenance of this machine I'm giving it 3 stars. If not for that I'd give it a 5 star because it does a good job at a reasonable price."
"At first, I loved this Coffee Maker. It was a dream come true. On days I only wanted a single cup because I was on the go, it was wonderful to have the choice to make a full pot or a single serving.The first machine I got, the single serve K cup broke within 2 weeks of me having it. It made loud noises and wasn't pushing the water out. I thought, no problem, one defective machine, so many good reviews. Amazon sent me a new one and took back the old machine no questions asked. That was at the end of August.It's now Mid November- 3 months later. On the new machine, the single serve side broke AGAIN. same issue, slowly pushing out water, overfilling any cup placed there (doesn't keep track of how much water it's actually pushing out) with the added bonus of now being ICE COLD. The heater doesn't seem to be working. Honestly, getting one defective machine, sure. Having 2 defective machines in the span of 4 months seems improbable. I wouldn't' waste your time or money on this. I've contacted Hamilton Beach for a new coffee machine, but it seems that I will be re-contacting them every few months for a new coffee maker at this point.Save your time and frustration and get another coffee maker!!"
"We have had this machine for for a month before returning it for a replacement. For some reason, the needle clogs frequently making it go into error mode. Removing the needle for cleaning is awkward and time consuming. The carafe works well."
"I purchased the item in March. It just broke down on me on the single serve side. Water is no longer going from the reservoir through the machine. I tried cleaning it well. That didn't help. If you buy this, be prepared to buy a new coffee maker within a year."
"The glass carafe broke during the first year and there is no replacement for it. Waste of counter space for a single cup coffee maker, which is all it's good for right now."
Seems to work fine. My issue is there is no adjustment for just keep the pot on warming for hours - shuts off to quickly for my long term use. Gonna return
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Last summer, my trusty old Keurig finally gave up on me, so I decided to get a new coffee pot that also has a single cup maker. My husband thought it would be great for those times we want a full pot at home or just a quick cup to take with us.However, we ran into a bit of trouble right off the bat. The first machine we received had a broken glass pot, which we noticed before even unboxing it! We hoped we could just get a replacement part, but customer service ended up sending us a whole new coffee maker instead, which felt like a silver lining at the time.The new coffee maker does a decent job with single servings—it brews quickly—but there's a catch: the coffee is barely warm, which is a bit disappointing. When we tried to brew a full pot, we hit some major roadblocks. I programmed it to start at 3 a.m., but by 5 a.m., we hadn’t seen a drop! Plus, the machine got so hot that it caused the water to evaporate, leaving grounds in the reservoir and not brewing properly.My husband took on the challenge, trying everything from changing outlets and relocating the machine to checking the breakers, cleaning the coffee maker, and even watching YouTube tutorials for tips. Despite his best efforts, the coffee maker kept stalling for a whopping seven hours, and still no coffee was made!When we reached out to customer service, they informed us we couldn’t return the product since they had already replaced it once. After numerous attempts to get this coffee maker to work right, it’s clear it’s not living up to our expectations.So, I've decided to treat myself to a new Keurig instead!"
"It looks nice enough and does the job, but lots of things I don't like:-the single cups do not brew hot. Warm at best- the single cups always have a ton of grounds in the brew- single cups splatters a ton- in the previous version, the basket under where you place the cup on the single side was smooth and had a removable lid. This time, it's ridged and you have to remove the entire basket to wash it. The only way to get it clean in the dishes is to use a scrub brush- on the carafe side, there is no indicator letting you know how many cups worth of water is in it."
Like the features of the unit like the dual use carafe or individualI just find that the brewing is very very slow especially in the carafe
"very pretty looking coffee maker, I love the white. The only problem is when I put in a K cup. The water doesn’t go all the way through ,the water just stops and I have to press the button a few times.  Sometimes it just doesn’t even work very disappointing."
Worked well but started having issues at the 20 month point.  On the search for something better.  Not Keurig went through too many of them!
"**** UPDATED**** on 03/07/2024- So we are having a fairly annoying issue with the POD brewing half of this unit now. For whatever reason it is constantly getting plugged up with coffee grounds every day from the pods and having to be taken apart and cleaned out, and NO we are not using cheap coffee pods. That is why I prefer to wait a while before writing a product review. ***** I have purchased 3 Keurig's in the past 4 years, and they have all failed short of my expectations of getting a high-quality product for the price you pay.  In my opinion Keurig is overpriced junk! So, I decided to try a different brand this time. After reading a bunch of reviews on different styles and brands I settled on this Hamilton Beach 49902 FlexBrew Trio 2-Way Coffee Maker, Compatible with K-Cup Pods or Ground coffee. My wife wanted one that she could make an entire pot to pass around the table when entertaining guests And I like the convenience of single serve and this unit serves both purposes quite suitably. It works very very well so far, and I have made coffee all 3 ways meaning Pods, the 1 cup ground adapter, and an entire pot full. I also like that it gives you choices on single serve such as light or bold brew and that it shows you the progress of your brew in ozs until complete.  I know this is early to be so satisfied but hopefully a year from now I will continue to be happy with this product."
"I had such high hopes for this as I have owned Hamilton Beach coffee makers in the past.The caraffe side seems to work fine. Coffee brews as expected. However, the single serve k-cup side has significant issues. The one plus is it brews pretty fast but that may be because it doesn’t heat the water long enough. The coffee is just not hot enough. Secondly, on about the 3rd cup ever brewed in my brand new machine, it malfunctioned. I got an error that said overload. The water level was perfect but it only brewed about 1 once of coffee before it made a loud noise and quit working. After going online and searching for answers I was directed to clean out the needle and to make sure no air had gotten into the line. Ugh!After removing and cleaning the needle and also banging on the water reservoir to clean any air out of the line, unplugging and resetting the clock-it started working again. I now feel obligated to unscrew the needle each time I am about to brew another cup of coffee. I only use bottled water and fresh k-cup pods and the one time I didn’t wash the needle out prior to brewing, it gave me the error again!Too much work and clearly a bad design on the k-cup side. I have never had another machine require all the extra steps just to get a quick, not very hot cup of coffee. I wouldn’t buy this particular machine again although I have had positive results with their other products."
"I can't read the control panel buttons, they are all black, no white overlay!"
Haven't had any problems with it so far.The single brew and full carafe work perfectly fine.The only thing I don't like is you can't turn off the glowing display light unless you unplug it.
"First off, to fix the 'Clean Needle' error.  Under the k-cup or filter holder on the single serve side where the water coming out of the filter/kcup gets funneled into a stream for your cup below.  There is a small x across that opening.  Just before the water falls into the cup.  Drill that x out.  It causes back pressure that sets off the needle error.Second, grind your coffee to a coarse grind, not fine.And lastly only use one tablespoon of grounds, and absolutely no more than that.  Again pressure build up is the problem, and it's not coming from a clogged needle.None of that should be necessary, but it is.  Following those guidelines I now get a decent cup of coffee out of the machine, when setting it to Bold.  What saved this machine from a one star review is that it was possible to actually make it work."
I bought this as a gift 10 months ago it was doing good no problems but the painted buttons were wearing off. the more important thing is the cup side is making a loud scary noise not taking water and spitting it back out in the tank I did see another comment stating around the same thing that happened to mine so maybe it’s a some what common thing to happen after awhile.
"So, I figured I would write a small review because I hesitated in buying this due some of the negative reviews. My honest answer after using it for 2 weeks. Don't hesitate. I'll list Pro's and Con's and you decided on your own.Pro's:1. One coffee maker instead of 2. See, number 42. Uses K-cups or use the separate filter for your own. (Very easy to use and clean)3. Try and start a brew cycle for single serve with no water in the tank, it will let you know. (oops)4. Yea, it's larger than your average coffee pot....guess what Negative Rocket scientists, it's replacing 2 Pots.5. Easy to use controls.6. Cheap enoughCon's1. I hate a 2 hour hot plate shut off....personal thing, add 1/2 cup water and start again. It's gone before it shuts off again.2. Ain't got no moreOther comments:Top fill requires you to move it out if under low cabinets to fill (a great hardship to some, I just slide it forward, fill and slide back).It's not as fast as a K-machine.....oh, for pete's sake people, it's not a K machine!!!! Keep your old K machine and buy a coffee machine in addition if you can't wait about 2-3 minutes for coffee.I have to fill it every time for a single cup......more trauma for some. Personally, I like fresh water better than water that's been sitting in a machine or tank till ready to use. If you really want to you can fill it up with it's 8-10oz and leave it, machine knows the difference between pot and single.Coffee flavor......tastes like coffee, all subjective, if yours is to weak, get a stronger kind, again not Rocket Science.I can't taste any difference between Regular and Strong, again subjective.Hey, at the price you can't beat it. Cheaper than a K machine and if unhappy with speed and size go for the $199.00 Silver Cuisiexpensive.That's about it, other than the longevity test......****UPDATE****8 months later I had to buy another coffee pot.Out of the blue it decides to blow the tops off the pods and give me coffee grinds all over. Doesn't matter what kind of Pod. Tried everything, Cleaned it, flipped gasket seal....same!So, rating dropped and will not get another one until this issue is taken care of by company."
"I turned it on and smoke came out. I let it sit and cool off, but now all I get is cold coffee. Luckily, I can still use the carafe side."
"I purchased this coffee maker with high hopes, but my experience has been nothing short of a disappointment. Let me break down the reasons why this coffee maker left me frustrated and dissatisfied:Dealing with malfunctioning appliances is frustrating enough, but the added hassle of navigating their warranty process and paying for shipping made me regret ever buying this FlexBrew. My mornings turned into stress-filled episodes as I tried to coax a cup of coffee out of this temperamental contraption. I expected better from a brand with a reputation like theirs.The warranty on this coffee maker is laughably inadequate. After just two months of use, the machine malfunctioned. I expected a reliable product, especially considering the price point, but alas, that was not the case. When I reached out to Hamilton Beach for warranty support, I was met with a bureaucratic nightmare. The limited warranty barely covers the blink of an eye, leaving me feeling stranded with a broken appliance.Hamilton Beach insisted that I pay for shipping to return the defective coffee maker. Seriously? I already spent my hard-earned money on their faulty product, and now they want me to foot the bill for their mistake? Unacceptable."
"The k-cup side,  I've cleaned out the needles getting error messages. Every time it will never give me the correct amount of coffee selected. I always seem to get maybe 6oz of water no matter cup size I choose. To bad i tossed the box. This thing is not worth the money at all."
"I bought this to replace a similar Cuisinart model that is no longer available.  The brewing time and temp are about the same.  Our big complaint is that the hot plate which is supposed to keep the coffee warm will burn the coffee in a short time.  Drops of water actually sizzle when they hit the hot plate.  I did a quick experiment with tap water and it raised it from 50 degrees F to 150F just sitting on the plate.  It would be nice if there was a setting to warm as the Cuisinart had.  We have always put our coffee in a thermos but after one or two cups.  With this one we have to put it in the thermos right away.  Our other complaint along the same lines is there is no indicator that the pot has finished brewing, like an audible beep.  There is only the word ""brewing"" until you turn it off.  The pod side works fine and does have the nice feature of choosing your cup size in OZ between 8, 10, 12, and 14."
"From Hamilton Beach website:“Let’s face it; if you make your coffee in the morning, you’re probably too tired to measure out the grounds. But if you add too much or too little, you could ruin your much-needed wake-me-up. Try to remember this: the basic ratio is 1-2 tablespoons of coffee grounds per cup (6 ounces) of coffee, and a typical coffee scooper is equal to about 2 tablespoons.”OK then, by their own directions for brewing for this coffee maker, which say you can put a MAXIMUM of 60 grams of ground coffee in the brew basket, you can only brew six cups ( 6 ounces each) if you want anything that almost resembles coffee.Our family “recipe” for coffee is 60 grams per 1000ml of water. Our now-deceased previous flexibrew model easily handled 90 grams of grounds.This is a dealbreaker for us.This unit will be returned, unused."
"The concept of this coffee maker is great, but has quirks. We have found significant amounts of water sitting on top of the grounds after brewing has completed. It also collapses the filter and causes a mess, on occasion. They put a hole through the back where your pour the water (?) so you have to be careful how you pour the water to avoid it coming back out again. We do like the separate reservoirs for kcups and carafe. Would not recommend."
"This is the second Flex Brew unit we have owned and really like the design, functionality and coffee quality. The ONE issue that has been a royal headache since receiving the NEW unit 2 weeks ago is that even though there is nothing stating it, I believe the unit we received is either rebuilt or REFURBISHED! I was suspicious when I opened the box and saw that some of the filler pieces were TAPED together. Not a problem though. The problem came the next morning when I got up to a nice fresh pot of coffee and then found that half of the pour spout was BROKEN OFF! I contacted Amazon who referred me to the vendor, NexGen to report the problem. They responded that I should return the entire unit in the ORIGINAL shipping container. The original box went in the trash about a minute after I sat the unit up on the counter. I requested that they simply replace the carafe to which they responded that they don't deal in PARTS! They did offer me a $20 refund, which was OK except the new carafe I ordered from Amazon cost just under $30! I'm out 10 bucks and SEVERAL e-mails, but now have a new carafe and some extra life drama to think about while I drink my morning cup of brew. UPDATE though, I guess the Hamilton Beach came through. this morning I received another e-mail saying that they were sending me a FREE replacement carafe! Guess it can't hurt to have a spare. the moral of this story is BUY DIRECTLY from the vendor!!"
"I got this machine to replace my Keurig Duo, when that quit working after about 4 years. I liked the Keurig better, mainly because it has only one water reservoir to fill. This new machine is also a bit more complicated to operate. I think when this one quits working, I'm going to look at having two separate machines."
Works good but the needle for the pods clogs every 10 pods. Would return it if I could.
"First, I would have rated a 3.5 if that was an option.  I love the concepts of this product, and it makes a great cup of coffee on both caraf and pod side.  The pod side is the problem.  It worked well for a few months. (Purchased in Fall of 2023.)  Then it would stop part way through a brew with the message 'overload'.  I googled a fix for this message.  I found steps to clean the needles.  It worked following this process for 3/4 cups.  Then the same message appeared.  I cleaned again with the same results.  I sent an email to the company.  They added a step to run a cup of just water through with the upper gray piece removed.  I have continued to use this process after brewing a few cups or when it quits working.  Yes, this is very inconvenient and isn't a 'fix'.  FYI!  The company offered for me to return for a new machine. Based on what I read in several reviews, this must be a flaw in the design which I hope will be corrected. So, getting another would not necessarily fix this issue."
"The self serve side has grates where you pour the water in so you can’t wipe out the reservoir, and if you have hard water like I do that’s a big disappointment. You can’t use the timer feature with the single side which is also a huge disappointment because that feature is one of the reasons I bought this. My husband and I rarely make a pot of coffee and use the single serve side 90% of the time. The lid to the carafe side where you pour in the water isn’t designed well and gets in the way of pouring the water in and it splashes everywhere. The little platform and accessory holder thing on the single serve side is actually in my way all the time because we use large and tall travel mugs so I’ve had to find a place to store it - it also does not actually fit the pieces inside it’s supposed to for the k cup thingy so it’s just a worthless piece of plastic I had to figure out where to put it. The little coffee grounds filter on the single serve side is shaped weird and grounds get stuck in the cap and bottom all the time so cleaning it out is a huge pain. My last coffee maker filter was super easy to dump grounds and just give a quick rinse, but this one you have to like dig in there and it’s time consuming and messy. I literally disliked this maker as soon as I started using it and wish we had a way to return it but didn’t know we’d be unhappy and threw everything away because who has this many opinions on a freaking coffee maker?? Lol I didnt foresee this coming and learned my lesson, keep the box!"
"The Good:  it makes decent coffee (and I suppose thats good enuf for most people). The Bold flavor setting allows me to cut back on the usual 1 tablespoon per cup and that saves coffee and money!The Bad:*  the Trio feature of carafe, single K-cup, or single brewed cup is great - until you find out you can't use more than one feature at a time! (ex; brewing a carafe is a slow process so I thought maybe I could get a K-cup while I wait...nope!*  would be nice if it sounded a signal saying your carafe is brewed and ready*  the ""Keep Warm"" for the carafe is pretty tepid and cannot be adjusted higher or lower*  also, that ""Keep Warm"" only lasts for 2 hours and again cannot be adjusted longer. Always shuts off before I can finish a carafe...so I get cold coffee.*  this coffeemaker is both tall and  'top loading' for water, filter & coffee grounds. Keep this in mind if you want to position it under top kitchen cabinets (you have to pull it out to load it, then push it back under)*  No battery back-up for the clock and timer. If you lose power - you lose your programmingAnd its Ugly! - a brutal design more fitting in a factory  break room than a home kitchen. The large blue backlit display for clock and programming if always on and obnoxiously bright - and again cannot be dimmed."
"Of course things went crazy after my return time limit ran out. I bought this model wanting to replace my Keurig dual when it's brain fried. At first everything was great. Then the single cup started giving at least a half oz. or more of water per single cup. Then the needle started clogging every other cup. Then on the carafe side, it started giving less water  into to the brew. Where did the extra water go that I had put in, to brew a certain amount go???? I have no idea. Evaporation?  All in all. The only positive I found was the single loose coffee feature. It was great to fix a single cup of coffee of my favorite brand. This was the main reason I wanted to try this unit. MY advice. DON'T buy it.  I'm probably just going to cut my losses and buy another Keurig."
"I am so disappointed in this coffeemaker. I wanted to buy an exact replacement of my last maker and thought I was but this one is different. The single side has an inferior base (where your cup goes), in order to make a full pot of coffee you have add more water after filling the pot. I know this makes little sense, but it's true. The design is bad, so much condensation on the inside of the lid causes water to fall when you lift the lid to make more coffee. The worst part is the front glows a bright light that you cannot dim or turn off. As if I need to spend more on electricity. And of course there is just enough of a difference that I cannot use my old coffee pot. My last maker lasted several years and made 2-3 pots of coffee daily before it started to leak from the bottom. If I hadn't just wasted 100 on this one, I'd hope this one doesn't last so long. Ugh.  If you're looking for a coffeemaker, I really think you're better off buying the Flex Brew model 49976"
"After barely one year, the single serve side quit working.  So many people have complained of the same thing - water gurgling and making horrible noises.  It used to work again after major cleaning many times but not this time... I'm finally done with it.  After wasting 5 K-cups and cleaning every possible place, it won't brew.  Finally made coffee in the pot (which works great).  Loved it when it worked but I wouldn't buy it again.  Going on a search for another dual coffee maker.Original Review:I waited to write a review until I had used the coffee maker for a few months and I'm glad I did. Loved the machine for the first 3 months as it was so easy to use.  The best feature is the refillable container for the single serve as it separates from the machine for filling and cleaning.  Now for the reason for 3 stars - after 3 months the single serve threw a code and wouldn't brew (had hot electrical smell).  I contacted Hamilton Beach and within a few days received a reply that they are sending a new unit to me.  I would have given the review 1 star but upped it to 3 because of they are making it right.  We'll see how long the new one lasts."
"I've used a similar FlexBrew from this brand for several years until my old one ( had it around 4 or 5 years) started not working well in the last month...my k-cup side, which I use most of the time, was not giving me full cups even with same amount of water in it. It would splutter, took longer to brew, and seemed to be having a difficult time brewing so I did a good cleaning cycle and unclogged the needle, but it didn't help. I decided to order this new one because it has more cup size options and I liked the removable reservoir (old machine didn't have that) for k-cup side as I thought it might be easier to clean.  I just got my new coffeemaker Monday and got it set up later that evening, rinshed out the reservoir good before putting it back on, then brewed several cups just clear water to clean out any residue or dust that might be inside it. After it sat for few minutes, I tried brewing a standard k-cup (same kind I've used all the time in old machine) and noticed the smell of hot plastic as it brewed. Fixed my cup of coffee like I normally do after brewing and I could taste plastic even with creamer/sugar in my cup like normal...I drank about 4 sips and had to pour it out. Once it cooled I pulled out the used k-cup and it looked little warped and shrank down from original size...never had the old machine ever do that so it puzzles me why this new machine did that. Has anyone else had this problem with it doing that and plastic tasting coffee?I haven't even tried the carafe side yet as I'm not sure if I'm going to keep the new machine because as I said I primarily use the single serve side so if the coffee isn't drinkable this is going back. I'm going to give it a couple tries, but if it continues definitely returning this one.It is a nice looking machine that does brew fast and heats water up well, but I want to be able to enjoy drinking a nice tasting cup of coffee so it's useless to me if I can't fix one...very disappointed in this new coffeemaker."
"It may be a good value for the money and it seems to function well but it feels cheap and I would not buy another one.  I question whether it will last. The carafe is so thin it has to be fragile.  The biggest issue is, no on/off button.  Instruction tell you to plug and unplug brewer for each use.  So you leave it on always or you have to reset the clock each time to use the delayed brewing function.  For me this makes the delayed brewing function worthless.  I love the concept and it will work for our weekend home.  Will buy one for my home also but will spend a little extra next time for a quality brewer."
"This coffee pot does everything I wanted from a drip coffee pot/single cup  except give me a hot cup of coffee.  I even tried setting it up to make the coffee 45 minutes before I got up because the coffee wasn’t hot when first brewed.  That didn’t work.  The coffee is just warm.  I’ve had to put each cup in the microwave for 45 seconds to get it hot.  It would be perfect if I liked just warm coffee.  It’s the same with both the carafe and the single cup…..warm coffee.Update:  The single serve side needle clogs EVERY TIME I USE IT with my coffee pods.  Mine clogs at 4 oz every brew!  You have to take it apart, clean the needle, run water through it and then try to make a cup of coffee.  I set mine at 10 oz cup size.  Even after cleaning the needle, it will stop brewing at 4 oz with needle code!! I can’t get the darn thing to brew past 4 oz …. AND YES, the needle is clogged EVERY TIME  (even after cleaning it).  I have a $20 plastic single cup pod coffee maker that NEVER FAILS.  This coffee maker is terrible!  After trying the single serve side I took a star away.  I gave it one star because it was delivered the day after I ordered it(Probably because they want to empty the warehouse of these Pieces of Junk. I do NOT recommend anyone buy this coffee maker.  It’s a rip off!!!!!!"
"We bought this unit for our new shop back in July. We didn't actually get the office up and running until around the middle on November. In the beginning we absolutely loved this Hamilton beach coffee maker as we have a lot of this name brand within our home. The unit has only been used maybe 20 times or less to make single cups of coffee or hot chocolate, and we have NEVER made an actually pot of coffee. Today during a meeting one of our salespersons wanted a cup of coffee. In the middle of brewing the water line blew within the unit (I know this as my husband and I took it apart to see what happened, and the metal clip that is supposed to hold the water line in place was off and there was water all inside the unit) and I literally had water everywhere on my counter that ran onto the floor. What a mess to clean up, needless to say embarrassing. Being in business myself I understand that somethings do happen but not something that has been barely used. I have a Keurig at home, as well as in the office of my other work place and both of them have ran hundreds of cups of coffee, hot water, hot chocolate, etc through them. For the first time I am very disappointed in a Hamilton Beach product."
"I bought this on January 23th, got it on the 25th, two days later.  I was happy with the first single side cup I made using grounds, that was all I had at the time, after the first cup it hasn't worked correctly as far as how much I got using the single cup, the amount is off, 12oz in a 12oz cup is too much, so I set to 10oz and am lucky if I get a half a cup in a 12oz cup, these problems are ongoing and I have decided to put up with them.  Now after barely 2 months I am having all the problems below:Problem 1). As described above:  I set the cup number to 12oz, that SHOULD fill my cup, it is actually too full but my cup is that size, so I have to set it to 10oz and get a little over half a cup, sometimes not quite half a cup ... there is to consistency to how much it brews on the single cup oz setting.Problem 2).  My machine just started doing this, I brew a single cup set to 10oz, using a Kcup, I am getting an overflow error and water is going all over the counter. I have cleaned the needle (it wasn't clogged), still getting error ... unscrewed and took out the top piece the needle sits in, poked the top and blew through it, coffee grounds came out ran water through, now flowing through, water wasn't going through before I did this. I had the exact same problem the very next day ... apparently I will have to take this apart daily if I want a single cup from now on.  I am using the same kcups I bought here on amazon, they worked fine for a month, now this ....Problem 3).  12 cup on the full pot setting is actually 10 cups in the carafe, it is filled as high as it can be filled which is suppose to be 12 cups a full pot, it isn't, it is 10 cups.Problem 4).  The full carafe takes f--o--r--e--v--e--r to brew.  Single cup takes the 90 seconds advertised once you work out the bugs each cup you make ... see problem 2 above.I am calling the company today and want a refund, having the single cup is nice but not worth the trouble, I have an older Hamilton Beach with the single cup feature which takes forever to brew but I have been using that for a couple of years with NO ISSUES, so going back to that.  Will be returning this and/or filing a complaint with the BBB if they won't take it back.  I would not buy this again, will update if I can as to what the outcome with Hamilton Beach is."
"This coffee pot really does it when it comes to the option of making a full pot of coffee or making an individual cup with a pod. We are really enjoying the versatility of not having to brew a pot when only one person wants coffee. However i have2 main  Complaints .. It really does take a long time to brew a pot..and that is even on the regular setting as well as the bold brew and even when making just 4-6 cups.  Its obviously more noticeable when brewing a fresh pot for now..instead of when your sleeping and its preset for a certain time.  Secondly the warming plate holds for 2 hrs it claims, but honestly barely  keeps the coffee warm.. We always have to  re- warm it in the microwave or add less milk or drink it as soon as its done. As for the taste..I think the coffee is good because of the blend i have created not because of the pot.  Its a shame we have to compromise on some key features to get other enjoyable features.  One day I'll find it all! Also need to mention the need to use large coffee filters to prevent grind spillage into the machine and your cup...otherwise the grinds  overflow the filter"
"We clean the needle after every use on the single cup side and we continuously have issues with it. If we use the coffee filter it will make about 1/2 the cup and then when you pull out the filter , the excess water drips out. The K-Cup also sparingly works. Sometimes it works fine but you never know what you are going to get. Just a frustrating part as one of the reasons we got it was so we could make the single cup without having to brew a pot of coffee (that side works with no issues)."
"Only had just over a month, and it's already acting up on me.  The keurig side will not work now. It reads needle on the screen.🤦‍♀️of course it's just past the return window by a week.😡 better off to buy from Walmart, so I could have taken it back .😡 lessons learned."
"For context, I have had this pot for about half a year. I originally gave it a 4-star review, but the honeymoon phase has certainly ended. I always swore by Hamilton Beach having high-quality products, but now I am unsure.The good: Sturdy design, sleek, looks like a high-end appliance for your kitchen. Brew strength options, and the ability to make a pot or a single cup. The coffee pod side has its own reservoir so you don’t have to add water with each brew.The bad: Hoo boy. Always had issue with the carafe getting grounds in it, which is a minor inconvenience, but not the best experience to drink. After about 3 months, I began having this “overload” error when brewing pods. This is, allegedly, caused by the needles getting clogged, but I am doubtful that is the case. When the overload error happens, your pod is unable to be brewed (except for an ounce or two), so it wasted an entire pod. This wouldn’t be an issue if it were a rare occurrence or user error. I closely follow the care instructions in the manual. Vinegar brews, needle reams, always making sure this thing is clean because I love a great cup of coffee. And when it works, it makes great coffee. But, 3 more months later, and I get the overload error after every other cup. The needle is clean. The pot is clean. But it still is clogged somewhere that I cannot access, it seems. Coffee pods literally explode and shoot grounds everywhere now. I don’t even want to make k-cups in this thing anymore. So now I just have a bulky carafe that spits grounds into my coffee. Lovely.The insulting: Hamilton Beach refuses to take accountability for the issue. Customer service was rude, dismissive, unhelpful, and told me to do what I had already been doing. This is a sign that the product has a design flaw - their own advice doesn’t resolve the issue! I also paid for a 4-year Asurion plan, but they refuse to do anything. Directing me back to Hamilton Beach, who won’t do anything and wants to direct me back to Amazon, who won’t do anything, because it’s not their product. I am out a lot of time and money on a defective product that should be simple. I just want coffee, man.It is beyond exhausting as a consumer to purchase a garbage product from a big company that refuses to take accountability. Everybody got their money. Now I can just go pound sand, I guess."
"Let me preface this by saying I LOVE this model, and it's my second one because of a cat/toddler/great dane and sandwich meat incident. But the first time I turned it on to make a pot of coffee with the new system the glass of the carafe Shattered. I have no patience for trying to replace the part right now,  or processing a drawn out return/replace of the entire coffee machine..... not to mention I threw away the box right after opening like a person trying to make sure it went out on trash day...Single cups of coffee for a bit I guess 🤷‍♀️"
"We have enjoyed the Duo a great deal. We are finding that we RARELY use the carafe side--next one will be just the single serve.  It's all very easy to clean and has worked well until now (25 months old).  It is now leaking water from the Single Serve side.  It leaks just sitting there, and I'm unable to find the location of the leak.  In trying to problem solve found that this is a COMMON problem with these models.  This is not a cheap machine, and I'm hoping that replacing the reservoir will fix it; unable to find part for just the seal on the bottom that may be causing the problem.  On repair chats it is common for a hose from one of the water pumps to come loose."
"From the first use it seemed to do real well, I like the various cup sizes and the choice of standard or bold strengths, but after about 10-15 cups it started clogging and giving an error message of ""needle"". We found we could clean it out and make it work again, this may be a real irritation fown the road."
"I purchased this used b reservoir from my first ut good. It came with the water reservoir broken and no coffee basket. I would just like Amazon to send a new reservoir but that's not one of their options.  Otherwise, I love it. It's my 2nd purchase. So I'm using the reservoir from my old one that quit working."
"This is by far one of the most frustrating pieces of equipment I have in my kitchen. 1) the carafe broke about a month into using it and I have yet to find another one that fits (the one made for this one is always “out of stock”) so we’ve been using the single brew side. The problem j have with the single brew, is the stupid needle that punctures the pods. Its got a hole in it, so the coffee grounds will get stuck in that and you’ll be 3 seconds into a brew and suddenly you hear a god awful noise and the screen saying overload. I’ve got into the habit of checking the needle before brewing, like I JUST did, it was clear and it still clogged. The amount of pods I’ve wasted is so sad due to this is so sad. As soon as I’m able to replace it, I am!"
"once the 2 hours after brewing is over, you can't just re-set the warming plate to keep the coffee hot, if I would have known that I would not have ordered this..too bad the other reviews didn't mention it.."
"This coffee pot worked great for a year then the problems started. The K cup side gets clogged every time you try to brew a K cup, if you don't clean after every use it gets clogged (the small silver spike used to pierce the K cup and run the hot water through for brewing) and it overflows into the water reservoir for the carafe. Tried everything and nothing works to keep it from getting clogged, ran white vinegar/water through for several 12oz cup cycles and that didn't work. It's very annoying if you are in a rush and want a cup of coffee using the K cup, which is one of the main reasons this unit was purchased."
"I've been using this product for 5 months now. I've only successfully gotten 2 cups of coffee out of the single serving/kcup side of the unit. It either spits and make a huge mess with coffee and grounds everywhere or simply won't brew.We use the carafe/full pot side of the unit on a daily basis. It has worked well and gives the coffee good flavor. We LOVE the programmable feature so we can set it a few minutes before we get up in the morning and it's ready. However, the lid where you pour the water has broken...one of the little ears broke where it attaches to the unit itself It still works but you have be a little careful.Overall, I'm giving this unit a 3star rating because the we mainly use the full pot side. However, I wouldn't have paid the price to have this feature if I didn't want to use it occasionally and now I don't have the option."
"Have had this coffee pot for 9 months. It looks pretty, but has lots of issues. The single brew side has a really hard time brewing Kpods...it just sucks coffee grounds up into the needle and water dispenser. Now it keeps saying FILL H20 even when the reservoir is full to max. The carafe side also has issues brewing. We have tried multiple brands of grounds, tried grinding our own to a more course ground and still have issues with overflow."
"After using this item for over a year, now, I feel completely comfortable expressing an experienced review.  The carafe function operates as you'd expect from Walmart-esque sellers.  Nothing exceptionally stand-out.  I purchased this item, fully reading the reviews, advertised descriptions and price points, among the other options.  First, thing first, second thing, next...packed well, coffee carafe brewing is as expected from Mr. Coffee, of 80's fame.CONS::: 1.- trying to figure out how to put together the single brew side was confusing, instructions lacked (in my personal opinion) depictions without labeling ""Part A"" ""Part B""...etc. It made the pictures of the single brewing process harder to figure out.  I have 20 other things I can be doing to be productive in my life, rather than figuring out a Chinese Puzzle Box that I didn't spend my hard earned money on for entertainment, without the entertainment...2.- How can I put this?  Coffee needs to be in my veins and brain before the 30 minute mark.  ""Sure"", he said, sarcastically, ""Why not set the coffee brew at 6am so it's ready for you when you wake up?""  Well, sir, there's this::: A) when I get up at 6:30am, it's still not done brewing...and...B) if I want to brew a pot for a drop-in guest we have to wait nearly 45 minutes for the pot to be ready.  UGGH...................PUHLEASE>..................So, it must brew faster with the single brew?....not exactly.  Takes about 10 minutes IF.... IF you really want to go through all the quirks with the function.  Specifically, errors pop up that you have no idea how to solve.  We go to the troubleshooting guide, included in the booklet.  No help there.The power cord is shorter than the length of an umbilical cord.....need I say more?"
I used the coffee maker for about 1.5 months and the K-cup option stopped working.  It started making a strange noise and then nothing would come out.  It prints Overload on the coffee machine screen.  I found a suggestion online that said to turn it over and bang on the machine.  I did that and it started working again for a while.  After 3ish weeks it started making that noise and not working again.  Banging on it hasn't worked since.  I used the pot option but I'd prefer to have both options since that's why I bought this one.
The coffee cup piercing needle design is flawed where it becomes clogged.You can use a paperclip or other small metal wire to brush the inside loosening any debris which might blocking the flow of water debilitating the machine.  You should see a small amount of coffee or tea debris free from the needle.  Run a couple of plain hot water cycles without a coffee cup to clean any remaining remnants.
"I am an avid Keurig user, however, this dual coffee maker appealed to me.  I liked that it gives the option to brew either a single serve K-cup or a whole pot of coffee. I also liked the overall appearance of it and that it was white and matched my kitchen better.  Here are the reasons I went back to the Keurig:1. The single serve option brews very slowly.2. The Keurig seemed to brew a hotter temperature of coffee.  I like my coffee my coffee hot!3. The single serve option was messy.  I found myself having to clean the ""coffee catcher"" every time I brewed coffee.4. The number one reason.... My k-cup coffee does. not. taste. the. same. using this coffee maker.The coffee pot side worked just fine, like any other regular coffee pot. So, if you use this side more often than the single serve, this may work just fine for you."
"It was a fantastic machine until it broke. The KCup side started making some loud noises when it wasn’t even in use. Then this morning it would only brew cold coffee. Sounds like the heating element blew. We use both sides every day. My husband and I drink from the carafe side and our daughter brews a KCup. I’m VERY upset that this thing lasted from July 14-Sept 9th. RIP. Trying to get anyone on the phone for support - don’t bother. The company only communicates through email. *** update: after 3 weeks of back and forth emails with customer service agents at Hamilton Beach, I was sent a replacement coffee maker. However, I had to pay $14.99 for shipping. Kind of unfortunate since it wasn’t my fault that it broke in the first place and the item was under warranty."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            After about 7 weeks our single serve K-cup maker would only dispense slightly over 2oz. of coffee no matter what cup size is selected. I cleaned the top needle that stabs into the cup & the discharge of the cup, both were clear and not plugged. I checked the discharge of the water reservoir and water is being supplied. I unplugged the unit for several minutes to “reboot” the maker.  Still no go. One occasion I pressed the brew button for a single serve and both sides of the unit turned on. Another occasion I removed the water tank to refill it and it started brewing by itself.Two calls to Amazon customer support were a complete waste of time. The agents could barely speak English and were asking me troubleshooting questions like, “is it plugged in” and “does it have water in it?” Realizing this was a waste of time, I finally sent a support request to Hamilton Beach explaining what was happening. To their credit, I received a replacement unit via UPS which was a complete surprise.The replacement unit however is a different model than what I paid for and has fewer features and a smaller reservoir than the one I purchased from Amazon.  I purchased model 49902 which has a 56oz reservoir and can single cup brew cup sizes 6oz, 8oz, 10oz, 12oz, and 14oz. Hamilton Beach sent me model 49904 which has a 40oz reservoir and can only single cup brew 8oz, 10oz, and 14oz cup sizes.I suppose I should be content finally having a coffee maker that (so far) works, however I ended up with a lesser product having fewer features than what I originally purchased and paid for. Very frustrating.Update: The replacement sent by Hamilton Beach has failed miserably after only a couple days. It scrolls an overload message even without a k-cup in the machine. See short video.UPDATE #2: I placed another call to Amazon and was able to communicate with the customer service agent. An exception was made and a replacement unit of the same model was sent. The defective unit was returned.. It's only been a few days but so far so good. Lets hope this one lasts.UPDATE #3 The second replacement unit failed on May 21st. The single serve maker spits the hot water through a bypass into the reservoir for the carafe maker. Nothing is plugged or jammed, the unit was kept clean. It is a useless piece of junk and I WANT MY MONEY BACK !!!!!"
"I returned this item due to two problems.  One was the coffee maker.  the element wasn't hot enough to keep the coffee at any temperature then lukewarm.  The second was the needle. It kept getting an error.  I don't have that kind of time to keep cleaning out a coffee pot's  pod needle and heating the coffee in the carafe in the microwave to get it to a hotter temperature.  I think Hamilton needs to up their game on their flex coffee pot, because if they did, they would have a really great product."
I have had the machine for 9 months and around 3 months it became an issue keeping it clean.  It overloads if you don’t take it apart and clean every part every time you use it or it faults out or lets grounds into your cup.  It still works but you have to clean it every time and pray you will have coffee in the morning.
"I loved this product the first few days I had it, but then I kept getting the needle message every couple days. It was extremely difficult to fix, even after carefully following instructions. Worked with customer service. Before I figured out this was a problem that wasn't going away, I had missed the return window, but I'm still working on trying to get a refund."
"I'd really wanted one device for single serve and also a carafe. The carafe has never disappointed, except it brews more slowly than other models I've had. The single serve is where I have big issues. First, there was something wrong with the water level sensor. Halfway through brewing it would indicate that I needed to refill water, when I had nearly a full tank. So i would have to press brew multiple times to get one 12-oz cup. This would have been a minor annoyance if it weren't for the other issue.Second issue: there seemed to be something wrong with the mechanism that pulled water from the single serve tank up into the spout. I noticed lots of sputtering and a TON of steam coming from the machine when I would do this. Then, the machine was very inconsistent on how much water came through the spout. If i selected a 12-oz pour, sometimes I'd get 9oz, sometimes 6oz, sometimes 2oz...never 12-oz. So I'd run the brew again. Along with not getting my full brew and all the sputtering and steaming, I noticed that my carafe water reservoir would collect water when I tried to brew a single serve. Ultimately, its like water would try to pump into the single serve dispenser after it had been heated, but there was a leak or a disconnect somewhere where some volume of that heated water would end up dropping into the carafe reservoir.I've had the machine since October 2022 and its gotten progressively worse. I thought I could fix this but I am only average handiness and didn't want to start taking it apart to fix. I didn't return it early on when I had the chance. So I'm going to replace with something else. Disappointing and sounds like maybe I had a lemon but in case anyone else has a similar issue....I couldn't fix mine."
"I honestly want to live this machine. It’s the nicest one I’ve ever bought myself, unfortunately it is also the worst. If I do the bold brew method there is always grounds in my coffee, no matter what. You can see in the photo the water just fills up but doesn’t drain quickly enough, then the grounds begin going under the filter and into the pot. I have tried multiple different filters, amounts of coffee, amounts of water. Honestly this machine was making me doubt my own intelligence, but there’s no way I simply forgot how to make coffee after 15 years of doing so! I could never actually brew a full pot of coffee in this thing without getting grounds in it. It can barely handle making half a pot without grounds. I thought the single cup brew option was a lovely idea - unfortunately it’s already errored out after brewing less than 10 single cups (yes I found the YouTube video and yes I cleaned the needle even though it wasn’t clogged). Unfortunately I just kept trying different things hoping I could adjust and keep this coffee machine and now I am out of the return window, stuck with this crappy machine and out $80 so a negative Amazon review it is!"
"We bought this coffee maker for our Airbnb. From the start, guests had trouble because the reservoir will brew all the water in it unlike other machines.We made a sign and that mostly took care of it but then it started to leak so we got rid of it. It did last longer than the Keurig Duo we had..but neither lasted a year."
"This is the second time I ordered this Hamilton Beach flex brew after a while maybe six months, the needle clogged up then they send you this long list of things on how to take the machine apart to clean it I tried it the first time took everything apart and it took me forever to clean it and put it back together. It was such a hassle but anyway, that still didn’t make it work. They did send out a new one. However, now this one is clogged I’m pretty sure they all clogged eventually but I had a Keurig and I’ve had it for two years and it never clogged. This one keeps clogging around six months. I’m going back to Keurig. But on a good note, I did like that it gets hot faster and starts pretty much right away unlike the Keurig but still, I would rather deal with it taking longer to start then to deal with clogging and taking it apart."
"This coffee maker gets slower and slower to brew. We have had it 4 months, I have cleaned it 4 times and it still hasnt improve. It takes 1/2 hour to brew a 10  cup pot."
This was my second Flex Brew.  First one lasted 3 years then theK- Cup side quit working even after following all manual directions for care and use.  Would only produce 1 oz of coffee each time.  Ordered a new Flex Brew and the K-cup side started the same problem of only 1 ounce after less than a month of use.The warranty department will not replace the machine unless I send them a picture of the cord being cut off and then they will replace the machine in 10 to 15 days.  In the meantime I have no way to make coffee because they want me to disable so the carafe side cannot be used while awaiting the replacement.  Since I had already disposed of the older machine I have no spare.  This is extremely poor customer service and also says that their appliance reliability is also very poor.  I will just purchase another brand of Kcup coffee maker and set aside the flex brew for when I want to make a carafe of coffee and will most certainly let everyone know how poor their customer service is as well as the apparent lack of quality in product.  Do not buy this product!!!!!
Just wish the serving size options were bigger and brighter.
"Love this coffee pot but the single side has stopped working and it’s less than 30 days old.  It seemed to overheat/smelled hot, now it won’t heat up.  Carafe side still works."
This product takes a very long time to produce a cup of coffee even in the pot it takes a long time to make a full pot of coffee very slow process
"This is the second purchase for the same reason. The Kcup side stops working and gives me the ""overload error"" message.  The first one I just thought was a faulty coffee pot because it worked for about a month before that happened. Replaced the coffee pot and have enjoyed using the Kcup side since February, until today. Now I'm getting the same problem as before. Obviously it is not just a faulty pot. After seeing others having the same problem I decided to see if I could fix the problem. In the top of the Kcup side you can slide it to the unluck position, slide the rubber gasket off and gently pull the grey piece out. That the where it is clogged. I took a sturdy, thin piece of wire and poked out the gunk stuck in the piercing piece.  Ran the Kcup side again and now it is running. For now. Guess this is what will need to be done every so often. At least now I know it can be fixed and not have to throw a $100 plus coffee pot out."
"I initially came to update my review I made shortly after purchasing this item a little over a year ago.  To my surprise, my original review (3-4 stars) was now deleted.  I came to reduce it to 0 stars.  So, let me provide this updated review of my experience after 16 months of use.To cut to the chase: avoid this coffee maker and all Hamilton Beach products at all costs.  They are poorly constructed and are nothing more than cheap disposable items that break after 1 yr or light use.  Avoid!!!Now to the details:First, I made this purchase to replace the Mr. coffee carafe that had last me ~ 10 yrs of daily use.  I also had a Keurig that was about 5 years old and in great shape.  This seemed like a good idea to save counter space.  Bad idea on my part.Problems with the carafe (and included with my initial review): The carafe side dumps coffee grounds into the pot all the time.  When I first bought this, I started using regular paper coffee filters and was only making 6 cups of coffee (not the full capacity of the pot).  Every time the filter would fold over, and grounds would be in the coffee.  I fixed this by purchasing a reusable basket, but I noticed there were still small coffee particles getting through.  Combining the basket with / to hold up the paper filters worked well.  So, the carafe side required some additional purchases to make it function properly.Problems with the single-use/K-cup side: As I mentioned in the original, deleted review this machine functions differently than a Keurig and it is important to be aware of these.  The water does not stay heat like a Keurig.  You add the amount of water you want to brew each time and the Flexbrew heats and dispenses the entire amount.  Because of this heating step, it takes longer than a Keurig.  I also think this is the flaw in the design and why the pumps burn out on these so quickly (explanation to follow).  About a month ago (again after light use of ~ 16 months) the water stopped dispensing.  During the past 16 months I only use water that had been run through a softener, been treated by reverse osmosis and then had been filtered through an inline refrigerator filter.  There were no hard water/particulates.  When the dispensing problem occurred I made sure everything was cleaned (reservoir, needles were not clogged, etc.).  There was no obvious cause and it appeared and sounded like the pump was defective.  The water was heating and was just not dispensing.  So, I contacted “tech support” to obtain parts/advice needed to fix the pump problem.  What an absolute joke.  Once I was able to reach someone from “tech support”, I was told I would need to buy a new coffee maker.  I explain I just wanted help repairing this, and all they wanted to do was sell me a new unit.In summary, stay away from Hamilton beach products and specifically this product.  They are made to be disposable, are next to impossible to reach and have no competent tech service.  It is not worth the money to purchase a coffee maker every year.  Save yourself time and frustration and purchase coffee makers by other companies.  I currently have a Mr. Coffee and Keurig, both have been dependable for several years in the past."
"When I purchased this model I really wanted to mostly use the single cup side of the coffee pot, and so I did, I thought it was strange that often the full carafe side would steam up and end up taking on water you need to dump out, (not the most convenient way to do it)However the single side was fantastic, still is and I love it but I had company come in from out of state so for the first time in almost a year since purchasing this I made my first pot of coffee, 10 cups, and omg the grounds where everywhere inside as if the nozzle just blew them out of the filter. They were down in the water reservoir too. I only used 2 small scoops to test it with.After spending 30 min to clean the whole thing top to bottom I tried to make another pot, and after the 4th time I give up, I am not sure if anyone else is experiencing this from the carafe side but I found it is impossible to use, I blame it on poor design!The single side is great so that is all I will use for now!!"
"We liked the coffee maker, as it had the full pot and single cup options.  The single cup options provided more sizes than other single cup only devices.After eight months, the single cup brewer no longer functioned properly, we cleaned it regularly, so that was not the problem.  Something within the mechanism caused it to not pump correctly, and the water would overflow into the coffee pot resevoir.When contacting Hamilton-Beach for service (within the one year warranty), we were told that they wouldn't do anything because it wasn't purchased direct from them or Amazon.  When we contacted the reseller, Deal Depot Plus, they told us that it was past Amazon's return policy and they do not offer warranty as it's not their product.  Poor customer service on both ends.Overall, we liked the machine, but not customer service when something went wrong."
The needle that pokes into the K-Cups that pumps water into it constantly plugs up with coffee. They should include a few extra of them with the coffee maker. That way you can still make you a cup of coffee while unplugging the other one. I use factory K-Cups.
"I am very disappointed with the single brew side. After only a few uses I was receiving a replace needle message. I cleaned it out, and it worked for a few more uses.  I am once again receiving the same replace the needle message.  To put this into context, I have not made it through a box of 24 pods.  I wish I had spent the little bit extra money and purchased the Kuerig brand maker."
"...but up until then, we were really enjoying it. Really stinks, that they're not made to last anymore. If you're paying $100 for a coffeemaker, you expect to get at least a year out of it.I was filling the reservoir on the ""Singles"" (K-cup) side this morning. Ten or so seconds after I hit the Start button, this thing made a loud BANG, then began leaking hot water all over my counter from the hole where the plug comes out. It ran all over my counter and beneath my (plugged-in) toaster, so I tore both plugs out of the wall, then and sloshed the coffeemaker over to my sink.Spent the next ten minutes, pushing counter water into the sink basin, then mopped up the floor. Have you ever tried to clean up a mess of that caliber WITHOUT your morning coffee?So being that it arrived almost six weeks ago, it can not go back to Amazon. I got on Hamiton Beach's website to file a warranty claim. Turns out the only way you can contact their customer service is to email through their web-form. And after you that, you get an acknowledgement, stating that it could take up to a week to get some help, because they have higher-than-usual numbers of people needing assistance these days. Perhaps if they'd kept up the quality of their small appliances, this would not be a problem...?I definitely don't recommend their coffeemakers, for sure - especially since I have no idea when the company will ever respond back to us, to make this right."
"Not very convenient to use for K-cups.There is no water reservoir for the K-Cups, you must pour a cup full of water into the back of the machine every time you make a single serving. This is annoying since after you pour it in, you have to wait for the water to heat every time. It takes at least 4x longer than a normal Keurig machine for a single cup, and is a lot noisier.There is not much leverage in the handle that punctures the two holes  in the K-Cup, so you have to shove it down pretty hard, as both holes are punctured at the same time.The small, removable plastic basket holds the K-Cup is a source of irritation. Sometimes the basket gets in crooked, and the bottom of the K-Cup doesn't get punctured, resulting in a back-flow of hot coffee and grounds out the single hole in the top which is a mess.When the handle is lifted with a spent k-Cup in the basket, the needle in the top of the assemble will 'hang on' to the K-Cup and the plastic basket just long enough to let both fall on the floor, splattering a few coffee grounds around.The stand that holds your coffee cup while it fills is tall, but there is only a very shallow depression in the top of it to catch any overflow. if you put to much water in. the overflow goes onto the counter.On the positive side, the 'BOLD' setting does make a cup of coffee that is stronger.The drip coffee maker side of it seem to work fine, at least as well as the $19.99 'Mr. Coffee' I was using.In retrospect, having two the different coffee makers types (drip and K-Cup) stuck together in a single device doesn't seem to accomplish much, other than maybe saving a bit of counter space. After getting it and setting it up on my counter, it seems silly to have the two stuck together."
"Product is very good overall. Coffee comes out hot and delicious.  Our only issue, albeit a big one, is that we cannot read the labels on the buttons.  In every picture they are white like they are lit up, however on our machine they are a light shade of white as if they should light up.  Is this the way they are supposed to be or are we missing something?"
"i also experienced dreaded ""overload"" error. read one review about cleaning needle. didn't work so i added a few more steps that seems to have solved problem, ""knock on wood"".  after rinsing needle took compressed air can used on computer keyboards. put little tube into top hole and blew out more grounds. other problems mentioned by MFG were with the Kcups, soft water, etc. i started using bottled drinking water. also started using reusable Kcups with my own coffee. the coffee is cheaper, control amt. of coffee. only been a week, but everything is working so far."
I wanted to love this coffee maker but I don’t. After just a few uses I had to clean the needle. That is frustrating. The single serve side is where the issues occur. In the middle of brewing a cup the lid pops up. Would not recommend.
"I enjoyed this coffee maker while I had it. I bought it around Christmas as a gift to myself and was excited to use it. Both the single brew and the pot brewed coffee great… until it didn’t. I went to brew myself a cup of coffee the other morning and the coffee maker would make a concerning sound, then give the error message “overflow”. Even after all the troubleshooting it still wouldn’t brew.You get what you pay for I suppose… I switched to a keurig and have liked it more than this brand."
"Loved this for the first week. Brewed using either option and delayed timer. Got up yesterday to brew a carafe and .... nothing. Says its brewing and then warming, but it does neither. Delayed function also not working now. Single serve is still working, thank goodness. Contacted Hamilton Beach customer service (since that's where Amazon directs me without choice) and received an automated notice my issue is ""under review"" and it could take up to a week to be contacted about the problem. Good thing Hamilton Beach doesn't manufacture pacemakers. I will update if/when I hear back  and/or this is resolved."
"UPDATE: I bought this in March 2023.  Now, November 2023, the K Cup maker no longer works.  $100 for 8 months of utility is no good but past the return window.  Hence, my rating goes from a 4 Star to 1 star.Helpful hack added to original review:I make 12 cups of coffee each morning and each time, the grounds overflowed my filter.  I contacted Hamilton Beach twice for tech support and they first suggested I play with the coffee to water mix (Note: I was using 2/3 of a cup of coffee and 1 cup was recommended so that didn't work) The second time they essentially said I needed to follow the manual.Soooo.... I purchased tall Buns filters and Viola!  Problem fixed.  I have been using them for a week and NO overflows.  I know this will fix your issue if you have the same problem.*************************************************************************************************************************It's a good value and you probably won't find a 2-way, 12 cup coffee maker for less money. It makes good coffee and I am happy I bought this coffee maker.  I like how the single serve coffee maker allows you to make 6, 10,12 and 14 ounce cups. I took away a star for a few reasons:- It takes 15 minutes to brew a carafe of coffee and it is a bit noisy.  Most other makers do it around 10-12 minutes and often times, quieter.  Not a big thing to me since I use the timer and am up when the coffee is brewing.- It doesn't have a carafe warmer button.  The coffee maker shuts the warmer off after 2 hours.  You have to press the ""Brew"" button to turn the warmer back on but the maker tries to make coffee and I don't think this is very good for the maker.  Additionally, the warmer doesn't keep the coffee hot enough in my opinion.- I like to drink a single cup of tea after coffee and found that if you have the coffee maker set up on a delay timer, you have to turn it off to use the single cup maker, then turn it back on afterwards.- The lid for the individual cup 56 ounce reservoir is not conveniently hinged like the carafe reservoir."
"I purchased the Hamilton Beach 49902G FlexBrew Trio 2-Way Coffee Maker on March 24, 2023, and for six months was amazingly great.The K-cup function stopped working, showing on the screen a message about water reservoir needs to be loaded, but I always kept it full. I tried cleaning the needle and making sure that the K-cup was properly in place. It didn’t work.I check on many Youtube videos on how to fix the issue and a year later, the only thing that I do to make it work is push the brew bottom five times and works. I notice that some water comes from the center that has two small holes and gets into the carafe reservoir."
"I rec'd this on 8/1/24, and today is 8/27/24. I was so thrilled with this machine. Loved everything about it. Then I was setting the carafe for the next morning, and when I pressed the button for the timer, the cappuccino side kicked on and there was smoke rolling from all seams all around! Damn near caught my kitchen on fire! I hurried and unplugged it to make it stop and was ready to throw it out the back door.  Now this morning I just did a test run to see what it would do. The carafe side works, but the cappuccino side just buzzes. Evidently the pump for the water has burnt up. I will not be using this anymore and just very disappointed. I haven't had it for a whole month and now its trash!"
We had an older model and it worked great. Just didn't survive a child pouring milk into it. Figured I would buy this as replacement. Not happy with it. The k-cup part keeps getting clogged and requires cleaning multiple times to get a single cup to brew. Threw it out after cleaning and trying 6 times to get a single cup of coffee. Don't waste money on this model.
"I got this because my Keurig was old and working slowly. The first K-cup I ever put in this thing blew up. Grounds went everywhere inside it and in my cup. I have made 4 k-cups since and 2 of those blew up. So, 3 out of 5 have exploded. I've cleaned out the needles every time and it doesn't matter. Even if the k-cups dont pop, it never gives me the correct amount of water. I always seem to get about 5 oz of water no matter what. This thing is not worth the money at all."
"While I have not used the carafe side at all, the single serve side is very disappointing. It's barely warm. After I add the milk, it's literally cold. Now, I find I'm past the date to return it. An expensive regret"
"UPDATE: Please disregard my original review. I’m leaving it for sake of record.5 days before my manfacturer warranty was up water started leaking out the BOTTOM of the coffee maker. I made sure that I set it up right and did some double checks. Turns out that as soon as the reservoir was placed on the coffee maker, the water was leaking out the bottom.I called Mr. Coffee only to find out that I was sold 2016 July’s model in 2017 January. I was told to email customer service with my order and that I couldn’t be helped over the phone for that reason. So I did, and I got an email stating I would get a reply in 3 days. It has been 7 days, my warranty is now out, and I didn’t have a coffee maker.Since I once loved this one so much I grabbed another one from Target. 2nd brew it blew coffee grounds ALL over the place. I did everything the same way I used to, with the same coffee and this was the result. I tried 3 more times with the same results. I’m returning the new one as defective and Mr. Coffee won’t be seeing any more of me. I have had plenty of $20 coffee makers that worked better and longer. I will probably only keep the thermal carafe since it hasn’t betrayed me yet.Attached is a picture of the new coffee maker every time that you fill it above 8 cups.————-I purchased this coffee maker back in January 2017 for my husband's birthday and have waited until now, June, to review. Many of the reviews I initially read made me nervous about purchasing this, due to the changes that they stated happened in the long term. Today I would not hesitate to purchase a second one, although I don't see it going any time soon.We are heavy coffee drinkers who make multiple full carafes a day. Quite often we replace makers more often than 6 months due to burning them out. This product has taken all of our abuse and is no worse for wear.Note that:- I cannot comment on the filtration, because we use already filtered water.- We use a reusable container for our coffee grounds.- Although some reviews mention weaker coffee, we found that ours seemed stronger. This may be because our old coffee maker was taking 2 hours to fully brew!- Some people said to make sure you clean it often and well to avoid acid wear on the gasket. I am ashamed to admit that we don't always do this, but happy to report we've seen no difference.My favorite things- The thermal carafe. I am still amazed at how hot it can keep the coffee and for how long. Without the burner it cannot get burnt and thick over time. It's not often we have any left, but we have been surprised with steamy coffee a few times when rinsing it at the end of the day. Plus without the burner being on, we saved on our electric bill- The removable water reservoir. Very convenient for filling and cleaning. I've personally never had a coffee maker with this option.- The speed. I timed it the first day we got it and I timed it again today. It still brews in about 8 minutes. In my experiences many coffee makers get slower and slower. From what I've read coffee is optimally brewed in a short time at a temperature no higher than 205 which is what this offers.Potential negative considerations- It will steam. I personally do not have an issue with how much steam is produced unless I make multiple pots in a row. If you are concerned, I would pull it away from the cabinets and definitely not store potatoes above it. This could be definitely be an inconvenience for some.- The coffee does pour a little slower than I want it to. You pour it by holding a trigger and tipping. I often have to remind myself not to try tipping it further over to make the coffee come out faster. The hole is only so big and tipping it further only gives me a pointless arm ache.- It can make a mess if you don't pay attention. Two times since owning the coffee maker we have failed to put the carafe fully in and it did get coffee on the counter.Overall, I give this coffee the best rating and would happily recommend it. I still brag occasionally to visitors and my husband about how proud I am of my purchase. Most of the potential cons are either user error or unrealistic expectations. If you want your coffee to be reliably poured and kept hot in a quick manner then this is for you."
"I have now purchased 4 of these coffee makers.  I gave one as a gift and just ordered my 3rd one as another replacement.  I love this coffee maker.  I use the “strong” feature and that it’s programmable.  Of particular benefit to me is the stainless steel carafe.  I make my coffee in the morning and take the carafe with me to the living room.  I’m retired so I really like it.  Here is where the problem comes in.  I have extremely hard water and if I don’t wipe down my faucets every day, they will have corrosion on them the next morning.  The switches on my two non working coffee makers stopped working.  I believe what happened is that the steam affected the wiring connections and corroded them.  When I went to clean the coffee maker today, I pushed the clean button and it tripped the GFI every time.  I wound up using the brew feature to run the white vinegar through it.  The first two coffee makers lasted approximately one year each.  I like having the second carafe and I have a bunch of water filters for it.  But, if this third one goes bad,  I am going to send all three back to Mr Coffee.  I contacted them and asked about repair parts, but none are available.  Good Luck"
"This machine replaced another older Mr. Coffee thermal coffeemaker that we were fairly happy with for about 3 years, until I discovered black moldy gunk coming out of the water tank when I decided to give it a full cleaning and turned the machine upside down to drain everything.  I had been doing the recommended 'vinegar mix' on the machine's clean cycle, but clearly the built-in water tank (which is black, so you can't see into it) gets pretty gross after awhile.  Anyway, decided I would have to find another thermal carafe maker with a removable water tank.  First purchased the KitchenAid 12-cupper [ASIN:B003TSYRRW KitchenAid 12-Cup Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker, Countour Silver]] but was very unhappy with the poorly designed carafe that you could not pour all the liquid from without turning it completely upside down and shaking while making a big mess, so I returned it.  Thought I did my research on this one but of course, you don't really know until you actually try the machine, and here is what I found.  Pros: very nice look, carafe is easy to use, pours well and quickly, and no leaks or drips for us. Coffee is hotter than any other machine we have ever owned or used, stays hot for hours in the well sealed thermal carafe, and a potful is made quickly.  Also, the side mounted filter basket and removable water tank is very convenient, and like the feature that reminds you to clean after 90 cycles.  The CONS: Ok, so our old Mr. Coffee thermal had a regular and a BOLD brew feature.  We always used the BOLD and it made great and rich tasting coffee, with less grounds!  It's a shame that they did not include the BOLD feature on this maker, as it really does need it.  The coffee is definitely weaker, and we are using almost twice the amount we used in our previous Mr. Coffee, and STILL we cannot get the same rich flavor.  I have to agree with the other reviewers in that because this coffeemaker makes the coffee so quickly, a big plus, it definitely produces a much weaker strength brew.  And I am not a fan of 'dark, strong' coffee like my husband, but I like a medium but rich flavor.  The 'bold' brew in the old Mr. Coffee did take longer, but it produced a nice rich and consistent flavor.  The second thing is the lid on the removable water tank.  First, why make it so complicated?  It lifts then falls over to the opposite side, where it blocks out the 8 and 10 cup water levels.  So, if you are making 8 or 10 cups of coffee, you have to hold the lid up slightly with one hand while peering under to see when to stop pouring water in.  Did no one even test this maker at Mr. Coffee?  I tend to spill water when filling because one hand is being used awkwardly to hold up that stupid lid. Why not just have a hinged lid that flips up to the opposite side?  I am convinced no one is testing anything at companies these days as this is the second coffeemaker I have purchased within 2 weeks that had such obvious design flaws that should have been discovered in product testing before they went into production. Anyway, we can get decent coffee out of it by increasing the amount of coffee we use, but because our usual amount is 8 cups, I'm annoyed each time I have to fill the water tank to that level.  And from what we've heard from friends who have also gone through multiple coffee makers trying to find a decent one under $100, they all have flaws.  Mr. Coffee (and all the other brands for that matter) needs to pay attention to these reviews, fix these obvious design issues, incorporate the best features into one product, but most importantly, TEST the products!  Anyway, we have had this machine for exactly 1 week, are not sure yet what to do with it, but will update this review one way or the other in the next few weeks.Ok, it's been about 6 months and I am using a paper filter inside the gold basket filter each time to slow down the water flow.  This makes the coffee with a bolder flavor, similar to the BOLD setting on our old Mr Coffee machine.  If I use just the paper filter or the basket filter, the coffee is very weak and we would have to use a lot more coffee to get the strength we like.  And I still get annoyed EVERY time I have to fill the water tank.  It is still impossible to see the 8-cup water line without awkwardly lifting the lid while at the same time pouring water into the tank.  So I would still give it only 3 stars."
"I am a huge fan of coffee.  Back in the day I would spend hundreds of dollars at local coffee houses (not starbucks tho lol), but then I went overseas and experienced their coffee's and brew techniques, and switch to doing it myself. Long story short, my high quality coffee station broke and I needed a replacement. I wasn't going to spend so much money on it, or at least not for now since it's a temporary solution, or so I thought.I received this product after only 1 day, this was much faster than advertised. I unpacked the coffee maker and was first very impressed. There was no chemical or plastic smell as others have reported, or you're used to when unpacking some cheap brand coffee makers.But then and this is why I give it only 3 stars, I got to the actual thermal carafe and while it's stainless steel, the upper part were the lid meets the steels is plastic, and in my case this plastic did have a huge white stain all around it. It kinda looked like somebody poured some glue or white paint over it, and it ran all over the connection. I tried cleaning it with warm soapy water, even with white vinegar, and while the stain faded it's still clearly visible. At the price this coffee maker is offered, I shouldn't have to deal with that, or this shouldn't even be an issue to begin with.If I didn't needed a coffee maker that badly the day I got it, I probably would have returned it, or ask the seller to replace it. But I don't have time to go to their website and get in touch with them, or having to wait some weeks before getting a replacement. So this was very aggravating to be quite honest and probably the reason I can't give it a 5 star rating.Back to the coffee maker itself tho, I didn't experienced as others have reported any leakage. But you do have to empty the thermal before using it another time, even if you plan on brewing less cups, or it will spill. Sometimes it's difficult to remember such thing, especially in the morning, since this coffee maker doesn't have like other machines an indicator on the carafe or machine itself. But you will get the hang of it after a while :)I use mine with filtered water only, therefore I can't comment on the actual water filter that's installed with the machine. But I do love how quick it is, and how quiet it is. I do live in an apartment building and work at nights. I make lots of coffee at 2 or 3 am, and this machine in comparison to other ones, do not disturb my neighbors, and trust me our walls are paper thin. One thing I would like to change is that annoying beep from the machine itself, after the coffee has finished brewing, it will beep 3 times. But it isn't just a beep, it's very loud and this could be a problem if you have people sleeping in your house etc.I love the cleaning function, and while it's a full 45 minute cycle, it does all the work for you. Just fill it with water and vinegar solution or any store bought coffee maker cleaner and you're good to go. Unless as others have reported you hit the button on accident, which I can't really see happening since the button is not even slightest close to the actual start button, you will have nothing to worry about. But even if you do that, you can just plug the coffee maker out and wait 5 minutes, after you plug it back in, it has reset to it's default settings. You wouldn't have to wait 45 minutes and run through the whole program that way.It does keep the coffee very hot, even longer than advertised (2 hours I believe is the manufacturer's take on that, at least in the manual) but I find myself having fresh tasting coffee, that's extremely hot even after 7+ hours. However to be able to archive that, you will have to do some preparations. I mostly boil some water in my water cooker, and then put it into the thermal, close the lid and let it stand for 5 - 10 minutes. Open the lid after, remove the hot water, close the lid and then place it under the coffee maker and press the start button. This will heat the thermal carafe from the inside and keeps everything very hot. If you don't want to go through this hassle, I tested it just for the review, running warm/hot water from your sink through it will at least keep it 4+ hours hot and fresh tasting. But even without doing any of that, you still get a good 3+ hours give or take out of it.After all I am very pleased with the coffee maker and would recommend it, however I am still salty about the weird stain, that makes the whole thermal less appealing when placed on the coffee table."
"Worked well for a couople of years, but the thermal pot is not useless because it doesn't keep this hot for more that about 10 min and there is no pot warmer!  I am reduced to making a pot and pouring it into thermal drink holders right away. I am getting another."
"The product we received included a thermal decanter that had an irregular discoloring around the entire decanter directly below the handle fixture (please see photo). The stain is undoubtedly the result of excess adhesive that leaked out from below the handle fixture. I have requested a replacement and will update this review after receiving replacement.For what it's worth, I like the removable water reservoir, side-loading basket and other features. The unit also fits perfectly on my retractable shelf.If the replacement decanter is not marred, and the coffeemaker brews a quality pot that stays warm for a few hours, I will be a happy camper and will bump up this review by two or three stars. BTW, I am a loyal Amazon Prime customer with no axe to grind. I have always been treated fairly and expect this transaction to result in my satisfaction.Update 3/5/17The replacement unit arrived within a few days, and the new decanter didn't have the stains as on the first decanter.The coffee is noticeably weaker than that made by the thermal Cuisinart DCC-1200 this coffeemaker replaced. The solution was to adjust the grind down from the 9th position to the 6th on our Cuisinart DBM-8 grinder. Same amount of water (5 oz. per cup) and same amount of coffee (one level scoop). We use paper filters, so there's no issue with spillage as others have reported with the permanent filter. BTW, I recommend inserting the filter basket before placing the decanter on coffeemaker tray to ensure proper decanter alignment.The decanter and filter basket are easy to clean, but a small amount of water does seep into the area below the outer upper portion of the decanter. My solution to force out the excess water is to give the decanter a few good shakes downward while holding the decanter upright . There is also a very small amount of water that does not get forced through the system after a drip cycle. I usually roll up a small paper towel and stand it up in the bottom of the unit where the water is dispensed to soak up the excess.My wife and I like our morning coffee, and this coffeemaker does a good job of making enough coffee for the two of us, and keeping it warm enough long enough for us to enjoy. I consider it a good deal for the $55 we paid.Update 8/1/17The clean light came on a few days ago. Today I got around to cleaning using vinegar. The first part of the process went smoothly. Then the machine started making a loud, screeching noise. This continued for several minutes while the timer counted down to the second cycle. I called the Mr. Coffee warranty hotline (1-800-777-5452), and the rep offered to send me a replacement. Of course I accepted (at which point I unplugged the noisy coffeemaker). When I asked if they wanted me to return the defective unit I was advised to just cut off the cord and keep whatever I wanted for spare parts. I'll use the (2nd) replacement until it dies or misbehaves. No more Mr. Coffee for me after this one. The quality of these units has declined over the years. I can no longer recommend.Update 8/8/17The replacement from Jarden Consumer Solutions arrived today, and it's not the same model. We now have the 12-cup model. It's much the same, but the parts are not interchangeable. I'm keeping the 10-cup carafe, and throwing out the old coffeemaker. Hopefully this new unit will brew a good pot and keep it warm.I'm upping the rating on the 10-cup unit because 1) the coffee was good after I adjusted the grind, and  2) the manufacturer honored the warranty without any hassle. I accept that the unit we purchased was a lemon. It happens.For anyone wondering why the Mr. Coffee brand has taken a downturn, keep in mind the original company was purchased by Health-o-Meter, which was bought by Sunbeam which was acquired by Newell. And Joe DiMaggio is spinning in his grave.Update 4/5/18I had to clean the 12-cup coffeemaker several weeks ago, and the problem with the original 10-cup version did not surface. Overall, we are satisfied with the purchase. The new unit is consistent, and trouble free."
It was missing the water level piece in the water container. I kept ny old water container part and used it instead. It worked othereise I like the coffee pot.
"Just bought our 4th maker.  We like the speed of brewing, the separate water reservoir and the carafe that keeps the coffee warm for hours without external heating plate.  The first one lasted several years until leaking issues occurred.. the second one the carafe leaked from the seams and we contacted Mr. Coffee for a replacement that did not have these issues.  That model last 2-3 year then the spring in the basket stopped the quick cup feature.  No replacement screen available and ordered a replacement basket.  Was working fine for 2 months, then the carafe literally unscrewed where the black top connected to the silver pot.  We ordered a new one from Amazon in October 2024, received a few days ago, easier digital controls, but the carafe top holds water on the top and the spout leaks when tipped, resulting in coffee on the counter as soon as you remove the carafe from the machine and more when you pour your cup.  I love the machine in general but am done with the design issues and spending $80 (now) to $ 125 for a coffee maker every 2-3 years (or less).  This new model has issues and I do not recommend purchase.  I will be filing a complaint once again with Mr. Coffee in addition to this review."
"Got this for our vacation home..It works good ....tip(fill the coffee basket first not the water side...it will Leake out) timer works good ,and strong setting is different... cons: the brewed coffee temp is not as hot as our Zojirushi 200°F...and I don't think the carafe is insulated enough just an hour after brewing the coffee is Luke warm...where-as the zojirushi stays really hot most of the day. Maybe Mr.Coffee will read this and make adjustments... taste is fine cheaper than the Z brand.  Looks very nice. No spillage unless read my tip above."
"My complaints with previous product, exact same one, may become “repeated with this open box unit.  On previous machine, electronics didn’t hold up well under heat so we couldn’t set up automatic timed brew.  This one is already seeming to be better than the one in 2017 (which we kept).  All the insolatrd machines have their production problems, based on the reviews, but this pot has no problem with the basics.  It pours easily without dribbling.  It won’t bleed coffee all over your countertop as long as you have the pot lined up correctly.This one makes hotter coffee and stays hot for 4-8 hrs which exceeds the exact model we had before.  I won’t be surprised if it starts to  decline in first year, but this time my gamble to purchase at almost half price may negate any disappointments.  It does the job to our satisfaction and we look forward to 365 brewed pots of coffee.Final Addendum. oct 2017.  Sigh!  It’s over and caput.The great hot coffee in a well insulated carafe worked well for 6-8 mos, then LED readout began to fade.  It gets exposed to lots of steam, especially when you clean it by running vinegar then flushing twice more with 10-12 cups water at recommended intervals.  The temp of coffee is hot.  If it’s not 205 degrees, it’s close.  Add cream to your coffee 2-3 hrs later and still plenty hot.  Final blow was when we could no longer read the LED to set digital clock and delay brew time.  We contacted customer service before warranty expired.  They sent us another and all was well.  The LED readout began to fail before 6-8 months but we decided to live with it.Now it’s October 2017. A little over two years after initial purchase and the coffee is not 205 degrees or even 200.  I just checked.  It’s 180 degrees and I’m having to microwave my cup to get hot coffee. Two units bought a year apart and both units failed.I’m keeping the carafe and going Back to the stove top boiling water poured through a funnel with a coffee filter in it.After you reach a boil, wait two minutes and pour.  That gets it in the 200-205 temp range for good brewing.Not as convenient, but I’m tired of dying coffee machines.  Maybe you have to spend more than $60 to get something that lasts.(Below is my initial review)Taking into consideration that my last two coffee makers were sorry and I still used them for 5 yrs.  Wanted an insulated carafe and hot coffee. Definitely pleased with the flavor and heat of coffee.  Some reviews made me wonder if it would be hot enough, but I am pleased to say it is plenty hot.  Have to sip the coffee at first, even 2-3 hrs after brewing. I use creamer, and its still plenty hot.  We love the look of it too. Read the directions on setting the timer.  Once you set it a couple of days in a row, you will find it easy to push timer before bedtimeIm no Coffee snob, but i think this Mr coffee  brews excellent coffee.  Have owned it 4-5 mos and no problems.  It you arent paying attention and you dont place the carafe securely in place you might find a counter top of coffee awaiting you.Addendum: (July 2016)  still brews hot coffee but after 6 mos the LED clock got dim, then went black at month 10.  Called CS, they were nice,but you could tell they were contractors because it took 2-3 explanations before she said ""we will send you another"". Had it within 7 days.  Pleased"
"Oh gees, where to begin with this product. I am a positive person, so let’s start with something positive. This coffee maker makes a very good tasting cup of coffee. It really does. It all goes downhill from there though.For starters, the thing is huge and takes up so much room. We have plenty of room, but still, it is much larger than it needs to be. I understand the water reservoir takes up a good bit of room, but this thing is bigger than any other automatic coffee maker we ever saw. It is HUGE.  And while the 1st few cups pour so beautifully, once you get below half of a pot, forget about pouring it without it dripping all over the counter. If one is like super, super careful, one might be able to pour with only a bunch of drops spilling, and if one just tries to pour normally, you might as well just pour it straight onto your counter. Wow, what a mess. And while it is easy to clean the basket, it is impossible to properly clean the lead as it does not come apart. We have had this for just over a month, and there is already coffee starting to dry up and cake up in the lid. Not the worst thing, but it shouldn’t be like that. The lid is far too complex, and should be simpler and able to pop apart for a thorough cleaning every once in a while. Okay, so here is the worst part of all. Every 9-12 pots, the water fails to penetrate all of the grounds, totally wasting the entire pot. This first came to our attention, when one morning, I woke up to what I thought was a complete fresh and delicious pot of coffee. (We had used the timer feature and set it the night before.) I poured a cup, and I immediately noticed that the coffee looked very light. I tasted it. It was super weak. I then checked the basket, and saw that about 30% of the ground coffee was totally dry. Huh? The entire pot was far too weak to drink, and we threw away the near $3 worth of Illy coffee beans, and started all over. This happens so often that we stopped using the auto timer feature, and once we turn on the coffee maker, we have to turn it off and check to make sure all the grounds are getting wet. It is very frustrating! I should take a picture next time it happens, and add it to this review. Also, and finally, we have had this maker for almost 1 and a half months, and it still smells like hot chemically plastic everytime we make a pot of coffee. Really nasty. It's like on the one hand, you get the great fresh coffee smell, but there is also an odor of the hot plastic coffee maker mixed in with it. Disgusting. We thought the smell would have gone away by now, but it has not. Probably cause the thing is just so gosh dang HUGE in size, and it made of like way too much plastic. Plastic, plastic, stinky plastic.Sadly, it appears that most all plastic, $100 or less, auto coffee makers all suffer from some, if not most or all of these issues, so it does not seem like we consumers have other options that would be much better. Still, we hope to find a better option, and if we do, we will update this review.AND TO ALL YOU MANUFACTURERS. YOU SUCK. MAKE US A BETTER PRODUCT FOR ONCE AND FOR ALL. Thanks!PS: Oh, yeah, on more thing. The plastic lid on the basket that holds the water filter keeps popping off when we wash the basket. Not a huge deal, but just so poorly designed and made, like the rest of the coffee maker."
"We've had this coffee maker for a year and loved how quiet it was, how hot the coffee was, and how fast its brewing time was. And I'm glad that this machine does work for some people who have given it positive reviews, because when it works, it's great!HOWEVER, all the reviews about the thing leaking are true, and I must offer a mea culpa to all those folks since, I'll admit, when I read those leaking reviews, I put it down to operator error, because honestly, how hard is it to run a coffee maker? But after a year of battling, cleaning up after, cajoling, pleading, cussing, complimenting it when it did a good job, stressing over, and babysitting this thing (heck, I have a husband for that), I've learned the error of my ways and heartily apologize to those reviewers--I'd offer ya'll a cup of coffee, but, well, you know. . ..Anyway, we've had enough of cleaning our countertops because of poor design on the part of Mr. Coffee (there's nothing quite like starting your day cleaning a mess instead of enjoying a nice hot cup of coffee--sort of puts one in a bad mood). So it's going into the trash--the coffee maker, not my husband :-). I won't donate it because why would I want to saddle this thing onto some poor unsuspecting coffee drinker who never did me any wrong? (hmmmm, but there is my mother-in-law . . .)No matter what kind of filter we used or coffee grind or cleaning the basket and filter before use, it leaked, especially if we wanted a full pot. Making half a pot with fingers crossed sort of defeats the purpose of even having this machine.I found what and where the machine plugs up--if the grounds are ""washed"" out of the basket during the brew cycle, they settle right where the brewed coffee empties into the carafe. To clean the grounds so this hole is no longer plugged means sliding out the basket, taking the whole machine over to the sink, and using the sink spray nozzle to wash them out, which is cumbersome since the machine isn't small.Mr. Coffee was ALWAYS my go to brand of coffee makers. My first one back in the 1980s make great coffee and lasted practically forever. This coffee maker replaced a Mr. Coffee maker, which quit working after two months of receiving it (that should have been a red flag right there). But it's come time to part ways. Mr. Coffee, you've let me down--I don't trust you anymore. Time to move on to higher grounds (pun intended).So to the person looking for a coffee maker, if you enjoy living on the edge (will it or won't it leak), cleaning your countertops constantly, or want a special gift  for the in-laws, this coffee maker is for you. Otherwise, keep looking."
"This is a very basic coffee machine dressed to look like something better, and you pay extra for the dressing.(I use fresh coffee and grind the beans just before brewing)Pros:The water is heated at correct temperature before contact with the beans.It has an internal, thin and replaceable filter that is supposed to remove impurities. I use filtered water anyhow—but I think the real function might be to assure the hot water is more evenly distributed over the beans. If true, that’s good!Carafe works well enough (not great) but it keeps coffee reasonably warm for a few hours. It’s very light so might lack insulation.Reasonably fast and quiet—though neither are important to me.Simple touch controls that work!Cons:It does not let the coffee bloom or if it does, not for long enough time—this may explain the flat, blah taste.Inconvenient access to water tank or coffee basket if you place the unit next to a side wall like I do.The water filter must be replaced every 30 days, so there’s an extra ongoing expense. Monthly replacement might not be required if you use filtered water like I do.You need to use a lot more coffee to get decent flavor from this, even on “strong” mode (whatever that does—there is no description) than from a pour-over or French Press.Insufficient instructions and information. There’s no data on what the water filter actually removes, so it could be entirely for marketing purposes. Look, a filter too!!And don’t be fooled by the clever appearance—the two vertical silver tubes on the front are entirely decorative and serve no function whatsoever.And save your money. If you’re going to buy a plain drip coffeemaker—which this is—you can get one for a lot less money.I’ll still use this when I feel like I can tolerate an uninspired cup, or when I don’t feel like doing a pour-over, only because the box has disappeared and it’s too much of a pain to return."
"I liked everything about this product except the pour spout on the carafe is terrible.  It drips down the front of the carafe and makes a spot on the table. Also, if you think it will keep coffee hot for hours, think again.On a positive note I have yet to have a problem with overflow."
"I've been drinking coffee over 50 years.  I've had a Mr. Coffee machine since they were first made.  I know how to make coffee.  I'm not making coffee incorrectly in this machine.  I'm not putting too many grounds into the basket.  This machine makes a good cup of coffee and makes it quickly.  Those are its positives.Still, the first time I made coffee with this machine (after cleaning it per the instructions) it overflowed all over my kitchen.  I had set it up to make 10 cups.  Since then I've only made 5 cups at a time.  That stopped the machine from overflowing, but it didn't solve every problem.  Now, every time--every time!--I make coffee, which is every morning, I end up with grounds in the carafe.I've had many Mr. Coffee machines in my lifetime.  This is the first one to give me problems.  I can live with the grounds.  But for the price of this machine I expected better.The 5-cup Mr. Coffee that I use when I travel , and which is still selling for about $20 on Amazon, doesn't overflow or drop grounds into the carafe.  I could have just pulled it out from the pantry and begun using it and saved myself $80.  Or bought this machine again, saved $60, and not had to worry about it overflowing or leaving grounds in the carafe.So the questions are: is this a poor design?  Are things manufactured more poorly these days?  This seems to be a problem for far more people than just me.  What's going on, Mr. Coffee?Signed,A Previously Loyal But Recently Dissatisfacted Customer"
"I have used thermal coffee pots for years and prefer them over the dangers of having a hot plate on the machine.  This machine has some pros, but there are a number of issues as well.Pros:  Brew time is quick - around 8 minutes for a full pot.  Coffee after brewing is extremely hot. Taste is okay.Cons:  It's a relatively inexpensive machine, but some of the components are cheaper than what you're paying for.  I'm actually on my second unit, after getting a replacement via warranty for my first.  The display faded on the first unit after 11 months and was almost unreadable in the dark.  I use the program brew feature almost daily, which is hard if you can't read the time on the display or the program settings!  I have had the second unit for about 4 months and it seems that this one's display is fading too!  The carafe has a little plastic ""dongle"" in the entry hole that is supposed to prevent major leakage when you pour.  My first unit had a piece of extra plastic on the little hanging ball that prevented it from doing it's job.  It looked like (and probably was) part of a plastic sheet array, like you see with some toys or hose washers, where the part is created in a sheet and you are supposed to twist it out for use.  The manufacturer sent a replacement carafe, which was nice.  In comparing the two, I was able to see the problem and cut the extra plastic out, giving me a functional backup...  Does the dongle do what it's supposed to?  Not really well.  The carafe also seems to start to degrade.  The washer that seals the lid seems to be weakening and I have noticed that the top seems to be warping just a little.  Lastly, the steam.  It is significant and loud and consistently so.  Running a cleaning cycle helps a little, as the presence of scale or natural salts will create more steam on the heating element, but I still feel it is excessive.In general, I like the machine.  However, I think I will be looking for a replacement far sooner than I had hoped.  My previous machine from a different manufacturer lasted 10 years.  I might get 2 years out of this one (which is bad when you consider I received a brand new machine 11 months in)."
"I've had this coffee maker for just over a year and have been happy with it, until now. The carafe does not keep the coffee hot anymore so you have to heat it up on the stove (not in the carafe) to get the last few cups hot again. A new carafe is $55.00 and a new coffee maker is $69.00 so ?? I will look for a different brand, that might last longer than a year."
"I have previously purchased this coffee maker three other times in the past. I love the way it keeps the coffee warm for most of the day. When I first found it I didn't see any other coffee makers with an insulated carafe. It was priced right in the middle of the cheap ones and the pricier ones. The first one was great. It was slightly different than this new one I bought. They changed the buttons to be less of a physical button to start the brewing. That I thought would be great since the only reason I had to replace the unit in the first place was the brew button wore out after about 2 years. That was a pattern and I figured the money I saved brewing at home made it a small price to pay. It does irritate me that things don't last anymore. However there doesn't seem to be many other options. Now for this new one. It is terrible. The build quality is noticeably worse, the filter compartment that pulls in and out gets caught and does not have a smooth operation when sliding in or out. But the worst part is that the carafe does not make a good seal with the brewing portion of the unit and causes coffee to leak down the outside of the carake and pool where the carake sits. Every time you pour a cup, coffee drips all over the counter from the bottom of the carafe that is sitting in coffee. Very irritating. The new buttons seem good. If I don't throw it in the trash in frustration I may give an update in a couple of years on that."
"OK, I've updated this again on 7/25/2020: should have run with my instinct and sent it back.DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE UNLESS YOU HAVE ENDLESS PATIENCE AND NO DESIRE TO DRINK COFFEE.Now it's too late to return the freaking thing.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------OK, I've updated this in the last hour.  Read the First Part as it is informative.  Read the Second Part as it helps to fix the issues...First Part:This is our second version of this.  First one is so-so, thus the second one as I couldn't really find something I  might like better.Upon arrival we performed the recommended couple of passes of water through the system to clean out whatever is left over from the manufacturing.  Did it twice.  First pot of coffee still tasted terrible.  Ran three more times with vinegar and tried again.  Better, still tasted funny.  I get that.  Plastic is plastic.  Time will probably work that out.Now for the real problem: this coffee pot works in what I call turbo mode: makes coffee in six minutes.  That means it tries to force a bunch of water through the coffee and filter in a hurry.  Standard filters will not work fast enough to keep up.  The grounds then flow up and out/around the filter, either paper or gold mesh and begin to clog up the works heading into the pot.  Then you start getting coffee on the counter, etc.  In our case all over the counter on our third morning and all over the floor!  Today was the first day with the mesh filter.  Expected some problems as our first iteration of this revealed the basic problem: coffee grounds flowing over the side.  This manifests itself in the obvious way but also makes cleaning the filter and basket a pain each and every time as there are grounds everywhere.  (I might  mention that had the coffee been ground less fine maybe this is not a problem.  One gets to the point where one isn't interested in pouring water all over the counter yet again...)Pros: makes coffee fast.  Keeps coffee warm.  Looks good.Cons: makes a mess even faster.This thing is going back to Amazon today.  I'm seriously thinking about getting a $19 unit from Walmart and calling it good.PS The first unit I bought had another, almost immediate problem: the little gizmo that is deflected when the pot is pushed into place broke off.  What that means is there is no stoppage of flow if you remove the pot.  Called Mr. Coffee, was promised a new part but it never showed up.  So customer service isn't great either.I really wish I had made a video of us cleaning up the mess this morning and posted it here.  Nobody that watched it would buy this coffee maker.  And they would have gotten a good laugh...Second Part:OK, got to thinking maybe finely ground coffee is the problem.  So I ground five scoops for about 10 seconds in my cheap Amazon grinder.  Looked basically like the beans had gotten cut in two (OK, perhaps I exaggerate a bit but you get the point) coarsely ground is what I can say...Cleaned up the mess from the previous run and voila, worked pretty well.  See the second photo.For now, then, this thing will stay in place.  It will be on double secret probation.  I've left it at one star because if you're like me, and I know I am, I read the one star reviews first.  I know there is a lot of complaining in the one stars but that's where you learn the problems the item might have."
"After checking out consumer reports; and america's test kitchen's recommendations, we were really pleased with the many features of this coffee maker and it's comparatively low amazon price. (Same coffee maker is twice the price from the manufacturer.) However, on it's 3rd pot, the small plastic piece that turns on/off the coffee stream into the carafe (triggers when pot is in/out) when brewing fell off (my husband may have moved the carafe while brewing), which resulted in hot brewing coffee pouring out all over the counters, floors.  The small piece doesn't seem to quite fit in its holes. Since one feature it has is the ability to remove the pot to grab a cup while it's brewing, it doesn't seem it should fall apart this easily if the carafe is moved during brewing. We stuck the piece back in but think it's flimsy and could easily happen again, so will probably place it over a dish drainer by the sink when brewing. Rather than returning it, we will be calling the manufacturer, as per the instructions, to see what they suggest or if they will replace it. Perhaps this is a slightly different model than the more expensive one? It is very disappointing, because otherwise it's great: very helpful to be able to remove the water tank to see what you're doing (our older model Mr. Coffee got clouded w/ steam after a while and couldn't see the measurement of water), and side load coffee filter is great if you leave against a wall under counter. Only problem with that is that the steam comes out back vents and could cause problems w/ your cabinets if steam is blowing out under your cabinets over time. On it's test run w/ water, I managed to burn myself a bit by pulling the coffee maker forward while brewing (grasped it over top back where vent is), which was due to my lack of awareness of the steam vents' location. Insulated carafe is great and keeps coffee warm and not burnt, and can be placed on counter or table w/o a problem. We may use our old Mr. Coffee carafe as a back up so we can have 2 pots w/ hot coffee available at parties, though you can't brew directly into an older model carafe. We hope we can get the minor problem resolved with the off switch for the carafe removal."
"I have used this coffee maker for a little over one week and think it is fine. Setting the time was difficult (it has to be the first thing you do once you plug the machine in or the time sets at 12:00) but making coffee is simple.I purchased this model because of the removable water reservoir. The water reservoir is nice but would be better if it had a handle as there is no grip. You have to really pay attention to your grip if you get water on the sides of the container. The water reservoir is on the left, and the compartment for coffee grounds is on the right. This is inconvenient and annoying as I have to constantly move the coffee maker left and right to add water and coffee grounds (I do not have a lot of counter space).I do enjoy the beep that is made once coffee is ready. The timer for freshness is useless for me as I almost immediately pour the coffee into my travel mug. However, that timer might be useful for households with varying schedules. The thermal carafe is easy to open for cleaning and easy to pour your coffee.As I said before, I chose this model because of the water reservoir (as it's a pain to measure water in a thermal carafe and I thought pouring water into the reservoir once would be a more efficient use of my time), but I prefer my old Mr. Coffee to this one. I had my old Mr. Coffee for almost 10 years and loved it (Model DRTX85). That model also had a thermal carafe and I only had to move it forward once on my counter top to add water and coffee. The buttons on my older model broke so I looked for another coffee maker with a thermal carafe.The product I received looked like it had been returned as the thermal carafe had marks all over it. Unsure if the marks are rust or coffee. Either way, the carafe should look new, don't you think?If I could do it all over again, I would have purchased the same model I had in the past. But this model works fine and has a funky look to it, so it's staying on my small counter. I enjoy Mr. Coffee and trust that this model will last."
"I've been rinsing the metal thermos in tons of hot water, blasting it in the laundry room sink, nearly every day for 13 days. The smell has gone down but is still quite strong. In their instructions they say to run one pot of hot water and the pot will be ready for use. No way! There's not that much plastic in this stainless steel thermal coffee pot, but the smell is extremely strong.  I rinsed it for 19 days total before using it, and the smell was not entirely gone.  The rest of the unit does not have anywhere near such a powerful odor.  Mr. Coffee is sending a replacement unit for another reason: via an installed hole, you can easily see through the lid of the thermos. That is, if I hold the lid above the white sink where I rinse the hell out of the stinky thermos everyday, I can clearly see the white sink through the lid. See my photo above the sink. There is a ball in this installed hole, which is supposed to fall and stop coffee from flowing out, should the thermos be turned upside down.  I can't tell what's wrong exactly without dismantling the lid, but the coffee would always cool very quickly with this wide open hole.  Many people complained in their reviews that their coffee does not stay hot.  It is Model BVMC- PSTX 91 RB- NP, and they cannot send out a new coffee thermos, so perhaps it's an older model."
"Mar 2021 UPDATE: This thing now floods my counter every time. It's going in the trash. Do not buy this.Right to the point - the reviews about this thing being leaky are accurate. It brews really fast, and that speed is probably why there are so many leakage issues. Apparently water is being pumped through the thing faster than the filtering can handle, so it has to go somewhere. Speaking of filtration, it claims to come with a reusable filter, but it does not. One star lost for false labeling.The water tank isn't the problem since the overflow mess is always gritty brewed coffee instead of plain water, and the grit points at something wrong with the filtering. The problem turns out to be the disc filter and the hinged plastic frame that holds it onto the filter basket (see photo), which I've never seen on any other coffeemaker. I popped the disc frame off at the hinge and haven't had any overflow or grit issues since.Even after doing that, the ""Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause"" feature is untrustworthy. It's basically a coin-toss whether the thing will flood the counter or not while you pour a cup during a brew cycle. The spring-loaded stopper on the bottom of the basket works, but if you pour a cup during a brew cycle, the thing can actually fill and overflow in the time it takes to pour. At least it only takes five minutes to brew a full pot, or of course you can easily set the timer so it's ready when you are.Bottom line: it makes decent hot coffee and tries to be as fast as a k-cup machine, but its speed can cause leakage and overflows. Removing the disc filter frame helps to reduce the chance of that happening. Given its counter-hog size and overflow problems when used as intended, it's on the low side of average as coffeemakers go. 3/5 stars."
"I only had Mr Coffee in my early years.  I think it's a great product if it stays in its lane.  This coffee maker had the look that was updated.  What I didn't like was that it does not make a hot pot of coffee.  It cools was to fast.  It's big for no reason.  Just image.  I didn't mind the reservoir to add water.  What I did mind was the coffee bin.  I bought the gold basket, paper filters and then the original basket.  I started with the paper filters and that didn't work.  The spoon measurements for adding coffee are difficult.  NO SCOUP included.  Everything using this pot was ""off.""  I have had more expensive pot and got tired of pods and their cost.  Sent this one back and using my old pod coffee maker with refillable pods .  Just a miss for me.  I want my first cup of coffee hot."
"It's a good coffee pot - but not great.  One image shows a strong brew button.  Don't be fooled, it doesn't have one.  So if you like stronger coffee, you're going to have to remove the pot from the maker several times over the brewing cycle to allow the hot water to stay in the pot with the coffee grounds in order to achieve a stronger pot.  There's another similar Mr. Coffee caraffe that has the strong brew button - so I strongly recommend ordering that one if you like a strong cup of coffee."
"I thought that this would stay on and keep my coffee warm but it dose not,  the coffee takes forever to pour out, also,  if you do not unplug it it will go on hours later by itself"
"I was replacing the similar coffee maker after seven years.  I much prefer the thermos style over the hotplate style.  The coffee maker works great but the water container cover was broken on delivery even though the package was intact.  It must have been very roughly handled.  Fortunately the seven year old cover was an exact match so I didn't go through the delay of returning; I bought the thing from Amazon to get the old one replaced quickly.  5 stars for Mr Coffee, 1 star for Amazon."
It works.  The coffee is fine.  The carafe keeps the coffee hot but it pours sooooo slow.
"Our first pot of coffee is disappointing.  We used same of amount of freshly ground coffee and water as we would normally use & enjoy, and the coffee is weak.  It has the ‘strong’ button, but should we really have it use it all the time to get what we consider to be a normal cup of coffee?It seemed to have everything going for it—love a thermal carafe, love the removable water tank, but this may be going back. ***RETURNED IT!!"
"I purchased this about a year ago and the filter basket has a spring with a round piece on the bottom the spring falls off so the feature to pause the brewing to grab a cup doesn't work, coffee goes all over. I have searched Mr. Coffee replacement parts from their partner dealers and NONE of them carry the filter basket for the model BVMC-DT100. Other then that it makes a good pot and stays hot in the thermal pot for hours."
"I'd love to give this coffee maker a higher review, because there are certainly things I do like about it. The carafe keeps the coffee hot for at least a few hours (I can't say for how long, exactly, as coffee doesn't last long in our house). I really like the look of the machine. Programming the machine to turn on in the morning automatically was simple enough in that I didn't need to read the instructions to figure it out. The flavor of coffee brewed by this machine is certainly good enough.There is one problem, though, with the machine that drives me nuts on a daily basis. Water does not run through the basket quickly enough, As a result I usually find coffee grounds in the bottom of the pot after every brew. To me this means one of two things: either the water is entering the basket too quickly, or it's not dripping out of the basket quickly enough. I have tried different grind settings on our coffee grinder thinking that maybe the grind was too fine to allow water to flow through, but that hasn't seemed to help. I honestly feel that the issue is that the water is not exiting the basket quickly enough to keep up with the flow of water through the grinds. I'm not sure if it is because the hole in the bottom of the basket is not large enough, or if the ""stopper"" is not lifting enough create a large enough gap for water to flow more rapidly out of the basket. In any case, it's frustrating to find grinds in the bottom of the pot on a daily basis. Oh, and not to mention having to clean the filter compartment because it's caked with coffee grounds.This coffee maker is certainly not a total dud, and I'm not unhappy that I'd bought it. If it weren't for the basket issue I'd easily recommend it. If you make weak coffee you'd probably be fine. I like a pretty strong cup of coffee, and so knowing that I'm not going to reduce the amount of grinds going into each pot I make I've resigned myself to the fact that I'm probably going to find some in the bottom of the pot each time."
"Revised 10/20/18:I found ""BUNN"" 8-12 cup filters that have side walls a good 1/4 inch taller than grocery store filters that do the job.  No more coffee grounds in my coffee cup!  BUNN side walls are 2.75 inches high.I'm keeping this unit so I should at least give it 3 stars.  It makes very good coffee.  Its quality is lack luster; there's a foil bead of chrome colored decoration along the base in front of the pot which strips off quickly.  The water reservoir lid does not have a hinge.  It won't sit level as the back has rubber feet and the front doesn't.  And next time I will hold out for a glass lined thermal carafe.Original review:Either the paper filters designed for use in this device are too small, or the flow rate into the basket is to high, if one hopes to make 10 cups at a time.  This device might be fine if one only makes 8 cups at a time but it's billed as a 10 cup machine!Mr Coffee has complied with the current thinking and uses hotter water than older designs; that's a good thing.  It brews better tasting coffee.  But they have also chosen to feed it into the basket at a higher rate.  This is nice if you're in a hurry for your coffee, but this requires a larger capacity filter and basket as to not overflow.  However here they try to get by with the old standard ""8-12 cup"" filter size.  This just doesn't work.We unnecessarily upgraded from our 18 year old Capresso Elegance 437.02.  It is still working fine but we wanted a 10 cup coffee maker.  We still don't have one!  Our 18 year old Capresso is far more robust, easy to clean, has a smaller counter footprint, has a superior glass lined thermal carafe and uses #4 cone filters which are far superior to the Mr Coffee style basket type filter system.  Mr. Coffee should 'revise and resubmit' and call this an 8 cup machine!"
Great coffee maker but the lid broke within a month.  They replaced it but broke again two months later (terrible design).  Two emails in and I have submitted two online requests and no one has contacted me.  Really disappointed.
"Bought this in March 2023 as a refurbished item for $65, I really wanted the strong brew option because I've had it before. This pot work fine up until a couple weeks ago. It does not draw the water out of the tank, I cleaned the water tube but still nothing. It does not seem to get hot either so there may be something wrong with the heating element."
This is our 3rd coffeemaker of this model. We like the features so well. The first one quit working after years of use. Our second one began to leak after a couple years of use. We ordered this coffeemaker from Amazon this time just a couple of months ago. We just discovered a leak. Turns out we can no longer remove the coffee pot during brewing. Not happy.
"The coffee is fine, but every single time a cup of coffee is poured, it makes a mess by dripping coffee all over the counter that has to be cleaned up before you can enjoy your coffee.  I wish it wasn't too late to return it.  I thought I was doing something wrong when pouring, but I'm not.  Missed the return date by two days."
PROS:Easy setupCarbon filter a plus (use it or loose it your choice)Removable water tank.  Meh... leave it in there for me. Except for cleaning.Brews fastNo heating pad.  Carafe  insulated (no burnt coffee!)Cons:Stupid silly slow pouring. (like draining a bath tub with a soda straw!)Filter holder flips up but spills waterRemovable water tank bad design. (on the left side.  Should be the right side)Time coffee sits (useless feature.  Hot plate I'd care. Thermal Carafe so doesn't really matter.)Will keep even with the Cons listed above.Last 12 cup coffee maker we had with a filter system.  Dribbled coffee everywhere. (hated that thing)This one pours so slow... few months we may dump it and get another one.  It's that annoying.Also the reason for 3 stars.
The first model I bought was five years ago.  It worked great. It was old so I decided to replace it last year. The second one did well for about two months before the carafe began to separate. I found a hidden screw and tighten it up. It fell apart again within three weeks.  The cost of replacing the carafe is not worth the $ so I just bought a new coffee maker.  I really hope this one lasts. What happen to buying quality products? Now a days we get half the quality for twice the price.  What's wrong with this picture?!
"I would give this a five-star rating if it weren't for the self-cleaning feature.  This coffee maker has an embedded self-cleaning feature that triggers at some seemingly arbitrary time, but it always seems to be at the worst time.  The coffee maker is useless until you run the self-clean.  There is no way to bypass this. You must run the cleaning, which is a 30 minute or so activity.  It's incredibly frustrating as, again, it always seems to trigger at the worst time.Otherwise, it makes great coffee."
Love how fast it brews a pot of coffee but the same piece of the water tank that holds it to the coffee maker broke off again the very first day of use on the replacement coffee maker sent to us.
"I bought this coffee maker so that my wife and I could enjoy a good cup of coffee; which we did until one day the unit grew a mind of its own and refused to work properly.  We tried everything, emptying the reservoir and starting over, unplugging the plug, added new coffee.  But the coffee demon had struck.  No more coffee from this machine.  This unit was expensive and the reviews were excellent.  However, our maciine didn’t measure up to the hype.  We attempted to contact the manufacturer, but that didn’t work.  So, we’re left with an expensive door stop.  Ugh.  I suggest to Amazon that instead of buyers having to contact a manufacturer, who might not be in this country, that the customer contact the SELLER to rectify any issues with defective products.  In that manner, perhaps my wife and I could be more satisfied than we are now…we are not happy campers."
"The only thing I really liked was the brew timer.  The first few pots of coffee tasted terrible, but improved with use.  Having to mess with the filter basket is a pain.  And after all that I still thought, it's not so bad, until it got 5 days past the ""return it date"" on Amazon.  The pot leaking around the seal seems to be a common complaint and I'm so pissed, because is it getting worse with each use.  In looking at the design I am guessing the coffee leaking out has been sitting in it the space between the plastic and metal is old and being pushed out by fresh coffee.  I usually buy Bunn pour overs and have sworn by them for years.  They all leak too, after about 5 years!!!.  At least you get your monies worth out of them.  I have had this one for 35 days.  Like all things the price of a Bunn has gone up by about 1/3, so I decided to save some money until things level off.  Thought I would get at least a year out of the pump on this one.  Hah! And there you go.  I say it all the time and did not take my own advice.  You get what you pay for, and although this one was not what I would call cheap, it is very cheaply made.  If I cannot get the manufacturer to replace the pot, I will just buy another Bunn and call it lessoned learned."
"I have had this coffee maker for about 6 weeks.  There's good and bad about. Good: I did not experience the bad plastic odor or taste with the first few brews.  Maybe the first but I brewed about 3 full pots of water through it just to be sure.  I really like the taste of the coffee.  The removable tank is just the awesomest thing!  Well... That's about it for the good, now for the bad.  Bad:  The caraffe does not keep the coffee hot for as long as I hoped!  Maybe lukewarm for a few hours but that's it.  What a big surprise there!  The caraffe also leaks terribly.  I have seen other reviews of people criticizing this complaint by saying the pot does not leak and it's because there is still coffee in the pot from the previous brew.  I am not an idiot DUH!  No there is not coffee in the pot before I start the brew.  There is a seam around the bottom of the pot and a seam near the top where it meets the black plastic part.  Both seams leak whenever you pour coffee.  Thre is a seam on the inside of the pot too.  Water seeps in between the walls of the pot.When it heats up during the brew process the water inside the walls bubbles out other outside seam.  Leaves little puddles of coffee on my counter top.  I started placing a paper towel under the pot while it brews since there is no warmer plate.  At least that keeps the water from going all over the countertop. And what is with the amazingly slow pour???  Come on!  I got places to go and things to do!  I would like to get a replacement caraffe because I really love the maker itself."
"This coffee pot was just what I was looking for:-thermal carafe that doesn’t need a burner to keep the coffee hot. With my old pot, by the time the two hour shutoff happened, the remaining coffee in the pot tasted bitter and sometimes burned. No problems here. If I fill the carafe with hot water from the sink for a few seconds and pour it out—that is typically enough to preheat the carafe, so that the coffee stays hot to the last cup.-separate water reservoir, so that there is no chance that the water going into the maker has been tainted by the coffee stained carafe.-I removed the separate water filter attachment that goes into the basket. I use filtered water for the coffee and my coffee has tasted great to me without the extra filtration…and it makes it a heck of a lot easier to remove the used paper filter and grounds after a brew.Now for the con:-the thermal carafe leaks and did so from the very first brew. I saw this in other reviews and thought, oh, that’s usually after a year of use, and I could probably deal with it. Well, it leaked from the first cup that I poured. Coffee seeps through the joint between the metal and the plastic top. And it is a lot of coffee. I have to keep a towel next to the pot to clean up after every time I pour a cup. It goes everywhere. This is the sole reason I knocked three stars off of the review. It is unacceptable that the carafe leaks when new out of the box. This is a design flaw or manufacturing issue and needs to be resolved. I filed a warranty claim with Mr. Coffee but have heard nothing back so far.If Mr. Coffee resolves the claim and provides a replacement that doesn’t leak, then I will update my review to 5 stars."
"The only reason I can think that this could possibly be rated that many stars is that people are reviewing this product before the clean up/coffee ground madness begins! We purchased this coffee pot because of the rating of stars to the amount of reviewers, the way it has the charcoal filter disc for filtration, the look of it, and the way the water filling method is removable sold us. It doesn't come with the lifetime reusable coffee filter so we used regular filters. We noticed immediately after the first use that the grounds covered the water filter disc area and spilled out of the filter into the carafe as well. We tried both larger and smaller coffee filters but no change. We purchased the lifetime reusable filter after 2 weeks of dealing with this because we thought that was the issue. We also had to purchase the water filter discs for it that are to be changed out monthly because after 2 weeks of cleaning grounds off of it after each use it was shredding apart. Once they arrived we changed the water filter disc and popped in the reusable coffee filter and brewed a pot of coffee the next morning. No change, coffee grounds everywhere and in our coffee still. So we tried a filter in the reusable coffee filter. Nope!  Coffee grounds for breakfast. After this change we noticed the carafe leaking EVERYWHERE as we poured our coffee in the morning. This still continues daily. You can shake the empty carafe and hear water in it. We have never placed this in our dishwasher and we have not submerged it in water either. We have simply emptied it out barely getting the outside of it wet while rinsing the carafe with our spray nozzle. Also, the other morning after the timer went off alerting us it was ready I went to pour our coffee and the pot was not full! I poured 2 cups from the 8 cups it normally brews. Once I returned the carafe to the plate it brewed more. We have only had this coffée pot for 1 month and 3 days. (Just missed the return window because we tried all measures that we could because we liked it) But, we are done. We are out over $150.00, too many frustrating mornings, and our hearts won't allow us to sell it and pass the madness on. My advice is it's not worth it. And if you want to buy it anyways, I will sell you one with $30 worth of filters for cheap! HA!"
"I bought this coffee maker, it was good. I got worried when I started to see a weird coating coming off from the coffee jar."
"love this coffee maker. We replaced a similar Mr. Coffee, upgrading to this nice digital one. I love being able to ""brew later"" for coffee that is waiting for me when i get up. I am a little disappointed that the lid seems to be faulty. When you press the lever, it doesnt open the pour spout to let the coffee out 90% of the time. We either have to take the lid off to pour or let it dribble out slowly."
"Very strange…problematic lid! Replaced my three year old MR Coffee with same unit, and now impossible to pour coffee out thru lid opening; barely dribbles out , if you take the lid off, it splatters all over, obviously a manufacturing defect. Disappointed!"
"I have used this model for years. I expected the stainless model to be comparable to the black/stainless model but it’s not.To be fair it is slightly less expensive but the plastic elements are a disappointment.The plastic is dull and looks cheap in my opinion.Are these known for leaking? Yes, after a 3 or 4 years my two previous ones did begin leaking. I don’t honestly expect a coffee maker to last much longer but if you do this model probably isn’t your best choice.As far as the coffee it’s hard to beat. It brews fast and keeps the coffee hot for hours.Pick and choose your battles I guess. I’ll take replacing it every few years over glass carafe models with burned coffee every time."
I have literally bought this coffee pot at least 5 times because I loved the carafe feature. Most of the time the machine part lasted anywhere from 1-1.5 years. I wish it was longer but again I loved the carafe. The second to last time I ordered the water reservoir had changed to a flimsier plastic and was chipped at the top but I kept it because it could still function and I needed coffee! I was sad to see the quality was shifting. Now I just had to order one again and this time I had trouble with the carafe leaking and running out all over the place after pouring. I got a replacement thinking it was a fluke in the seal and lo and behold the replacement is worse than the first one! I have to keep a towel around it so I don’t end up with coffee everywhere. It gets worse the more I use it. Quality has went way down hill with this product. Sadly my time has come to throw this junk in the trash and look for a better coffee maker. I will not buy this product again. :(
"I have had one of these Mr. Coffee machines for two years AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!!Two weeks ago it suddenly started leaking all over the counter during the brew process. Well after two years, I thought it's not the greatest longevity but I like the machine better than many others I've tried, so I'll order another one.It arrived today and after unpacking and reading the instructions, I proceeded to run several reservoirs of water through it to cleanse everything, per the instructions. It didn't take more than two minutes and we had water all over the kitchen counter. I tried again and again and because I had my old machine here I tried both the filter basket and the carafe from it.Here's the bottom line. The basket in this machine, whether I use the new one or old one does not allow the water to drain through into the carafe - PERIOD!  BTW, this is an entirely different problem than what was causing leakage in the first coffer maker. Why? Because it leaked clear water when we were actually brewing our coffee. If we were brewing with this machine, the overflow would be brown.I can only conclude that the bean counters/MBA's at Mr. Coffee's corporate offices have allowed cost cutting to undermine the quality of what was previously a very fine product. Wake up boys and girls - there is no profit if your customers desert you!!!!!!!You would do well to start paying attention to all the negative reviews that came before mine and get things turned around. (yes I read them and ordered the new machine anyway, because I believed in you)I sure hope you're listening.JCUpdate: Since I wrote the review above I ordered and received another Mr.Coffee Optimal Brew machine from another vendor. After it arrived we set it up and everything works beautifully - Just like our first one! Note that this one has the stainless steel center piece above the carafe, unlike the one we received and returned to Amazon which has a black center piece. That said, we recommended this machine to friends and they got the one with the black center piece and they couldn't be happier. They get a pot of coffee that is brewed quickly and very hot and that doesn't take a crazy amount of grounds to get a robust brew. So this has  nothing to do with whether you get it from Amazon or someone else.Summary: when these coffee makers are made well, they are very hard to beat. You get a very hot brew and whatever coffee you use, this machine extracts maximum flavor from it. (BUT - better coffee beans always, always mean better coffee)If the Mr. Coffee folks can insist on better quality control during manufacturing, they have a winner that I will buy again when this one dies."
"We are on our second of this same model and it just gave out on us for a second time. It makes great coffee for about 4-5 years and then gives up the ghost suddenly with no warning. First time around I thought maybe it was hard water build up, so after buying a second one we used the cleaning cycle more regularly without waiting for the light to tell us it needed it. That only seemed to speed the deterioration because it lasted 5 years the first time and only 4 years the second time. So if you don’t need a coffee maker to last more than 4 or 5 years it makes great coffee!  But if you want something that will last, don’t buy this!"
"I had this coffee machine for about 10 months.  Worked great during that time and never had a problem.  Coffee was always good.  I personally couldn't stick my hand in the carafe for cleaning, but my girlfriend could.  That was always my only complaint...Then...this machine decided to turn on me.  I woke up one morning to make a pot of coffee before going to work.  I set it up to brew a pot and went upstairs to take a shower.  I heard the beeping acknowledging that the brew cycle was finished.  I walked downstairs to get my coffee and that is when I saw the horror of an entire brew cycle of coffee all over my new cabinets and floor.  Coffee was everywhere! Behind my oven, and into the grout on my freshly laid tile in the kitchen.  I spent the next two hours cleaning up the mess...bleaching the grout on my floors, cleaning my new counter tops and cabinets.  I assumed that it was my error and that I did not put the carafe all the way into place when brewing the coffee.  I cleaned the coffee maker thoroughly and chalked it up to user error.Anyhow, the next day I decided to make another pot of coffee before work again.  Same sequence of events occurred...including the coffee being all over the floor and cabinets.  This time I almost lost it..I was so angry.  I cleaned everything again and then started testing the coffee machine with water only outside.  It continues to leak.  The only moving parts on this machine are the spring loaded piece of plastic that lets the coffee drip into the machine from the basket into the carafe when it is in place.  The only thing I can think of is that that cheap spring loaded piece of plastic is not activating properly.  It is just a piece of junk.  The only moving part on the device should be built with more robustness so this doesn't occur.  I will never buy this coffee machine or Mr Coffee again.  It has effectively ruined my kitchen tile and the grout on my backsplash.  I would never trust this coffee machine again as I have watched it fail three separate times.  Save yourself the aggravation...there is no doubt that it will eventually leak.  My mother bought the same machine roughly 2 months before I did...we both liked it which is why I decided to buy one for my own house...turns out she also had the massive leaking problems.So, thanks to Mr. Coffee...we can add to the junk pile of garbage that we throw into our ocean as the earth is now receiving two coffee machines in our trash can.  Thanks Mr. Coffee for designing  a crap product."
"I received this item and it seemed perfect for what we wanted, and it performed as advertised.  We operated for the first couple of days without a problem.  We even threw away the packaging.  However, the item started leaking after just three or four pots.  I don't mind a few drops, but this pot makes a mess of the coffee maker and the counter it sets on - at least a half cup of coffee leaked out (three paper towels saturated).  I ran a few more pots through the unit to see if I had done something wrong (such as too fine a coffee with the filter overflowing).  The unit continues to leak profusely no matter what I did.Today, I called Amazon to tell them of my situation and that I had thrown away the box.  The Amazon associate was perfectly friendly and helpful.  Without my suggestion, she offered to send a replacement unit, and I could use the box to return the old one.  Outstanding Customer Service.  If the replacement unit works OK, I might change this rating (we like the coffee maker) and consider the one I received as a lemon.Received the replacement as promised and it works perfectly - no leaks.  I have been using daily for a little over a month now.  No problems.  I am raising the rating to three stars from one because of this.  One more item worthy of note, the coffee maker advertises it to be a 10 cup unit.  However, the reservoir holds only about 50 oz.  So the unit is 10 small 5oz cups of coffee or 4 larger 12 oz. as I use it.  To my knowledge, there is no standard as to how many ounces of liquid is in a ""cup"" of coffee."
"I bought this because of the claim that the coffee maker and the thermos carafe kept coffee hot, but that was not the case.  The carafe unfortunately allows coffee to get cold.  And the carafe was annoyingly slow at dispensing coffee: you have to turn the carafe over while pressing the button to get coffee to flow out, even when it's full.  I ended up returning it after just a few days and getting the Cuisinart Coffee Maker, 12 Cup Programmable Drip, DCC-3000P1 which also has a removable water reservoir with markings for each cup level, and the Cuisinart has an internal coffee holder that keeps the coffee HOT.Pros:Looks good.Removable water reservoir.Cons:Noisy, lots of gurgling.Slow, seems to take forever to make coffee.Only even number markings on water reservoir, no marking for five cups level which is what I use.Did not keep coffee hot."
"Had the coffee maker for a week, and works great with no issues.However, you do not get 10 cups of coffee out of it. We measured and got about 6 standard cups of coffee instead. Good enough for a household of 2-3 coffee drinkers."
"I am sending this back...With a carafe, you generally have to run hot water into it to get it heated for coffee.  Even after doing this, it doesn't make coffee hot enough.  Coffee is lukewarm even making a full pot.Nice looking coffee maker.  Duel drip spouts are just a facade but still look nice.  Caraff is very nice."
"Coffee maker brews quickly and is reasonably attractive in the kitchen.  Overall quality of construction seems a bit flimsy and filter tray does not slide into place without a little bit of jimmying.  Water filter disk seems to be a joke and probably only effective to filter out large particles but will do nothing for water quality or flavor.  I feel like the description did not clearly show that it is a flat bottom coffee filter and does not come with a reusable filter but perhaps that was my fault.  Lucky I had some leftover paper filters to start off with.  The worst part of this coffee maker is the thermal carafe which only let's coffee dribble out of the pot when I'm pouring a cup.  It is almost irritatingly slow like a leaky faucet so I just unscrew the lid and pour it, which defeats the purpose of a thermal carafe.  I feel like I need to use almost twice as much coffee grounds to get the same flavor of coffee from my previous coffeemaker.  Overall, I am not overly impressed and would not purchase again."
We could never get the bad taste out of the machine.  Tried cleaning by the book and all google videos.  Even visitors said it had a bad taste.  Went to garbage after 1 year of bad coffee
I wouldn't buy it again. U can only do 12 cups. Will not allow u to make just 2-4 cups.  After having it for awhile the water will leak out slowly.  I wouldn't buy it again.
"Pours coffee  REAL  slow, it's easier to take the top off unless you have a lot of time."
"Purchased in 2017, had a few issues with overflowing coffee due to either forgetting to empty the carafe or not pushing it in all the way. After several months of that learning curve, finally got it right. It died today so here I am looking to replace it. I paid significantly less for it back then but can’t seem to justify the price increase for just an ok machine. I’ve been here searching for a replacement and I guess every machine has some flaw or two. You will get some grounds or sediment in your coffee with this machine. It doesn’t brew piping hot coffee and you have to make sure you tuck the pot in all the way or you will be cleaning hot coffee off your counters. Also it did not last very long. I usually only use it once per day so I feel like it did not have a very long life.The clean feature is nice, the carafe keeps the coffee warm but not hot, programmable feature is also good. But none of those things make a difference if it just stops working. Which, sadly this one has and is going to the landfill."
"Unfortunately this is a coffee maker I would highly advise avoiding.  I bought this coffee maker because it looked good.  That is its only quality and even that has started to diminish due to the carafe rusting!So the problems:I am not a picky coffee drinker and have never cared about what kind of coffee bean I have, or how it is roasted, or even how long the coffee has been on the burner.  I'll drink whatever.  But what this machine dispenses predominantly tastes like hot water.  I have tried using stronger coffee blends and using more than double the recommended amount of grinds, but it is always very weak and tastes dreadful, unless you like the taste of hot water.Other reviewers have mentioned how slowly the carafe pours and this is true but not something that bothers me.  However, the reason the carafe pours slowly is because the openings into must be kept small to keep the coffee hot since this maker doesn't have a burner.  Aside from the slow pouring, this creates a problem when the maker is dispensing the coffee into the carafe.  The hole in the top of the carafe is too small to allow the coffee to enter the carafe at the rate the coffee maker is dispensing it.  This means that a good amount of coffee will end up spilling down the sides of the carafe leaving a nice pool of coffee to clean up as you enjoy your first cup.Another area where there is always a leak is where the stainless steel part of the carafe attaches to the upper black plastic peice.  Apparently this bond is bad so any time you pour a new cup, coffee seeps out from there.Lastly, as I initially mentioned, the carafe is now rusting.  I imagine this from the continuous streams of coffee is has experienced daily as I have tried time and again to make this a workable coffeemaker.  I have always wiped the carafe down with a dry sponge before and after pouring, otherwise I would be dripping coffee everywhere.  I have never let it sit around wet or have put it in the dishwasher.  I would occassionally rinse out the inside of the carafe from the faucet and then leave it upside down to dry.  But still, the carafe has now become quite rusty.In short, pick another coffeemaker if you are actually going to be making coffe with it.  But if you just want a kitchen ornament, I highly recommend this one, it looks great for a bit."
"Pros:-'strong' feature works pretty well and definitely makes for a nice, bold flavor-thermal carafe is a huge plus over having a hotplate to me; not only do you not have to have the hot surface but I have a small work area and I can keep the coffee maker in another room and just bring the carafe in when ready-water reservoir is easy to remove and fit back onCons:-a bit of water is left in the reservoir after brewing every time, so I end up removing and dumping/rinsing the reservoir frequently-when brewing anything more than 6 cups of coffee and using the disc filter, grinds and coffee were getting splashed up onto the filter and housing; keeping filter clean between uses was annoying enough that I stopped using the filter-I don't brew more than about 6.5-7 cups as that appears to be the most you can do without grinds splashing around too much and getting around the filter basket; maybe this would be less of an issue if you had the disc filter in, but either way I would definitely not recommend trying to make the full 10 cups this machine is rated for-there's a ring on the bottom of the carafe lid that helps keep it sealed that comes off easily, so if you do get this be very careful when washing the carafe lidOverall it's a decent machine but with several drawbacks and probably not the best option out there, but it's not too bad and it does make a very good tasting cup of coffee*edit* reservoir has a floating magnet for machine to detect when water runs out, which you cannot clean effectively without removing the little tiny screws a foot deep into the narrow reservoir, which makes it a huge pain when you need to get to it and will probably break soon; as other reviewers noted sometimes water somehow gets inside the body of 'sealed' carafe; this seemed like at best a mediocre product at first and has only gotten worse, and will definitely be replaced soon."
"We've used a regular coffee maker for years (glass carafe and heat pad) but got frustrated with how the coffee would always get a little off taste after sitting on the burner and then get cold after the burner shut off after 2 hours.  I sometimes like to drink coffee throughout the morning.  So we found this Mr. Coffee Thermal Carafe coffee maker and ordered it.  It seemed perfece for our needs.  However, after several weeks of usage, I came down one morning to a flood of coffee and grounds on our countertop, down the front of our cabinets and all over the floor.  There was no discernable reason I could tell for the overflow.  I made coffee with the same amount of water and grounds as I've made for years.  Chalked it up to some sort of odd occurence and went back to using it.  Another week later, the same thing.  What a mess to wake up to!  It has happened to us three more times over the last couple of months and this last time was the last straw.  It's going into the garbage.  Very disappointing product."
"We bought this model many years ago and it worked flawlessly until we lost the gasket from the carafe lid and had to buy a new one after 6 years or so. Even without the gasket, it still brewed fine, the only thing that happened was that the coffee would get cold pretty quickly. Of course, because we loved it, we bought the exact same model.This one was flawed from the start. Upon the first brewing, coffee leaked from the seam between the carafe and the lid. Even though the gasket seemed to be in place right and not compromised, it would leak a small amount around the whole rim every single time. Then a few times, it leaked from somewhere COMPLETELY different and what seemed like the entire contents of the coffee batch ended up all over the counter, in the drawers, and on the floor.So we thought it was just a single flawed item, and returned/replaced it. The new one came within days and ONCE AGAIN it would leak from another different place (looked like it was coming from INSIDE the structure of the coffee maker which means that coffee was leaking from inside/behind the brew basket). It wasn't the entire batch of coffee this time, but it was enough to be an annoying thing to clean up every morning. This happened consistently 3 times in a row, no matter how much we cleaned it up between brewing, didn't over grind the coffee or overfill the brew basket. This was the final straw.We love the thermal carafe, so we are keeping that to use for other mobile hot liquids and just trashing the appliance and eating the cost. Literally other than this HUGE messy and annoying flaw, this would have been our favorite coffee maker of all time."
"I almost returned this because I kept ending up with grounds in my coffee, but I was able to figure out what I was doing wrong. Some grounds had gotten inside of the area where the filter basket slides into, and so every time I made coffee, those grounds were getting into the pot. So I now remember to take an extra step when I make coffee, before I slide the filter basket back into place, I run my hand in there to check for any grounds left over from the last pot. I think this area is what is causing all of the overflows. Another thing to keep in mind, with most coffee pots, you use the carafe to fill the water reservoir, but since this reservoir is removable, you've got to remember to make sure your pot is empty. I make back to back pots of coffee all day, and it has happened that I left a bit of coffee in the carafe, which caused a back-up / overflow when I made a new pot.... which  then caused there to be grounds in the drawer for the filter basket... which then caused the spout to become clogged.... which then caused subsequent back-ups / overflow.... But finally, I have learned all of the places where I (an avid coffee drinker of 20  years) can mess up when using this coffee maker, so now I'll stick with it because just because I don't want to have to learn the quirks of another coffee pot.As long as you are careful to use the pot properly, it makes good coffee and keeps it hot for hours."
"We thought we'd try a middle-tier, simple machine for our morning coffee. We have had both an inexpensive coffeemaker and a high-end grind and brew, and each had their benefits and trade-offs.  What a mistake this particular choice was!  We have brewed perhaps 60 pots of coffee using this machine in our two months of ownership.  Of those 60, I'd say the unit overflowed in the filter area perhaps 10 times---and that is trying for just 8 cups of water max, not even the full 10.  Of the 50 (or so) that we actually got coffee, we were happy with the coffee taste of perhaps 5 of them--we don't like 'chunky' coffee with the grounds inside, or watery coffee, or faux-espresso strength coffee.  There are no real adjustable settings to help there either.  Now, one might wonder about the beans and the grind---we tried different of each, nothing helped. Coarse grind? Still overflows.  Fine grind? Still overflows. Flavor?  Erratic no matter the grind.  We used the same Whole Foods beans we've used with two other coffee makers and the results were much less impressive with this unit.  We tried it with the water filter and without---it was bad both ways, but most likely to overflow if you used the water filter.On the plus side, the removable water reservoir is nice, and the side-access filter is easier to get to than many.  That's important since it backs up and requires intricate hand-cleaning of the filter era regularly more than 10% of the time!Of the 3 coffeemakers we've owned over the past 8 years this was, by far, the worst.  We're giving up 2 months in, and I can't in good conscience recommend it.  We'd rather have bought eithe of our prior coffeemakers again---this was harder to use than a finicky grind and brew, and the quality of coffee was no better (and perhaps on average worse) than the $20 model."
Second time purchase of this particular coffee maker. Was really happy with it! Now this second one leaks all over the counter like there’s no tomorrow. Sadly waited too long to return it. Be careful when you buy one make sure it works properly before keeping it.
"I purchased this after reading reviews but no one mentioned the two most annoying things about this product.1.  The flap over the filter.  In my photo I show a drop down piece of plastic which you need to lift out of the way before you add filter or coffee and then need to replace before installing the coffee filter holder into the machine.  I believe it is meant to distribute water over the coffee evenly, but was flimsy and cumbersome.2.  The water reservoir has a worthless detached plastic cap that you pull off separately and leave on the counter while you fill the reservoir.  After filling and replacing the reservoir, you have to put this very flimsy piece of plastic back.  Absolutely hated this thing.  Poor design and should have been attached to the reservoir or the maker itself, instead of some separate piece.3.  Lastly, and not a terrible thing, but also annoying, the reservoir and the coffee are loaded, unloaded from opposite sides of the coffee maker.  This means you have to have the space on either side to perform these functions (which you perform each time you get a cup of coffee).  This proved also to be inconvenient and a design flaw.4.  Taste was OK…nothing to knock your socks off.In all, very poor purchase.  I went back to a French press.  Much less hassle."
"Sort of worked for two pots of coffee;  Did not beep when brewing ended at all; After second pot, clean light came on.  Called Mr Coffee Customer support and was told that there was something wrong with the coffeemaker and I would have to return it.  They send a return label via email and returned via UPS.  In the meantime, Mr Coffee did send a new coffeemaker via FedEx SmartPost which took about a week.  When we received the new one, discovered parts included which the original unit did not have.  (Water Filter holder, filter etc.)  Now suspect that the original unit was a return to Amazon because of problems and they then just reshipped it to me as new.  Have made 3 pots with new one and it is still working properly.  Thermal carafe does indeed keep coffee hot for several hours.  Like that aspect.  Have been using Bunn for years and decided to try Mr Coffee.  Maybe a mistake.  Think if I had to do it again would purchase the Bunn with thermal carafe.  Price of that unit just went up almost $50.00 on Amazon so will pass.Originally received replacement in Oct of 2014.  In Jun of 2016, the display became too dim to read.  Called Mr Coffee, (Jardon) and they informed me that there are no repair parts available.  Lady (Bianca) also asked where I purchase this unit and I said initially from Amazon.  She then said that they sometimes sell refurbished unit as new.  Explained that this unit was a replacement we received directly from Jardon and she then went on to explain that sometimes units are damaged when moved around the warehouse.  I suggested this sounds like a packaging or quality control problem.  She then said they are working to improve quality !!!  Doesn't give my much confidence in Mr Coffee products at all.  Anyway, no fix available.  Unit still works but cannot set clock or use delayed brewing."
"I recieved the wemo version of this coffee maker not the standard model pictured.  I love the construction but I am not happy at all with the wifi.  When they put in the wifi light on the front panel they had to remove the controls you would expect to see.  Second the wifi continously blinks.  This may be because i was not able to finish hooking it up to the wifi but it significantly brighter than the on off light which is quite dim.  Now i did not spend alot of time trying to hook up the wifi so maybe someone can correct this or i will figure it out when i have some free time.  But even though i have smart things set up for my house it does not appear to connect to my present system.  You have to download a seperate app.  Then oddly you have to switch your wifi to the coffee pots own wifi to connect to it.  The instructions on the app are a bit confusing so i am not sure if you have to switch wifi souces every time you want to use the pot?  Confusing. I just want a cup of coffee and for the darn thing to shut off in two hours automaticly like the one i ordered. Although the product i oedered stated that it had a 2 hour shut off, i have not found that statement in the instructions or on the box of model i was sent"
"The major thing about buying a coffee pot of any kind today is how good is the system in the device at delivering consistent results.  And that's hard to answer because of the age of the coffee being brewed each time.  Let's assume thecoffee maker is consistent is it's ability to produce the same temperature of water and its delivery through the coffee grounds.  That leaves the variable of the age and roasting process of the coffee itself.  If you've been buying the same brand of coffee for sometime and enjoy it's flavor, then adding a new coffee maker should hopefully keep that same flavor.  But what about the coffee maker itself.  How many lose pieces do you have to remove before filling it with water and the filter and the coffee itself ??  This specific machine has a loose lid over the water container that has to be removed each time its filled, which is everytime you make a pot of coffee.  The coffee holder itself has a flip lid with a place to put an activated carbon packet to reduce some impurities in the water supply...which is after the water is heated !!. The balance of the coffee holder is a simple basket into which you put a paper filter and then add the ground coffee.  The system could be made a little simpler, but it makes decent coffee."
"This is our second time purchasing this coffee maker.  The first time it lasted approx 2-3 years and it broke (started leaking).  The second we brought is June 19, 2023.  And now the coffee pot is starting to unsealed. 😟I love how warm it keeps the coffee.  I would say I want to try and purchase again but I’m thinking of trying a different brand 🙈🤞🏼"
"* update: I am contacting the seller. The carafe has started to leak from the side where the plastic meets the metal.I  already own one of these same coffee pots which I bought 5 or 6 years ago. When I needed to buy a second one for a second home, there was no pot that I would rather have! Well, the top center part is not solid and sturdy like my first one - it ""wiggles"" its just not a solid piece and somewhat bothers me when I wipe it down and it rocks.  The thermal carafe is not as heavy either. But it works just as beautifully as my original. I would have loved to give it the 5 stars it deserves, but not with the top center part loose. Maybe if I had never bought one before and couldn't make a comparison I would feel better about it, but it is AN AMAZING COFFEE POT despite this issue."
I have been a long time purchaser of this particular coffee maker. The one thing that we loved about it is that you can always pull the coffee pot out while the coffee is making. This cannot happen with this coffee pot. There is a defect do not buy.
"I had a challenge rating this as it is overall a pretty good coffee maker. It looks good and I like the thermal carafe, but I rated it lower because the coffee just doesn't taste as good it could and the beeps are annoying.I followed the instructions in the manual to clean the coffeemaker before use and I always use a water filter.  I thought that over time the plastic taste would go away but it hasn't. I also have to use a lot of coffee to get a full-bodied, strong cup. On days when I have a little more time and I don't need several servings of coffee, I prefer to use my Clever Dripper to make coffee. I use the same coffee with the same grind and get much better tasting coffee with no plastic taste. I will try the trick of using two paper filters instead of one to see if that helps with the strength of the coffee; paper filters are a lot less expensive than the coffee, after all.I also don't like the beeps on this machine. It beeps when the coffee is done and then again two hours after brewing. In my small house, that beep sound really travels. If someone in your household is a light sleeper the beeping may wake them up. There is no way to turn off the beeping and I wish I had read about it in comments as it may have changed my mind about purchasing it."
"I have 3 of these coffee makers and all 3 percolator units work perfectly and make great coffee.  However, the carafes start leaking in about a year.  The manufacturer does not sell replacement carafes.  They can be purchased from 3rd parties - for about the same cost as the entire new unit.  The manufacturer honors their 1 year guarantee and will replace the entire unit when the carafe goes bad."
"While I love this coffee maker, it only lasts a few months before the water line inside it leaks.  If set up for overnight, the water leaks out completely over the counter and can cause damage.  If making the coffee immediately, it still leaks and less than half of the water makes it to the pot.  I wish they had made it a little more sturdy like it used to be.  Not sure what they changed but I have bought a few over the years and they used to last at least 2 or 3 years.  I won't buy again!"
"I am very disappointed in this coffee maker.  I expected the thermal carafe to keep the coffee hot for at least an hour.  It didn't.  A couple of other complaints were really my fault, I should have read the description more thoroughly.  I guess I just took it for granted that the coffee maker would automatically shut off after making the coffee, it doesn't.  Maybe I'm not understanding the water filter ""installation"" but I find it a little inconvenient when trying to make coffee.  Will not be replacing this one with another Mr. Coffee."
"My first coffee maker was the stainless one, and it was great. It had a decent run lasting me around 7 years! I was impressed by how long it lasted which is why I bought another one when the first one died this past May. The second one is the black/stainless because I wanted to have the (what I thought was) the same coffee maker, just with a slightly different color palette. Well, it’s not the same because this new one starting giving me issues only a couple months after buying it. It’s slightly upgraded with the buttons which I can appreciate, but the problem is the thermal pot. Despite washing it after each use and letting it air dry in a drying rack, somehow there’s liquid sloshing around in the thermal cavity. I can’t get it out either, so even though the pot is empty it sounds like there’s liquid in it. Annoying! And gross! Also, I can’t brew a full pot because when I do the thermal pot leaks at the top leaving coffee to pool underneath it and then the bottom is all wet and drips on the counter when the pot is pulled out. Never had these issues with the first coffee maker I bought years ago! I’m disappointed."
"Really liked this machine.  Was the only affordable machine that had all the features I wanted.....removable water reservoir, delayed brewing, carafe.  Easy to use, looked nice on counter.  However, after 8 months, the carafe lid has a loose piece inside causing problem creating opening big enough for coffee to come out,  Never had a leaking problem as described by so many.  But the lid issue is causing me to have to retire the unit and go back to another one (different brand) I had put away.  The only reason I haven't chucked this is I'm hoping to find replacement lid for carafe.  One site that specializes in genuine replacement parts for many items has it back ordered.  Walmart site says it's ""out of stock"" and offers in-stock alert which gives me hope I will be able to get it.  If the item is no longer available, their site often says so.  Otherwise, it's gone.  Very disappointing that an otherwise perfect coffeemaker didn't even last a year with daily use.  A sign of the times; am seeing many well known, formerly high quality manufacturers putting out literally disposable products at the same or higher prices for their formerly long-living products."
We had a Mr. coffee maker for about three or four years and then the water tank clip broke. We liked very much and so we ordered another one. It only lasted two months before it broke. I have to see if we can have the basket replaced.We have a Mr. coffee maker for about three or four years and then the water tank clip broke. We liked it very much and so we ordered another one.

"Where to start. I really wanted to like this coffee pot. I have used Mr coffee for 30 years and never has anything let me down like this thing. Pretty much everything about it is bad. The worst thing about it is that it doesn't make good coffee. The charcoal filter is absolutely useless. Even after soaking the filter for 48 hours, it still does not let water through it fast enough and the water just ends up flowing over the sides and not down into your coffee grounds. As you can imagine this makes for a very very weak cup of coffee. Even without the filter the flavor is still subpar, although better. Then there's the cleaning issue. The way they designed the basket is ridiculous. There is literally no way to get in there to thoroughly clean it. I like the idea of sliding the basket out the side but in actuality it's terrible design. Also the coffee pot leaked water and I could not figure out where from. I can definitely see where other people could have issues with overflowing when brewing a full pot of coffee as well. I was not expecting the best coffee pot I've ever used in my life, but I would expect that at the price point, I should at least be able to get a decent cup of coffee out of it. That is just simply impossible. I returned this coffee pot due to the leaking issues and also due to the fact that it just does not make good coffee."
"First, I love the thermal carafe, which was the main reason we went with this one. Maintains heat for a really long time, even after the 2 hour *beep*.My issues with this are mainly in the design. You have to account for twice the counter space for the side loading tray for grounds. There's no sliding it out ""just a little bit."" This side loading feature? Also a negative if you're in your ""pre-coffee state"" and don't actually slide it back in before you hit brew. In a ""normal"" coffee pot, that means you just brewed a pot of really hot water. This one? You're staring tiredly at your grounds on  a quickly flooding counter going ""Whaaaat is happening?"" If I need a cup of coffee on board to make my coffee, that's a problem.The lid to the reservoir is not attached- either to the reservoir or the body of the machine. Again, let's not complicate things before I've had my coffee. The reservoir is also not flat on the bottom, so no setting it on the counter to fill. Not a huge issue, just something that doesn't make sense.The machine is still working a year in, it's just not a well thought out design. I am currently keeping an eye out for models that my carafe will fit in, vs buying a whole different machine."
"Everything about the coffee maker was perfect!Coffee stays hot in the caraf.  I wasn't wasting pots of coffee because after 40 minutes it tasted old and cold like in my B&D coffee maker.A pot of coffee only takes a few minutes where as before 10 minutes with my old one.Having a removable reservoir that could be cleaned saved me time and a big mess.The filter really did make the coffee taste better!So why a 1 STAR?  IT LEAKED!!!! From the very first pot I made, the part that held the water reservoir leaked from the bottom all over the counter.And although the caraf is a brilliant idea....the opening is so small, it barely comes out.  You need to take the lid off to pour the coffee.February 18thSOOOOOO....my replacement Coffee pit has arrived.  I was a little nervous if it would leak so I stood there while it brewed.  NO LEAKS so far!  I love this thing.  I changed my review to 3 stars.  It would have been 5 if the 1st one didn't leak."
"Mr Coffe used to be my go-to coffeemaker. My first bought in 1981 lasted 40 yrs. Simple to use, made good coffee. Bought 2 cheap Mr Coffees that didn't last and this $69 one is just a poor design for just making coffee. Side reservoir, thermal carafe that does not keep coffee hot that long, and a basket with a filter; is a lid that lifts but does not detach for easy emptying & cleaning! I kept it for no other reason than tired of shopping!"
"I wanted a coffee pot with a removable reservoir so I bought this one as it matches my appliances. I never spend a lot on coffee pots but decided to this time, and what a mistake. Every time a brew a pot of coffee, my counter is covered in coffee and not just a little but approximately two cups leaks. I will be returning this!"
"I also read the reviews about how terrible it was to pour coffee from the carafe of this maker, but I ignored them. I wish I hadn't. Pouring out of this carafe sucks terribly, and there is no way to clean out the pour spout (who knows what's growing in there). The pour is very slow and I drink LARGE mugs of coffee, so I have tried several times to pour without the little screw on lid.... Goes OK until there is like 4 cups or less in the pot and then it goes all over the counter and down the carafe and all around the mug-you get the idea. The pros are that this this is easy to use, looks good on my counter, and the insulated carafe keeps the coffee warm all day and night. Cons, I haven't been able to get the scheduled coffee feature to work (but haven't really hunkered down and tried), and the pouring thing just sucks so bad. I'm going to look for a solution or another compatible carafe today."
"My package was delivered to the wrong address, it went to my neighbor, who was nice enough to pack it to my house. The box was beat up a bit(not sure if it was the neighbor). The coffee brewer came with a couple dents in it, but I decided to keep it anyway. So, it’s true, DO NOT use this brewer under your kitchen cabinets! The intense steam will ruin your cabinets. I’m still trying to find a home for the brewer because of this issue. The coffee has a nice, smooth taste to it, and it doesn’t get bitter after a couple hours. It’s not as hot as I wanted it to be though, so, we are still heating our coffee in the microwave after brewing( We like it molten hot). The filter compartment likes to hold onto coffee grounds, so once the disposable coffee filter is dumped, there are grounds all over the filter compartment, so, lots of rinsing is involved. I probably would not buy this product again, nor would I buy it for a loved one unless they knew what they were getting into."
"Ok, so after my husband murdered my Bunn, I replaced it with this.  I have had this coffee maker for over 2 years now.  There are a couple of things I like about it:1) It is fast--about 8 minutes.  And the timer means I can also set it the night before.2) It isn't too pricey.3) I can fill the reservoir from the sink hose without removing it.Some things I don't like:1) The first one I ordered had a sticky start switch, so I had to send it back.2)  There are a bunch of inaccessible tubes that carry the coffee from the brew basket.  Without frequent vinegar cycles your coffee begins to taste like the coffee at the gas station at 3 in the afternoon: acrid, bitter, sharp.3) Last night, the ball valve *inside* the carafe lid broke, spewing coffee all over the counter automatically.  I can be tough on machines, but there is No. Damn. Way. I could have done anything about that. I punched it out with a chopstick, and it works ok now, but that is a lot to ask only 2 years in, after cleaning the counter, before my first cup.  Caveat emptor."
"I've had this for almost 2 years now. 99.9% of the time it works fine. 0.01% of the time you will not push the basket in all the way just right, or you not accurately set the pot inside the tiny margin of error, and you'll have 10 cups of hot coffee all over your wood coffee bar and oak floors. Has happened to us several times. I've never had this issue with any other maker."
Top plastic part of coffee pot separated from stainless section.  Pot started to leak when pouring.  Was able to press top part back to the stainless section but next use the top plastic section separated again.  Will be filing a warranty claim with Mr. Coffee (Sunbeam is parent company).
"Been using for few days, and so far it’s doing what it supposed to do. Nothing special to be honest, but I got it for black Friday deal, so it’s ok.Except for one thing that’s when it comes to pouring coffee. I don’t know why they made it so slow to pour. Probably it’s not gonna be an issue for normal coffee mug, but it takes forever to pour into my large thermal. I swear, old man with narrow urethra can finish his business faster than me filling my cup of coffee. Of course I can alway just remove the lid and pour it traditionally, but can’t stop thinking this is a design flaw."
"I had great hopes for this coffee maker after the good reviews and maybe the problem is just something wrong with this particular one but I'm very disappointed! The coffee is just not hot! Not even right after it is brewed.If it sits in the pot for even an hour it is just lukewarm. So many reviews raved about how hot the coffee stays for several hours that I am tempted to try to get a replacement and try again. I like the set-up otherwise. It is very convenient for under the counter. One reason I have to get a coffee maker that has a separate water holder is because there is not enough room under the cabinet above it to pour water into the top. The side dispenser for the coffee grounds is very convenient and easy to use. The display settings were a breeze compared to my old coffeemaker. So, all in all, if it kept the coffee hot or even started out hot it would be great so I'm wondering if it is just something wrong with this particular one. I just hate to get another like it and find the same thing. There is also a slightly rubbery taste to the coffee but I figured that would go away after using it several times. And yes, I did wash it all out before using it."
"I rarely write bad reviews about products because...  Well... It just seems like kinda’ a dick move.  I mean, unless a product really sucks, what’s the point in expressing mild dissatisfaction?Well, this product – this Mr. Coffee coffee maker – really, really sucks.Let’s start off with the very first cup of coffee we made with this thing.  Was it a good cup of coffee?  No way to tell, because water and grounds overflowed from the filter basket drawer, spilling all over our counter and floor.Turns out that the carbon filter included with the unit is just barely permeable (even when it’s been pre-soaked for ten minutes), and so water – and then grounds – just sorta’ flow off the top and out through the basket drawer.And what about the second cup of coffee?Well, after ditching that carbon filter we were able to brew up a pot, and the resulting coffee was super duper strong.  Crazy, barely drinkable strong.Why?Well, it turns out that this coffee maker consider 5 ounces to be “a cup” of coffee, rather than the standard 8 ounces used by everyone else.  If you make a pot using standard measurements – one tablespoon of ground coffee for every cup – you’ll end up with coffee that’s 60% stronger than usual.Also, a five ounce cup?What the hell?Anyways, we’ve tried using this coffee maker off and on for the past few weeks, and it’s been nothing but frustrating.  There are times when it randomly overflows (even with the carbon filter removed), times when it doesn’t quite overflow, but grounds still end up in the pot, times when it actually does brew up a good cup of coffee (maybe every one out of three brew cycles), and times when we just want to throw this thing against the wall.Do yourself a favor and spend your money elsewhere."
"this coffee maker brew pot does not fit the coffee maker once it starts brewing coffee leaks from the top of the pot and down under it all the suggestions, they give you do not work make a mess every time poorly made the older model worked perfectly this one is garbage DO NOT BUY!"
"We have had 3 previous Mr. Coffees, all the same  model -  this new and updated model has various problems,  the most annoying is the leaking of water..Yes, we've checked the equipment, watched countless videos, appealed to the maker.....to no avail.Its frustrating that a good, dependable model has been made worthless.  We've had it less than 4 months."
"This coffee maker was to replace a 15 year old Krups thermal that was still making good coffee but the electronics were no longer functioning. Overall, it seems flimsy and a little too plastic in construction therefore not giving a sense of longer term life. The coffee basket is my real gripe. It appears to be too shallow and the grounds frequently go over the top of the filter requiring a total washing of the basket with each batch of coffee rather than just dumping the filter. I thought it was the paper filters so I bought the metal filters and those were worse. The metal filters do not have any screen in the bottom (cheaper??) so they drain more slowly and two mornings in a row I awoke to a coffee flood on the counter. The water filter system also seems weak. The ring holding the filter in place does not really lock so when you have to rinse the whole basket due to the flood of grounds the filter frequently drops into the sink causing more rinsing and fuss. If you like weak coffee and are OK with a small amount of grounds this maker may work for you. The carafe seems to keep the coffee hot but I do not know if it is any better than our old Krups. This maker makes a French press batch of coffee dumped into a thermal carafe seem like a brilliant idea."
"I hope you'll take the time to read this one star review because it is not coming from a place of anger and is written by someone who is very confident that they know how to operate simple home appliances.Where I work, we have a larger Keurig brewer that gets daily use from at least five people, typically in rapid succession and sometimes multiple times per person. With that in mind, I considered Keurig to be a producer of reliable single serve coffee machines. I purchased this item in December of 2023 and it started getting used on Christmas day. I appreciate an 8oz cup of coffee, and was pleased to see that it happily brews up an 8oz cup of coffee with no complaint. All is well with the world. My wife, who would prefer a cup of stronger coffee, wanted to try it out at its minimum water level of 6oz. The reservoir emptied, but it refused to brew.Well, as much as that sucks, we figured that there may just be a design oversight where it *has* to be exactly 6oz of water, and maybe we were just under that somehow. I added a few more ounces of water and got it to actually brew. I suggested always making sure it was over the 6oz line, and that seemed to be the solution.In April of 2024, we hit a snag - it wouldn't brew an 8oz cup of coffee. I tried giving it a few more ounces and it once again did brew that cup of coffee, albeit weaker than intended. I chalked it up to maybe having mismeasured the cup.Now here we are in June of 2024. It once again would not brew an 8oz cup of coffee. No amount of additional water given to it would make it brew the coffee. The instruction manual says to hold the button for 5 seconds to purge the water that is currently in it, but it would do no such thing. Eventually, it did brew the water it had in it after I turned the entire machine off and back on, presumably resetting its software... But after getting 12oz of water out of it and pouring it down the sink, the next 8oz cup... Wouldn't brew.I added more water and for the first time ever, found that water was somehow leaking out of the bottom. Where did it come from? Who knows. I cleaned up and took the entire thing to the sink, pouring out what was in the reservoir and trying to see if I could shake more water out of wherever this mystery puddle had come from. There was the obvious sloshing sound of water coming from inside the machine, presumably in whatever little heating chamber it has in there, but shake as I might, I could not get the water to leave that heating chamber.So, one K-cup gone to waste and no coffee made. A shame. I did not successfully brew a cup of coffee after that. I re-read the instruction manual to see if there is something I missed, but no. We have used only filtered water in this machine, pulled through a Zero Water filter, so there is almost no chance that something is clogged or scaled, and I have no intention of purchasing Keurig's overpriced bottles of lemon juice to attempt to descale the machine.I have not yet sought remediation through Keurig, but I intend to. Regardless of the outcome, it won't change my review of this machine because I have read the one and two star reviews and see that this is a common problem. If Keurig honors their one year warranty and sends me a replacement machine at no cost to me, then what I can say is that Keurig is a company with standards and integrity, but it won't change my opinion that there is something built to fail about this particular model. If they do not honor that warranty, my opinion of Keurig will be at rock bottom and I will find other ways to make my $60 ""investment"" serve me.As an aside, it baffles me that there is a ""minimum"" amount of water that a coffee machine will take. I understand that inevitably, some small portion of water boiled is lost as steam, but you have to cook water for a long time to lose an appreciable amount. As someone entirely unfamiliar with the mechanisms at work inside this brewer, I think it may be suffering from being overcomplicated. It shouldn't care how much water it has in it - it should simply dispense hot water. Based on sound alone, these machines have a pump that ejects the water, so it doesn't seem to rely on the steam to force the water out. No one wants to spend 80 cents to over a dollar on a K-cup to get two drips of coffee, the user is not going to sabotage themselves with less water."
"I bought one 3'ish years ago. It stopped draining water. I did a good job of descaling and cleaning fairly regularly. I bought a new one because I liked it. Plus, it was on sale. I bought this one July of 2024. I went to clean it and when I went to take off the water reservoir it popped off and disconnected from the drain tube. *apparently I wasn't supposed to remove it. I'll take the blame for that. My other one was apparently the plus version where I could remove the reservoir. However, the screen that drained the water was so clogged I couldn't' clean it. And the descaling didn't work.I filed a claim via Amazon to Keurig. They gave me a number to call so I did. The representative was more than helpful. But, because I wasn't supposed to remove the reservoir, it wasn't covered under warrenty. Again, I'll take responsibility. I was offered a discount of 20% with free shipping if I was to order a new one. However, their website offed 30% off with free shipping. So, I've decided to use another brand. The price of Keurig is on the high-end but it doesn't last long enough to purchase a 3rd one.Long story short, Keurig is a great brand. I just think their single serve isn't worth buying."
"My prior Keurig K-Mini worked fine for 2.5 years with no issues.When it died, we got this new K-Mini which I think is not the Deluxe model.After 1 month and 5 days - past time I could return it - it suddenly died.I called Keurig support and was happy that they helped me clean out the little needle thingy that punches the k-cup.  After that they walked me through testing it.  So it worked and I was so happy!Next day, no - it didn't work again. :(I called Keurig support again - very friendly and helpful support staff!However this time we tested it and it had to be sent back to be replaced.Luckily I had bought from Amazon so I could get my receipt easily.I recommend Keurig - but I'm disappointed in this particular K-Mini.This K-Mini doesn't allow you to get to the inner water tank to clean it out.I didn't know that when I bought it.  And now they're going to send me the exact same model.Oh well."
"Does not get as hot as my old one did.  Got this for the taller mugs that are around.  Old one would only accommodate a small mug, but sure did get the coffee hot.  This one, not so much.  I would not buy this model as you have to put your brewed coffee in the microwave to get it hot as it should.  Brews fast and that is probably why it does not get the coffee very hot."
"As far a performance is concerned it worked very well for about 45 days, then it started turning off on its own then leaking all over the place under pressure., Seem something or some hose on the inside broke and it was shooting hot water from the bottom.They did give me a refund, hence the 3 starts, but something like this should last for years not days."
Bought this as a gift for my sister to replace old fashion coffee pot. She used it once and was unhappy because there is no way to make it stronger. Coffee very weak and watery. If you want one of these make sure there’s a button on top that says strong. Now I have to rehome this one.
"I have gone through two of these Keurig’s in about almost a year and a half and they both just stop working. They usually just stop either sucking up the water or pouring my coffee. I don’t know why they’re not working for me, but I am considering looking at a different coffee maker"
Loved the color. But it arrived with gel packs in it to keep the moisture out and one of them had broken and gotten all inside the machine so I returned it. And thenI decided that I really didn't need another one because my 12-year-old one works just fine
"I have been a hold out for a single cup coffee maker, but after using my son’s coffee maker, the same as this one in but in black, I decided to break down and come into the current decade or two.  I love the color of the little aqua coffee maker, and I love being able to make a single cup. But no matter what size mug I use, it is a splatter festival. I have to wrap a towel around the coffee dispensing area, including my cup, and even the handle gets soaked. Hence the three star rating. Glad to read others don’t have that issue, but for the rest of us, it is real."
"I was so excited to receive this and loved the color. Sadly though this device let me down in two areas. First, even after removing the lower tray, it was still too short for me to fit my standard travel cup underneath it for a 12oz cup of coffee. I was a bit surprised because my travel cup is a standard tall skinny size.The other disappointment was the actual coffee. I was using a dark roast pod, but for some reason, the coffee kept coming out weak and tasting almost like a light roast. I know it is the machine and not the coffee because I used the same box of pods in a different machine and the coffee tasted great."
I’m am an 89 year old senior and wanted to have an easier way to make coffee in the morning. I noticed after a few uses the coffee maker is misting coffee on the countertop near the machine. When I called the company to see what I should do they said I h@ve to prove I purchased it myself. I sent a screenshot of the Amazon order and they wouldn’t accept it. They need proof that I paid for it. I assume that would require me to send my bank info which I refuse to do. Very very disappointing. I thought they were supposed to be the best?
"I bought this to replace a previous model that I had for many years. Although I appreciate it’s taking up less room on my counter, the coffee comes out so forcefully it splatters outside the coffeemaker onto the counter, which I don’t appreciate. I was pleased to read that it has a space to store the cord, but I expected it would be controlled by a spring mechanism as in other small appliances - not so. It’s a thick, stiff cord you have to wrestle with to get it in and out of the small storage compartment. It’s also noisier than the previous model. I also must mention that the grinds from the pods accumulate around that area and should be wiped out after each cup to prevent a build up of residue. Not easy because the space is tiny. A q-tip is handy but a wet paper towel folded thin is even better. Lastly, where it says 10 ounces where you pour the water, it’s really only 8. Coffee comes out the same as in the previous model."
"Had to return the first motor broke. It's good for single serve and the price when on sale. Stylish, small, convenient. I would say best cup.of coffee"
"I purchased this particular one-cup machine for a couple of reasons.  One, I trusted the brand name for quality.  Two, I like the slim look of the unit (doesn't take up much space) and three, I wanted to be able to make a fresh cup of coffee one at a time after I put away the larger coffee maker from the morning.Both of us noticed a lack of taste in the coffee made with this machine.  There are no changes on my end; I'm using the same coffee g rinds, using the same filtered water and using the correct amount of grind.  In fact, I even put slightly more into the pod for the 8 oz mug.  The coffee lacked flavor; it wasn't rich and full-bodied...it was weak and watered down tasting. This is odd.  Is the water running through too quickly to be able to capture the flavor of the coffee?  I guess we'll never know but I will give it another try in hopes of being able to keep it.  I don't think anything will be different at the next cup and this will more than likely be returned.  I noticed that I'm not the only one with this exact complaint.  What is up Keurig? Room for improvement."
"I bought this product as used, but came dirt as F… at least next time clean them before send a used product."
"I've had this machine for over a year now. I wouldn't buy it again.  There are some really good positives about the machine.  It's as compact as you're likely to find for a single serve coffee machine.  It brews a decent cup very quicky and the design in terms of handle and reservoir placement is good.However, it's very quirky.  It's supposed to brew with a minimum of 6 ounces of water,  However, it randomly refuses to brew sometimes even when routinely filled with 9-10 ounces.  The solution is to add more water, lift the handle and start a new brew, but sometimes even that doesn't work and you wind up having to put another cup underneath it to catch the overflow from the double fill.I'm heartily sick of fighting it to get a cup of coffee in the morning so am currently looking for a replacement."
"Is larger then I expected considering is the mini, but don’t like that it splatters the coffee all over the counter and outside of the cup if I don’t use a tall travel mug… I also don’t like that the bottom is adjustable to life the regular coffee mugs. Expected more for price and brand. Otherwise coffee comes out good and is made quickly."
"This product needed multiple starts, and 3 months later quit working.  Cheaply made."
I’ve had various Keurig coffee makers over the years and for the most part they work well and last. The one I got before this one started acting up after 6 months and this one started having problems in less time than that. It now takes 2-3 tries to brew a cup and it’s exasperating.  The convenience isn’t worth the irritation.
Hard to clean.  Awkward to use.  Much prefer older model
"This is my second single serve Keurig.  The first one simply quit working. This one makes a good cup of coffee, but it does not have the features I was expecting.  There is no container for storing coffee.  There is no button to brew a stronger cup.  Those features should have been included."
It worked great- until it didn’t. Got about 3 weeks out of it and then one morning it just wouldn’t pump the water. Just sat there and made noise. I bought it for travel and it would have been perfect for that had it not died so soon. I might try buying again. Not sure though.
"Sadly we wondered how long this guy would last. It would start running clear water into the coffee mug about a quarter of the way full before dispensing coffee into the cup. Now it will turn on and make a noise, dump some water out the bottom of the Keurig and shut off"
"On the positive side, it does let the hot water go through the inserted pod, so it is a coffee maker.Now, the negative sides. Firstly, the 180ml/6fl oz mark is not the minimum water required to make a coffee. It requires 210ml/ 7fl oz, at least on my unit, otherwise, it annoyingly shuts off by iteslf. Why does it matter? Well, if you dilute coffee by an additional 30 ml/1fl oz of water, the coffee does not taste the same. In my experience, this unit works best with over-roasted coffees as their flavour comes from the coffee being burnt, and not the quality of the bean itself. Secondly, the coffee gets splattered around, not only because of the nozzle, but also because of the height between the nozzle and the cup. Luckily, if you use a tall champagne flute, this can be remedied. Thirdly, the method of adding water to the relatively small opening at the back, and not having a removable cannister may present a problem for some. Lastly, the way Keurig produces coffee results in a lack of aroma and flavour compared to the competing brand, which is an inherently unsurmountable problem.Than again, it does make a hot brownish liquid if you add enough water."
This machine brews warm vs hot/very hot
"It's very touchy on how much water you can out in. The minimum amount of water you can put in it... isn't the actual minimum? You have to put more water than the minimum line for a small cup of coffee. Other than that, it works alright."
It makes good coffee but splatters everywhere!!! It’s the first one we have had that splatters coffee! I’m surprised because keurig is supposed to be so good. Probably won’t get another. We haven’t had this very long so I don’t know how long it will last!
"I read all the reviews before purchasing this, yet I took a chance because I love the convenience of a Keurig yet not having a machine take up such a big footprint on my countertop.  I followed all instructions including cleaning the machine running clear water through the machine etc.  When it was time to brew my first cup of coffee, nothing happened really.  It pulled the water through, when it decided to come out only about an inch of ""brewed coffee grounds & mess"" ended up in my mug.  The coffee pod had basically exploded & there were grounds up in the top part of the machine & water was leaking from underneath the unit. I cleaned it all up. Waited a few minutes & tried again.  It pulled the water through however it never made it to the mug.  I refused to give up.  I added another 10 oz of water and turned it on, it pulled THIS batch of water through and this time it all came out in the measuring cup & another mug that I had sitting for the overflow.  I still wanted coffee, NOT to mention I wanted to show off my new little Keurig Christmas gift to family that was here over the holidays.  I waited again, then started all over again.  This time it made an entire cup of coffee however the k-cup once again imploded and there were coffee grounds all through the mug of coffee I just brewed.  I waited...  tried it again later after everything was cleaned up, and this time it brewed a good cup of coffee  Since January 1st I've wasted 5 or 6 k-cups because the machine continued to do this.  This morning however, was the last straw.  It was one of those mornings where I NEEDED that cup of coffee, you all know that feeling right?  Water was measured & put it, I waited, smelled some coffee brewing YESSS!  NO!  It brewed about 1/2"" of coffee mud, grounds were everywhere in the mug, at the top of the machine around the k-cup...  But WHERE did my 10 oz of water go?  This isn't the first time the water just disappeared.  Once again the water was leaking out of the bottom of the machine.  It was under the area where the mug sits AND running out all over the counter.  I still needed that cup of coffee and wasn't settling for instant...  I tried ONE more time.  This time it made a cup of coffee.  For some reason it still leaked some water underneath the unit.  This is not Keurig quality, I've had Keurig units since they first came out.  I gave up on the last one that had a water reservoir because of the green algae growth that occurred no matter how many times you cleaned it/changed the water/put in a new filter.  I've given these units as gifts to family.  I love the convenience of k-cups and a quick cup of coffee.  Once again, this unit is not meeting Keurig quality standards  And yes once again I followed ALL instructions-it's not rocket science.  By the time I finished this cup of coffee today, I had already cleaned it up & have it ready to go back to Amazon.  I'm not impressed at all, my family was not impressed the first day that I tried it, and I'm now in the market for something else.  I really wanted to love this little guy, the machine seems like a great idea however Keurig, you need to check into what the quality issues are that quite a few of us are having & find a remedy.  Glad for the customers that are having no issues - some of us are NOT so lucky."
This is the cutest little coffee pot. So easy to use and brews very quickly.  Only 3 stars because I can't just run hot water through it. I have a mushroom coffee (Beyond Brew - I bought it on Amazon and it's amazing also!) that I like to drink in the mornings. I make one cup of actual coffee and place a cup under with my mushroom coffee to have the hot water run through.  I add the two cups together and it's a nice large cup for me. This won't allow me to do that so it only has 3 stars.
"Unit failed before warranty ended. Keurig did replace but replacement failed within six months. Makes an average cup of coffee; Cuisenart is superior, in my opinion. The unit is noisy and it does spatter excessively."
"I REALLY liked this single cup Keurig at first -- good hot, strong coffee in a very short time with no fuss.  But after about three months of use, the coffee just wasn't getting hot enough anymore."
"It brews quickly, but there is a design flaw.  Because the tray that you set your cup or mug on is so small, coffee splatters all over the kitchen counter during brewing."
"It sometimes take the water but make you add more to dispense, preferred the kreuig that had a tank to fill although this does take less space."
"Update:  After 5 plus months useIt makes a good cup of coffee but had to Reduce it by two stars.1st clean up not that bad.  However, the design is horrible and makes a big mess inside the machine.Literally had to scoop mounds of coffee crud out of the top of the unit.  Worse somehow this sludge gets down below in the base where the K-cup funnel extends.  The K-cup holder does pop out but, it is nearly impossible to get in there to clean well.  I have no idea how all this crud builds up over a short period of time.  It is gross and should be easier to clean.  The bottom tray pulls right out and is easy to clean.This is where you place your coffee cup while waiting for the coffee to dispense.Sorry Keurig, the design leaves a lot to be desired in the cleanup department.My original post is below:I liked the ease of use.Cleaning first time was a snap. (Recommended before first use)Keep in mind it will pull the liquid from the reservoir tank then heat that up.Then it will dispense into your cup.  So wait on it.I was not familiar with the  unit and thought it was defective.Heard the heating element fire up.  Few seconds later out came the hot coffee.Just wish the Tank held more water.  It only fills up our coffee cups to the half way mark.""Big mugs""  :)"
It is a miracle that the machine worked after I watched on my ring camera how the delivery guy THREW IT on the ground! WTF???
"I bought my first K-mini in late 2019.  It died in about 3 months after the year warranty.  The company did replace it for free.  That one lasted two years.  Purchased another.  In June 2023 it started to act up so I ordered one just i case.  Started using it about 2 months ago when the last one actually died.  This morning I could not get the handle and lid to close completely.  Called to see if there was something to fix it!  No but they did say they would replace it.  I am the only coffee drinker at my house and I love being able to just make a couple cups for myself.  When the machine is working I love it but they are expensive to replace.  The customer service is very helpful if you are within the warranty or close. The K mini takes up very little room on the counter.  I do use a descaling product every couple months.  Making hot chocolate seems to be hard on the machine so I don't use it for that.  Others have told me that the small, cheaper models do not last but I don't want to give up the counter space.  The old fashion electric coffee pots were not as nice but for the same money they lasted forever.  If you buy this machine just keep a jar of instant for the morning when your unit has died."
"Too many complaints about this. Cord is too short, which is probably my biggest one. It makes it hard to shift things around on a limited space counter trying to fit everything else around it. Second complaint is that when it said ""makes 6-12 oz"", it meant that's how much water it will hold. Which means every time you want to make yourself something with it, you will have to fill it all the way back up. Every time. Which for me kind of defeats the point, especially if you drink a lot of coffee or teas. I wouldn't really say this is worth the money when you can get a 1.8L electric kettle with a significantly longer cord, for half the price.The only bright side is it heats water up really fast. That's probably it, honestly. If you like Keurigs, idk maybe you'll like this. But if you're looking for something to get yourself as a starter for your first home, an electric kettle is honestly the way to go."
Started to brew slow in less than a year of use. I prefer fresh ground coffee.
Had to put on a smart plug or it wouldn't turn on.
I really think I'm getting seconds/returns. This coffee maker makes a good cup of coffee  but it makes so much noise that it scared my upstairs neighbor!(I got an air fryer that makes a ton of noise and a blush with a broken seal and someone has run a brush or finger across!! What a pain in the ---!!)
Liked the looks and it is very small but I like a stronger brew.
"I bought this based on my experience with a Keurig brewer at work, which is large and has a direct water line (so you don't have to add water for each cup.) That one is reliable and makes a reasonably good medium-strength 8 oz cup of Joe. I bought this Keurig Mini for its small size to use at home and the Keurig ease of use. This one doesn't seem to want to complete a brew cycle with less than 8 oz of water.Updating my first review, now that I've had this for a month or two. It is temperamental. You have to add water and then the pod, in that order, or it doesn't seem to know there's a pod in it. Also, it just doesn't reliably brew with the minimum 6 oz of water. I've had to brew 7-8 ozs in a mug that will hold that amount and then pour the brewed coffee into a 6 oz cup.ALSO, I've used 4 different brands of pods and had regular failures with each. This unit doesn't seem to punch a big enough hole in the bottom of the pods, so I have to put in a pod, close the lid, open and turn the pod, and close the lid again to make two holes in the bottom. Otherwise, the pressure in the pod gets too high before the coffee comes out the bottom of it and the grounds in the pod begin to erupt out the top of the pod. I've had to spray out the pod space more than a few times before I figured out this work-around. Shouldn't have to do this.I got the Keurig because I wanted something ""easy"" that took up less counter space than my previous full-sized coffee maker. If I had more money and a bigger counter, I'd upgrade. I can live with this, but there sure was a learning curve with it.UPDATE 5/20/2023 -- The coffeemaker now is tripping my CFGI outlets. I tried it in 3 separate rooms with the same result BUT was able to use other appliances (hair dryer, electric kettle, etc.) in those same outlets. So my conclusion is that this didn't even last 3 months of light daily use."
"Despite encouragement from Kevin and Jane at Kuerig and despite sending them all the requested proof for the warranty I have not received a replacement or promise of one. I ordered in July, used probably 20 times, and the Amazon  return window expired in August. I was excited to use the sale to get the one cup for company that I had coming."
The product doesn’t make strong coffee it’s watered down
"I had the larger Keurig (with carafe) for many years, was finally having problems with it.  Looked on Amazon (my ""go-to"" for everything), and saw this cute little Keurig.  I am only one drinking coffee at home, so it was perfect for me (very lightweight).  GREAT!  I ordered online and it was delivered in about 2 hours!  Was able to pay $10 per month-no interest-with Amazon Prime.  REVISED REVIEW:  I read the directions (enclosed with unit) and viewed the video.  Started using the coffee maker, but lights start flashing (after going thru the process) and no coffee comes out.  Have to start pressing buttons again.  Then I hold my breath until coffee comes out (YAY!).  THE PROBLEM IS:  you can only make one 10 oz cup of coffee at a time.  The unit will not work to make a second cup of coffee (which some days I really need!).  So, not really great."
Not completely happy with product. Not a daily user.  Takes me a few times turning it off and on before it will actually work.  It splashes the drink all over the counter when filling the cup.  I've flushed it with water after every use but still seems dirty.
As with all of my Keurics it worked well within limits. The amount of water you put in is what comes out. There is no in between. If you put 10 ounces of water in and your cup only holds 8 you are out of luck.
"Great little machine, for about six to eight months. Then it starts to malfunction. I've been through two in less than two years. Won't bother getting another one. I've tried virtually every single suggestion on the internet for fixing it. None of them work."
I've had my 2nd one now for just barely over a yera- and it's starting to do the same thing the last one did.  Which is having to re-start it at least twice to get it to brew.  SUCKS-  this is my last Keurig.
"I gave this 3 stars because the first unit I bought was defective. I bought it at a discount at the ‘like new’ used. Unfortunately, it was for a guest house that we were building. Once the guest house was completed and I had my first guests, it did not work. Of course by that time, it was past the 30 day return policy. Bought this second one on sale and immediately plugged it in and made sure it worked. Should have done that with the first one but assumed by the listing, it had been tested by Amazon. In the end, I paid $120 for my mini Keurig. Live and learn!"
This machine works ok. If you use the lowest water level it is finicky and doesn’t always run. This is a nuisance as I only use that daily. Sometimes it takes two times to get it running.
"Pretty disappointed,  very cheaply made . Not sturdy at all had to add rubber pads to back to help with rocking while trying to operate latch. It works I guess . Not worth more then $50"
"I like how slim the design is, and it makes some quick coffee. However, definitely not hot enough. I've honestly had to microwave some water and use instant coffee instead because of this..."
They don't make them like they used to
"This is my second one of these. They are great, but beware this seller. I bought a new one, but was clearly sent a used one, gross."
I am a Keurig nut!  I have had my original Keurig for years and use it everyday.  I wanted to put a single cup machine downstairs for guests and my craft room.  I loved the red color from the photo but when received the plastic looked too cheap for me.  I will try and find a different model that looks like my original.  I am still a Keurig gal and buy some great pods off Amazon.  They have a chocolate cherry that is very tasty.
It don’t have a reservoir so you have to fill it every cup and wait on it to heat. But the price was right
"Amazon sent a machine that started to fail about the time the 30-day return window closed. By the time I called them, it was closed by 2 days. When I closed the POD, it overflowed and would not send coffee through the POD, creating a mess. I finally had to lift the handle and turn the POD a quarter of a turn, and it would work without overflowing grounds and water everywhere.  Every now and then, I would have to turn the POD a second time and puncture the POD a third time to keep the water flowing. I called Keurig, and to their credit. they sent me a new machine and even sent me a box of coffee to replace the ones I lost. I've had the new machine for 2 days. We will see if this one lasts. I have been a Keurig user for over ten years, and this is the first issue I ever had."
"Great for single brew coffee. About 3 months after purchase, started making strange noises intermittently long after coffee was brewed. Ended up trashing it..."
Have had a few issues it doesn’t want to turn on if u keep messing with it though it usually does
"Having had many very large Keurigs in the past, I was pretty excited to get this smaller one. Saving space on my counter since we no long drink coffee every day. I cant seem to make a good cup of coffee using this machine. Its always way too light and sad. There is no way to choose a stronger cup like there is on the bigger models. Sometimes it even stops brewing right in the middle of making. Not sure if i like this machine. I miss a good cup of coffee."
"I do not like how it makes a loud snap noise when you pull down the handle !  It’s not the most sturdiest unit, but for the price it will do,  I don’t expect that it will last very long.  Spend the money and get a good one. Another thing, bought at the end of August,  it included coupons that expired in June ! 🥴🥴🥴"
"Works fine but no manual on who to call, cleaning instructions etc."
"Using a normal mug that everyone else uses in the country, the height from which the coffee comes out of the machine until it hits the cup is high and therefore splashes all over the counter. It makes a good cup of coffee, but you have to mop up afterwards."
"My daughter bought us the first Keurig which we had for years. We loved it! I bought a new one weeks ago because the first one was quitting on us after years of use.I loved this new Keurig. It worked so much faster than the last. But now it quit just days after the 30 days and seller doesn't allow returns. I'm having to deal with Keurig directly instead. I bought another because we have to have our coffee. My husband showed me the boxes they came in. First box was just a regular brown one with the name Keurig on the side, no inner box like you would find at a retail store and no protective packaging. Just tape holding the water container lid closed and one holding the drip catcher to the machine. No manual either which makes me think it was a refurbished machine. I don't remember seeing anything stating it was refurbished when looking at it online. I don't throw money at anything refurbished. I am sorely disappointed.This one we just received came in a retail box protective packaging like you would expect when buying from a retail store. I contacted Keurig to find out what warranty if any they have. If they have a warranty on the other one, I'll keep it too in case I need it in the future. I know I'm just not happy with the ""used"" one. I know things can go wrong with even brand new, but a no return/no refund on something is not the way to treat someone who trusts to have better service on a brand spanking new item is not the way to go IMHO."
"The first morning I had this, I had ""filled"" the water reservoir with water the previous night.  I put in the coffee k-cup and pushed the buttons.  No coffee.  And no water in the reservoir.  I added water to the lowest level noted on the reservoir.  I pushed the buttons again.  No coffee.  I added more water.  Finally, coffee.  It was way too weak. This has happened repeatedly.I love the size of this coffee maker.  I love the looks of it.  But continually getting weak coffee in the morning is not working for me.  I'll try another mini.  If that doesn't work, I'm not sure what I'll do."
You get what you pay for.
The coffee pot was suppose to be red.It is an orange/red.
"works well, but,cant use cozy up pods! tried a couple of pods and won't break a hole in the bottom pod! hope I don't have trouble with other brands because its going in my camper and not easy to just pop out and buy more!"
"The coffee maker seems to work OK - I'll have to try different brands of K-Cups. I'm put off by the fact that I spent time trying to register the product and it kept telling me this is wrong, that is wrong. Waste of time."
"my Keurig purchased in 2013 died and I bought this mini because it's just me most of the time. It's a pretty color. I'm stepping away from black and silver. Directions were easy to follow and it worked just fine. But it's only been one day, it fits under the counter cupboards, looks sweet and has auto shut off plus it quickly brews the coffee.My only complaint so far. You get coupons for pods plus if you register the machine you're supposed to get five boxes of pots and here is the big butt: all the coupons and they offer for free boxes of pods expired June 2024 and today is October 2024.Here is the update after using the machine for a while. I noticed that the coffee spits out behind the cup, leaving a mess behind the cup.here’s my last update. Still spewing coffee and the coffee as some reviewers  say is not very hot and not very strong even though I use Keurig pods."
"This machine is super-cute and makes good coffee, but as other reviewers have noted, it splatters all over the counter no matter what size mug I use. That's a deal-breaker for me; it's going back."
When it works it is just fine. The problem is that is shuts itself off way to often. I've done all the fixes you find on Google but the problem keeps coming back.
This would be perfect for a dorm room or camper but do not buy this for your home if you’re a coffee drinker daily!! Works great but should’ve read detail closer- my bad!
"My Keurig stopped working it’s been less than a year.One day last week it just started making a loud noise( talking lawnmower loud) and cut off.Called customer support twice and was informed to send a pic of the serial number along with proof of purchase. Ok completed that, when I called back today I was told they did not receive the email both times so I’m not too happy right now. Didn’t think it would be such a task to get a replacement from a reputable company. Patiently waiting.. will update to let everyone know the outcome."
"It does the job, but it’s a bit loud. I was looking for something more compact & it’s definitely small & sleek but the noise drives me crazy."
"I've owned Keurigs for years. Never a problem using reusable pods in them. For this one, I've tried 3 different versions - & I'm still not sure the one I'm using now won't break the thing that comes down from lid into pod. I ordered pods that said ""for use with Keurig K-Mini"", but they just don't fit smoothy. It's like the pod holder isn't setting correctly in the machine, close, but not exactly on target. Trying to decide if I will keep or return."
"Keurig is convenient but I've never had a Keurig maker ""spit"" and splatter coffee like this one. It requires cleanup after every use!"
"I like the small footprint of this, but even though it says it can brew a 6 oz cup of coffee, if I put anything less than about 12 ounces in the machine, it only sucks in the water but does not heat and dispense.  Very frustrating (especially when I have not had my caffeine).  If you like a larger cup of coffee it will work fine.  Going to buy a bigger one - unfortunately it is too late to return this one."
"you know when i saw this back in march it looked like a good product. slim, very much so for a coffee device of any tier. it made one cup as all pod loaded coffee makers do. and it was at the time on sale for $59, which isnt saving a whole lot considering its regular price but the last keurig i had before this one, that being a K- compact was the same price. but the K-compact had a 30+ Oz  tank. but was twice the width of the mini. now here's where my salt comes into play when i bought the mini. it was because i needed a machine now. and couldnt get to town for a replacement for my compact. and on amazon there was a slew of reviews stating this that and the other about how bad it is. save for one guy who wrote a book about the pro's. what they said was in short, it leaks from nowhere that should make sense.{ill get to that in a minute} it spits grains into the cup at a liberal rate, has electric failures. and or quits working at about six months if your lucky.... now the pros are exactly what you'd think its small, so that means you can fit it anywhere, whether at work or at home or even if your brave, in your car.{ i would not do this} other than that, for the time that it works it does its job well. some folks said that you couldnt fit a reusable filter in it. so i tested that as well. dollar store brand filters will not work people, period. keurig cuts the plastic to fit their own brand of filters. in some cases? that means a cheap reusable filter might fit like in the K-compact, but not this guy, it is made to be a tight fit and with as little leftover clearance as possible. this creates the problem with the coffee grains. because of how tight it is, it pressurizes the pod and the filter so much that the lids come loose, which poors the contents in to your morning jumpstart juice. next ill talk about the leaks, they originate from the very pipe that takes water from its tiny tank to to the pump that drives it all. that entire assemble was corroded when i opened it up. which stems into the electrical shorts it seems to be known for. what happens folks when an exposed circuit board with an active current touches water....even with all these problems i decided to push this thing into the ground. and sure enough at a rate of three cups a day, it burns out within six months. that being last week per the date of this review. the pump stopped working because it had corroded so badly over the months that the electric motor driving it was disintegrating from rust and moldy water.for the same price as this engineering disaster. you can get a K-compact that will do the same job and last you for about two years or more.and something else ill point out after opening the two makers up? my first K-compact? no problems that dont come with wear. it stopped working due to its heating equipment. but that was after two years. the k compacts needle? that squirts hot water into your pod or filter? stainless steel.... the mini? cheap plastic. which means that you will have a harder time closing the lid of the mini while using pods because it just isnt sharp enough to do it as easily as the K-comapact.im not a guy who goes out and spends three months reading about the ""perfect cup"" im a guy who sees a machine. and its innards and can point out what should and should not be, so if you still want this thing? be ready to baby it."
"I love the appearance and the size. The problem is that it works as expected some times,  and other times it explodes the K-cup which makes a huge mess. I purchased this as an emergency replacement as my previous Keurig unexpectedly died, and I'm wishing that I had ordered a different Keurig, but I'll make do with this one until I can really be picky about the next one that I order.  It's OK but not great.Edit 01/08/2024I am revising my rating to 4 stars. I found out that if I poke a tiny hole in the top of the Kcup with a pin before I put it in the Keurig that it doesn't explode all over.  The only time this happens is when the top of certain Kcups are a bit rounded rather than flat.  The pin poke allows a bit of air to escape before the big poke of the Keurig needle.  I'm much happier.  Hopefully this will help others."
I mean. It works. You have to sometimes press the brewing button again. Open it up and close it again.
"We have owned this coffee maker for 2 months. It is used on average 1 time a day for a single K-cup's worth of coffee. This machine splatters coffee everywhere unlike any other K-cup machine I've ever used. Since purchasing, it has failed to brew 4 cups of coffee (clogged needle? inadequate pressure? I don't know - I've unplugged it, removed the wasted k-cup, and run water through it to ""fix"" it). It also has the loudest operation of any coffee maker I've ever owned. I understand that this is the entry-level keurig machine, but it's performance has been unacceptable.  I will grant that when it (loudly) works, the coffee that makes it into the cup is as good as higher quality keurig machines I've used."
Too simple. and only. stores 1 cup and every time need ma to pour water for each cup.
"disappointing.  this is the third kuerig I have purchased in the last 1.5 years  They all work for a little bit and then stop.  i like the convenience of Kcup, although not so sure how environmentally friendly it is.  When this one that I purchased in August went bad (and I got the boring grey color unfortunately), I contacted Keurig support via email, was told to call.  Then after 30 minutes of questions was told would be sent a replacement, however they then wanted pictures, me to put my name on a piece of paper and date it with a picture of the device, a picture of the serial number and giving them emails from amazon and the order number and date was not sufficient proof of purchase for them.  So, now out another $100 and no coffee machine.  Won't buy another.**Update after this review, although I did not rec further correspondence from them, a replacement was sent to me and it is working better. My advice is to save items such as amazon email confirmation, register etc. though."
"Well, that was disappointing. Ordered this on February 8 this year. And it broke down today, August 5. Do I think a refurbished item should work longer than 6 months before it stops? Yep. Sure do.When it worked, it was a sweet little machine.I've always had good luck with refurbished items. And I'll probably still order them because the prices are budget-friendly. But I'll try an extended warranty next time."
This is the third identical Keurig I had over the last 6years.  This one is noisy.
"it was delivered to my house in a box that had already been returned with a big red sticker, so i returned it."
"I formerly had a larger Keurig but after many years of use, it stopped working so I had replaced it with this one since this one is more compact. Bought this last December. It stopped working after 4 months. I thought I might try to fix it so I put it away for another day. Then I forgot about it. I just took it out and, of course, it doesn't work. I am tossing it. It is a piece of junk."
"I'm used to a larger Kuerig with cup option buttons. It was a small adjustment to just use the amount of water needed for the cup size or coffee strength. BUT I am NOT a fan of how to get the water heated and filling the cup. I've used the machine several times and STILL haven't figured it out. The light flashes signaling all that. Seriously? I prefer a button to heat the water then a button to fill my cup. I use it while working so I like to be able to walk away and keep working while the water is heating. Don't know if it's me not understanding the instructions, a design flaw or a combo of the two. Somewhat disappointed but I get my cup after a few moments of frustration and move on. If it wasn't for the size I'd go back to my bigger Keurig."
I had to hit the button twice in order for the water to boil.
I would love some updated coupons please!I purchased this 9/10/24.  I'm sad.
"Purchased in 2019, and has now finally failed. I'm a two-cups-a-day person, and kept the unit cleaned and maintained. About a month ago I noticed the fresh brew was no longer piping hot, and this morning it was barely luke warm. It's quite noisy, but, doesn't take up a lot of space. I'm upgrading to something that hopefully won't end up in a landfill so quickly."
"Generally is was user-friendly but after a month, the taste of coffee changed."
I return the coffee machine.Not happy with the coffee machine.Quailty not good
"**** UPDATE 8/2023: I'm through, done, kaput with Keurig. The performance of this machine is just too sporadic and time consuming. In addition, I can't tell you how much purified water and coffee pods I've wasted just trying to get the doggone machine to brew a single cup of coffee. With that being said, I will admit that it always works --- eventually--- and after adding additional water --- and running water through again.But, all that work and time, just to have one cup of coffee is too much. I've had other Keurigs in the past. The first worked fine for several years. The last three, not so much. This latest one started acting up within the first four months. I hung in there, but now it's time to try something new.8/22: Not enough room on your countertop for a coffee machine? Only want one cup at a time?  Well, this machine can help with that.  The Keurig K-Mini delivers a good cup of coffee, one cup at a time, every time, even in the tiniest corner of your kitchen. With cup sizes ranging from 6 to 12 oz you can choose exactly how much coffee you want.  And, you get a fresh cup in a little under two minutes.We like that the small reservoir ensures that you need to add fresh water every time you make a cup. Sure, you can put water in overnight and just run the machine in the morning, but both my husband and I like to add fresh water each time (our larger 48-oz coffee machine didn't need frequent refills, but the water could get stale if not changed often).We still have our older Keurig with the larger reservoir. That one has been with us since 2012. It continues to make a great cup of coffee particularly when serving several people. But, the Keurig K-Mini is the one that sits on our kitchen counter now and it's just what we were looking for as we only drink 1-2 cups per day.*** Update (2020):  We've had our K-mini for five months now. It still makes a good cup of coffee, but makes intermittent noises. Sometimes the noise is loud and persistent (particularly after brewing) sometimes not.  We researched answers from the manufacturer. This is what they wrote - "" This is considered expected behavior for the K-Mini coffee maker. After brewing, heat will still be present inside the hot water tank. This heat causes the air to expand and forces it out of the brewer. The noise you are hearing is likely air flowing through the hole that regulates brew pressure. Hope this helps!""  Hope this helps :)*****Update (2021). After several weeks our K-Mini (purchased in 2019) wouldn't brew after the third or fourth cup. The water would run through, but wouldn't complete the cycle. We finally figured out that you have to run a cup of cold water through the brew cycle and then it would brew. After a while that became annoying.*****Update (2/2023). We purchased another K-Mini in late 2022 thinking that the last one was faulty. Nope! This newer one is starting to behave in the same way --- and of course it's well past the 30 day return window. I still enjoy a morning cuppa, but sometimes it takes waaayyy too long just to brew a cup of coffee what with waiting, waiting, stop, take pod out, run water through -- put pod back in (already punctured mind you) wait, wait - then finally brew. Whew, at this point I'm exhausted and that's why it's only great some of the time!"
"This is so cute, but doesn't meet the quality that I am familiar with owning multiple Keurigs. It's the perfect color for my vacation home, but feels so plastic and the water spills out while in use on occasion and I haven't figured out why. I would've returned it but shipping to PR was a pain to begin with."
Sounded simple but confusing. Didn't do well. Don't like it.
Hard to find pods that fit.  Too expensive
"Beware, I purchased the Breville Barista Touch Espresso Machine in December 2022. I started having issues with the ""start "" button not working in April 2023 from time to time. When it would happen I would try everything,  even unplugging the machine.  I thought it might be a fluke.  But it wasn't.  In May  I contacted Breville  by email and got a pretty quick response requesting more information and proof of my purchase from Amazon.  Breville has a 2 yr warranty.  So I figured I would get a replacement as I  only used it for5 months.  Then I received an email telling me to try plugging it in in a different outlet. Which I had already but I had another appliance plugged in to the same outlet and it was working.  But I still tried a different outlet.  Didn't work. So after providing more information., I the next email I received told me I would be receiving a box with in the next 5 business days, to pack this defective Breville Barista Touch Espresso Machine in and all the instructions on what not to send, that Breville would repair the defective product and return it within 5 to 7 business days after they repaired. To ship it back to Breville for repair.So I waited and waited and when I didn't get the box to pack up this defective expresso machine, I wrote an email again and then never heard back for 3days, so I wrote an email again asking them is that how they took care of customers and stated I had thought Breville was a reputable company.  By this time after not hearing anything from Breville support, I called the support number. I talked with a representative, who pulled my many emails up and all she could do was apologize.  I then asked to speak with a supervisor or manager,  she immediately told me one wasn't available,  that shehave them call me back. By thistime I knew I was getting a run around, so I told Breville representative I was contacting Amazon. Said goodbye.I immediately called Amazon talked with 3 different people,  got my issue dealt with but in the meantime I received another email from the Breville representative who I spoke with on the phone stating by 7pm that night I would receive the return box for repair of this defective expensive machine.  Never received that return box for the repair. Never heard nothing else back from Breville support.  Nothing! Amazon took care of it and made an exception for me but I  lost about 200 dollars on it.I would advise everyone not to purchase a Breville,  they don't honor their warranty and don't provide customer service at all. They only give you the run around.They are not a reputable company!!Oh BTW, I wrote Breville an email telling them that they were not a reputable company when they do not stand behind an honor their warranty and I would never buy a Breville product again and that I was going to write a review on them. Within a couple of hours after sending that email to Breville support,  they replied and stated they were sorry for my frustration and sent me a 25% coupon on my next purchase of a Breville product.  I wrote them back stating how dare they. I could not believe they totally thought it was ok not to honor their product 2 year warranty and totally disregarded and disrespected me."
"I was excited to purchase a Breville espresso machine, as it’s well-known for its excellent performance and quality. True to its reputation, the machine itself was fantastic—brewing rich, flavorful espresso with ease. However, my experience was marred by the condition of the item I received.I purchased it as a ""Used - Very Good"" item, expecting some minor signs of use but nothing major. Unfortunately, it arrived with a broken water tank. It was clear that the packaging for the used item was inadequate, and I suspect improper handling during shipping contributed to the damage.While I had to go through the hassle of returning the machine and ordering a new one, I still believe the Breville espresso machine is a fantastic product when received in good condition. I recommend buying it new or ensuring that any used or refurbished option is packaged securely to avoid a similar issue."
I like this espresso maker very much. What I do find is the machine is pretty inconsistent on coffee grinds by weight as well as the amount of espresso. Other than that great machine.
"I bought this 3 months ago. The bean grinder jammed two weeks ago. Opened a support case on Feb 16 with breville and no response on the case. I cleaned the grinder basket per the instruction to  no avail. When you call they say they have unexpected high call volume and maybe able to call you back in a few hours on the support line recording.If you go to chat is says agent offline on their site. They did call me back and advised an advanced cleaning of the grinder which I did and it restored it! I did not see that there were more parts to remove and clear before. It was a challenge to get the individual grinder gears, plates and felt ring out of there as there or no tools to remove them but I finally got it after 10 minutes of tanging using needle nose pliers and a toothpickI liked this machine a lot when it was working.  Then company needs better support at least chat support enabled to follow up on support cases. The device is under warranty, but that doesn’t matter when you can’t reach anyone to either get a replacement or to get it fixed. I had to call in several days / times before I got a response. The tickets submitted do not even get an acknowledgement as they are backed up apparently. If you are that backed up on Customer Service calls, that unfortunately says a lot about the quality of your products."
"We immediately noticed how smooth the coffee is (we use the latte setting). That's the good news. The bad news is that it goes through much more coffee than a regular drip coffee maker, and the on/off button is beginning to fail after just a couple of months. For these reasons, it's probably not worth the high price."
"This was my first experience using an espresso machine and learning about how to pull proper shots, grinding, bean roasts etc. This machine was a good help in understanding how things work when making espresso. A few things though:1) The grinder is ""okay""... it's a little hit and miss on grind texture and sometimes, for some bizarre reason, the grind size will change on its own. I don't use the automated grinding function as it doesn't make sense: each bean and roast will come out differently depending on a number of factors. I'm not sure how Breville approximates the recommended size of 18 grams of grounds into the portafilter given the bean roast variables mentioned that influence the output. So what I do is grind the beans into a bowl and then weigh them into the portafilter on a scale independent of the Breville machine. It helps ensure consistency.2) Small design changes would help.-The aforementioned grind size wheel changing on its own. Not sure what that's about.- The hole below the milk frother is too small... if it was slightly bigger, the clean cycle(s) would spray into the underlying tray with better accuracy.- The tray has some water issues - there's a tool storage compartment that tends to get water in it after a few uses so I don't store the tools in there.Cleaning is pretty straightforward - make sure you order extra cleaning tablets though as they only provide a few.The frother is automated and fine for our needs. Not really latte/cappucino experts though so opinions may vary.The funnel is a great tool to ensure your grounds all end up in the portafilter.The ""automation"" of walking you through how to make different drinks was immediately left in the dust. I couldn't wrap my head around those drinks given the challenges of producing consistent grind results.Overall, a good starter machine. When I go to replace it, I'd definitely get a separate grinder though."
Love the machine but not the presets. If youmake a Latte or other drink and change thesetting they do not hold..so you have eitheruse a custom setting or reset everytime youbrew. Not sure why they did not program thisto hold the adjusted settings on drinks likeall other machine manufacturers do. Makethe process pretty tedious.
"First, this was a great machine. Saved me money because I literally never ever buy coffee out.  I take this thing with me on road trips!BUT I want to caution everyone be very careful with the little milk heat sensor knob that you set the feotger pitcher on.  Mine had gotten some gunk in it and I was cleaning it, I guess too rough. It is connected by the tinest wire apparently.  So it broke.  And in Breville's amazing wisdom, they make the whole machine unusable when that one part breaks.  So ya can't even just get a shot of espresso.  Then you will figure out that no one carries that stupid part in the US.  So I had to order from a UK company.  This is just an insane huge design flaw.  And it is dumb to brick the whole machine for just heated milk froth.  Which that also should still work, because I could buy a milk thermometer and do it manually.  Any hoo, just received the new sensor and now I will have to take apart and install.  That sensor was over $100 fyi.  Can't remember exactly price but do remember my eyes bugging out."
"The machine is now giving me a system error E05 message and the entire machine is offline. After googling it sounds like it's the milk frother thermostat which has nothing to do with the espresso maker part of it. It's a nice to have not a necessity to measure the milk temp. Why did breville not have a bypass option to just deactivate the milk temp feature and operate the frother manually??? Going through my Amazon credit card extended warranty to hopefully get it dealt with. I'll update after I hear back from them.Super disappointed that this $943 machine crapped out already. I bought it bc I thought breville was a quality brand. Apparently not bc there are many many complaints of the same issue with this model. So it's obviously a design defect with the machine and not ""wear and tear"". I only used the machine 1x a day 4 or 5 days a week.Breville should be offering everyone who owns the machine free repairs for this issue!"
"Loved this machine but Breville needs to address the problem that keeps giving the dreaded Error ER05. Prob 9-10 months after purchase it popped up and there’s absolutely nothing you can do, other than send it in—if it’s under warranty (1 yr). It took at least three weeks till we got it back, which is a big issue. When you pay over $1k for a machine you expect it to last for a while. I feel like for that price, Breville should immediately send out a new unit, fix the problem, and sell the fixed one as a refurbished unit, instead of letting their customer sit for that length of time. Now less than six months after getting it back, the error is back and of course we’re past the one year warranty. According to my research, it’s caused by two tiny wires getting torn in the temperature sensor under the frother. Online commentors say it’s a simple fix you can do yourself with a small replacement kit you can buy online, but the only place you can find this kit right now is Australia—anywhere they are carried in the US, they are sold out. I can imagine why. I would not buy this model again unless I’d purchase an extended warranty with it. Otherwise it’s easy to use and makes amazing lattes, Americanos, etc. But Breville needs to address this defect that clearly is a common issue with this model!"
"This is an update from my first review, which was a one.  Now that I have had the expresso machine for a while, I can give a better review.  I cannot fault the machine.  It is very well made and works well...so why the three review.  It is because the results of the various types of coffee...latte vs Cappuccino and the others...simply put are not different from each other.  Excellent machine, but a less expensive model would be good.  I wish I hadn't spent this much money."
"Kind of bummed that this was my first ever actual espresso machine (aside from nespresso but I don’t count that as a real one). When I first received the machine it worked perfectly, of course it takes some time to figure out the right grind setting and everything for each bean you use but I figured it out within an hours time and we were good to go. It was great tasting, delicious , I thought it was the best money I had ever spent considering I was a die hard Starbucks lover- daily and it was adding up. Fast forward not even a full TWO MONTHS- and the grinder stops working . I contacted customer service because of course there’s a year warranty on it, they said ship it to them for free and they would repair it, which is fine, but for a brand new machine that I just paid over 1,000$ for I was kind of annoyed to find that it stopped working so quickly and more annoyed that I would have to be without daily espresso for 2 weeks which meant back to Starbucks to spend more money while it was repaired , the sole reason for buying this machine to save money in the end.I then receive it after the repairs and the SAME exact grind setting / grind amount, SAME beans-  EVERYTHING the exact same and the espresso is not coming out the same. I previously had nice solid espresso pucks and great tasting espresso on these settings with the same exact beans and now after being repaired the grinder does work again but I have played with the settings on this machine after being repaired for 5 days now and I am still unable to get even close to the same exact result that I had when I first received it. I really feel that after not even TWO MONTHS of having a brand new , seriously expensive machine, it not working that breville should’ve had me send this machine back they could repair it to sell as refurbished and I should have been issued a brand new one because after the repairs it is still not working how it did when it first was delivered to me, and for 1,000+$ machine you hope it’ll last AT LEAST a full year without needing anything fixed on it. I am not sure that my next espresso machine will be a breville after this experience :("
"** Updated review**....InitialIy I was very pleased with the service that I received from Breville. After receiving a defective product, they said that they would send me a shipping box and return label to return the product so they could either fix/repair it. Well after not receiving a box for a few weeks I called back. They showed it delivered. When I verified the address, they had left off the unit #. So no clue where it was delivered, but I never received it. When I explained this, the young lady said that since it was delivered, they couldn't send another one. Even though they are the ones who did not put my complete address. After going back and forth with her, she said that she would have to send it up to a different department to get authorization on it, and she would call me back once she heard back. After a few weeks, no call back. I called again, and the young lady said that she would get one ordered, and still no box delivered. Still trying to get this resolved after 3 months, but not holding my breath. This is the LAST time I will ever buy anything from Breville!!! They obviously don't honor what they say, and now I am stuck with this very expensive machine that makes lukewarm coffee. Very frustrating!!!I will admit, I am a totally novice when it comes to espresso machines. Years ago I had a friend who had a Breville and absolutely raved about it. I always had it in my mind that I wanted one, but the price was more than I wanted to spend. Well a couple of months ago I got a pretty nice bonus from work, and then they a good price for Black Friday, so I got it. I am super impressed by the looks and how easy it is. I have had some issues with the machine itself. It wasn't heating up very well at all. I wasn't sure exactly how hot it needed to be, so did a little research. Found out an espresso should be close to 100 degrees. I bought me a thermometer so I could test it, and it is only about 59 degrees. I contacted Breville and was very pleased with the service I got. They are sending a package for me to return so they can either fix the issue, or replace it with a new one. Maybe a little inconvenient, but I am just glad it will get fixed. I will add to this once I get the replacement."
"I’ve been wanting to get this machine for a while now and when I finally did it was the most disappointed thing ever. After about a week when I first got it, it started presenting problems, it just wouldn’t turn on and it would take me a few tries to get it going, then I proceeded to contact a refills support and they were not able to give me an explanation at all they just said to record a video of the problem and send through email to start the process for a replacement. Unfortunately I’m in Guam and somewhere in their policy says that they are not responsible for anything that happens outside of the US so basically if you order through Amazon to anywhere else, to put it nicely, TOO BAD! You spent thousands on a coffee machine that doesn’t work and you are stuck with it. Amazon support was not able to cover a return either which is even crazier and so my question is, why is amazon able to ship it all the way here and why be evil le would allow that when they have an issue with replacements and anything that needs to be fixed can’t make it back to them. They just took my money and I’m not able to use the machine!!! This has been going on since August, today I still don’t have a solution."
I’ve always liked breville products but this one did not last. I love all the features on this machine and the ease of using it. 1 year later the steam wand no longer functions correctly. It has started spurting out small amounts of water while it steams and now my milk is watered down. It’s no longer under warranty and I can’t figure out how to fix it so it’s just a giant machine on my counter that makes only espresso shots. For the money I’m disappointed.
"If you have a toddler and are used to cleaning up their messes then assume that you've added another toddler with the accompanying mess when you buy this machine.  It leaks more than a store brand diaper and throws coffee grounds like a 3 year old having a tantrum at the sand box.I've considered building a miniature shower stall in the kitchen just for this machine.  Instead, I bought a rubber mat to sit it on.  Now I have a mat shaped clean spot under this machine on my counter that is surrounded by coffee grounds.Just like a toddler, there are multiple types of messes.  For every cup of water you pour in the machine somehow two cups appear in the drip tray.  Thankfully there is the convenient tool tray that doubles as a water overflow bin!!Oh yeah, this machine makes coffee too.  But don't expect a consistent pour.  If the Breville gods are displeased you may get half a cup.  That could be half a dispenser of ground coffee or half a cup of water in your cup.  Be sure to do your morning coffee dance to ensure the gods are appeased!I'd write more but I have to go powerwash my counters."
"Within the first three months, the machine broke and we had to send it out for repairs (fully covered with the warranty). During this time we didn't have the machine, which took almost three weeks; a inconvenience but not the end of the world.Now, 18 months after the initial purchase, the machine is leaking every time it is used and leaving a small pool of water underneath the base of the machine.Unfortunately the warranty is only 1 year...The product is too expensive to have these issues and such a short warranty."
I guess I’m dumb or something but I thought I could use this machine for a fabulous cup of regular coffee in addition to espresso etc. NOT so. Went through 3 different types of beans and spent 4 hours and had to go to Wawa for coffee ! Returning.
Bought this for my wife at the end of March. We were both very happy with it. Unfortunately it didn’t last a year and it now won’t brew. Tried customer support and had to leave a message. Their message said we have a high call volume and it will be hours before we return your call. Still waiting. Have a very expensive item that takes up counter space and won’t brew coffee. Very disappointed.I do hope the issue can be resolved.Update. they did return my call they really seemed to have went the extra mile. we ran through some tests. following this the lady said we will be shipping you a shipping package so that you can ship it to us. they are handling the shipping and the repairs. I am very well pleased with them. they are standing behind their product. I do know that machines do break. when they stand behind them that makes all the difference in the world to me.  I am well pleased and would buy a Breville again due to the customer service. I was wrong and reviewed negatively too soon. I should have given them more time.
"The coffee maker was definitely previously used.  Coffee grounds in grinder and throughout box when opened and I had to reset the product to factory settings.  Was also missing certain pieces, water test strip, some of the cleaning materials.  Was able to set up initially without these parts with additional research, but is frustrating when you think you're investing in a quality product."
"I paid almost $800 because the material is supposed to be stainless steel. The only parts that appear to be stainless is the tray, milk frothier device and pitcher! The rest of the machine feels like plastic."
"After several weeks of trying to get consistent coffee, couldn't figure it out. Numerous reddit forums talking about weighing your beans and etc. Aupposed to be easy and friendly to use, but nothing but torture. Ended up swapping for jura ena 4, a much better choice for a novice in the same price range. Yes bought freshly roasted beans and followed instructions and watched numerous videos. Do not recommend unless you are a barista or a pro."
"We enjoyed our machine until the frothing sensor died due to the faulty wiring issue so many others have mentioned .  Sent it back to get fixed and it worked for a while but now had other issues with the steam wand. We have descaled, used the proper water filter, cleaned the group heads and all other suggestions and it still is failing.  Purchased 1 year ago and used for 2 lattes per day.  Very disappointed in the quality and longevity."
"We have loved Breville machines now for over 5 years. We decided to sell our Barista Express after 5 years and upgrade to the Touch Pro.  It was easy to learn and we love that even our kids could curate the perfect latte without our help for anyone!It is easy to set up and use. Cleans out great and was a fantastic purchase..... Until we got an error code Christmas day😭. We had this machine for under 2 months and got a heat sensor error code that needed factory resetting and fixing. If our Barista Express had zero issues for over 5 years, and we transported thatachine all over and have used itt literally thousands of times )/(I do Mama's and coffee mornings with women quarterly plus we use it as a ministry tool for fellowship) out lasted the new and improved Pro touch.... Made us very sad. So we returned it to Amazon and will not be repurchasing this machine.  We've influenced over 5 other people to buy a Breville Espresso machine in the last 6 months , and I hope this same issue doesn't happen to them.From love to hate in .8seconds on Christmas day😭"
This error seems to be the milk sensor based on what I can find on forums but after waiting hours to speak to someone at Breville and not being able to I am here to warn people off. This is a major design flaw and now we have no coffee machine that functions. It's a giant brick. Amazon return window has closed as well so we will see if we can ever even get ahold of Breville. Be warned.Update:Breville did fix it and paid for shipping etc. wasn’t fast but they did take care of it and it’s fine now. Just wanted to be fair that we did resolve the isssue through customer service. The unit otherwise is a great unit. Updating to 3 stars
"My wife bought me this $1000 expresso/cappuchino machine. It worked well for 2 months, but then if you ground your coffee fine, it didn't seem to have the pressure to make good espresso and I was worried something was wrong so I returned it and bought another. When I set up the new one, it did not work at all. The heating mechanism on it didn't work. You got cold coffee and cold milk and nothing would make it heat. I called up Breville for trouble shooting, and all they said it seemed like it was defective. They said they could send me a new one, but after 2 out of 2 machines failed within 2 months or immediately, you really have to question the quality of the product and their quality control. I am very disillusioned with this Breville product.  This whole experience was really extremely disappointing. I broke down and bought another unit. its warranty is for 2 years. at 2 1/3 years, the milk temperature sensor apparently broke which is a very frequent problem described about these machine. When the thin wire breaks, It makes the whole Cappuchino/expresso/grinder disabled so you can't use the machine at all. They do this so you have to buy a new one or have them replace a $30 piece for hundreds of dollars. I find it all a huge scam by the company. First, they should fix this problem about a flimsy wire breaking by making the wire thicker. It is a design flaw that could be fixed easily if they wanted to.. 2nd just because the temperature sensor on the milk frother malfunctions, there is NO reason to make the entire machine unusable. I would buy an external thermometer to measure the milk temperature\\but NO, they make the entire machine unusable not allowing you to do anything. You can't grind beans any longer for some stupid reason. You can't make expresso. You can't do anything because of one knowingly defective easily breaking sensor on the milk brother. Ridiculous. With this attitude by Breville, I would advise everyone to chose another brand. NO ONE makes their entire $1000 Touch Cappuchino Expresso machine unusable because of a milk temperature  sensor malfunction because of a flaw Breville has never chosen to modify so it won't break. Now that this is happening, it reminds me of another Breville machine I had whose milk sensor also stopped working, but on that machine, the malfunction did NOT prevent everything from working. I really resent Breville for doing this to its customers."
"I want to clarify that this coffee maker is excellent. I mean this used one in ""Acceptable"" condition. For me, honestly, an ""Acceptable"" version should be fully functional and only have unimportant cosmetic issues. Specifically, this machine that I received has a serious problem with the water measurements and it also doesn't allow you to adjust it to a shorter time, which is very sad. Honestly, it was a waste of time. Also, I think it was used profusely because it had wear on parts like the coffee grinder. Unless someone else in the past has replaced this part in this one to replace it with a new one. Anyway, this is what happens sometimes with this business of buying used or in conditions other than new. Returned."
"Works fine, surprised by the dent that’s on it. Hard to imagine it happened during shipping since it’s packaged so well and there was no damage to the box."
Never plugged it in...I apparently received a refurbished machine that was missing several key parts such as a tamper and water filters.
"Update:  still no response from Breville customer service but my espresso skills are getting better through YouTube vids and books.  The espresso shot function initially delivered perfect shots, but after a couple weeks the coffee was coming out too fast and bitter.  I tried adjusting grind, temperature, beans, cleaning the whole unit and resetting back to factory defaults but nothing helped.  I tried contacting Breville but have not yet been contacted after 2 days of waiting ""in que"".  For some reason I am not able to submit a trouble case through the Breville website. Amazon assistance was responsive but only suggested everything I had already tried.  For the amount of money spent, I expected more from Breville.  Now if I want to return it, it will take a month to process a refund.  I feel like I'm stuck with it now. At least I registered it so the warranty is good for 2 years."
"This is a nice looking espresso maker, which comes with all the needed accessories, except for coffee water and cups.We followed the instructions tips and guidelines over several days and could never get it right. We expected, at this price point, for the machine to be user-friendly and easy.  It was exactly the opposite.  It was frustrating, quirky, time-consuming and overall, a big letdown.For the record, the box was heavy and had a hole when we received it.  It looked like it may have been handled a little rough. We considered that rough shipping may have contributed to the machine not doing anything well. But in the end we think the machine is simply “style over substance.”We returned it; bought a separate grinder and espresso maker that together were 1/4 the cost. They are all stainless, look great on the counter and are easy to maneuver.While the new machines are simpler and slightly more “manual” it took us 1 attempt to get a nearly perfect grind which resulted in a rich crema and overall smooth, clean espresso.We are certain that there are those who will love the Breville and probably have few issues. But this was a good lesson for us.  We will not be buying anymore over-engineered countertop-trophys."
Great machine but was not able to get it to make decent coffee. Definitely not a one button coffee maker as you need to be your own barista and make the right portions to make it right. Too complicated for me as I need a quick coffee maker when i am “on the go”. Returned and got myself a Nespresso.
"This is a great machine and was very pleased with the drinks it produced right up until we got the dreaded ER05 code that meant our machine would not function. This means that a wire has likely broken that goes to the milk temperature sensor. Unfortunately this does not simply disable the milk frother, but instead disables the entire machine. There are many videos on how to repair it but honestly on a machine that costs this much money I find this to be unacceptable. Buyer beware."
"I was super excited to get this machine and eyed it for a long time.  It was easy to set up and brewing great Americanos. I had two issues with the first machine.  The water ejector was flipping back and forth as it filled my cup, it was almost like there was a very small obstruction.  I could not correct this issue.  The second issue was with every other cup more almost as much water ended up in the tray below as it did in my cup.  I called and customer service was great and shipped me a new machine.The second machine was working properly and gave me the same quality without the water flickering back and forth...making a larger properly sized cup.  After two weeks, it started do the same thing as the last machine.  Rather than replace, I was still in the return window so I opted for return.I bought an extended warranty, but since I had two different machines doing the same thing I felt that I did not want the long term headaches with a machine that may continue to break down or need to be constantly replaced.  I was glad to get a refund on both the machine and extended warranty.Based on the taste I would recommend the machine, but based on my experience, I would not recommend."
"I’m not usually one to write a negative review but I simply couldn’t at least share our most recent experience with Amazon. We are prime members, have been for a few years now and have yet to have an issue like this. However, after having this experience it makes me question on ordering future things from Amazon.I have been wanting this Breville Espresso Machine for a while now and finally got myself to make the purchase. Upon purchasing, I was notified it would be on back order for over 1 month. I was disappointed, but knew that what would be coming would be well worth the wait…but boy was I wrong. Upon opening the box the machine REEKED of coffee grinds. Not that I have a problem with the scent itself, but the fact that it most likely meant this machine was used. After opening the machine it was clear as day that we were sent a very much USED machine when we paid the price to receive a NEW one. And when I say used, I don’t mean just opened and then repackaged. I mean used to make multiple coffees. Splatter stains all over. Coffee grinds everywhere. Scratched all over. Pictures attached for reference. When you’re spending this kind of money on a machine, it’s not to receive something in this condition.I am just beside myself with how Amazon could let something like this get by. When calling customer service the only thing they could offer me was a refund 3 days following dropping off to a UPS store and a measly $10 gift card for the inconvenience. I will be reordering this appliance, but not through Amazon. It’s clear that they can’t differentiate new and used appliances."
"Even though the product makes good coffee and lattes, etc. it’s tedious to make each cup of coffee. Also, only short coffee cups only fit the machine"
"Machine is more complicated than you think. Also, seller is not so friendly with refunds. When I returned the machine in pretty much mint condition a week later, they didn’t issue a full refund. I’m still not sure why."
I want to love this machine but it causes so much stress!! The grinder will only work every few days
"This review is on Amazon Warehouse and not the actual Barista Touch. GF has one and it’s an amazing machine and simple enough that an espresso newbie can master. This low review is for Amazon Warehouse advertising “Very Good” condition for the Barista Touch and marked down basically $40 off retail. Thought I got an excellent deal when I saw everything in the box still sealed and wrapped. Pulled the plastic off and it was dented front and back, with the plastic groove on the bottom front right (I guess it’s supposed to serve as the balance portion) shattered into about 20 pieces. I picked a few up from the plastic it was covered in. I definitely don’t think it was damaged in transit. I think it was sent this way. Ordered plenty from Warehouse before and never ever had an issue. Cosmetic blemishes, a missing cord, that’s fine and understandable. But when a $700 espresso machine can’t sit level on the counter because its entire right footing is broken off, that’s not what I’d call “Very Good.”"
"I bought the machine August 2020 and loved it. However, a few months in I had problems with the milk wand. (I clean it thoroughly every time I use it!!) i sent the machine in, no cost to me! I got the machine back with the comment that they opened the machine and found it dirty inside, it had to be cleaned throughout. Hmmmm. An almost new machine dirty? The Barista Touch asks you regularly to use descale or cleaning cycle…. Which I regularly do, with the recommended tablets. I use only filtered water too.Since a few months I noticed less espresso in my cup. I checked the grinder if the beans are grinder too fine etc, everything I could find as recommendations. Still in 60 sec mode I get only barely a teaspoon of coffee… warranty is up, costs to send it in for exchanging parts etc is quite expensive. I’m sad, because I really liked the Barista Touch in the beginning. The problem is that regular cleaning and descale cycles are not enough and if you’re not a specialist who can take the machine apart and back together, it’s only a short lived pleasure. It’s just too expensive for 2 years and 7 months"
"Pros- Solid Build Quality- Not annoyingly noisyCons- On going learning curve.. not different from regular espresso machine. No way to identify if the machine actually making proper espressos. Many times pucks had water left over even after espresso shot was done.- Settings need to be tweaked every time coffee beans are changed.- Whatever espresso based drink is selected, machine makes same espresso- Automatic frothing and touch screen are not very useful to justify higher pricePS: Since I work full time I do not have the patience to have such deep learning curve. I found similar problems with super autos when I tried them out at store. I also do not have the time to call customer care during my work hours."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Worked fine for 2 weeks. Then started shutting off while frothing. The attached video shows continuous current arc noises while frothing milk which occasionally shuts down the machine completely before frothing is complete. The jumping display also shows something going on. Seems to be an issue with this and the impress line of machines. Reading up on other forums. I plan to return this machine and get a simpler setup like the Bambino plus with the grinder maybe. Not planning to take my bet at this machine and face these hassles.It is a great machine if it works though.
"This is a phenomenal machine when it worked. I loved using it as it saved me so much time going to a cafe and waiting in line. However, it randomly stopped working within just 7 months of use!I'm quite shocked how quickly it broke. I use it once a day for one person (myself). It's always kept at home; safe and kept in a cool air-conditioned place. The only thing I use it for is to make espresso shots. I don't understand why it broke honestly.Normally, I don't mind when things break because things happen. I just go through the proper channels to get it fixed. The reason for my one star review is I tried communicating with Breville via email and asking for assistance, but their response is super slow, and when they do finally respond, it's a half-baked answer that doesn't even provide any support. Nothing about offering to repair or replace when it's still under warranty.I'm pretty disappointed with my purchase. I spent over a thousand dollars on this machine. Terrible customer care. Questionable machine quality. For anyone looking to buy this machine, I would recommend really reading the other reviews. Customer care should be an important decision-making criteria and Breville is a solid 1-star rating for that."
"03/08/2022 update. After 2 yes of having this machine, I can honestly tell you Breville has such a poor customer service, this machine went twice to repair/service same issue which has not been solve last time I called they did not want to do service anymore since the issue according to them is that I don’t know how to cleaning / service the machine so they decided is not worth it to send my machine anymore, they troubleshoot over the phone and the machine work perfect for 2 days and then again same issue, wand does not reach temperature =cold milk and clogged wand all the time. I follow the steps they showed which pretty much is to reset factory default and worked 1 time only. I called and they told me they will not take my machine o my trouble shoot even though I still have factory warranty and they even extended 6 months. Thank goodness I purchased the one from Amazon and hope they will refund my money this is been the worst, useless and expensive  kitchen appliance I have purchased. Since the machine does not work properly my husband and I end it going to the gas station for coffee. Ridiculous.1st review:I bought it because a friend has it I use it several times and everything was wonderful, after five months of use there was a malfunction And stopped working, I contacted Braville which takes over 1 hr  to get a real person on the phone and they told me that I needed to send it over forservice, I asked for my money back because if this happened in less than 5 months what should I expect in the next 5 months warranty should be a most over and then I will have to get a new one??? Service will not be cheap come on, when you invest in a good coffee machine you not expect a repair that soon = bad quality product. I will be checking professionals coffee machines.Don’t waste your money on Breville, buy a cheap one since you will replace it in less than a year.Bad customer service and experience!! 😠"
"We had a Breville Infuser expresso maker (BES840DXL, 2014) that was wonderful - made great espresso and coffee; had one or two issues, but customer service was fantastic and helped to solve the problems. Our son wanted it when he went to college, so we bought the BEDS880BSS Barista (2019), which worked fine for about a year.  We started to have problems in 2020 with the controls - If I adjusted my oz of grounds to ""12"" for my profile, the machine changes all the programmable  options to 12oz; there were issue tying to clean the machine, etc.. I talked to service, but this time I was put on hold for over an hour; when I did get someone, she was quite cranky and blamed me for the malfunction; "" You much be doing something wrong!"". I tried several times after that but no one could tell me what was wrong. I asked if I could send it back, but I was told it would be a substantial cost to do that. Just before that, we bought the BTA830XL toaster, which worked fine for the first 6 months. We do not do bagels... ever... but the toaster - which was $150 - now only does bagel mode - we have to toast one side, and when that's done, we have to turn it over and toast the other side. I'm scared to call Breville again. Not buying from this company any more, which is a shame."
"I like my coffee and espresso hot. This machine, at the default temperature of 150 degrees to steam milk, cannot get my coffee hot enough even when I warm my cup first. You can turn the steam temperature up to 170° which I did a few months, back and now I’ve burnt out my milk thermostat. Got the error code, ER05. I called Braville’s customer support line and they no longer support their customers with parts. They told me to go to e-commerce or to Amazon to buy a milk thermostat. Neither of those retailers sell this part. So I purchased my expensive machine in October 2022 and it lasted about a year and a half. Expensive machine to have died after short time and to go into a landfill! I suppose I can try to sell it’s parts- LOL! ! I am very unhappy😩 about this, I expected a company with the name, Breville, to support their products and they just don’t.. No apologies, they just send you to other retailers whom they likely even know, don’t carry the part I need. I would NEVER BUY another BREVILLE product!!!"
"I purchased a brand new espresso Breville Touch machine. I followed the instructions for setting up the unit and used medium strength coffee beans as suggested. Within the very first coffee pour using the machine the grinder was clogged. Thus, I had to adjust the course of the grind to maximum course in order to unclog the grinder. However, by the next espresso drink made the grinder was already clogged again and this time completely and would not grind the beans at all. This is very disappointing consider a $1000 machine should be able to grind all various coffee beans. I now am stuck contacting customer support trying to fix this and I have found out this grinder issue is very common in these machines."
"Like everything about the machine but the deffective grinder and poor service. From unboxing, our grinder takes 45 seconds to grind a double shot (Max setting is 30 seconds) , so have to do two grind sessions. (The average for others with this machine is about 15-18 seconds for a double shot).  Tried taking it apart and cleaning it, changing settings, had no impact, support was rude and refused to help in any way, even though its brand new and clearly deffective. We will never purchase a Breville again."
"Great machine—until it stopped working. After 16 months of moderate use (5-6 times per week), the flow sensor stopped working, so it wouldn’t auto-regulate the water for shots and would just keep flowing and flowing until manually stopped (or the tank was empty). Multiple attempts to engage someone from customer support finally yielded an email asking for a more detailed explanation of the problem. Provided that info, and have received zero further response (despite multiple requests for follow-up). Extremely disappointing."
"I’ve bought this machine twice. The first time, the machine lasted a year before having issues. The steam wand completely malfunctioned at the end.While I didn’t pay $1,000 for a machine to last a year, I did think it had to a be a fluke that it didn’t last.Machine 2 was trash out of the box. The whole grinder process was off. Even the sound of the grinder was not right. I had been using the machine for a year, so I do have experience with this machine and how to use it correctly.The other thing was every pull was inconsistent - sometimes burnt, volume was off, never delicious.The second machine I bought did not work as advertised.This machine is supposed to be a high quality and easy to use espresso maker. My first one broke before being used for a year and my second one wouldn’t even give me a decent tasting pull. I’ve lost my trust in this product completely."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I literally just got this in the mail and was excited to try it out. It keeps telling me the hopper is unlocked and to twist the knob to lock, but every time I do this it never says the hopper is locked. There must be something wrong with the machine because it can’t tell the hopper is locked and so I can’t grind the espresso."
"Its great if you are a beginner, or if you want good espresso with in the budget.For a 1000 buck you get the machine and a grinder so cant beat the deal.The taste of the espresso is acceptable, better than Dunkin Donut.But not as great as a specialty coffee shop.If you always add milk to your espresso you will love it, if you drink espresso directly then ummm..."
I bought and received this Breville 880 on Oct 15. Yesterday was only Nov 28 and it doesn’t work and shows error code ER03. It’s too soon to have problems😣 Now I don’t know what to do!
"This rating is primarily due to Breville's customer service and support. The espresso machine was amazing, but the temperature sensor that makes sure the milk is heated to the correct temperature is flimsy (common issue noted online). We accidentally broke it when the machine was 2 years and 2 months old, 2 months outside the warranty period, which results in a warning code which made the machine inoperable. Be warned, it doesn't seem like you can buy any INTERNAL replacement parts for this machine from third parties, you have to send it to Breville. They confirmed this part was broken, but said they didn't have replacement parts. They then said it was ""unrepairable"" and only offered me 30% off a new machine. You can only reach front line customer service people through the phone number, talking to a manager can take three days. After a week of back and forth with Breville, they initially offered me a 35% off coupon, then eventually offered me a free refurbished replacement machine. I'm happy they did it, but the customer service process is very difficult and you won't be able to fix the machine yourself if any internal parts are broken (I did find Australian websites that sell parts)."
"We purchased this machine nearly one year ago and were very pleased with it. However, after standard use (nothing fancy), we got an error code (ER05) because the milk thermostat was broken. It's a simple fix (from what we learned online), but Breville has absolutely non-existent customer service. We cannot reach anyone from Breville to obtain what we understand is a $30 replacement part. It's been weeks of trying to reach Breville via phone, online (chat and filing a request via log-in) and not receiving any answer.Meanwhile, we have a $1,000 espresso machine that we cannot use. We don't care about the milk thermostat, but the machine is inoperable with the error code. Effectively, one small item goes out, you cannot get a replacement from Breville, and thus the entire machine is non-functional. It's a terrible waste.If you're going to buy a nice machine, I recommend getting one where replacement parts are accessible, lest you experience what we have (a perfectly good machine with a small error that renders it useless)."
"Have been trying to get service on a less than one year old Breville Touch Espresso Machine.  9 months in and it randomly started adding too much water.  We did hours of trouble shooting and finally got a response back for warranty service.  Apparently, after reading reviews on line, this problem is not uncommon.  Sent in over 10 days ago, and no update from Breville, can't get anyone on a phone line and without the machine for the holidays.  A great machine in concept, but so far, very disappointing not only in the performance, but the horrible customer service.  If you buy this...good luck!"
"Please do not waste your money like we did. I bought this machine in November 2023 for $859.95. The coffee machine was producing decent espresso shots, and we were happy with the purchase. We followed all the manufacturer's maintenance guidelines, including filter changes, de-scaling, and cleaning. Last month, I noticed that the size of the espresso shot started reducing. A few days later, the water pressure ultimately died. Hot water produces a tiny amount of water, spitting it violently.A thousand-dollar coffee machine should not die in less than a year. No news from the manufacturer. What a terrible waste."
"I bought the Breville Barista coffee maker, expecting a premium product, but it has been nothing but a massive disappointment. The machine stopped working properly within days—shots pulling inconsistently, and the grinder malfunctioning. I called Breville’s customer service, hoping for help, but I’ve never experienced worse service. They were incredibly rude, dismissive, and made me feel like my concerns didn’t matter. No solutions offered, no replacements, nothing. It’s absurd that such an expensive product comes with such appalling customer support. You might want to save your money and stay far away from Breville! This was not a wise decision from my end..."
"It arrived broken and with missing components that without them make this machine obsolete.The water tank is cracked at the top. That could be switched, but when the integrated tamper is also missing, if you are looking forward to relying on all of the machine’s uses, you need to make sure to let them know.In addition to that, the basket is stuck in the portafilter. I’ll be returning to exchange it. Fingers crossed the next one is a complete unit.Edit. Tried using it today to give the machine the benefit of the doubt. It made some loud boom noises and started leaking from the group head, the steam wand, under the machine, and the water tank.I got the water tank out and re-inserted it to make sure it was installed correctly, but I think it's the machine’s boiler itself. Breville’s CS is MIA.Can't request a call back because the automated system hangs up on you, there is no agent online to chat with, and when you call even if it's during EST working hours, it says they're closed. So, it's getting returned tomorrow.Massive letdown, especially when this was going to be my son’s College present."
"I’ve now used this machine for many months and I wanted to love it but I don’t. If you want to make coffee drinks with foamed milk, this may still be a good choice for you. But if you want espresso, look elsewhere. The espresso isn’t strong enough or hot enough and the machine forms no crema on top. I’m just really disappointed with this machine."
"I had some technical issues with this product right out of the box. I honestly thought I got refurbished or returned one because of the issues. I called Breville and they assisted me. I'd say for 1,100 USD there are far better machines out there."
We had the previous model for over 5 years with no issues. This one had problems after about 4 months and now has the error code ER05 and won't function. I'm reading online that this is a common problem with this machine at/around the one year mark. It won't let you bypass the error screen so it isn't functional. Waiting to hear back from Breville customer support. WASTE OF MONEY!
"after one year of use, when i turn the machine on, the touch screen doesnt respond, i cant use my machine to do anything."
This machine was easy to use and made great coffee for two years. Eventually the temperature sensor for the milk foamer failed. The whole machine bricked because of this -- could not use any part of it even though only the foamer failed. Had to send the entire machine to Breville. They told me the machine couldn't be repaired and offered a 30% discount on a new machine. I will be buying a more reliable brand instead.
"The machine looks nice and seems to have nice features but it produces only luke warm coffee on the hottest setting.I read that this is a common defect with this machine.If it weren’t for the defective heating element, I believe it would have been a decent machine for the money."
I got this new machine and it is not making my milk hot any idea whats wrong with it ??!
This expresso machine is my biggest purchase regret. I’ve had this since February 2023 and I’ve had so many problems with it I sent it to the company to fix and sent back and still have the same issue it’s not worth your money I even have to heat my coffee in the microwave because of it getting cold waiting for the froth to work at the temperature I have it on after 6 times of stopping at 105 before it gets to 170 I’m so over it. DONT BUY SAVE YOUR MONEY.
"It is an excellent machine but once you get an error massage, you can throw $1,000 machine to garbage. Do not buy."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                It makes amazing, espresso and lattes. BUT the design of the water catch connects right near the steam wand. It leaks through the crack and drips underneath the machine.!! The engineer/design is not great."
After having this machine not even 3 months.  I’ve had constant problems with the grinder and finally it’s now longer working.  Support hasn’t given any response on the matter.  While the espresso machine and the milk frothier are easy to use and I do like.  It doesn’t do me much good if I can’t grind the coffee.  I would not buy again.
Bought this machine and we were super excited for the integrated grinder as well as the automated features.  Upon unboxing we noticed both the portafilter and the steam wand have plastic inside!  Plastic that the hot water & steam pass through.  No thanks.  I'll stick with my Italian made stainless steel option that requires a bit more effort but I have peace of mind that blazing hot water isn't passing to my cup through plastic.  Returned.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I am unable to have my settings save per coffee choice. If I change one, it changes the grind on all. If I make it a single, it changes some to a single as well. And it does not portion out appropriately. For example I tried to brew a small, giving me the same as a large. For the cost of this appliance, I am extremely disappointed and would like to be reimbursed for my purchase or receive a replacement, please."
I love Breville products but I had to return this because of the water boiling issues at high altitude. I worked with customer support to troubleshoot and after doing some more research it seems that this is common with this machine I would not recommend it for anyone that lives above sea level because water boils at a different temperature and you have no control over the actual temperature with this device. When attempting to pour hot water it sputters and sprays outward.
The machine just stopped working and shows an error code. Which means you don't have a machine for coffee. Would be great if it had kept on working. 6 months is too short of a time for a $1000 machine to break.
I REALLY WANTED TO LOVE THIS MACHINE. MY SISTER HAS THE MANUAL ONE AND RARELY HAS PROBELMS. NOT FOR THIS ONE. I BOUGHT IT NOVEMEBER 2022 AND HAVE HAD TO SEND IT BACK TO BE FIXED FOUR TIMES!!! IT IS SO FRUSTRATING WHEN YOU THINK YOU ARE BUYING SOMETHING OF QUALITY. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT BREVILLE HAS FIXED IT EACH TIME - THE BAD NEWS IS THAT i want my money back.
"I'm so frustrated with this machine. I've had it for a few weeks and I've wasted 3 bags of coffee trying to find the perfect settings.  Bottom line is, even if a specific setting makes a decent cup once, it won't consistently be good at the same settings just a day (or an hour) later!It's important to note that this is my second Breville machine so I'm not a total newbie and I understand that you need to dial things in - and I know that can take time.  I have owned the Breville Express for almost a year.  I love that machine and get a consistently good cup of coffee from it.  I purchased the Breville Touch for my office thinking it would be a nice upgrade but so far I'm not at all impressed. I will keep experimenting for another week or so to try to make it work but right now I just want to return it."
The espresso machine was great for two years and then one day it just stopped pushing water. We tried every remedy we could find in the manual. We contacted Breville and they asked us to send our machine to them. We sent it and received it back shortly with no explanation and it still was not operational. We have tried to contact Breville again and have not heard back.
"I purchased this over 4 months ago, and in my opinion,  it's too much hassle to make a cup of coffee in the morning. I do not want to work this hard for a cup of coffee at 6 am.You have to clean this thing every time you make a cup. After a few weeks, it constantly wants you to descale it. Also it would not froth my milk early in the am because it needed to be cleaned again. I'm not happy at all.  I spent a a lot of money on a machine that actually made my life harder."
"Luckily, I had a warranty on it and it didn’t even last a year"
"We loved this espresso maker at first, but after a few months, it no longer had pressure. We called and they sent a box for us to send it in for repair, received it back and still had the exact same issue. They’ve made us do multiple video chats, showing what this issue is and still nothing. they’re doing whatever they can to not repair or replace it. Quite a let down on a 1000$ machine. Hoping they replace this before we have to take the next steps to get refunded."
"So pretty disappointed for the price. Have been cleaning it weekly and descaling monthly, as well as pulling an empty hot after each cup. We like a finely ground coffee. Still the ground setting was set at 15-16 (out of 30) so nothing crazy. It clogged within 3 months of use. Got it cleaned under warranty and was returned to us with ground setting at 30 (coarser): i  kept it like that for a while and attempted to go to 20 with twice weekly cleaning but clogged up again. I got an extended service plan just in case but very disappointed overall for the price.10 Month updateDowngraded to 1 star.The problems continue. Now the steam wand won’t work, water comes out the brew spout instead. Have been cleaning and descaling religiously after the issues above. What adds to the frustration is breville’s people ask questions like “when where the coffee beans roasted?”. I would not buy this again."
I bought two of these machines and both broke within two years - hard to accept the unreliability of this product at the price you pay. The heating sensor and other parts are prone to failure. Look online before you buy and you will see that many people have big issues such as failures of the frothing heating sensor.
"I bought this in November 2019 for home use. My first cup of espresso was luke warm. I tried different grinds, preheated all the components but at preset brew temp the coffee temp was 125º. Turned the brewing temp up to max and got it to 165º. I called Breville and they walked me through various testing scenarios and decided to replace the machine. Two weeks later I received and set up the new machine. Same problem. I called Breville. “We’re very busy at this time. Call back later.” The recording encouraged me to leave a callback number but never let me do it. For a thousand bucks, Breville, you can do better than that. I called Amazon and returned the machine. Many other reviewers have had the same problem. This is either a design flaw that shouldn’t have gotten to market or a large batch of defective heaters. Since I bought it, the price on Amazon has dropped $200. Is that a Black Friday deal or ? Also, in the first 20 or so cups of coffee I made the grinder jammed twice. The replacement machine stopped brewing the first cup after 10 seconds even though it was set for 30 (it didn’t just stop dripping, it said “brew stopped” and reset the display.) I don’t recommend that you buy this machine and I would carefully read the reviews of their other machines, particularly those reviews with 1 or 2 stars."
Started having a problem with heating after 9 months of use.
"Unit has been great for about 18 months. Due to the vibration when the unit turns on and is active, it causes a milk temperature thermistor sensor to disconnect due to poor design. It is so fragile that is cannot be repaired either. The internet is filled with people out of warranty with this issue. It renders the entire unit inoperable with ER05 and ER06. Researching shows a DIY repair by adding a resistor solves the issue, but getting in touch with Breville is tricky at best. Seems like that part is only available in Australia, and is way overpriced for what needs to be replaced. Won't be ever purchasing a Breville again. Onto coffee manufacturers who design their units properly."
I've had this machine for about 30 days. After brewing there's water that remains in the portafilter. I've tried adjusting the grind. I've also left 2 messages for Breville for help. If anyone out there knows a solution I'd appreciate it.
"So the ""up to $200 rebate"" means this - you have to purchase 13 bags (12oz each) of their coffee for $18 each to get a $50 rebate. You keep doing this up to 24 months or $200 rebate money - whichever occurs first.  I find this very disappointing to pay $234 for coffee to get a rebate of $50 when I can buy 32oz of great tasting coffee for $17. The espresso maker is much better than one star - I would give a 4 or 5, but wanted people to know how the rebate works. This being said, buy this espresso machine for what it is, not what the rebate offers."
"DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE; IT DOES NOT WORK AFTER 3-4 MONTHS! AFTER 4 MONTHS FIRST MACHINE STOPPED WORKING; WILL NOT FROTH MILK.  STARTED HAVING A ""BLOCKED"" PROBLEM AFTER A MONTH OF USE ONCE A DAY. KEEPS SAYING MILK WAND IS BLOCKED EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT (I PURCHASED A NEW PART AT MY OWN COST SINCE THERE WAS NO PERSON TO SPEAK WITH AT BREVILLE; SAID THEY HAVE TOO MANY CALLS).  NOW I AM HAVING TO GO THRU AMAZON CUSTOMER SUPPORT.  HOPE TO GET THIS RESOLVED FAVORBABLY FOR SUCH AN EXPENSIVE MACHINE!  FOLLOWED ALL INSTRUCTIONS MANY TIMES TO UNBLOCK MILK WAND, EVEN PURCHASING A NEW ONE, WITHOUT SUCCESS.  ADJUSTED MY RATING FROM 5 STARS TO 1 STAR. AMAZON SENT ME A REPLACEMENT AND I RETURNED THE BROKEN MACHINE.Follow-up 3 months later: Got a second machine and it also stopped working after 3 months!  No help from Manufacturer as they are closed and no help from Amazon Product Support as they said it is past my 30 day warranty with them!  Amazon charged me $199 to return this defective machine to them!! Then they say it will take 2 weeks to process my return DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE!!! IT IS DEFECTIVE."
"Machine was wonderful for about 4 weeks. At that point, the frother kept giving me a ""clogged"" error message. I went through the routine to unclog it, as described on the touchscreen. This kept happening for days. I called Customer Service and was told to do a factory reset. That didn't make a difference. At about the same time, I began having trouble with the brewing. The elapsed time before extraction became excessively long. I suspect a pump problem with the machine.  I called Customer Service again and a replacement was arranged. 10 days elapsed before I had the replacement unit and I was supposed to return the 1st one. However, they sent me the more expensive Oracle Touch as a mistake. I called Customer Service again and was told I had to send back the Oracle Touch first, and once they received it, we could start the whole return process over. At this point, the machine has been out of service longer than it was working for me. I am a frustrated customer."
Machine came with a cracked water tank.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Machine is nice if it didn’t have 2 technical issues: 1) switches off erratically when frothing the milk 2) display is glitching.Shouldn’t be like that with such an expensive piece of equipment.
I think the less expensive ones would have done the same.  Coffee is slightly better than a drip.  The milk frothing is awesome!!
"The main issue with this item is that the clearance for the coffee mugs is not enough. Clearance needs to be at least 2 inches higher to fit standard or oversized mugs which are now commonly used.Second issue with this item, I have not had my coffee machine more than one month and it’s already requesting to be Descaled. This is disappointing in my book."
"Is a nightmare this machine, DONT SPEND YPUR MONEY, Breville and their warranties works really bad, and is a expensive machine. Don’t buy it. I bought in almost November and in January started not working correctly. I apply the warranty and I hace to sent the machine. I spend money during that time buying coffee. When they return to me, look like old machine, I always clean my machine and this looks old."
"Update- it is another 2 weeks later after we returned the machine- still have not been refunded.We purchased this on the 10th of October, it has been less than 10 days since we had it. All was going well until this morning, we tried to make coffee, the grinder makes the grinder noise like it is grinding, nothing is happening, we followed the Manuel, the steps on Breville on how to clean, fix ,nothing. We then called Breville, did a video call with an agent, showed her that we are doing exactly what it says, and she hangs up. Have called back three more times, as well as sent in a support case. nothing from Breville. $850 dollars for a broken espresso maker."
"No cup comes out the same.  Tamped to an even lb, measured on a scale, measured to .05 gram, still an INCONSISTENT waste time and quality wise.  Want to avoid COVID19'ville, get a better machine than this POS.  Brew temp issues with unequal cups every single brew.  Will do the milk hotter than the coffee, why, I don't know?  I returned mine only to have to contact Amazon over a month later to ask for my money.  Got the run around and then someone finally processed the refund.  Shortly after I got an email from Amazon stating I had returned something not in new and original condition and I was being informed not to do it again, or any returns.  Well, yes it was used, I did not know it didn't work until after using it!  Duh!  All accessories and boxed items were with it and they will still hassle you, so beware!If you want a consistent espresso the manual machines are still better in my experience.  The learning curve on them isn't much different than this 'semi-automatic' one.  As the latte site says, these are toys, not commercial appliances."
"My machine came and we got it set up and it wouldn’t grind coffee right and the pump was weak. I had this same machine before, but the pump went out so I had to get a new one. It took almost 30 days to get the refund for the first one. The one Amazon sent out that was defective they WOULDN’T replace it and I still haven’t gotten a refund. They want me to wait another 30 days for it! They already have it in their possession and STILL WON’T process the refund. So BEWARE if you order things and they come defective because they won’t replace it nor give a refund in a timely manner."
"I loved the Breville. Following all the reviews I bought it early Jan 24. It worked for 3 weeks then stopped producing hot water. Breville support grossly unhelpful.I returned it and bought it again off Amazon. This one had faulty hot water right from box unpacking. Called Breville. Their response was that if it happens again then would only fix it and not replace it (so bad)Because I love the machine so much I bought it again from Crate & Barrel Feb 1, 2024 (assuming maybe Amazon got a bad batch). It was again broken hot water out of the box.I'm done!Amazing product but something has happened to their manufacturing quality and service is dismal."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            the machine arrived with a problem with the coffee grinder
BEWARE...... Bought this December 3rd.  Was working great then noticed smoke filling up in the coffee pot yesterday while brewing a new pot.  Today it totally stopped working.  I threw away the box already cause it seemed to be working good so now I can't even return it.  Extremely disappointed. Had it for 17 days and it does not work now. I do not recommend this product. Stay away
"Based on older reviews, I bought this simple coffee maker to integrate with a smart plug: my idea was that I could tell Alexa to make me coffee when I wake up in the morning (assuming the coffee maker has coffee grounds and water from the night before). Unfortunately, after opening and washing it, I realized that the on-off switch is NOT mechanical. It is a toggle switch which must be manually pressed to turn on. If the power turns off and then later turns on (like from a smart plug), it remains in the default ""off"" setting until pressed. I understand this is a safety feature but invalidates the whole reason why I bought this in the first place. This might be a 2024 update to the product.I will be returning this to Amazon. I never made coffee with this but I assume it will be good quality from the other reviews."
"We like the coffee maker but the coffee doesn't start off very hot, and so it cools down very fast in the mug.  Not much we can do about that but I'm buying some mug hot plates to keep out coffee warm while we drink it, so it's not much of an issue.  It also goes off after two hours which isn't very long, so I have to remember to turn it off/on if I want it to stay on longer.  Other than that it's fine."
"Gone through many name brands coffee makers, if you know what I mean.  The instructions to set up is easy and operate.  The instructions how much coffee to make was very informative and no coffee to waste.  It takes one click of a switch to enjoy a cup of coffee each day, keeps the coffee warm for 2 hrs. and shuts off.  No worries if you forgot to shut off the coffee maker.Update: 10/19/24Made coffee for my parents then all of the sudden it started leaking, unplugged the coffee maker, filled it up to 11 cups and didn't reach to the number of cups, after the container cooled off, I noticed a stain bottom of the coffee plate.  Time to report it into Amazon.Update;It due to the coffee grounds, not sure the reason for the leak but I cleaned the black cup with water eliminate the coffee grounds but the black cup that the filter was sitting on. It works better now."
"If we were to rate this solely as a comparison to the other THREE coffee makers we bought this year, it'd get five stars, hands down. What a relief to have one that is actually worth the money we paid for it. Phew.What we absolutely love: We can add as many grounds as we want - for very strong coffee - without the basket overflowing and making a big mess and leaving us with crunchy coffee. Big plus for us there.What we appreciate: It's super simple. No unnecessary clock or timer to set up. Cleaning is easy peasy. The permanent basket is well made and eliminates the need for paper filters. Nice.What we find annoying: Loads of condensation in the top after brewing, and nowhere for it to go. Lift the top very carefully, and most of it will drip back into the machine, but it still makes a drippy mess on the counter no matter how careful we are.Too, the ""Anti-Drip"" feature is a big fat lie. I mean, yeah if we pour VERY slowly and carefully it's fine, but it shouldn't take so much motor control to pour a dang cup of coffee. Transferring the coffee to our thermal carafe is more of a challenge than we like to face on a daily basis.On the other hand, as I said before, compared to the other three coffee makers we bought this year, I would absolutely recommend this one. It is definitely far superior to other brands."
"I bought this updated model, thinking it had the positive on/off switch. It was good for an Alexa switch and an ""Alexa turn on coffee"" morning command. The new switch has to be manually switched on at the coffee-maker. Yeah, I know, first world problem. Now I have to traipse to the kitchen on cold mornings to start the coffee. LOL. I'll read the specs more carefully next time. Otherwise, makes a good 12-cups pot."
"Very easy to use.  Just add desired amount of coffee, adequate amount of water, and push the button.  No problem.  However, the warming plate is inadequate.  If I want more than one cup I’m finding that subsequent cups are lukewarm at best and end up heating it in the microwave!  Do not recommend!!!"
"It worked fine for the first 3 days and then it suddenly stopped brewing, the power light still turns on but nothing happens. I reached out to mueller and the customer support was fantastic. They offered to replace the item for me, which was unfortunately stolen because amazon didn’t follow my delivery instructions so I don’t actually know how the product worked."
"Within the first couple of weeks, it was suspected it wasn't working quite right. But instead of jumping on my hunch, I kept it to watch. It didn't get bad until after the time to return it. It retains water and will only heat up a cup at a time, then must be turned off so it will reset. If I want 8 cups of coffee, I can prepare myself to play with it for a half hour to get the 8 cups and then have to pour more water in it, often more than once. Where does that water go? I don't know but part of it doesn't go into the carafe. Aggravating isn't the word here. The main reason I purchased this particular coffee pot was it was the only one I found that was BPA free. I would not buy again."
"It's a basic coffee pot, so far works as it should, disappointed that it does not keep the coffee very hot at all."
The lid doesn’t lay correctly.  Have to fiddle with the filter and brown big thing.  Hate it!  3 months now… buying a diff o e
in the future I will purchase one with a clock and an off time/on time
It’s okay.  A little flimsy construction.Makes coffee and that’s what counts.
"I returned the coffee maker without even trying it. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I liked the design and the red color. I had expected some kind of quality but this coffee maker is very cheaply made. The lid to the water reservoir is very difficult to open and close. I am used to lids that just open and set back down without having to be held in place.  Also, when you do snap the lid shut, the whole unit kind of ""flexes"" because the plastic is so thin.  I did not even attempt to brew a pot of coffee because I was afraid the coffee maker might melt.  Of course that's an exaggeration but it is not a quality item.  I guess this is what $34 buys now a days.  I'm spoiled by by 25 year old Krups, which I also paid about $30 for, and it's still going strong. I know time and inflation have to be taken into consideration but I would recommend buying something that may cost more but will last."
"Sage green is much more warm and neutral. This is a bright seafoam green, reminiscent of a 60s diner.Reciew is just based off of color inaccuracy, I’m sure it brews coffee fine. Color isn’t terrible, just definitely isn’t sage green."
I am keeping this coffee maker cause I did use it but it's way smaller than I thought...no thrills...very basic ...makes coffee that's just ok.
"It makes coffee. Otherwise, it can be a real pain.  I've used numerous coffee makers over the past years, all of a similar design. With this one, if you remove the pot before it's done brewing, the spring valve doesn't work probably 85 percent of the time, so it continues to let coffee through rather than stopping the flow.  If you get the strainer and other parts lined up perfectly after you've added the coffee, your chances of success improve, but are not guaranteed.I've had Mr. Coffee and a couple of other brands over the years, and this has NEVER been an issue.  Put the water in, add the coffee, close the lid and press the button and pull the pot out at any time during the brewing--never a problem.I bought this coffee maker over a year ago, but just took it out of the box a couple of months ago and have been on the verge of tossing it since day one. I'm just a procrastinator. It still makes coffee.  And a mess."
"Update: I rewired it and swapped out the simple on/off switch from my old Mueller and now it turns on automatically when the power comes on again which is what's required for it to work with a smart plug.  Makes great coffee, but needing to undo this unwelcome 'soft switch' change sucks.------Original review:I had the previous version of this coffee maker and loved it, when it came time to replace it I immediately went to get the same thing and found they had made an incremented version with higher wattage which I was fine with.When I finally got it, I discovered that they had “improved” it in a way that makes it worse. In fact, no longer does what I require and now I am contemplating returning it.I have had my coffee maker wired to a smart plug for years so that I could schedule coffee to be automatically brewed for me and waiting for me when I got downstairs . There were other benefits too, but this new version of the coffee maker has replaced the on off switch with a soft toggle that must be pressed before it will brew.  No more fresh coffee waiting for me when I get downstairs, now I have to wait 10-12 minutes per the manual.I imagine that someone sold this to management as an improvement but it is absolutely not. I know that I’m not the only person who uses a smart outlet to control their coffee maker and I wouldn’t be surprised if others find themselves unpleasantly surprised by this change.What a shame. I can no longer recommend this coffee maker after years of being an enthusiastic fan."
"The coffee tastes burnt ...I think the heating element for the cold water reservoir is set to high...I have to turn off the machine immediately after the brewing is done as well, because the bottom heat element also seems to be running hot. Maybe I just got a dud, but I have to toss it after only 5 weeks of trying to get a good pot..sigh..I didn't keep the box or packing materials , so I'm not even going to bother trying to return it."
"Purchased this machine in September of 2024. It’s basic, but we weren’t looking for anything fancy. The lid has always been a little finicky and water/grounds would occasionally overflow if it wasn’t firmly latched… and sometimes if it was. Auto off worked well and it made passable drip.All of this is in the past tense because this morning the carafe inexplicably cracked when it was not even in use. It didn’t undergo a rapid temperature change that led to the crack. It was just left empty on the counter and suddenly decided the stress was more than it could bear. We don’t have another carafe so I guess it’s the me for a new machine… just not another Mueller."
I knocked the pot in the sink and it chipped. Never had that problem with another coffee maker
"Recently my daughter bought me a coffee maker, it had all the bells and whistles! I mean it could do everything. It also took up a ton of space on my small counter. Of course I thanked her profusely but told her it was just too much. All I needed was a small machine that can make coffee. I don't need anything but that! Simple Pleasures float my boat! Would buy this again! And highly recommend it for those who just want to make a simple cup of coffee without learning a new operating system! 😆 Lol!Update: the interior coffee basket has to be sitting just right for the lid to close. This is extremely frustrating. Three times, as the water was percolating to make coffee, it didn't penetrate through the basket and to the carafe. As a result it was spilling out of the basket onto the burner. This is because the cover didn't close thoroughly. I can't tell you how infuriating that can be first thing in the morning when you're getting ready for your day. Cleaning up this mess! My return window has closed, if it wasn't, I would return it. So basically given you all a heads up to make sure the basket is lined up and the cover closes before you turn it on"
"Did fine at first. Now stops brewing mid-way through and you have to keep turning off and on to get it to finish!update: After talking to the makers, they are sending a new coffee maker. Hopefully this one works because we like this maker"
The coffee doesn't stay hot in the carafe.  When you pour coffee out of the carafe it leaks on to the counter when it is full. I should have bought a better coffee maker
"I live in a hard water area so even with frequent cleanings my coffee makers tend to not last long. This coffee maker is about as basic and cheap as you can buy. Nothing stands out, but nothing really is a negative either. It brews coffee in a efficient time frame and I do not taste any plastics. The whole coffee maker feels very cheaply made and is so light it slides around counter top even filled with water. It needs some rubber feet. Thing is, I have bought much more expensive makers with no better results. If all you're after is a decent brew of coffee this machine will work."
"This coffee maker lasted exactly 6 months before it quit working on me. Not quite the longevity(or lack of longevity) that I was expecting. I went to make a pot of coffee and when I came back to pour a cup, there wasn't anything in the pot! The water was still in the well and it sounded like it was trying to pull the water up but nothing was happening.Why I bought this coffee maker: I was looking for a coffee maker that didn't have extra buttons, functions, etc. I just wanted a coffee maker that made coffee and had a well that was easy to clean. And this machine fit the bill! The only complaints (and they are minor) that I had when the machine worked was: 1) it didn't have an auto shut off feature (only forgot  and left it on a couple of times), and 2) sometimes, when doing a ""regular"" pour,  the water or coffee would spill out and get all over the counter (I learned to pour slower).It was a decent coffee maker when it was working. I am very disappointed though that it didn't last very long."
"But I had to return two of them after one week. Springs and plastic parts flying off when I washed the pot. Sadly, it makes some of the best tasting coffee I’ve ever had."
"Bought the coffee maker 10/23 now it's dead on 06/24. So basically I got 8 months out of the thing! Ridiculous!UPDATE: I changed from 1 star to 3 for the moment. The manufacturer offered to replace the defective item under the ""one year manufacturer warranty"". Customer service was definitely prompt and pleasant so that's why I increased the number of stars. If this one performs better I'll update my review further but I did want to give credit to the company for their effort to resolve the issue."
Wishing I had read the description better before buying. No shut off. Otherwise it works well.I like the screen/basket. Cleans up quick & keeps most of the coarser grounds out of my cup.
It's ok
"Fact it didn't last., it broke."
This is an average coffee maker.  Does the job and keeps coffee warm for two hours.  Pot/lid is awkward to clean and I always have to wipe up water from steam drips.  I would choose a different coffee maker if I was to purchase again.
The cup inside that holds the coffee filter has a spring loaded in the bottom of it which is held by a white clip.  The clip popped off when washing and is down the drain making the coffee maker useless.  this is the second time this has happened.
There's nothing special to report. It makes good coffee and is simple to operate. I'm not particularly impressed with it's construction.
Don’t like that I know when coffee is ready.  Don’t like that top filters cannot go into dishwasher.
"Smaller than I expected, doesn’t keep coffee very warm. Lid is hard to open to pour water in. It’s a basic model that brews your coffee. Nothing fancy. Great for camper or motor home. Oh you get what you pay for."
"It's really odd, but for some reason, this maker's coffee is watery and really weak in flavor. I even tried adding additional scoops, but the result was still a weak flavor. It may be due to the design of the coffee basket being inside the water cavity. I am considering getting a different maker to replace it."
"I've had this coffee pot for a month now and use it several days a week. It does brew a nice cup of coffee and is easy to maintain. Mine does not beep to indicate it's finished brewing. My biggest problem with the coffee maker is that the unit I got does not automatically turn off the warming plate after two hours. The on switch is also very easy to flip on. I accidentally turned it on this afternoon when I moved a plate on the counter and it bumped the on switch. After a near miss incident yesterday of discovering the coffee maker on and the inch or so of leftover coffee having been reduced down to tar in the bottom of the pot, I'm back on the hunt for a better machine. I have the Mueller electric kettle and it's wonderful, this coffee maker, however, is not up to the standard I expect from them."
This made great coffee that’s why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 but it quit after 2 weeks!  How do you send it back - pack it back up - for a refund? Very disappointed.
"First one I had to send and replace .... That one the water was not hot and the coffee was not cooked .... The next one .. Inconsistent .... sometimes great .... gave the benefit of the doubt ... measured coffee more carful .... SAME ... "" Nothing to write home about "" ... Got to be honest ... did not expect much either were it is made ."
"Between the flat, instead of cone-shaped basket, and the lack of a 1-4 cup button, this coffee maker does everything it can to ensure a minimal amount of exposure to coffee for the water, meaning I had to use almost double the amount to get the same strength as my old maker. ONLY USE THIS FOR FULL POTS. If you're going to be brewing a few cups at a time, you'll go through a lot more coffee."
"It’s affordable for a reason, which is sad right? This coffee pot is OK, but it really does not execute very well. I’ve only used it a few times and it leaks every time you pour coffee into a cup. Yesterday also didn’t brew my ground ground cup full of water and I had to clean that up and then it worked OK so it’s just testy. Spend the extra 20 bucks and get a better one"
"I used it to make coffee, but it tasted like plastic for days. I did the water vinegar first too. It's better today."
"A coffee pot has two jobs...1/ Hold coffee 2/ Pour coffee. This one does job #1 really well. No leaks. The coffee maker itself is great, functions beautifully and makes good coffee.The issue for me is with job #2, pouring the water into the coffee maker, and pouring the coffee out of the pot. Unless you do it REALLY slow, water/coffee runs down the side of the pot and onto the counter. Not a little, a lot. How hard is it to design a pot that pours without this issue? I'm thinking not too hard, as I have many other liquid holders/distributors that don't have this issue. Not sure if it is a big deal to others, but I find it really, really annoying. All the other stuff...the making of the coffee, the heating of the coffee, and the holding of the coffee, are great."
"Not much else to say. It worked great for 11 months before developing a leak internally. The post-mortem revealed that a leak had developed where the water leaves the heating element, which caused excessive corrosion and a short circuit inside."
It burns the coffee so you can’t leave it on long and for some reason when I pour a mug the coffee goes everywhere not just out the spout
Doesn’t seem like very durable plastic.
One of the reasons I picked this coffee maker was because it supposedly had a water level window on the left side based of the promotional photos.  This isn't the case.  It only has a window on the right side which makes this unit unfit for my needs.  Immediately returned.
simply because I ordered 2 and the other one was exactly what I wanted
Meet expectations anyway.
"showed up broken, it’s not that big of a deal but i’m still super disappointed"
"Seems like a decent enough coffee maker,but its cheaply made...the top gets really hot from the steam and you will get burned if youre not careful,and it has to be fully closed and click into place or the steam will have it opening...I would not recommend this and wont be buying another one...I'll stick to Mr.Coffee..."
"This is the second coffee maker I bought from this company. The coffee making part is fine, but this strange ""glass"" material turns brown and is impossible to get to look clean. It might be possible to clear it up with Comet or some other scratchy material, but one should not have to resort to such effort and harsh cleaning chemicals. I will try a coffee maker from another manufacturer."
"Have had it only a couple weeks, use once a day in the morning, and already twice it's malfunctioned where it stops dripping into the carafe because it's blocked and starts to overflow in the basket. basically cheap material that has to be used carefully."
I sent this back without even using it. It was made nearly completely made of cheap plastic and I didn't want it in my kitchen.
Overall this is a great little drip coffee maker! Only issue I had was the spring in the basket - it won’t stop the flow when I take the coffee pot out. Not a deal-breaker for me whatsoever but just an FYI if that’s important to you
"It's a basic coffee maker, actually very cheaply made.  I didn't mind that, since I only spent $30.What I did mind was that after one month, it happened that no water made it through the brewer, but the source tank just got hotter and hotter.  Seemed like a check-valve problem, but it happened only once.Then today, no heat at all.  The switch and internal relay clicks, but no heat to the brewing heater nor the plate heater.  Voltage seems to be applied, but no heat.  Not worth it to me to dig deeper... goes to the junk pile.I guess the carraff is still ok.... but is does spill if you don't hold it perfectly vertical... messy especially before completely waking up.Learn from my experience of this failure.  Buy something else, like I'm going to do next."
Wanted an inexpensive coffee maker with no timer. Have an Alexa plug to control on/off. Getting harder to find a coffee maker that does not have a timer or other extras. . Have had Mr Coffee and they have been ok.  Have had this one for months now. Works well. Does what you would expect. Ordered a 2nd one to have a backup since simple coffee makers are getting harder to find.  Worth the price.Update to review. Wrote this review 2 days ago. Have had the coffee maker for 7 months. It went out and no longer works.  That will teach me to write a glowing review. Using 2 nd one I bought now.
So it looks fine but the unit is very light.  Easy to move and/or knock around.  The pour spout is problematic.  Easy to overload and then it spills all over.  Happened repeatedly for me.  Otherwise it is slow but does the job. I’ve been using a paper filter but it comes with a reusable one.  Lots of nice coffee makers out there.  This one is mediocre.
I have to maneuver and forcefully close the cover of the water reservoir. I received a coffeemaker that’s defective in my opinion.
"This was, obviously, repackaged, most likely returned. I ordered a NEW coffee maker, not recycled."
Purchased this a year ago for our vacation home. Way too late to return it but disappointed in this product. This coffee pot takes over 45 minutes to brew a pot.
"I decided to replace my 6 year old Mr. Coffee simply because it was getting old and the warming plate was rusty. I saw the name ""Mueller"" and thought, ""Wow, German engineering, it must be a good one""  What a piece of you know what.  I had the same excessive condensation complaints as in many of the other reviews but that was not my biggest complaint.  Unless you line up the funnel, as Mueller calls it, exactly perfectly you do not get a pot of coffee.  You DO, however get about a cup worth in the carafe and the rest of the water has filled the permanent filter.  In just over one week this happened to me 3 times.  Then when you go to clean it you find coffee grounds in the water reservoir, in the carafe, and some burning on the warming plate.  Did you ever smell burnt coffee?  That's what you get throughout the entire house.  I sent a lengthy email to Mueller ""Customer no support"" and got crickets from them.  I threw it in the trash today rather that trying to clean it for the third time in 9 days.  NO auto shutoff, so if you have to leave the house and forget to turn it off, it will cook your coffee all day long.  I think Mueller owes me for the purchase price, the wasted coffee, my time cleaning up and the additional grey hairs on my head.  I seriously doubt I will get any response.  It is the landfill's problem now.  Rather then buying one of these, light a match to $35 and put it in your fireplace."
product descriptions are incorrect .this device is suitable for 120V operation. the description is not compatible with 220v. incorrect information
"How long have I had this??? Tooooo long. I have used this coffeemaker every single day and twice, just 2x have I been able to get a cup of coffee without the carafe leaking all over outside of the cup. I'm really hating this brand/type of coffeemaker. Throughout many years I have had different brands some cheaper in cost, some more expensive. Not one poured so sloppily. If I didn't live out in the country by myself without a car I'd send it back. I wish that there is an option of returning items via USPS. Anywhoooo, this brand of this particular type is.....fill in the blanks____. And I have not been able to take off the lid with my only arm tho' a few suggestions were made."
makes a decent pot of coffee with a few issues.  it is sooo slow!  seems to stop and pause..start and stop.  maybe i got a bad one?  the Carafe is poorly designed as it drips and dribbles.  I may just keep it for a backup and purchase a better one.
I like the look of the compact design. Dislike the way carafe pours. The lip drips.
"I needed to replace previous coffee maker and this was size and color I was looking for. Coffee tastes fine, fits well on counter... however, brewing is very noisy! (compared to my previous makers). More than averagesteam leaks out of top. Not sure if I will keep. I will add that none of the coffee makers seem to have overall good reviews : / challenging to pick one."
"This is as simple as a coffee maker gets. One button, turns on same button turns it if. Auto off in 2 hours. Very light weight, reuseable filter is flimsy, and doesn't empty easily. I'm having to rinse 50% of the grounds down the sink. The coffee is hot. But the pot dribbles every time I fill the maker or pour coffee. Over all, remember you get what you pay for. I won't purchase it again."
"The coffee maker works ok. The lid locks in place when firmly depressed and does keep some of the steam from escaping, if that was the plan. The problem I found was that when the lid is raised from the locked position the whole unit may shift about. Another problem I encountered is that the water sprayer is lifted with the lid and if the heating elements are still hot, condensed water from the lid drips down and steams out. I found this when making a second pot of coffee and was removing the cup with the used grounds in it."
"I wanted to love this, but after about three months, the brewing pauses multiple times during one brew cycle, for several minutes each time. It takes up to 20 minutes to complete the brewing of one pot. It does NOT need to be cleaned or decalcified, it completely stops brewing and then restarts multiple times."
"Moisture stays trapped, clinging to the top fill lid so that even hours after use there is a stream of water that will flow down the exterior rear of the unit when you lift the fill lid open. You have to be willing to always put a towel behind the unit when you open the lid to prep it for use.I got this for my 87 year old Mom and she would not let me return it. Trust me - I offered."
Bought this Coffee pot few months ago. It was cheaply maid. Well I guess for the price I paid you get what you pay for. BUT when I made coffee this morning the pot didn't drain the water. The light was on but nothing! I thought i would at least get a year out of it but not even a few months. Don't buy this product. Spend the extra money and get a good one. Always you get what you pay for.
"nice coffee, good for our family small but big enough to serve everyone  add on!!!  the coffee maker quit working on November 17th.  what a waste  of money"
I bought this in Feb. It's April now and just tried ii. Here are things I dislike. It will not shut off by itself after some length of time like some do. The lid is extremely tall and gaudy. Flimsy to. It's over 21 inches tall.  This makes it awkward to use under kitchen cabinet. You will probably not notice it still being on because on light is so dim. This is extremely cheap made product. I just hope I don't burn my house down when I forget to turn it off. My other coffee maker was really old. With this one you can really see the progression of how cheaply Chinese stuff has become.
"It arrived in a good packaging. It's easy to clean. However, when it brews coffee,it doesn't smell like coffee at all. Neither does it taste like coffee. I'm very disappointed. I had a similar coffee maker from Mr. Coffee. Unfortunately, it broke. I was brewing coffee for 20 years with it. I was very happy that I found a similar coffee maker. Now, I'll have to buy another one."
"Biggest weakness was that it was very light and keeps moving around when you went to push the button to turn it on and off.  Seems minor but it gets annoying.  Also, the base coating is already wearing off from regular cleaning."
"Good coffee maker that was easy to use, but suddenly stopped working after less than 6 months."
"I didn’t realize when I ordered it that it didn’t have a clock.  I like to set the timer so that my coffee will be ready as soon as I get out of the shower.  It serves the purpose, but I stopped using it after the first week and started using one with a clock.  This one went in my camper where I don’t need the timer."
"Update: less than a year later it's done.  It was great for about 6 months,  then it wasn't as hot and as each week went by it was less than warm.  If you want a disposable coffee pot for a year this is it.  If you want one that will last,  this isn't it.  Bummer, I really liked it in the beginning. I wouldn't waste my money on this brand again.To bad they don't send a follow up card 6 months or more to set of your still satisfied.I've had this for 2 months.We got this for our travel trailer and it works just fine.  No bells or whistles, nothing fancy, just an on and off switch. I've had other Mueller brand items and trust the name. Love the permanent coffee filter which I use with paper filters, so less mess to clean.I even got a follow up card today in the mail to make sure I was happy."
"This is not anti-drip.  In fact, coffee spills all over the counter when pouring.  I'll not purchase another Mueller if this is common."
The coffee spills out all over from the carafe. What a mess. It's not as hot as I'd like.
"Wishing I would’ve heeded those durability warnings in the reviews and not wasted my time or money. This coffee maker is a literal piece of trash. The first one we received already had a big crack in it so it dumped water all over the counter when we went set up the first pot. We exchanged it for another one, and after a few uses, it cracked and started leaking water in the same exact place. The plastic on this coffee maker is flimsy and cheap, which is unfortunate because my husband really liked the carafe and the coffee it made. Going back to Ace to replace the Proctor and Silex one that worked for years."
"I like that it comes with a reusable filter you can use every time, just wash it. the carafe has a problem, the sides of the spout are way too short and the coffee spills off the sides before you can put it into a cup. Thankfully I have my old carafe I can use."
"The low price doesn’t indicate a good value. For perhaps three months I was content but then dissatisfaction swept in.  If you want 2 cups of coffee at 7AM then set your alarm for 5AM so you can get your Mueller started.  The coffee flavor also degraded.  From my experience, coffee maker technology is beyond the Mueller company’s talent.  My one star rating is misleading in that Amazon doesn’t offer a lower rating.  If you’re a masochist then this is the must have coffee maker for you.  ///  My new coffee maker arrived today.  The instructions cautioned that mineral build up will clog the machine and that it would need to be cleaned after 70 brews by filling it with half white vinegar and half water.  After half of the vinegar brew is complete, turn off the coffee maker and let it sit for AT LEAST 15 minutes in order to soften any remaining mineral deposits,  then complete the vinegar brew.  (Brew a full pot of water afterwards to clean it out.) I didn’t do the mineral clean out step which probably explains why my Mueller coffee maker slowed down so badly after a couple of months.  So - most likely I owe an apology to Mueller.  I’ll never know for sure because, at twice the price, my new Kenmore coffeemaker is promising."
"Bought it one year ago, was great until two months ago when it slowed the brewing down considerably. To make 4 cups it would take 30 mins. and longer.It has been cleaned properly so don't understand why."
You have to line it up perfectly to get water to go into the pot. If it moves which it does while filling up sometimes it instead will overflow the area with the filter and make a mess all over the sink. I am going back to the cheaper Mr coffee pot that lasted years this was disappointing.
"This coffee maker worked fine for its limited lifetime but the whole handle assembly, which includes the lid, was loose enough that it moved around the carafe during washing and drying. That happened all the time. The whole thing just stopped working in May so it only lasted about 6 mo. anyway."
I wanted a simple coffeemaker w/o bells & whistles. This coffeemaker makes very good coffee but there's always a puddle of water afterwards. I probably won't be buying this brand again.
"I wanted a simple, no frills coffee maker. This one would fit the bill if it didn’t burn the coffee almost immediately. I’ve had a dozen or more coffee makers over the years and this is the only one I’ve had this issue with. I’ll be getting something different."
"You get what you pay for. This coffee maker takes a prolonged time to brewing water placed in reservoir. It takes 10 + minutes to get not even one full cup. If I still had box for carafe, I would have dental back. Don't waste good coffee using it!"
Coffee pot still works 4 months later but takes 1/2 hour to finish. My other cheap coffee pots took over a year before they started slowing down because of mineral build up. Unfortunately I bought two of these machines. I'll stick with Black & Decker or Mr. Coffee.
I thought I was getting a Black Friday deal!  The coffee pot was listed at 50.00 some odd dollars and I got it for supposedly a good deal. I can’t imagine it costing more than 15.00 or 20.00 at the most.
I purchased this based on the reviews that it kept the coffee hot for sometime. Unfortunately we are not experiencing this. The first cup is hot but then the coffee quickly cools in the pot. Disappointing.
"Iso of easy & expected just that & indeed that's what arrived. However, makes the WEAKEST cup of coffee. We use extra dark very strong coffee yet it was so watered down due to rapid fill drop no beuno!"
"Waited to right a review until we had used this coffee maker for few days and that's all the longer it lasted. Delivered Oct. 9th and quite working Oct. 22nd threw in recycling this morning plus the short time it did work the brewed coffee wasn't very hot, after drinking half a cup would have reheat the remainder in the microwave. Would strongly not recommend purchasing this product!"
"Takes 25 minutes for a pot of coffee. SO SLOW!Drips when you pour it, no matter what. Filling up the coffee maker or a cup. Big mess!No auto off, I forgot to check that before purchasing.I feel this is old technology, sitting in a warehouse from 1980Pro: Not made in ChinaCon: Slow and messy"
"I was trying to get a bit better coffee maker than the basic Mr. Coffee with the manual on/off button. (The last two of those have had problems with overflowing grounds, no matter what filters I used.)However, this Mueller coffee maker button doesn't stayed pressed on, so when I say ""Siri, turn on the coffee maker"" from bed in the morning, my Vocolinc smart switch will turn on, but the coffee maker won't turn on until I toggle it's weird button.Had to return it to try to find a different coffee maker with a toggle switch that stays on, no matter whether the coffee maker cord is getting power or not."
It didn't last 2 months
"I don’t need some fancy coffee maker. But why can’t they make a good standard drip coffee maker. It makes fine coffee. But the display is not backlit, it’s dark gray text on a gray background, and super small. If you’re over 40 you’ll need to have a magnifying glass next to it. The buttons are laid out in a way for you to make mistakes. Rather then auto being next to on, auto clean is next to on. I’ve hit auto clean a few times when I meant to hit auto. Also it’s easy to hit auto clean instead of on. There is not light indicator for auto mode. Just a small text in the bottom. Coffee is fine but it’s a pain to use."
"Makes coffee the way it is supposed to.  A bit noisy during the brewing process.  Two drawbacks, 1. the display is small and hard to read, there is no backlight to help out, 2. the coffee maker shuts off after just 2 hours and there is no way to adjust for longer time."
"I bought this one month ago and for the most part I like it.  I like all the features and settings.  The two things that really bother me are:  It's very loud!  I have an area in my bedroom where my coffee maker and mugs, etc are so I can have coffee before I even have to go downstairs or talk to anybody other than my cats, cuz you know, people, eww.  I wanted to be able to set the coffee maker to brew 5 or 10 minutes before I wake up but it's so freaking loud IT wakes me up, so now the alarm on my phone is useless.  The other feature it boasts, and other people who bought it were happy with, is that the lid stays up on it's own.  Well, mine does not.  It goes down immediately (insert your own joke here)  I have to rig it stay open so I can pour the water in and put the filter and coffee in.  I know these are first world problems and I even feel a little petty writing all this, but that's my review and I'm sticking with it!  :D"
"the buttons have a plastic coating which makes them hard to push down.  I reset my pot daily to start in the morning and I find it difficult to get the program button to push down enough to get the blinking time (which lets you know the program is set).  Too late to return it, but would if I could..."
I purchased this because of the auto turn off feature. Make sure you take advantage of the warranty. I had one similar about 6 months ago and due to power surge it went out. I got the same one. Black n Decker is my brand.
"This coffee pot didn't even last three years BUT when it worked, it worked well. It was easy to use, easy to program and the carafe virtually unbreakable!  I'm in my 60s and liked this pot the best BUT it began to clog up and grounds were everywhere. Some mechanism broke and we never could figure it out. We checked prices on others and bought the same one again. Why? I don't feel like the carafe would break easily and we knock ours about unintentionally and break a lot of carafes. The coffee always was hot, even if full of grounds. They make things to break and there is not an American made coffee maker.  Make the best of it and examine the policies of your elected officials rather than their personalities!"
"I have used a Black & Decker coffee pot for many years, and decided to try and get a coffee pot that doesn't drip so much.  The vortex feature looks compelling, but when I opened the lid while it was brewing, the nozzle output created anything but a vortex.  And only two of the nozzles were being used during the first half of the brew.  The output from the nozzles is about the same as any other brewer, really, if not even slower.  When the water had been spent for brewing the water basin hissed menacingly and spewed dangerously hot steam.  Also, I dropped the unit while removing the plastic wrapping that was adhered to the plastic, and the hinge on both the lid and the 'vortex' arm broke easily.  The flavor was no better due to the 'vortex' arm, in my opinion, and the hissing steam at the end of the brew sealed my impression that this is a rather cheap coffee maker, in material build, and not a substantial improvement over its predecessor in the Black & Decker line.  I recommend going with the version without the 'vortex' arm or one rung higher on the material build offering."
"It was a pretty good coffee make for the price. They are all about the same, IMHO. We replace them about every 2 years or so. This one just quit after about 1 year, so 3 stars instead of 5."
It brews coffee. 3 stars because there's nothing to indicate it's on and it doesn't stay on very long after brewing.
It just is not intuitive.  I have to get the manual out to reprogram it every time the power goes out.  And there is this annoying cleaning feature that prompts you to clean the coffeemaker after 60 uses.  That is way to frequent for me!  And you can't reset the reminder.  You have to go through the whole hour-long process.  Coffeemaking is basic - which is all I wanted.  Please no bells and whistles where they aren't needed!
Works well except the burner is already starting to rust. I try to make sure pot is dry when I place it back on the burner but it is still starting to discolor and looks like rust.
Coffee does not seem to be hot enough.Very disappointing
"The coffee maker itself seems good. I like the simple design. The biggest flaw in this coffee pot is that it will easily overflow with coffee grounds in the pot because of a poor design that opens the drain when you place the coffee pot on the base ( it would not allow the drain to open) There's an arm at the back of the coffee pot which pivots to allow the valve to open and the coffee to drain. The angle on this was insufficient so I had to pull it off, heat it up until the plastic was soft enough to bend, then I bent it so that the drain valve would actually open when putting the coffee pot in the base. After making this change, I'm very happy with the coffee pot."
"I recently purchased the Black + Decker coffee maker featuring their innovative vortex technology, and while I appreciate how it enhances the flavor of my coffee, I’ve encountered some frustrating issues that have significantly detracted from my overall experience.First and foremost, the vortex technology does indeed make a noticeable difference in the taste of the coffee. The rich, deep flavor that emerges is a step up from the standard coffee pots I’ve used in the past. It really elevates my morning routine and has rekindled my love for brewed coffee.However, the positive experience ends there. My primary complaint lies with the brewing process itself. I've had persistent problems with water pooling on the coffee grounds, which leads to overflow in the coffee pot. It’s not just an occasional hiccup; it seems to happen every time I use the machine. I find myself having to monitor the brewing process closely, which is far from the convenient experience I was hoping for. Cleaning up after a messy overflow is not how I want to start my day, and it definitely diminishes the enjoyment of my freshly brewed coffee.In summary, while the Black + Decker coffee maker excels in delivering better-tasting coffee thanks to its vortex technology, the ongoing issue with water overflowing is a major drawback. If they could resolve this design flaw, it would be a fantastic product. Until then, I can only give it a 2 out of 5 stars."
"First its a great coffee pot, makes great coffee but it seems that when I move it around there is always a small pebble of water under it?And it not from filling it has I pull it out from under the cabinet to fill it, not sure what the problem is its just weird."
"This does NOT come with a ""reusable filter"" as listed. The instructions refer only to using a basket-style paper filter.  - I saved the reusable mesh filter from our last coffee pot and that fits this pot's filter holder and works fine. But that's why ""often bought together"" in the listing shows a box of paper filters and a metal filter. - We stopped using paper filters years ago, so it would be a deal breaker if our used metal filter didn't work.The photo on the left I'm posting is what the UNLIT display screen looks like in our kitchen. That's all the light available in the place where we have the pot. The time can be made out (barely), but nothing else. The photo on the right is the deceptively bright photo in the Amazon listing. The things you need to see besides the time are if Auto is on or not, how long the coffee's been made, the 1-4 cup feature, and the PM you have to see to know if you're setting the time in the correct part of the day. Yesterday I could never manage to see if the PM was on, so I just guessed at it. - Today with a flashlight held close to the display, I could finally see the PM and the other tiny things on the display.One more complaint - It doesn't beep. I didn't know coffee pots were made anymore that don't beep when they've finished brewing. You just have to get used to how long it takes and check if it's finished or not.So this is a BARE BONES pot that we're disappointed with. We're keeping it because the coffee comes out fine and we don't want to hassle with returning it. But this is the most we've paid for a coffee pot and we are unpleasantly surprised that it's a step Down from what we're used to.Not recommended. Pay a few more dollars for pots that you can be more sure about from the details in the listings. - BUT keep in mind - even the details can be wrong, like this listing which says it has a reusable filter. --"
"For the most part, this is a standard drip coffee maker. Fill the carafe with water and add to the water compartment. Fill the basket/filter with coffee, and turn on...But the part I find annoying, albeit a first world problem, is that the measurement markings on the carafe do not match up with the markings on the water compartment. As an example, for me, going up to 4 cups on the carafe comes closer to 3 cups on the compartment. so you may have to experiment a bit to find the right spot on the carafe based on how much coffee you are making.Other than that, the maker is easy to set up, clean, program, turn on, turn off (though the on/off indicator could be larger/easier to see....)."
I was surprised at how light weight and flimsy this coffee maker is. I would not buy again
"We had to return our first order because there was a line/marr in the carafe that looked like it would lead to a crack farther down the line. I will say the return process was very easy. When we received our second machine, we inspected the carafe very carefully and it was perfect. We then started inspecting the rest of the machine when we noticed the buttons were very different looking from the description on the website and even from the picture on the front of the box (photo above: top, what we received; bottom, picture from box). They were not ""true"" buttons, but something that you depressed. We thought perhaps there was a film covering them, but that was not the case. They felt very flimsy and looked like future trouble. Just depressing then to try them out just felt ""off"". We really wanted to like this machine, but we just don't feel that the quality was up to par. If the buttons had been true buttons, as depicted in the photo/website, we would have kept it. We returned it because of that."
"The coffee maker was OK.  Not top of the line, but had the features I was looking for,  programmable, auto shut off etc... It makes a pot pretty quickly which is a plus,  Unfortunately, the lid for the carafe broke.  I opened the lid to add water and it snapped right off.  There was no force, it was not hit or bumped, it just snapped off."
"About 8 months after purchasing this coffee maker the water would only brew about 60 percent of what I filled the reservoir with.  The rest would steam away or stay in the basket & filter.  I cleaned it regularly every month or so with vinegar & water.  I contacted the company & they sent a replacement as it was still within the warranty period.  The replacement arrived in a timely manner & was a new unit.  I have been using the replacement unit for about 8 months now & so far there is no sign of the same problem developing.The only ongoing issue, which occurred with both the original & the replacement unit, is that it does not keep the coffee hot.  It's just lukewarm.  I have to microwave the coffee to get it hot enough.  Which leads me to believe this is a common occurrence with this model coffee maker."
"What I liked:*  Nice enough looking - as coffee makers go.*  Simplicity of use.  Press 1 button & it's on.*  Size fits under cabinets (barely, so check first, if you have low cabinets)*  Auto Shut off, in case he forgets.What I Dislike:*  Clock is so bright, you could land planes by it. We had to put metal tape over it, because painters tape barely even dimmed it.  It gives me headaches, and blinds anyone who looks directly at it.*  The Lid is so hard to get on & off, Hercules would be cursing.*  Not surprisingly, the Lid broke exactly 33 days after delivery.Overall, it's a Coffeemaker, and the coffee, the filters, & water will determine if you like the coffee or not. My complaint is not the quality of the coffee, it's the  'designed to break soon'  manufacturing that annoys me.It's so tight to get that lid on & off (& the plastic is the shattering type, not the bendy type), so there's no way they don't know it's gonna break, and sooner rather than later.  33 days in operation before breaking is mighty convenient timing, for a 30 day return policy.  Thankfully, Amazon allowed me to return it, since it's close to Christmas.I'll be ordering another coffeemaker, but not this one.  I am not amused, as we have company coming this very evening, & no time to shop around for coffeemakers.  Boo Black & Decker."
"Buying this coffee pot for a Christmas gift was probably not a good idea.Yes it looks good, has the right lights on it to let you see the time and if it’sOn or off. But sadly to say to stop working after a few months (4 months)No I won’t buy it again, but it was nice while it lasted."
brewed  coffee fine but was very loud as there is a space between drip and pot.  Returned it
"I have tried four times to program for my morning coffee. Have followed the directions, exactly. No luck. This is a feature I enjoy very much, so I’m quite disappointed."
I bought this coffee pot 2 months ago and I set it to start every morning at 4 a.m. One morning it did not brew all of it. Now it says it already needs to be cleaned. I've never had a coffee pot that had to be cleaned so soon.
"I have had this coffee maker for almost a month now and I have found that it makes a great cup of coffee. I have no complaints at all about the temperature or the flavor like I have read in some of the reviews.With that being said, there is one thing that I will complain about, and that's the clock. One of the biggest reasons that I bought this unit was because it was programmable. I enjoy having my coffee ready for me to pour it and go to work in the morning without waiting. The clock on this unit will hold time accurately for a day or two at a time, then inexplicably it will lose 15 to 20 minutes by the next time you look at it. You reset it, and again a day or two or three later, it's 15 to 20 minutes slow again. I have never seen anything like it. All of the other appliances with clocks keep their time correctly. There haven't been any power loss situations, and the voltage coming out of the outlet is right where it should be.Since the rest of it works just fine so far, I have decided to keep it and just compensate by setting the programming a little earlier so that I can be sure my coffee is ready when I leave for work even if it decides to lose its 20 minutes overnight (which it has done).Because of this, I can not recommend this coffee maker to anyone looking to purchase one."
"This coffeemaker leaks out of the top for some reason. It’s not like it has a hole or anything - but water comes out of the top from condensation of something. So you have to occasionally wipe of the counter that it sits on.Where the lid attaches to the pot cracked after a months use, but it still works on one side so it’s no big deal.It also automatically shuts off after 2 hours so you have to turn it off and on again to reset the 2 hour timer.Other than that it works ok - just a few nuances that I don’t care for."
"So I was super excited to get this as it is programmable except I’ve yet to be able to properly do that despite going off the instructions. As a mom of a newborn, it was super important to have a machine I could set the night before and have it ready for me first thing in the morning but now I’m having to go to the kitchen to turn it on. Most annoying however is the automatic shut off of 2 hours! I seriously don’t know anyone who would finish a pot in two hours but even after the shut off it cools down so quick that I’m forced to pour the coffee into a mug and heat up in microwave prior to then pouring into my metal thermos. I have a 15 yr old Hamilton beach one that stays hot all day that I think I’ll need to resort to 😞"
"Brews quickly, overall good quality.  Problem is that the machine does not achieve adequat hot plate temperature.  Necesitates user to transfer to microwave and thermos."
Love the coffee pot and works great. But when I got the coffee pot it had no instructions or paperwork at all and said it has a 2 year warranty but no way to guarantee the warranty. The description when I ordered it said it had a reusable coffee filter and it doesn't have one. For the most part not bad and works
This Black and Decker Coffee Maker was probably produced in the same factory that makes Mr. Coffee and many other mediocre coffee makers.  Water temperature is not as hot as my old Braun coffee maker.  The warmer is also average - I often have to microwave my coffee.  I'm sticking with the Braun/Cuisinart coffee makers in the future.  Its worth the extra money
"So we literally only brew coffee two or three times a week . First it stopped draining on it's own. So we added the clip inside. Helped for a minute but then it started having internal explosions regularly. So we removed the lid. Once again helped for a minute. The binder clip doesn't always stay on. So sometime it gets forgotten. That is where the popsicles sticks come in. There the only way to stop a full explosion in progress and if not put in in time, coffee grounds will need to be washed out parts you didn't even know this coffee machine has.  This machine is just over two years old now"
"It brewed coffee ok, but the filter basket had absolutely straight sides which sometimes allowed grounds into the carafe. It was also ridiculously deep which made getting the filter and used grounds out more difficult than just turning the basket upside down over the trash. I know, first world problems, but it irritated me to the point I returned it."
When you open the lid to empty the filter it drips water all over the counter.  The lid should have been set inside of the unit instead of overlapping.
"Sleek coffee pot, brews fairly fast and doesn't take up a lot of space however the light on the power button is nearly invisible and as someone with vision issues it's incredibly hard to tell if it's off/on"
"It's very..large, but the buttons -all of them, are tiny & difficult. I've never seen such a small power button (& the 'on' light is very hard to see, even for someone with good vision)"
This only lasted 9 months! I used filtered water and cleaned it regularly. Very disappointed
"Packaged well for shipping. Cord is about a foot(12"") too short. Previous 2 coffee makers sat in a sweet spot between plug and sink, still allowed me to fill from spigot while having power; this one does not. Also, when running clear water through it to ensure it was working, noticed that there is no indicator of it being on or off. Feel that this could cause an issue with accidentally leaving it on. Previous pots had indicator light so you knew whether it was on or off when leaving it unattended. Not pleased, would not order this again due to stated issues."
"I knew it was inexpensive but wasn't expecting it to be so cheap. I figured they've been making coffee makers for so many decades they should be able to make a good inexpensive version, this one however is inexpensive and useable. Main issue is everything fits poorly so just using it causes evaporation to leak from the lid and to drip onto the burner after removing the carafe.Anyway, it's cheap, it works, what more can you expect so it's 3 stars."
"I have trouble when I do more than 4 cups, the filter and grounds just make a mess, and it’s a pain in the butt to just empty the filter."
"I bought this black & decker coffee pot thinking it would be very similar to my old coffee pot.  It is not.  I usually make coffee for myself and make 2-3 cups every day.  The one feature I am very particular about is the 1-4 cup feature.  This coffee pot has that feature but it is challenging to use.  The button is very easy to see and use but extremely difficult to see if the feature is on.  My previous coffee pot had a light which came on and was easily seen.  This product does not have that feature. It shows up instead in the time panel.  However, it is like font 2 in the lower right hand corner.  It is not lit up, and  You basically need a magnifying glass to see it.  This coffee pot is going to Goodwill and I will be purchasing one that does not require so much effort.  Coffee is an important part of my morning and not happy with this contraption."
"Every time you pull the pot out to pour a cup, it drips a fair amount of moisture on the hot plate. A real pain in the rear!"
Brews very slowly. Constantly says “clean” even after I clean it. It does not stop dripping if you try to get coffee before it’s done brewing. The numbers on the coffee pot are very hard to see. Very disappointed!
"I was very happy with this coffee maker until this morning, when it just stopped working.  I'd only used it a little over a year.  Aren't these things supposed to last a little longer than that?"
"I’ve had this coffee maker for only 2 months and the heating plate is already chipping! It looks old already!! I had expected more from this brand.However, it’s easy to use, the coffee brews quickly and is very good. I just don’t know how long it will last since it’s showing wear already."
"Very surprised at Black&Deckers product...no lighting behind the digital clock so you can barely see it, extremely loud percolating, and no beeping or buzzer when coffee is done brewing.  None of this was in the description, however I'll give two stars for hot coffee!Guess you can't depend on what you thought were longtime reputable dependable dealers anylonger!"
"Overall, a pretty standard coffee pot with easy to clean basket system and water reservoir.  Individual buttons for HOUR/MINUTE make resetting the clock and timer very quick which is frequently an issue with coffee pots.  My biggest complaint comes from the temperature set point for the warming function.  It is way too hot. I drink my coffee black but have to wait a decent amount of time for it to cool down.  Another issue with the temperature is that it is pretty burnt by the time you hit the warm function again. This may not be an issue at all for some people if you add milk/cream.  Otherwise, overall it's a decent coffee pot that is good for the price."
We have tried three different types of filters- all price ranges. The water still overflows leaving coffee grounds in our coffee. Grrrrrr
"Good, basic coffee pot but the sneak a cup feature does not work."
Lasted a week before it started leaking.
Make sure you have 20/20 vision before purchasing this coffee maker. Since THE CLOCK DOES NOT ILLUMINATE I have to use a flashlight to set the time or brew strength.
"This is my 3rd Black and Decker coffee maker I have ever purchased and i am a bit disappointed with this one. The coffee is nice and hot, but the clock and timer don't work well. Clock is hard to set and the timer doesn't always go off when it should. The is an important feature for me."
"Buyer Beware!! I purchased this coffee pot for two reasons. Reason one it is a household brand, reason two it fits in my semi truck cabinet. I bought this September 21, 2024 and it broke November 22, 20204. Resister R21 overheated and broke the solder joint (see pic). I will not purchase or recommend this product to anyone. I have since purchased a pour over and electric kettle. I hope this review helps!"
"Didn't last 3 months. Hot water runs outside the pot onto the heating element and all over the table, or doesn't drip out and water is left in drain spout, spilling again to get it out. This one makes a huge mess, leaves half the water in the well and turns off. I have searched for online options to fix, but no luck. I heat 6 cups of water for tea in a 12 cup coffee maker.The 5 yr old coffeemaker still running well.This newer one is a waste of money. Don't buy it for a gift"
Don’t fill to the 12 cup line on the coffee maker. The coffee or water will over flow out of he carafe. The two don’t match and will OVERFLOW
Its a good coffee machine and this is the 2nd one I owned but the on/off button needs to be pushed 2 or 3 times to turn it on. Sometime thinking its on when its not
"The coffee from this machine tastes like plastic. I have tried putting vinegar and water thru it, making many pots of coffee and even programming it to brew automatically. I cannot get rid of the horrible plastic taste. I called Black and Decker and their solution was just to return the product. Since I have seen this issue all over the internet, I would have thought that they would have made changes to the plastic they use to make this machine. I will no doubt be returning it."
"I got this coffee maker after the last few I've purchased from $50 to $70 quit working after a couple of years. I'm sooo tired of spending good money for something that will break sooner than expected. Now I expect things to break. After the last Mr. Coffee stopped working after 14 months (and we clean regularly) and before this came we used our old Mr. Coffee that is simple but still works. A great back up. This Black and Decker was flimsy feeling out of the box. Thin plastic. Thin glass on the carafe, push buttons that feel a little loose and you have to make sure the red light comes on when you press the auto. And doesn't heat up the coffee enough. It will do I guess until it stops working like the rest."
"The first two posts were excellent, but the third pot of coffee was full of coffee grounds.  I looked inside and the coffee ground holder was slightly tilted; so I thought maybe that’s why. After cleaning it well, now I make special efforts to make sure the grounds holder is absolutely level before starting the coffee maker. Regardless, I still find coffee grounds in my coffee about half the time. ALSO — I only make 1/2 pot at a time. I can only imagine the amount of grounds that will be in my coffee pot with double the water and double the grounds!  I’M GOING BACK TO MR. COFFEE!  No more Black and Decker for me!"
Cheap appearance. Picture makes it look higher end than it actually is. Buttons are flimsy. In my opinion not at $36 product.
Works good but the pot always drops when pouring
"UPDATE: This coffeemaker was wonderful until one day in November it refused to turn on. There was not a power surge or anything. There was no warning, just it wouldn't turn on. I was very disappointed. Usage of this maker was a pot a coffee nearly everyday from the time we got it until it died.Old Review: We bought this coffee maker to replace our old worn out one.  This coffee maker makes an excellent cup of coffee.PROS::The alarm to let you know when the coffee is done brewing and subsequently when it is turning the machine off 2 hours later. (This is awesome for us, we have a house full of kids and it is great to know when the coffee is read in the morning)The programmable timer.The design.The 4 cup option (tried it once, it worked well!)CONS::Really.. the only thing I don't like is the display. We are fortunate to have the ""right"" lighting in our kitchen. To be able to read it, but I wish it was readable without having to turn the lights on.All and all a great machine. Remember to not over fill your coffee grounds in the filter and all is right with the world. Oh, and as for the plastic smell... rinse everything out really well before using. I washed my filter basket and carafe before using."
"This is the second one I bought, because the first only lasted 3 months before dying.  I thought it was a fluke.  Now, I have had this one for SIX months, and it takes all of a half hour OR MORE to run a full pot of coffee thru.  And yes, I do know how to make coffee, been making and drinking it for better than a half century.I also have their little one cup Brew and Go coffee makers which work great, and I keep them handy because who the heck wants to wait a half hour for a cup of coffee?I will be looking for a replacement, and it won't be tis model."
I've had several B&D coffee makers. This one is sub par. Coffee tastes weak and the brewing does not givevoff that wonderful Coffee  aroma. The heating element does not keep the carafe contents hot; it's just warm.
It doesn't like to pump the watervery well. It takes too long to brew a pot of coffee.
Makes the coffee taste weird. Maybe has to get seasoned. 🤔 I bought a new one after 2 months.
Timer stopped working.
"Update:  Water drips down the back when the top is opened.  The item looks great on the counter.  I'm fine with the fairly bright led readout.  I generally only need to brew 3 or 4 cups of coffee and it works fine for that.  If you need to brew more than 6 cups it might not suffice.  I mostly brew store bought national brand pre ground coffee, but even so I tend to like it on the strong side.  This maker uses the same 8-12 cup paper filter as my old Mister coffee but the ground basket is smaller in diameter so that I have to fill it about 3 quarters full to get 4 cups of strong coffee.  I would estimate unless you grind dark roast beans just before brewing if you try to brew more than 6 cups you're not going to get a strong cup of coffee."
"Good, makes a decent amount"
"Cleaned this thing to user manual specifications 10 times, STILL says to clean it. Can’t even get a refund cause it’s been 2 months and threw everything away. Thanks black and decker! Never buying a black and decker device again."
"The coffee maker works fine. I've had it since Oct 29th, 2023. However just before writing this review today, I was cleaning the pot with soap, water and sponge, no heavy force applied, and the piece of glass shown in the picture just falls off. So be warned"
"I just received the coffee maker pluged it in and could not set the time right,  the directions' say to tell PM from AM the PM will light up, well guess what, not true I even unplug it and pluged it back in, it stays very dark and with out light you can't even read it, so I have know idea setting it to 6am automatic, I do not know if AM. or PM.  I guess I will find out at 6pm it is now 3:45 pm.  Buyer be ware.  I like Black and decker But I guess even they mess up?  Not sending it back maybe with use the light will come on?  if not I will buy some body elses. My motto  ( If it does not work junck it and buy another one with a another name. )Update: found out the auto was set for 6PM. and not 6AM.  I will use it for a while by turning it on manually then garbage here it comes and no more Black and Decker for me.up date this maker only lasted for 3 months, now it will not brew, water will not come out, had to turn it up side down to get the water out.  NEVER AGAIN WILL I  BUY THIS COFFEE MAKER!!!"
"Makes great coffee using the strong brew function. I had one that started to rust on the hot plate after six months, and I figured I'd replace it with the same model. But that one leaked from the water tank: eight cups of water leaking out over night when set with the timer function."
"Bought this coffeemaker to replace an old Mr. Coffee. Hated it almost immediately. While it makes a decent cup of coffee, a joy to use it is not.1. Badly designed coffee filter receptacle. The handle constantly gets in the way trying to empty it out. I end up having to rinse it just about every time.2. The lid is hard to open and close. I am not breaking into a bank vault, people.3. Does not slide well. The non-slip feet on appliances only make sense if it's a mixer or a blender or something else that could try to escape. Coffeemaker is not one of them. You have to move it to fill and clean it, why does it have to be hard?4. The display numbers are hard to see. They are not backlit, and they are not at an angle, so seeing it from the top is impossible.With all that said, I'll probably be switching brands soon."
Coffee maker is decent for the price. Display lights are dim. Coffee is hot.
"i am very disappointed in the Black & Decker coffee maker I bought.  The two things I do not like about it is, the lid on the carafe does not come off for cleaning.  I called customer service to find out if the lid is suppose to come off for cleaning & told me it does NOT come off.  Makes if very difficult to wash the carafe & very hard to place in the dish washer.  The second thing I don't like about it is, when you open the top lid of the coffee maker to take the filter out, water drips down the back of the coffee maker onto the counter. I will not ever buy another Black & Decker coffee maker again."
"This coffee pot lasted 3 months. The last 2 coffee pots I've bought from this brand were the same basically: Basic coffee pot with basic functions, worked fine, as expected and both of them stopped working within 6 months of purchase. So this is the last time I'll be spending money on anything Black & Decker. The power button no longer works on this one. You plug it in and it turns on automatically and starts brewing. Green light stays lit up and it will not turn off. The first one did this same thing and then eventually the hot plate stopped getting hot. I know you get what you pay for and I never expected either to last a lifetime but THREE MONTHS?? That's ridiculous. No crazy amount of wear and tear, just normal use. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Ever."
"Good coffee maker, fairly full featured.  Timed burner shutoff was great.  Pump busted and dumps water on on the counter.  Had a great year of regular use.  Did not last as long as expected."
"When you lift the lid to add water, it drips down the back, leaving a pretty good size puddle.  Otherwise, its fine.  Also, difficult to remove the cover off of the pot to clean."
Easy to program.Only issue is when purging coffee into cup it leaks
"I have always been tech savvy, and I followed the instructions for programming the deals yes start, but I have yet to see it work right. The clock doesn’t even have a setting for AM and PM so this means no set it and forget it options like other models I’ve used, but I’d be happy if it would work at least one time the way the instructions say it does…"
I would love to find a coffee pot with a carafe that doesn't drip when pouring
One would think in this day and age I could find a good coffee pot...NOPE.
Why bother putting a clock you cant see. Does Black and Decker make a coffee pot that you can see the TIME. black on grey does not work.
"It works.But if this doesn't last at least 2 years, it's not a good product.Coffee flavor is fine but I think that depends more on the kind of coffee you use."
The brewing was slow and the backlighting on the controls was very hard to see. We used a flashlight to program it and set it at night. I returned it.
Really like the coffeemaker and all the features. Only lasted 7 months though.  Water started leaking out of base causing reservoir to empty on counter!
Light weight plastic
"On the positive side this does make good coffee and it's easy to program and use. The only big negative is the warming tray. This is the second B&D I've had and both had the same issue. The heat resistant paint on the warming tray is terrible. It begins to come off after several washings. And this is from  a normal cloth, not an SOS pad. I can't imagine how this issue has not been corrected."
"The worst thing about this coffee maker is that the ""Sneak a Cup"" feature that was advertised in the description is not present on our machine. We discovered this when trying to pour a cup when the coffee was still brewing, and hot coffee went everywhere! We don't know if our individual unit is defective, or if this feature is missing from all of these coffee makers. But it is a real hassle. Other than that, it works fine."
This is an awful coffee pot. Don’t waste your money.
"First use of this brand-new coffee maker, and we observed that the 2-hour automatic shutoff (safety) feature is not working.  We called the company, and no fix was available (aside from returning the unit).Our previous Black and Decker coffee maker (different model, similar price point) lasted about 18 months before the heating filament broke.  Given our history, we cannot recommend this brand (even though the cost is very reasonable)."
"My last Black & Decker coffee maker lasted over 6 years so naturally I got one again when it started having problems. I got this one in September and already, the self-cleaning won't work, it overheats so the front metal is untouchable and it takes forever. Sometimes it stops with 2 cups of water left and I have to dump everything out. The new design is part of the problem--the old one had a bar that went across the entire basket of grounds and this one has a centered hole, which slows it down considerably. Why is it that new designs create problems that did not exist before? Also, the old one had settings for 1-4 cuts and strong; this one's same settings produce nothing but coffee that tasted burned. I have tried dozens of things and cannot get a rich tasting coffee anymore. Same coffee, same grind, different machine. The new design was a terrible idea. Now, after just 2 months, I have no working coffee maker and need one with this footprint due to limited counter space."
"This coffee maker almost made it a year, and I was hoping it would die sooner to be honest. It’s very easy to program the current time and timer. But when you set the program, it’s very difficult to see the screen in low light, no back light. We used it daily for almost a year until the heating element gave up. I’d stay away from this one."
"Replace Mr coffee with this.  It works, programming is easy, auto shutoff is what we needed.But, no one thought to use this before they sent the design to production.  When you open the lid to remove the filter basket after brewing, the water that condensed onto the top drips down the back and onto the counter!  Also, drips in the front.  Brilliant!The old Mr. Coffee had none of these problems.  Shame too as my other appliances are B&D and they're okay.Update May 2021 - tired of wiping up water on the counter.  Bought Bella, someone intelligent designed it!  No drips down the back, no drips down the front, no drips from the carafe, no blinking LEDs after you plug it in, no illuminated anything after it turns off.https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07HRVNM7T/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_SNHB4XJSKEQHQQ8860TP?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1"
"We are generally happy with this coffee maker including the quality of coffee it brews, but we had to modify one thing in order to make this work correctly.  The carafe looks beautiful with a slight curving near the top (instead of squarely pots in the past).  This curve will not push the bar behind the carafe enough to lift open the opening (located below the filter basket) where coffee flows down to the carafe.  This resulted in having coffee flew down outside of the carafe spilling it all over our kitchen counter.  Finally, we figured out what the problem was and fixed it by taping a small piece of rubber to the bar behind the carafe so that it pushes the bar all the way."
"I love the Ninja Coffee makers, but they seem to have a longevity issue. This was my third ninja coffee maker. My first started having issues after a year and Google showed it was a known issue. YouTube videos of n how to solve, helped. My second coffee maker worked great, but then same issue. After about a year, it starts having issues. It’ll start brewing and will start beeping. After messing with it and descaling again and again, it’ll finally work - who knows what actually fixed the problem. Recently, my husband bought coffee pods, so I wanted a machine that would do ground coffee AND pods. And now, about 18 mos later, my coffee pot starts, beeps at the start, then shuts off. Back to the internet to search for a solution. I love you, Ninja Coffee Makers,  it I shouldn’t have to turn to Google to find solutions for why you’re not working after I spend a lot of money for all your bells and whistles. It’s getting to where it’s probably cheaper for me to just bite the bullet and purchase an espresso machine again. I’d wanted to be able to just add grounds and water, but now I’m back again to packing my k-cup refillable pod for every cup of coffee. First world problems? Yes. But if I spend over $200 for a good coffee maker, I expect it to last more than a couple of years. Am I wrong about this??"
"I have a love/hate relationship with the Ninja coffee makers and this model in particular. We bought one back in May of 2023 and it malfunctioned right away. Called the customer service and they had us try a few things and eventually said they would replace it -- after I switched to video and he watched me cut the cord (understandable). They sent out a replacement. When it worked it was wonderful but oftentimes it would not recognize the button feature selected and just sit and beep. Then it just, magically, started working and had been fine for the past 6 months. Brewed a 4 oz cup of coffee and an hour later tried to brew a full pot and it won't work at all. It doesn't recognize that the top door is closed so there are no options to select for brewing anything.I love the specialty options (that's what I use). I love the multiple options to brew normal coffee. I love the hot water feature (so you get an actual cup of hot water that doesn't filter through the coffee part). But at $150-$250 a pop, how many more times can I justify ordering this brand if they're only going to last 6 months to a year?Superb features, great design, horrible operational product. This is my last time of buying another one."
It should be easy to make a pot of coffee.  I can easily use the pod and make a quick cup of coffee.  Today I would like to make a pot of coffee because I am working from home.  Instead of making a pot of coffee I am writing this review of how I cant make a pot of coffee while on hold with Ninja support.  The machine does not recognize that the drip basket is install and I keep opening and closing and sliding to try to get it to recognize the drip brew basket.  This is too much just to make a pot of coffee.  If it didnt cost so much I would have probably thrown it out the door.
I loved this coffee maker. I had wanted one for a while. I made my purchase in July of 2022. This is an updated review  About a year in I got an error  06 and had no idea what that meant reached out to Ninja. They said it was an internal error and may need replaced or a good cleaning but it was outside of the manufacturer's warranty all they could offer was 10 % to buy a new one. I decided to run a clean cycle and I do clean regularly. No problems after cleaning ran fine could do everything. Has been running fine with no problem since then. Up until today 2 months after having for two years I got the error again today so since I already knew Ninja's answer I took everything apart checked then cleaned it very well I  still was regularly cleaning it. It worked fine up until tonight. I wanted to make sure e everything was fine for in the morning to brew a pot of coffee but wanted a cup of tea tonight. It flashed the error again so I started another clean cycle which takes 75 minutes. I went back to check and it even stopped during the cleaning cycle. I believe it has stopped working completelyI am still messing with it but I believe it has died. I did love it while it lasted but I won't repurchase it because of how much I spent I had hoped it would last longer. I am not upset at Ninja or Amazon I understand out of warranty and time frames this is just an update so about the longevity of the machine I have other Ninja products that have worked longer.
"Let me be clear: This machine makes a great cup of coffee, and brews quickly. Unfortunately, the pros end there.1. It's too tall! With the pod lid open, it stands at 21"". Counter-to-cabinet is usually 18-19"". So, if you like your machines under the cabinets, forget it. You'll need to slide it out to brew.2. Over-engineered. The team that designed it must be very smart, however, I doubt they brew their own coffee very often. To switch between pod and grounds, users are required to swap inserts. It doesn't sound complicated, unless you decided for another cup after finishing the brewed coffee. Now, you're required to replace the insert (wet from the previous brew), put in the other, then start again. (And don't forget to slide it out from the under the cabinet as well!)3. Who is this designed for? Ultimately, this was returned because our senior citizen parents often watch our kids. After a few days, we knew that they would hate the bundersome unnecessary steps for their pot of regular in the morning, and pod cup of decaf at night.If it were squattier like its competitors, and more user-friendly, it would be a 5/5 machine."
"The dual design, carafe and single-serve, saves space on the countertop. The reservoir is easy to detach and fill. I like the fact that it can be used on the side or on the back of the machine. The brewing system works well overall. That said, the single serve pod adapter has some design issues. While it works well with standard plastic pods, it doesn't do a good job with compostable pods. The spout depends on the pod's plastic liner to direct the coffee smoothly into the cup. Since this liner doesn't exist on compostable pods, the coffee splashes over the sides of the cup and makes a mess. I solved this by cutting a plastic liner off of a standard pod and inserting it into the pod adapter to catch the splash and direct the coffee more neatly into the cup. Further, the latch on the pod adapter wore out after 7 months of use and had to be replaced. Ninja considers the pod adapter to be an ""accessory"" and is thus not covered under the appliance 1-year warrantee. The customer service center was nice enough to make an exception and didn't charge me $40.00 for a replacement. They did, however, charge me about $10 for shipping. It seems to me that an item advertised as a ""dual brew system"" should not regard an essential part of that system to be an accessory. Is it, perhaps, because the adapter regularly wears out fairly quickly and it saves them money not to include it in the warrantee? I'm just speculating here. In any case, I'd say the pod adapter is not well designed."
"So I received my ninja however, it had no paperwork (ie instructions, product detail)It came in a standard cardboard box with multile parts. I have never owned a ninja before so Im not sure where everything goes.  After I figured out how to at least make a cup of coffee. Im guessing it shouldn't splash coffee all over my counter  and yet here we are..coffee everywhere.  I would have referred to the  product instructions if I had received them..any chance this was a returned item and thats why it shipped the way it did?? For the record I would NEVER pay the price I did for a returned or refurbished product!  And that is something that should have been clearly stated.So here we are..me with coffee splashed all over my counter and you with my money..nice.  Do better"
"While this machine is very versatile and well designed, the coffee isn't hot enough. That is a deal breaker for me.  Coffee is supposed to be hot, this coffee is very warm, but not hot, so much as I like the design and features, I will probably return this.  I don't want to have to microwave my coffee after it's brewed."
"I'm a fan of Ninja products.  I purchased the Ninja Master Prep Professional Blender back in 2013 and use it still to this day.  My previous coffee maker was the Ninja CE251 Programmable Brewer which I purchased in 2020.  I had that coffee maker for less than a year and the unit's electronics malfunctioned and could not be used.  I called Ninja, they validated it was not functioning correctly, told me it was still under warranty and they would send a replacement but I would have to pay $25 shipping.  Needless to say I had words with them.I purchased the Ninja CFP307 DualBrew Pro coffee maker on 03/18/2024.  I love the features and funtionality of this coffee.  I love the touch display, how intuitive and easy it is to use, it's versatility and the rich coffee flavor it brews.  Just one problem...the water doesn't get hot, only warm.  I even tried the boil water function and still warm.  So after <1 week of use I called Ninja today, 03/28/24.  They confirmed the coffee maker was not functioning properly, told me it was under warranty and they would send me a replacement but that I had to pay $25 for shipping.  So a brand new $200+ coffee maker, owned for a week, not working correctly out of the box and Ninja expects customers to PAY MORE to receive a replacement.  Words were spoken again.Again, I really enjoy Ninja products and am very happy with this coffee maker (with one star off for receiving a defective product and one star off for Ninja expecting me to pay to receive a replacement).  Just be aware you could receive a defective product so hold onto the box and just don't deal with Ninja and just return it to Amazon."
"This machine makes good coffee, however, when you use the kcup/pod function, it tends to splash everywhere."
"The Ninja coffee maker makes decent coffee but there is so much wrong with this product it makes me feel like I am working for this coffee maker, not that it’s working for me.The good:- Good coffee made by pod or carafe.- Coffee and water (when dispensing for tea) are very hot.The bad:- Unit wobbles on countertop as it is not balanced.- When making k-cup coffee, the maker sprays coffee on the counter top and base of the unit which requires cleanup after every k-cup.- Need to physically swap out the head unit to switch between k-cup and carafe options requiring you to store the component not in use (as there is no way to hang or mount to keep with the unit ).Every time I make a cup of coffee in the morning I am reminded how much I don’t like this coffee maker when I am cleaning up the mess it makes.  A product of this price, and being that coffee makers are not new technology, I should not feel like I am making accommodations for this to fit into my life, rather than helping to make my life easier."
"TLDR:  Not a product review - more of a cautionary tale regarding refurbished items.I really wanted to like this coffeemaker.  It's sleek, fits on my counter, and for the two cups of coffee it made I was very pleased...Ok so - Lord knows I tried.  But two versions deep and they still can't send me one that works.  First time around it worked out of the box.  Carafe was broken but ninja main office was great and replaced gratis.  Thanks Ninja!But after two delicious cups of coffee the water volume began dropping noticeably.  Note to self (NEVER throw away an appliance box again until past the return window.)  I've seen this before, the pump bladder leaks or the reservoir gets clogged and I know where this story ends.  25% drop after 2 cups = broken in a few weeks.  Requested a replacement - flawless execution - thanks again amazon and ninja!New one arrives.  Now it won't even heat water.  Internal breakers trigger every time I try and heat water.  No luck am returning this one too.  What's this??  Shipper no longer has a refurbished model to ship.  Ask for refund.  Go shopping again for a new coffee maker.  In the meantime I've wasted a lot of time and aggravation.  Perhaps I'll shill out for the new version this time."
"My 6-year-old Keurig finally bit the dust this week, and I decided to try the Ninja DualBrew. I got it yesterday and set it up. I ran a 55-oz. pot of water through, per the setup instructions.After that, I brewed a cup using a k-cup. (My mistake there was using my stainless froth pitcher and not paying attention to the amount of coffee that was dispensed.) I was testing a k-cup brand that had previously always given an error on my Keurig, so getting anything was a success as far as I was concerned. I then removed the basket and rinsed everything so I could run water for a cup of tea. I used a smaller mug that I know takes 8 oz. of water and it overflowed. I emptied some of the water and set my tea to steep while I grabbed a measuring cup to run another test and make sure I wasn’t just misremembering my cup’s size. Sure enough, the 8 oz. setting poured 12 oz. into my measuring cup. At that point, it was late, so I knew I would be waiting until today to research the issue.I have now been searching for the last hour and have not found this issue documented anywhere. I have one other test I want to try later, but, for now, I will be brewing everything into the pot. Hence the 3 stars, for now. Everything tastes good and *seems* easy to use, but I want to be able to brew directly into a cup as designed and not have to constantly re-teach every guest I have how to make coffee. Will update again once resolved."
"I like that this coffeemaker brews the pods so quickly. It’s easy to assemble and use.Con is it is higher than a Keurig so it doesn’t fit under the cabinets very well.A concern is that it is tearing open my coffee pods and after it beeps that the brewing is complete, there is a lot of water left and the grounds are bubbling over and into my coffee. This is already happening after just using for approximately 2 weeks so I am concerned ended about how long this will last.I cannot seem to find customer support chat or email options but will keep looking."
"First off, we got it on sale and paid $159.99. After 6 months of use, the base quit recognizing the K-cup adapter, so we couldn't use that function. Called the company and did a video meeting with them, which ended with me paying $22 for shipping a replacement base.Pros: When it works, it makes coffee and K-cups! It's nice to fill the water reservoir, then attach it, instead of pulling the maker out to fill the base.Cons: Can't adjust the timer on the hot plate, it turns after after 2 hours. On the base, it measures in ounces, with the symbol of how full the carafe will be. On the water reservoir, it only shows the symbol. While together, that's not a big deal, it was a learning curve since our old coffee makers only measured in ""cups"".  No battery to keep the time from resetting during a power outage. Is it really that hard to add that Ninja? Obviously, the base not recognizing the K-cup adapter.Overall: Knowing what I know now, I probably would not purchase this again."
"I want to love it. I love most Ninja things, but this one is a fail. The hot water isn't hot enough. ""Boiling"" is about 180 degrees F... okay for brewing certain teas. The ""hot"" option is about 170. Maybe I just got a bad unit?  Even worse... the pod adapter. When brewing coffee from pods, the needle meant to pierce the bottom of typical pods isn't very sharp, and I'm literally afraid of it breaking - so I use a craft knife to cut a small hole in the right place before placing it in the machine to brew. Even worse, it splatters everywhere, even when using a pod that is thin enough that I don't have to pre-cut it. Serious mess - most of the coffee splatters onto the counter instead of into the cup with certain pods, meaning I have to stand there and hold the cup right up to where it comes out to catch it all. Not at all happy, especially given how expensive this was! It does a good job with drip coffee. But for only a drip coffee machine, it's way too expensive! I'm sort of struggling through with it - I can use 180 degree water for most of my tea, and I can use ground coffee instead of pods... but geez. Not worth the price given the fuss. Very disappointed!"
"I didn't try to use it, as my unit arrived with broken parts.  Disappointed to receive a damaged item, especially when going through the Ninja Store on Amazon.  This is my first bad experience with a Shark or Ninja product.I ended up buying a 2nd unit at a local retailer to give the Ninja CFP301 a 2nd chance.  I am comparing the results to my existing Cuisinart Grind & Brew 2-4 cup setting.  When making coffee into the included carafes of each coffee maker.  The Cuisinart has a 2-4 cup setting that slows the brew time down for a very flavorful pot of coffee.  The Ninja lets me pick 16 oz setting, but the warming plate is not an option for that setting, so my 2nd cup of coffee is cold.  With the Cuisinart I used to Level scoops to make my 2-4 Cup (16oz, or Number mark on the carafe).  With the Ninja, I increased the amount of coffee to 3 level scoops, and changed the Brew to Rich, and even so, the Ninja brew is still much weaker than my Cuisinart using 2 scoops.It appears that the only way the Warming Plate is an option is if you brew 1/2 pot of coffee.  In my case, that would mean throwing away more than 10oz in order to get 16oz's of coffee, and having to use much more ground coffee than my Cuisinart.I haven't yet tried the specialty or frother, as that isn't something I would drink every morning.  I was looking for a coffee maker that would match the flavor of my Cuisinart Brew (2-4 cup setting), with a few more bells & whistles for an occasional treat like ice coffee or latte.  On the surface the Ninja CFP301 appeared to check all the boxes, but in taste it doesn't meet my regular Cuisinart Grind & Brew.  I'm only using the ""Brew"" feature on the Cuisinart, as the Grinder broke years ago, so that isn't the reason for the difference in taste.  I'm assuming the difference is either and/or due to the temperature, and the length of time of the brew.  With my coffee, I'm very much ok with the process taking longer in order to get a very rich flavorful cup of coffee every morning.I tried contacting support@ninjakitchen.com and the email was returned undeliverable.  Was hoping the email could give them ideas for improvements with future models.  Such as allowing a user to make 2-4 cups into the carafe and use the warming plate to keep the made coffee hot.  As near as I can tell I have to make a 1/2 pot of coffee in order to use the warming plate on the Ninja CFP301.  That means throwing way 10oz of brew in order to drink 16oz.I tried using the 16oz setting, and I used 3 scoops instead of the 2 I use in my Cuisinart, and even so, the Ninja coffee using the Rich Brew setting was much weaker than my Cuisinart using 2 scoops.  Of course the 16oz setting on the Ninja will require that I microwave my 2nd cup of coffee, as the warming plate is not an option with the 16oz setting."
"The coffee that is made with disposable k-cups is good but I prefer to reusable kcups so that it's not so expensive to drink coffee.  Also, the frothing attachment doesn't generate enough froth."
"For a single cup, I have to transfer my Keurig cups into ninja adapter Or fill ninja adapter with regular coffee. It’s easier just to make a pot of coffee with ninja. Haven’t used any other feature at this time."
"I received this as a gift from my husband last year for Christmas. At first it worked very well. Fast forward to September 2024, the pod attachment stopped working. The coffee pot will not recognize the attachment. I tried using the attachment and ended up with water everywhere on my counter top and floor. Now it is November, the coffee pot is less than 12 months old and this morning it just stopped making coffee in the middle of a cycle. For the amount of money this cost, this should last more than 11 months. I am so disappointed in Ninja. I bought a new Keurig and I am dragging my old Bunn coffee maker out of storage because even after 10 years, it still works fine. I will not purchase anything else from Ninja."
"I am writing this review with a heavy heart, as I had high hopes for the coffee maker that I am now forced to critique. Initially, this machine showed promise and delivered satisfactory results. However, its sudden breakdown has left me feeling disappointed and frustrated. Allow me to share my experience with this coffee maker.Design:On the surface, the coffee maker had an appealing and modern design. It featured a sleek exterior and a user-friendly control panel. The compact size made it suitable for smaller kitchens, and the glass carafe added a touch of elegance to the overall aesthetic.Functionality:During its operational period, the coffee maker performed adequately. It brewed a decent cup of coffee, but it lacked the consistency and precision that I had hoped for.Durability:Unfortunately, the coffee maker's durability was its downfall. After a relatively short period of use, it suddenly stopped working altogether. Despite following the manufacturer's instructions and properly maintaining the machine, it simply refused to brew any coffee. This unexpected failure was not only disappointing but also frustrating, as it rendered the coffee maker useless.While this coffee maker initially showed promise, its sudden breakdown left me with a sour taste. The design and functionality, while average at best, were overshadowed by its ultimate failure to function properly. I would not recommend this coffee maker to others.It is my hope that the manufacturer takes note of these issues and works towards improving the quality and reliability of their products in the future."
"THis coffeemaker is an illogical and inconvenient design.1. You can only dial an ODD number of cups of coffee but you need to specify the number of OUNCES, not cups, and it's a strange number, e.g., 28 oz for 5 cups, 37 oz for 7 cups, 46 oz for 9 cups, etc. I don't know how they calculate ""12"" cups since 55 oz is the highest which is 11 cups.2. There is no spring loaded valve under the basket. So you need to flip a switch from ""Open"" to ""Close"" if you want to pour coffee before it's done brewing. And DON't FORGET to switch it back to ""Open"" or else it may overflow!3. Since there's no spring loaded valve on the basket. even after the brewing noise stops at the end of the brew cycle, make sure all the water has drained through the grinds in the basket or else it will continue dripping onto the heating pad after you remove the caraf. The only alternative is to flip the flow switch to ""Close"". But DON'T FORGET to ""Open:"" it again when you're done.What would have been the problem for allowing us to just pick the number of cups we want to brew rather than making us select a strang number of ounces (which only increments in 9 oz brackets), and why couldn't they have put in a spring-loaded valve like virtually every other consumer coffee maker? Not a very ""Ninja"" design.These are really obviously DUMB design flaws that are easy to fix, so why was Ninja so thoughtless with this design? And it's not like thy're still on version 1.0 !!"
I am frustrated because the water reservoir is 60 ounces and not the advertised 96 ounces. It was purchased for this reason.
"I bought this almost 10 months ago and used it to make about half a pot of coffee a day and the occasional kcup...it broke yesterday. Clog9 error,  after running the clean cycle twice it would only brew half the pot when you tell it to brew the whole pot. Seems like a processer error more than a clog.They did replace the unit when I contacted them, just had to pay shipping. Tech support wasnt bad.  Just dont have faith the replacement unit will last more than 10 months.  Ive had good luck with Ninja on other things but I just wouldnt recommend the cofee maker.  Theres no way to clean the ""needle"" properly like Keurig machines.  I would recommend getting an all in one from a known coffee maker brand."
"I wanted a carafe/pod dual system.  I read all of the reviews and this came out on top.My complaints: too hot (I like very hot coffee but this destroys the flavor,  you have to switch parts to switch brewing options so it requires storing extra pieces near by,  and the water chamber doesn't have a handle for easy removing and refilling (the Cuisenart does), and there isn't an auto stop if you pull out the carafe to get an early cup of coffee (there is a shut off lever though)What I do like: the narrow profile"
"I was so excited to purchase this product not just because of its multi-use, but mainly because its a Ninja product. I have several other Ninja products and they work great with zero issues. I got tired of buying Mr Coffee brand coffee makers since they wouldn’t last long. Therefore, I decided to invest in this Ninja product. Unfortunately within 4 months of purchase, the Ninja logo in the front began chipping away. I brushed it off as it was just cosmetics, but a month later (5mth from purchase date), the product started acting wonky. It would turn on by itself and begin a coffee cycle. I’ve unplugged it for several minutes at a time, but would still start up the brew cycle. Now I’m forced to purchase another coffee machine. I’m very disappointed in this Ninja product."
"I had high hopes for this coffee pot, but I’m not that impressed by it. I like the iced coffee and the fact that it can brew a pot or a single k-cup. But on k-cup mode, the coffee spews/sprays out in such a way that it often misses the cup, which is annoying. Also I would prefer my coffee a bit hotter. Overall, I’m not so annoyed that I would have gone to the hassle of sending this one back, but if I could go back in time, I’d pick a different coffee maker, and I won’t get another one when this one gives out."
Would have gave a 5 star but the seller was a terribly slow at shipping and the tracking number was useless for shipping progress. We bought the first one and they never updated any shipping by just refunding our money back without requesting back on the first order from the first seller. The 2nd seller did finally send the unit that took for ever with no updating. The product itself is excellent!
"A little disappointed in this coffee maker.  While it brews a nice HOT cup of coffee, it has a couple of shortcomings.  As the photo shows, I often (not always) get a bunch of coffee grinds in the bottom of the coffee cup. Something leaks?  Also, the Milk Frother?  What a waste.  Oh, it froths up the milk or cream prettty good - until the coffee comes into the cup. Then all the froth disappears.  Have used it with Half & Half, and Almond Milk - happens with both.  Haven't tried making a pot yet.  All in all, it does a better job than my old Keurig coffee maker that only turned on intermittently."
"Clogged on k cup... cannot clear, albeit I have tried all the manufacturers suggestions,  will not properly brew k cup... drips even when ""closed """
"Sold as a new product, came without the original packaging/no manual. Did appear to be new, works well, am keeping."
"I took the unit apart, was very easy, to wash parts. I tried to remove the lid to the coffee maker and it would not budge! WHAT? I called Ninja for a replacement and they informed me that is how the carafe is made, that I can wash it with the lid on, and the picture in the manual just shows the parts, but that the tightly secured lid was NOT removable. They also said they did not have replacements! So if you break it, I guess you need to buy a generic one from Amazon. They do have a couple that fits this model, but not the original  one that comes with the unit. I guess that is manageable, but I told Nina that information should be clearly disclosed in their advertisements. Otherwise, looks like it will do what it says it will. Haven't tried it out yet, crossing fingers all I have to deal with is a non-removable carafe lid!"
"I bought this because of the great reviews and that it makes a cup or a pot.  However:* I find that when making a pot, if I turn on the “keep warm” option the coffee quickly tastes burnt.  If I leave the option off, the glass pot let’s it get cold long before my 3rd cup.* I makes my keurig cup taste great, however it’s messy as heck.  I use a tall 20oz cup, so it’s taller than your normal cup.  It spews coffee all over the counter and the machine itself (check out the pictures).* The little shelf that’s _supposed_ to help keep things clean doesn’t really work.  And it’s not removable and cleaning it with a cloth is difficult due to the little rubber piece on the shelf ( heck out the pictures).* The clock resets to 1200 after a power outage.  However the delay remains set.  So, if you set it to make your morning coffee, depending on the outage time, you’ll either have cold coffee in the morning or it won’t be brewed yet.  Come on, if you can keep the electronic timer scheduled you should be able to keep the clock too….* I ordered (and paid for) a new machine.  The one that arrived had “refurbished” on it.  I contacted the seller and they refunded a small portion.All in all, I love the taste of my single cups in the morning.  However, if it hadn’t cost so much I’d trash it an look elsewhere for my morning beverage maker."
"This is a good coffer maker but I wanted to make a stronger coffee that I could add different flavor and still have strong taste, more like going to a coffee house.  Coffee maker was quick, stayed warm and 1 cup was fine.  Just not what I was looking for. I wanted a coffee machine that would be more like my own coffee house maker.  With really strong café style drinks. I will just have to keep going to Starbucks.  I am a little annoyed about return policy. I returned clean with all the attachments. placed in original packaging and with manual. Just as received I have been advised it may take 30 days to determine refund. Thus 3 stars not 4. Will f/u with returns status was told they would determine how much would be refunded.  anything other than the price I paid , is unacceptable policy.Not what I expected from  Prime acount."
"We bought this Ninja after we looked at reviews about getting hot coffee versus what the other popular coffee makers brew. We bought it March 2024 and it’s defective . We brew two cups a day and it went into CLN cycle. We read all instructions and did exactly as it stated. The coffee machine never went back to BREW mode and when we tried, it went back to CLN function for the next 4.5 hours before we unplugged it and took out our old coffee machine. It’s past the April date of return. Just as a note, this machine doesn’t brew the coffee HOT so we heat up the cream in the microwave, which helps. It’s disappointing that this coffee machine failed after a little over a month.=========I contacted Ninja customer service and they were so helpful and realized the machine may be defective. They are sending another machine and I received confirmation immediately through email. That’s how customer support should be!Update—-Second Ninja coffee machine came and that machine failed as well. I contacted customer service and after almost 34 minutes in the phone they said it appears machine is malfunctioning. I asked for a refund to my credit card and the rep stated unfortunately, they can only offer another machine. I said absolutely not after 2 previous attempts. I told her I didn’t want to go through this a third time. She said I would need to go to Amazon to get refund and so I’m awaiting the refund after mailing machine to Amazon."
"This is why I don't like to do reviews as soon as I buy something because of course something brand new is going to be great but will it stand the test of time. This coffee maker was great until it wasn't. I loved everything about this coffee maker but for the price I paid I think it should have lasted longer. I bought this June 2023 and today April 29 2024 it's dead in the water. I kept us with the cleaning and maintenance because I was hopeful it would be good to me but it let me down. I see that all coffee makers are throw away items, nothing is built to last."
"thought I was buying from Amazon and not independent seller, Product arrived a day late, no big deal, however was not in a Ninja Box and had no paperwork that normally comes with new products . No owner's manual and no warranty card ?"
No owners manual or directions including just came in a shipping box. Not even the original box.
Lots of plastic not crazy about it but I need a coffee maker
"Overall I like the coffee maker, it does what I need it to do a majority of the time. Its versatility makes it a perfect one stopIn the kitchen. If you want hot or boiling water for tea or cooking it works great. But, if you want a full pot of coffee you risk grinds overflowing into the carafe. If I use k cups, 1 out of 6 winds up with half the grinds in my cup. In my experience, it can do the two jobs, just neither of them perfectly. So I have adapted- only brewing 37 oz at a time and having to re-filter my k cup coffee after brewing it every couple of days. If you are willing to adapt to the machine then give it a spin."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            When purchased I had read the mixed reviews but because of previous Ninja items bought in the past, decided to buy. I love the combo of cup and pot brewing but had issues with the pot brewing very first time. Learned to live with the overflow issues as we don’t brew a pot very often. Also found much grounds debris every time in the coffee. I don’t love the idea that when you go to brew with a cup, the machine doesn’t first warm when there’s not enough water in the reservoir before it starts. What happens is the brewing will start and then beeps and spews until you refill the tank and replace and then tell it to brew. This is just more annoying than anything. The next and final straw was our first notice to clean the machine for scaling. Again no warning just brewing a cup and the machine started making a very loud grinding sound and then the clean button lit up. Read the instructions for the 75! minute process but after the 75 mins, it never fully “brewed” the 40+ounces of descaling solution into the pot and just kept making a horrible grinding beeping sound. I finally just unplugged and ran about 5 pots of plain water to rinse.  The clean button did not light back up. When we tried to use is this morning, the grinding beeping sounds came back and the clean button lit up. I WOULD NOT recommend purchasing and of course I’m outside of the window to return. I guess I will go back to the simple but reliable Keurig brand and a spare carafe brewing machine for when we have guests. Wish Ninja would read these reviews and improve the quality and functions of this machine. The video attached is after following directions for descaling that tool 75 mins. :("
"The machine is almost brand new and regularly complains that it doesn’t have enough water. A complete reset fixes it but according to research, the sensors are often at fault and that requires a service call. For a coffee maker??!! I just want to fill it and forget it. I gave it a two because it does make a good cup of coffee."
"At first, I loved this coffee machine. It is a little taller than I would have liked and doesn't fit under a cabinet very well. I have to pull it out to use it. I've only had it for 2 months and my coffee hasn't been brewing evenly. Sometimes it's fine but most of the time my coffee tastes like water. I use both coffee grounds as well as Kcups on the 'strong' setting and it still tastes terrible. I'm really disappointed."
"1. Machine delivers variable amounts of coffee.  If set on 12oz, you may get six, or eight, or 12.2. Dripping!! Leave a roll of paper towels next to it. If gate is closed, you get two ounces of last cup of cold coffee in your fresh cup.3.  Serving temperature varies and often needs 30 sec in microwave to heat up a fresh cup.4. Pot and K Cup use same dispenser, so while the machine takes up less counter space, you need to store the pot elsewhere."
"I love the quality of this coffee maker. It’s very convenient as well, with the multiple pot/cup size options. Only negative is that it is so loud!  This includes the initial phase of bringing water into the maker, (there’s a really loud whoosh noise) and the beeping when it starts up as well as multiple beeps when brewing is complete. It renders the delay function basically useless because it will wake me up when it beeps. (My bedroom is near the kitchen, but not  actually adjacent)"
"I purchased this in mid January 2023 so it was two months old when I began my quest to get it fixed. This is a very cool machine.  I never used it for the specialty drinks so I can't speak to that.  It is a little on the large size if you have limited space, but that wasn't an issue for me.  The drip part of the machine worked great and the coffee tasted good.  Now the unfortunate bad.  The kcup part of the machine is useless to me.  I tried half a dozen different brands of kcups and only one of them worked, that being Peets.  Many of the popular brands would just have all of the grounds blown out into the  cup.  I tried again and again only to have cups of coffee FULL of all of the grounds from the pod.  I mean there was no coffee left in the pod.  I contacted Ninja about it and they sent me a replacement insert part used for the kcup.  I returned the original part as they requested and tried the new one and it did exactly the same thing.  I contacted Ninja again and this time they sent me a replacement for the main part of the machine.  Once again it did the same thing blowing all the grounds into the cup.  I contacted them again wanting to get a refund as I had lost confidence in the ability of the machine to properly handle  a kcup.  They would only offer to send me an entirely new unit for which I would have to pay shipping.  They suggested I contact Amazon, which I did.  After a good deal of back and forth Amazon agreed to let me return it to them even though it was beyond the 30 day return window they have. They did charge me a service charge but at least I wasn't stuck with a product that was useless.  If only the kcup part of the machine would work properly I probably would have given it a 5 star rating.  Thanks Amazon for your help.  Bad Ninja"
"I really like the styling options of this coffee maker, but this is the second time that I brew an 18 Oz amount of coffee, and each cup is only lukewarm. I'm not sure if the settings are able to be adjusted to brew my coffee hot but for what I just paid for this product, I feel that this shouldn't be an issue. I will be updating this post soon."
Lasted for about a year. The K-cup function stopped working a year after I bought it. For the price I thought it would last much longer. The k-cup will shoot out steaming hot water at you and burn you. It did the same thing to my daughter and me. I tried descaling and it did not work. I descaled it on a regular basis so not sure why it did this. The regular coffee pot feature still works but just takes longer to make.
Conveniently omits that reusable k-cup pods are not compatible.  Please update the description to point out that the super whoop-ty-do tri needle top also prohibits using any reusable adapter. It's buried in a sub-not in the manual that you'll see much to late to do something about.
"We have had this machine for almost 2 years and today it totally crapped out. No reason why, it just won't brew coffee or water. Also, throughout our 2 years of having it, the k-cup option is very finicky and we have had to poke our own holes for every cup, every morning. That wasn't too big of a deal, but now that it's not working at all, I would say spend $200 on a different brand."
"I bought this about 3-4 months ago to replace a keurig that broke, because I wanted the option of either traditionally brewed coffee or k cups, and have been really pleased with it overall. I use the SF Bay compostable pods and it’s a little tougher to get the machine to close in a way that pierced them correctly but I’ve got it down now (initially I was worried the extra force needed to do so might break something but it seems to be fine). I have ended up rarely using the cone brewer but love that I have the option, and when I have its super simple to switch over and brews great coffee.The ONLY complaints I have is that coffee is lukewarm right off the bat and needs to be microwaved if you want it to be HOT, and occasionally the coffee maker will switch back to the default cup brew size between brews (I use specialty 4 oz and do two pods for each cup) and I’ve now three times overflowed my mug because I didn’t realize it’d reset.It’s super easy to clean (though I wish it gave more of a heads up or like, this needs to be cleaned after the next 2-5 brew cycles, vs clean now or we won’t brew your coffee lol not fun at 4:30 am), and also super easy to use in general.I have not used the frother once (I have a separate frothing/heating carafe) and have zero feedback on it but again, love that the option is there.If anything changes down the road I’ll update but for now I’d definitely recommend.Update:The pod adapter is stuck closed with a pod inside and the only support is having to call a phone number (no email or chat option). I don’t have time to deal with this over the phone right now, and am super annoyed that the screws holding this piece together are not a normal/common screwdriver shape so it’s now unusable until I have time to go to a hardware store and try to find a screwdriver that matches."
"This coffee maker will not brew when it needs to be cleaned. The problem with that is that you can clean it one night and then when brewing the next morning, it stops mid-brew to say it needs to be cleaned. Happens to me every few days and I clean it once a week.You can unplug for a few second and then it usually starts to work again but, super frustrating!"
Great coffee machine! Looks and performs well. Only problem I never got the piece for frothing the milk and had to buy that separately
We started using this coffee maker in December. It had its ups and downs due to multiple failure codes. It finally kicked the bucket tonight after using it less than a year. Highly disappointed in this one. It could have just been a single bad coffee maker but I can’t recommend this after spending so much money on it. Not worth the cost.
"Coffee maker failed to brew using K-cups and got extremely hot and smoked during cycle. After video call, product support specialist determined a whole replacement of the unit was needed and I agreed to pay shipping cost of $22. However, she then stated that she had to observe the cord actually being cut per policy. With a new unit scheduled to arrive in 5 days, she asked me to brew a pot (the carafe feature still works) to store for the week. I get company policy, but with a video call in which the unit was determined to be defective, I felt the company didn't trust me to ""cut the cord"" and dispose of it AFTER the new unit arrived... I'll not be a customer again."
"I used to be a fan of Ninja products because of their clever design. Unfortunately, this coffee maker is an exception, and my experience with Ninja support was so humiliating that I will avoid their products in the future.The dual-brew system in this coffee maker is poorly designed and causes problems (as confirmed by the support representative). My coffee maker worked well for one month and then, for no reason, stopped working in the capsule mode. Instead of sucking water from the reservoir, it made a squeaking noise, but continued working in the ground-coffee mode. You can find other reviews where people faced similar problems.After spending approximately one hour on the phone with support, they sent me a new motor base. Notably, I was told they were making a big exception by not charging me for the replacement parts and shipping. Indeed, you can find reviews where customers were asked to pay for warranty replacements.The same problem persisted with the new motor. Not surprisingly, this meant that the problem was caused by the capsule adapter. After another hour on the phone with support, I was told they could only send me another new motor (crazy, right?), but if I needed other replacement parts, I would have to pay for them.I could have agreed and gotten another motor base—you can see the two I have in the picture (why not start collecting them?)—but I couldn't waste more of my time on this.Bottom line: Any company can have good and bad models, and some customers may be lucky while others are not. However, this product is garbage, and the support experience is abysmal. Avoid at all costs."
I do love this ninja coffee maker. Problem is it constantly reads an er11. I unplugg it and let it reset before plugging back in so I can rebrew a pod. This has been an issue since the first month I've owned it. I looked into the issue and it's very common. The machine would get 5 stars if this wasn't a constant issue. I'm probably going to have Ninja replace it as the troubleshooting isn't fixing the problem.
"Updated review, it doesn’t even work. 10/11/24.The packaging was great. Shipping great. I opened the box and set it on the counter. most things were taped. it was very dirty with water in it and grounds some calcium build up as well. I did wipe it down a bit before I thought to take a few pictures.I did purchase a used/acceptable/new coffee maker."
"Really like this machine, when it works. Coffee is good enough for me and the features are convenient.The repeating issue is a random reboot of the whole machine while brewing. I’m a “set it up the night before” person and it is extremely frustrating to walkout in the morning to a tiny bit of coffee in the carafe and the clock showing midnight. Whatever the glitch is caused by happens if you’re brewing a full pot or single serve and seems to become more frequent over time.  The other issue I’ve witnessed is a “add water” alert despite the reservoir having plenty of water. This is also random, but less frequent. Only seems to happen on the single serve brewing and can just be reset by restarting the brew. Annoying, but I was dealing with it.I’m on my second one now because the first one started having power issues within the first year and Ninja replaced it for me. Now this one is doing the same thing as the first, but of course I’m out of warranty. Two devices with the same exact issues tells me that there is something wrong with Ninja’s design"
"We got this unit in December, 2022. It has worked pretty well since then until a few days ago. I put in a pod, as usual, and during the brew process, the machine began making some very unusual noises. A ""clean"" error message came up, even though I use filtered water, so I ran a ""clean"" cycle through, and when that was finished, and I cleaned the pod holder, I ran two cycles through with no pod, and the unit seemed to run ok. I put in a pod, but when the brew process started, the same odd sounds occurred again, once again ending with a ""clean"" error message. I thought this was certainly unusual, but I ran another cleaning cycle through, cleaning out the pod holder and brew basket, even though both were already clean. I also ran another brew process through with no pod, and no problem appeared. I then put in a pod, and during the brew process, the machine again made unusual noises, again ending with a ""clean"" error message. I went over everything again and tried running through two more pods, but the same thing occurred again. I called Ninja's helpline, and they reviewed the problem per a one-way video per a link they sent. After seeing the problem occur, they said I needed a new base, and that I was out of the warranty period (one year), and the cost of the new base would be $199, which I would have to pay. I said I was not interested, and they ended the call. I agreed to take a survey after the call, and the first question was how likely I was to recommend a Ninja product to others, with ""0"" being the least likely and ""9"" being the most likely. I pressed ""0,"" but the system would not accept that, and the system said I had made an improper response, and the system ended the call."
"I have been using this coffee maker, daily, for about a year now and I really like the size a features it offers; HOWEVER, be prepared for it to begin to break down at about year 1 of ownership.  At month 11, the coffee maker began to randomly turn off at the beginning of a brew cycle or dispensing hot water.  Sometimes it shuts down 2 times, sometimes as many as 8 times.  It’s annoying because I have to stand there and watch the machine run through its cycle in anticipation of it stopping.  I have looked high and low on the internet for troubleshooting information and the only thing I can consistently find is this specific problem is common and nobody knows why it happens.  At this price point, I would expect to get more than 1 year of use out of it.  This is my 3rd Ninja product and 2nd coffee maker.  The previous model I owned worked flawlessly for more than 4 years, so I’m not ready to turn on Ninja products, just this one for now."
All plastic not like the same model ninja I purchased 3 years ago. Will not hold up. Very disappointed in ninja I think I'll go back to Keurig when this one dies. I'm sure it won't be long
"I like the quality of this coffee maker, but if you use the pods on a regular basis like I do,  its a pain to switch out the components. Also, the coffee maker doesnt go by cups, but by ounces. If I want to swith from 6 cups to 10 its a little hard to gauge how many ounces to make."
"I absolutely loved this coffee maker until it broke after two weeks. Ninja wanted to repair, I returned it. Ordered another one immediately thing I received a lemon. The second was great for four month, wouldn’t make a single serve coffee; it said to clean, the clean function would not work. In my opinion it’s junk; I have had Keurigs last 10 years or more. Waste of money!!"
"It took three weeks to receive my order.  When I unpacked the box, the carafe was broken into little pieces. There is no manual to learn how to use.  I had to guess my way through the process.  Since I don't have a manual, I have a couple of attachments that I don't know where they go.  I will look on line for guidance hopefully."
"So to be fair- I have had this coffee maker for a couple years. But I have went through two of the glass carafe’s. And I had to buy the second one I bought. At the time, I thought perhaps it was something I had done, but the attached picture shows that it seems to have melted the glass to me. I think it’s very think glass- but who knows. I think it’s strange I have went through 2 in such a short period of time. Probably won’t buy another ninja."
"We bought the Shark Ninja Dual Brew. Its quite pricey but we figured the cost would equal quality. Sadly, it does not. We have had intermitent problems with it for the last 6 months with the brewer not accepting the water. We followed the cleaning instructions and had to flip it upside down to get air bubbles out of the system before it would work but it eventually stopped working.We called shark ninja and they required us to register it before they would provide tech support. We did. Then they said they wanted to record us and get video access. They assured us the video was only for tech support and that it would not be shared, only stored in case we needed help in the future so I agreed. It took only a few minutes for them to tell me the sensor was broken and that they wanted to charge me $199 for a new sensor!!! Outrageous! So I declined and asked them to delete the video and they refused. I asked for a supervisor and not only did she refuse but then she also refused to affirm that my registration information and video would not be shared with 3rd parties even though they promised that to get me to agree to let them take video. So, basically, the coffee maker is expensive junk AND they lied to me to get access to my phone and video. In my opinion this company is deceitful and does not stand by its products. I do not recommend this coffee maker or Shark Ninja products. I also do not recommend you allow them to make videos for tech support as they refuse to delete them and after the fact changed their agreement not to share my data and video with 3rd parties.This coffee machine costs less on their own website than they wanted to charge me for a sensor to fix it. Worse, they also lied to me and told me the coffee maker was more expensive than it actually was on their own website! Thank god I checked first and didnt fall for their scam."
"Bought Dec 9 2022 : August 2024 the machine will not get out of clean mode and will not brew no matter how much we follow the troubleshooting . Only 2 morning coffee drinkers (2 cups per day) . Great product until it broke…. Bought a 50.00 Kuerig , brews faster and much cleaner …. Miss the carafe when we have guests"
"While this unit functioned correctly, all the misc. parts fit properly, and we were able to make both pots of coffee from grounds and single serving from pods, it was simply the worst tasting coffee - EVER!  We tried to change the settings, add more/less grounds, cleaned the unit and still BLECH!  Even coffee made with pods tasted weak and bland.  I wanted a dual purpose coffeemaker to save counter space but, unfortunately, this unit does neither well.  Returning this one and will go back to my Cuisinart Coffee maker and a Keurig pod machine."
"I mean it works. It makes coffee. But, it brews through the coffee to quickly without hitting all of the grounds so the coffee comes out a bit weak. But, the preset functions are easy to use and I enjoy choosing how much coffee I’m making for those 2 cup evenings.The iced coffee setting somewhat works. It a little warm still, but not enough to melt the ice immediately… but if you don’t have ice don’t expect cold coffee."
This is a decent product but if your trying to do any cup size bigger than a mug you will be disappointed.
"We bought the first one last year and the kcup never worked, then when I try to have it replaced or fixed they said the warranty already expired so I bought another one because we like ninja products but it's the same, maybe it's just bad luck, but I'm returning this one on time"
Received  December 12th 2023.  Loved it until kcup part stopped working.  Only sputters and acts like it can't pump.  The brew part still works.  It has always made a very hot cup of coffee but very disappointed  it only 5mths with the kcup.  I did try to clean it but no improvement 😔
"I ordered model CFP301 NEW, but received CFP451CO REFURBISHED, and it was missing 3 parts - the scoop, permanent filter and there was no user manual.  My first clue must have been the plain brown box, not a Ninja box. It was for a birthday so it was just opened, after the 30 day return period.We brewed our first cups of coffee today and the coffee is GREAT, both hot and iced with frothed milk. However, as I've read in other reviews, the water reservoir leaks when it is on the base - all OVER the kitchen.  That means we can't use the delay timer feature without having a flood.Instead of calling Amazon, I called Shark/Ninja customer service and they are shipping the missing parts and new base unit free of charge.  I hope the new unit works, because we do love the coffee it makes.So many reviews here mentioned they received refurbished products and they leak.  I hope this gets resolved by Ninja and Amazon needs to sell new as advertised."
When it worked (spoiler alert!) it was great. Loved having the option for drip coffee when I was alone and then switching over to K cups when people came to visit. But it stopped working after only 9 months - it started to make scary noises and was only be able to produce lots and lots of steam which is not want I to drink in the morning.
"Okay, I ordered this machine used and got a fabulous deal. However, it was missing the frother part. I actually don't froth my coffee so I didn't send it back. It should have been complete. The part is another $20 or so. I ordered a hand frother for $6.99 and have to return it too because it didn't work. Just not my day.....But the machine makes terrific coffee and I do love it."
"Sent it back...it's too tall! When placed under standard height kitchen cabinets, you can't open the top without pulling the whole unit out. I mean...fundamental flaw!"
"Such a basic feature of the carafe lid being difficult to put on each time is ridiculous. It twists off ok, but trying to get it back on is tricky. Also, there is a ""lip"" seam that does not make for a smooth pouring experience.  Otherwise, just average and not worth the high price."
"The features of this coffee pot are great, Easy to use with either pods or grounds. You also have many setting sizes to brew. However the mfg didn't take into account that if you place on counter under cabinets you can't open the top high enough to put the grounds or pod in. You always have to pull the coffee maker forward. The second thing is, it is very noisy when starting the brewing process.  I am keeping it though because of the good features and will deal with the not so good ones."
"Bought this for my wife for Christmas. I probably should’ve sent it back the first time we used it but I thought it was just me. It works great. Makes great tasting coffee. But it cannot get even remotely close the the volume you set it to. If you set it for a 12 oz Kcup, you might get 7 ounces. If you set it for a 55 ounce carafe, you might get it half full, 30 ounces. Doesn’t matter how you set it. Doesn’t matter if it’s cleaned, or calibrated. I’ve checked the entire guide and looked through YouTube and apparently this isn’t an issue with anyone else. I’ve had it a couple of months since I bought it before Christmas and it sat under a tree for a while. Just know…if you need more coffee to get you going in the morning like we do, this thing is going to eat through pods and coffee grounds like crazy. We’ve tried running it twice to get a decent sized cup, but it seems to be watered down when we do that. Not impressed. Gave it 2 stars because it does taste great when you do drink it."
"I like this coffee maker. Being able to use grounds or cups in great. It brews quickly.The cleaning cycle takes 75 minutes.A week shy of 3 months, it no longer brews coffee.This morning while brewing a cup, the machine stopped running and beeped.The clean light was on.I ran a clean cycle and there was no water in the carafe and there was a continuous beeping.I tried running a second cleaning cycle and could see that it still was not taking water.I called Shark ninja and they said it's broken. Luckily it's still under warranty and they are sending a replacement, to arrive in 3-5 days."
"Item was missing the frother attachment, the measuring scoop and the manual. It was supposed to be in like new condition"
We loved this coffee maker until it quit working out of the blue. We brewed a full pot almost daily and cleaned once to twice a month with the clean cycle. Never used the single serve. Only used filtered water and just after a year of use we got an error code 11 and the unit would no longer heat up and brew.
The Keurig function no longer works. I've cleaned all areas and still does not function. What is the fix?
I actually really like the design of  this coffee maker and have made a pot of coffee that was great.  However that pot was about half the size of the carafe size expected. Amazon lists this as a 12-cup coffee maker so I guess I’ll be brewing 2 pots.
"I don’t normally leave reviews however I’m making the exception here. I have the Ninja Dual Pro it’s not even 90 days old. I was so excited when I purchased it. I paid $194 and all of the sudden the pod clean cycle light came on. I ran the cycle and it won’t work. I tried unplugging to reset it, nothing works. I called support and they were helpful but I had I have to wait 3 weeks for a replacement part. What am I supposed to do for 3 weeks."
"If you plan to make individual cups of coffe instead of using the carafe, the splatter is problematic and leaves the entire machine dirty, needing to be wiped down after every cup you brew.Also, the pod “adapter” is junk - within a month it was “rattling” and refusing to close to brew coffee using that method.Overall the worst Ninja brand product I’ve ever bought and will not buy another dual method machine from them - it’s seems this is not what they do best."
"Prior to 2020 all my coffee came from the office.  It was an elaborate machine.  When covid hit I spent $40 on a single serve coffee maker that didn't do K cups.  That lasted me until Jan when it was obvious we aren't going back to the office anytime soon.I picked up the Ninja CFP301 - 4 brew styles.  Honestly this thing has been fantastic.  The options available on it has made this thing a god send for being able to mix things up for variety.  I've never frothed my milk before.  I'll never go back to not doing that.  The K cups rock (I recommend picking up a cutter that can separate the bottom from the top for easy recycling.Overall if you are looking for a solid mid ranged coffee maker (I saw some that are 3x the cost.) I would recommend this.UPDATE: May 16, 2023:  LED for the power button died.  So no way to see where the power button is.  Thankfully I just know where it is at this point but still. Bad design where you need to guess where the power is.  Actually any failure of the backlight would render this thing useless. And of course this thing only has a 1 year warranty that expired in Jan"
"Purchased this item 4 months ago for the RN's to use at a Children's Hospital. We have had nothing but issues after the 30 day refund policy.  It keeps saying it is ""clogged"" ... requires a lot of unnecessary maintenance. Would not purchase this item gain and wish we still had the option to return it or at the very least have it replaced."
"Initially worked well, but after just two days it won’t boil water anymore.i like the concept and multi use functions. If it work long term it would be great. Maybe im just unlucky"
"Was working just fine making great coffee, then all of a sudden it stops in the middle of a fresh pot."
"The item itself is nice, however when I received my coffee system there was a damaged piece that Amazon would not replace. I went through a lot of trouble and had to purchase a broken item that was delivered to my door. So I not only purchased this ninja but I had to spend more money to replace the item that was delivered to me already broken, I'm not happy with that."
"My father was a coffee salesman, so I’ve been drinking coffee over 50 years, a tradition I’ve passed on to our children as well.  I previously owned an earlier model of the Ninja which brewed perfect cups of coffee 4 to 8 times a day for over seven years before that sad day came when it was time to retire it and search for a new coffee maker.I was hoping to buy the same model, but it had been long discontinued.  I searched for the new Ninja models and settled upon the CFP101.  What a disappointment.  The only thing I like about this machine is the option to brew K-Cups.  Here's the shortcomings.1. The carafe leaks when you pour.2. It does not brew a consistent amount of coffee into your cup.  I use the same mug every morning and sometimes it fills the mug with the 8oz setting and sometimes it only fills it halfway at the same setting, with various levels in between.3. The brewed coffee is not hot.  Lukewarm at best.  I'm not looking to pour molten lava into my cup, but I expect a steaming hot cup of coffee as every other coffee maker I've ever owned produces.  With this brewer I have to take my cup of coffee and put it on a mug warmer to bring it up to the desired temperature.I've owned several Ninja products over the years and have always been happy with them, so I didn't even consider other brands when I was looking for a new one.  Based on the 5 star reviews I've read in for this model I presume I got a defective unit?  Regardless, this is the last Ninja product I will buy."
"I was going to return this product because it does not make hot coffee. In fact you will have to microwave to get it hot, but after purchasing another brand that has a separate water dispenser (know as a higher end product as well) I chose to keep it until they come out with a better one. It is a design flaw issue. One was returned that was even less warming than this one. Be aware that you will have to warm it, but you can’t beat the taste in my opinion, and now I’m spoiled to the water dispenser fur my teas. Wish they hadn’t discontinued the old ninja. It was great. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it!!!!"
"I loved this coffee machine, was perfect. The just over 2 months after I bought it, it just stopped working. Would only brew maybe an ounce or two of coffee, it started to just rest itself on the time, and when I tried to clean it would do its thing and after a few minutes would just quit and restart."
"We were so excited to purchase and use this coffee maker. The reviews on Amazon and Google were excellent, so we thought this was going to be a wise choice! It offered all the features that we wanted (and some we didn’t even know we wanted) from K Cups to travel mugs, full carafe, ice coffee, and hot water for tea. BUT….It didn’t even last 3 years! All of a sudden it started dispensing 2/3 of the number of ounces on the display….for single cup servings and even when using the carafe. We descaled the machine, cleaned all the dispenser nozzles, and tried every size serving…no luck. We called Ninja support, and they told us that all Ninja products have a one year warranty, and the only “fix” was to purchase a new base for $199.00 or a brand new unit for $199.99! Unbelievable. That’s more than we paid on Amazon, and it’s fascinating that there is only a .99 difference between the two options. So we’re going to drink our stronger brew coffee with a little extra cream and look for a new dual coffee maker. We may be the exception to all of the glowing reviews here on Amazon, but please make a note of the  1 year warranty! Cuisinart is the only company that offers a 3 year warranty. Braun, Keurig, Breville, Delonghi, all give you 1 year. $200 is a lot of money to spend every 2-3 years for a new coffee maker. You might be better off getting a single serve K Cup coffee maker, and a separate coffee maker for full carafes."
"We loved this at first, but then after about a month, we were getting ""ER:06"" on our dial and it stopped making coffee.  Nothing we did can make it go away.  We tried to search for ER:06 for Ninja errors and there's nothing on their website or anywhere on the web to find out what the issue is."
"We bought this less than 30 days ago and of course registered it with Ninja per the card inside the box.Within 10 days it stopped working and made a horrible grinding high pitched metal on metal sound and said add water even though it was totally full of water.Contacted ninja and they made me do a video call and show them the issue and then they charged me $20 to fed ex me a new base.This is the actual machine “the base” they don’t send a new carafe or brew basket etc or water containerI was told even with the warranty and the fact we had it 10 days there was no other option.But to pay the $20 shipping and get a new base sent out.Fast forward a few days and the new replacement “base” arrived.I plugged it in, added water and went to brew a coffee pod and nope not working, went to brew pot of coffee nope not working loud horrible sounds and grinding metal sound so again called Ninja and did the required video call and was told since I bought this on Amazon I would need to go through Amazon for a full return and all ninja could do was send a new base AGAIN.I have had this machine for exactly 31 days and the Amazon return window closed on day 30.This purchase was a mistake it is a faulty machine and I would rather have a $200 paper weight, atleast that would do its job."
"When i first used the single serve side, the pod exploded and grinds were all over the cup plastic and the bottom of the lid where the pod seats. Called cuisineart and they gave me suggestions. I tried them and now unit doesn’t leak grinds but there hardly any coffee in the cup. It’s almost clear. And it leaks an excessive amount of water outside of normal residual steam when you open the top back up to retrieve used pod.  So i decided it needed to be replaced. Well they didn’t offer me the option of a replacement, only a refund which won’t be issued until january second. I needed this coffeemaker before christmas. So i complained and although they said they will get my refund within 24 hours tge unit is now $100 more. And before i got something done about getting refund faster via chat, i talked to a live agent who told me i wound have refund within 3 hours only to find out later after talking to someone else it will not be until January 2nd before i get it. So now i’ll wait and see if i actually get the refund within 24 hours. At any rate, the price should have been locked into the original price i paid. It’s not my fault electronic items tend to get damaged through the delivery process as i’m sure stuff gets thrown around somewhere in the process of shipment. Dropped or whatever. The package was in decent condition but all it takes is one good drop or item getting slammed and the electronics are damaged. Now to be fair i’m not saying this occurs all the time or even often. I’ve had really good customer service for the most part for years with Amazon. This time was different."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I know this is mid-range in cost, but I expect more. Starting with what I see as design flaws. It is very hard tell if there is coffee already made in the carafe. (see photos). The water reservoir is in the rear of the coffeemaker which makes it difficult to be able to empty a full carafe of water into the reservoir for drip coffee. To add water for espresso or k-cup serving the water reservoir is in the back of the machine so you must pull it out from the wall to access the reservoir.There is no way to turn the machine off once coffee is made and the carafe is emptied. Not until it reaches its full warming cycle and then it automatically shuts off. This seems like it could cause carafes to burn or scorch as they are left on warming plate empty. The temperature of the coffee is not very hot, and cools down far too fast (cools down to barely lukewarm after a few sips) which says it wasnt very hot to start. Finally the motor on the espresso part of coffeemaker is unbelievably loud when making espresso.(listen to video)I kept it for a week and tried to like it or get used to it, but it only frustrates me. So I am now back to the drawing board to find a decent coffee/k-cup/espresso maker :-(  Right now to have a coffeemaker that combines drip coffee, espresso and k-cups it appears that there are only two choices on the market at this time, this one and the Ninja."
"First the good - the machine is really beautiful and sleek.  The frother works great, and I loved that you can brew a carafe or a single cup. The Brew Pause is awesome and we liked that you can set it for a bolder flavor. We also liked that you can use espresso capsules in the Single Serve brewer.Now for the negatives - first, the water reservoir for the single serve cups, is in the back of the machine. This means that you have to pull the whole machine toward you and turn it to get the reservoir on and off the machine. Second, as many other reviews have mentioned, there is a slight learning curve to using the machine. It could be designed to be so much more intuitive to use. Third, the light on the display that is supposed flash to let you know it is brewing, is too light!!!  In a brightly lit kitchen it is very difficult to see the BREW light flashing. Fourth, for an almost $300 machine, we were disappointed that Cuisinart could not include the reusable Filter Cup to brew your own coffee for single-serve = you have to buy it on your own. Fifth (and for us, the dealbreaker) - the machine beeps (loudly) 5 times when it is done brewing a carafe.  Cuisinart did not include the option to silence or even lower the beep sound, so it wakes up the sleeping members of the house!  This was especially frustrating because the basic Cusinart carafe coffee machine which we were trying to replace, does have the TONE button to allow the beeps to be silenced.We have had a Cuisinart coffee maker for years and love the customer service. We were trying to upgrade our coffee game with this machine but the beeping was too annoying to deal with."
"When it first arrived, decent multi functional unit that can make pod single coffees as well as carafe and nespresso.  About 8-9 months in, the milk steamer wand is leaking water into the milk making it a nasty mess.  The single cup pod function now barely makes luke warm coffee.  Tried cleaning the burners with vinegar but nada.  Going to have to send in for warranty work.  At least it has the warranty.  First 6-8 months when fully functional was a decent product but should have more durability for the price."
"So, I was super excited to get this machine. It was everything I wanted in a coffee machine all in one. It could be great and my cuisinart coffee pot was always my favorite so I took a chance.First of all, the  buttons and dials are kinda funny. It took me time to get used to them. It’s not intuitive at all. The directions don’t even explain it well. I finally got the system down but it took a while. Maybe it’s just me.Secondly, it is not compatible with all k cups. I have bought several that don’t work with it and all you get is a cup of hot water. I can’t buy them at Aldis anymore because they don’t work. I was a punching a hole in them before using them to make it work. Also the espresso pods are hit or miss. Same thing happens where it can’t puncture the pod. I have one stuck in there right now and the frustration lead me to write this review. So it not only didn’t make me an espresso but now I can’t open the machine. Very disappointing!!! I’m hoping it will open by the time I get home from work.Thirdly, the frother is in a bad spot because it is very low on the machine and too close to the counter so it’s hard to get a pitcher under it.The drip coffee comes out very nice but that’s about it.So I bought this machine to clear up my countertop. I’m very disappointed in Cuisinart. I’m going to be looking for a little espresso machine now too. It won’t be a Cuisinart!"
"I don't know how many bars of pressure this machine uses for the espresso component. It doesn't feel like 19 bars. Yes, you have to wait quite a while for your espresso; it's not instant like a Nespresso machine. I can deal with that concession, given that I have the wonderful ability to brew a pot of coffee. But I am VERY disappointed that the espresso does not come out hot and rich with a thick crema, but instead it comes out thin, with hardly any crema at all. Total bummer. If you are an espresso lover and want to make coffee art with the foamed milk, you need a good crema for contrast. You won't get it with this machine, unfortunately."
I don't like the way it lights up the the top when you're trying to brew coffee and the bottom lights up at the same time buttons are way too close together and if you lose power you got to reso it again or it stays hot for 2 hours
"I purchased this 1 year ago.  I now cannot use the pod/espresso/steam function as the light will not come on for those features.  I have cleaned everything, watched videos and tried to contact customer support.  In order to communicate with customer support, you have to call—and I have no interest in being their technician or in trying to understand someone on the phone.  I will have to replace this with another brand.  Most of my small appliances are Cuisinart including other regular coffee pots and I love all of them, but this is a dud."
Love the coffee pot but I ordered white and received black.  We will keep the black to avoid hassle of returning.
"The water pump for the single serve feature is loud.Otherwise, the machine works great and looks good."
"I have purchased four different espresso pod brands and none of them will puncture the pod. According to cuisinart, they have a problem with their insert sleeve. So I have not been able to enjoy espresso yet. I'm on the list for when a replacement sleeve gets restocked. Very disappointed with that aspect, but otherwise the rest of the machine is great"
Doesn’t always do what it should sometimes putting in a pod and setting it. You only end up with hot water. I’ve had to reset it by unplugging and unplugging to get it to go. There’s something funny about the way it pokes holes in the coffee podsIt’s a bit of a pain so I don’t really recommend this oneI was hoping to replace a simpler one that firdI should  have done that
"My Nespresso machine with an integrated steamer blew up after 5 years and I didn’t want to replace it with another $700 machine.  My husband uses K-cups, so this seemed like a perfect solution, especially since it would clear up counter space.After one week, it’s going back.1.  My Nespresso ends up tasting burned more times than not.2.  It’s very easy to turn the carafe’s warming plate on WITHOUT brewing a pot.  Unfortunately, I didn’t know this when I grabbed the machine to move it.  Admittedly, after burning most of my hand on the first day may have impacted my willingness to give the machine a fair try.3.  This morning, my husband tried to brew a K-cup.  We had to unplug the machine twice before the option to choose anything other than a regular pot brew lit up.Final straw, it’s going back.  If this is the best I can find, I’ll take out a second mortgage and buy the Nespresso instead."
"Update to my review. While this is a good coffee pot, the brew button has not consistently worked. After calling customer service, they replaced the entire device. Good customer service, but I feel the product is defective since the new one is doing the same thing. If I unplug it from the wall and then plug it in again, it will work. I would not recommend it only because of this issue.-----------Love the 3 kinds of coffee this makes plus milk frother! The brew-on button sometimes doesn't work unless I unplug and replug in my machine. Also the location of the milk frother seems low so it almost spills when you remove the cup. Overall I enjoy this a few times every day and it is very nice."
Water reservoir leaking badly
"So you want to use the craft to measure out 12 cups of 8 oz coffee.  That should be pretty easy, just add water to fill the craft to12 mark and you are good to go.  At least that is what I thought.  According to cuisinart customer service, you would be making 12 cups of 5oz coffee.  Whatttttt are you talking about??  When pressed to confirm that via the manual, etc.  I was told< ""that is what a colleague told me"".So you can not use the craft to measure out your water to fill the basin for 8oz cups.  Just saying..."
I was very hopeful for this coffee maker. It makes the hottest coffee I have ever had and I love that. I don't like anything else. We mostly use pods and it leaks where the pods go in. I was willing to overlook that but we have not even had it a year and it's causing more issues that it is work. I paid well over $300 for this and I'm not impressed.
"I love the idea of this coffee maker (one appliance instead of three on my counter), but it just has so many flaws.1.  Buttons - the buttons need to be double clicked - once to wake it up and once to select Brew or Off.  Guests think they are brewing coffee but really they only woke it up, so no coffee until you realize it's doing nothing.2, Dials - the dial to select the Kcup or Espresso is sensitive. If you press it wrong, it will change the size or change to Water.  It should click rather than spin so freely.3.  Kcup inconsistent results.  The Kcups explode out the top on occasion.  Cheap or expensive, it doesn't matter. It's happened at least 4 times now with different mfgs of them. I think it happens when the water tank if full and the pressure of the water explodes the Kcup. I've tried double piercing the bottom and the top but it doesn't work.  Even when it doesn't explode the cup always has grounds in it.4. Hard to clean the Kcup dispenser - so when it does explode or even just when it squirts water all around the top, there are so many crevices that the grounds get in that cleaning it is a nightmare.The coffee tastes fine and it makes a nice pot of coffee but if you're making more kcups than pots of coffee, be warned."
"We just bought the 4-1 a couple weeks ago, and it brews a mean pot of coffee, much better than our previous unit, but the expresso option didn’t fair to well. The very first time we tried the expresso feature, no water was pumped up through the unit and therefore did not yield a drop of expresso. We unplugged it, as outlined in the manual to reset it (by unplugging it), tried it again, and nothing came out. We tried to open the lid by releasing the silver latch and when we popped the latch the lid is stuck and won’t open. It simply won’t budge. Customer support was no help and couldn’t figure out how to get the lid open either. They recommended that we return the defective unit. Again, we tried to like it, but unfortunately I didn’t work out and no we’re on the look out for another coffee machine."
"I've utilized the brew, K-cup, and Nespresso pods, and all have been fantastic. The water tank is quite sizable and easy to pull out and in (my machine is on a wheeled platform to roll out). The only issue that I have had repeatedly on both the K-cup and Nespresso is that about 10% of the time, I get a hot cup of water. I turn the machine off and on, switch between Nespresso and K-cup, rebrew, and then it works. It's not reseating the pods so I have no idea why it's happening or how in the world the water is traveling around the pods. I can't troubleshoot anything because it's all under its locked top."
"We really wanted to love this coffee maker, however, the K cup/Nespresso side is ridiculously loud.  I even called Cuisinart direct hoping for a solution. I was specifically told that the noise is just part of the design. So for us, the solution is to just return it."
"Purchased mainly for the Kcup, Nespresso functionality.  On my 2nd unit and have had issues with both. 1st machine would consistently over-brew Kcups by an ounce on any setting making for watery coffee. It would also over-brew Nespresso pods but not as extreme and they tasted fine. Tried unplugging overnight in hopes of a reset but no change in brew amounts. 2nd unit consistently under-brews by an ounce making for stronger coffee.  Cuisinart either has an issue with the pumps or electronics in this machine that won't allow it to consistently brew at correct volumes.  Both machines brewed fine on the Carafe side. If you could live with ""learning"" which brand pods work best at which setting the machine is very versatile. Had no issues with leaks but one lock-up when a Nespresso Pod did not puncture."
"Started off loving this coffee maker, but after 2 months of use, it leaks from multiple areas and often soaks my counter. Wish I could return."
"Having option to use K-cups or Nespresso cups or re-fillable pods or a pot of coffee, along with the steamer, made this very attractive. But I discovered a few negatives: --there is minimal room to pour water into the reservoir when making a pot of coffee; I have spilled more than once;  --usage is FAR from intuitive; press the Start button for pods but On button for brew? --Where is the Off button? After brewing a pot, the warmer stays on even if I have finished the pot, there is no way to turn it offGiven a choice, I would not buy this machine again"
Nice looking coffee maker. The keurig part makes a lot of noise when making coffee.
The carafe leaks when you pour the coffee. The pods do not make good coffee. This was not worth the money. Do not recommend.
"The coffee pot portion and the k cup portion work fine, as expected. That said, and we’ve had this machine for many months at this point, the Nespresso pod feature is not good. I buy Nespresso brand pods as I always have with my previous machines, and this machine makes it less frothy and most importantly, more than half the time, there are coffee grounds that come through. Like a lot of them (see picture). I wouldn’t buy it again."
The single serve coffee maker doesn’t properly puncture the pods and produces hot water instead of coffee because the water doesn’t flow through the pod properly to brew the coffee.  I have to puncture the pod twice and turn it inside the cradle before closing the lid and activating the brew function in order to actually get coffee instead of hot murky flavorless water.  I should send it back but I figured out a work around and I’m too lazy
made very weak coffee/ espresso wateryk cup also very weak
I wanted to like this barista but it has its flaws. The single service does not allow you to put your coffee cup there. It’s only made for thin travel cups. Also the frother is not flexible to fit your frothing cup under the frothing tool. It’s easy when the cup is empty and you add your milk but after it’s complete try taking that cup out without spilling that incredibly hot milk
"When finished brewing there is a lot of water left in the k-cup. It drips and drips and within a couple of days the area under where you set your coffee cup fills up. If you take the k-cup out immediately after brewing, hot water pours out in your hand. This machine is also slow."
"Don't waste your money on this. When it works the kcup side is nice, but every other kcup (across many brands) tends to not run the water through the cup itself, resulting in a cup of hot water. This has resulted in WAY too many lost kcups.The  nespresso side is perfect.The steamwand is a dumb design. If you don't have the machine raised off the counter, you can really only fit a small espresso cup under unless you seriously underfill any larger cup so it can tilt sideways.The caraf side is fine.All in all, if you want a kcup machine, go somewhere else. I thought a 4 in 1 would be nice, but im now realizing I should have stuck to my original plans and just went with real espresso and a breville unit with a keurig machine on the side.I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife -- you'll get the initial wow factor, but one you start using it its all downhill.I write this review as I sit drinking my hot water that somewhat resembles a cup of coffee. This is AFTER I wasted 5 kcup pods just trying to get this weak excuse for coffee brewed."
"This machine works great for coffee, the steam wand is not something to be desired.  It takes a while to heat the milk and doesn't create much foam, it is just OK. It is very nice to be able to use Keurig pods and nespresso pods, and regular brewed coffee. We use each option often.  Because of the lack of performance of the steam wand I use a separate frother."
Worked fine for a while - but the k cup lid eventually got stuck and now doesn’t work - I don’t recommend it due to low quality design
"I loved the versatility of this coffeemaker. You could either make the traditional cup of coffee with ground coffee and a pot, or you can do espresso pods or K-cups. Perfect, right? Wrong. No problem with the traditional method but the pods only work properly 50% of the time. For no good reason that I can discern, the Kcup pods get torn open and I end up with water on the counter and a cup half full of coffee grounds. The espresso pods work better but again, half the time, the water sputters and I get half as much espresso in the cup.  Very disappointed and I’m researching for a replacement."
"Don’t make coffee early if you don’t want to wake anyone. This thing could wake the dead. Super bummed about that. Sounds like I’m grinding coffee. But, it’s pretty, it works well and has nice options."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Haven’t used the regular coffee maker yet, but the single-serve side is unbearably loud (kind of a grinding, vibrating noise, and makes a cup of coffee extremely slowly. Both Nespresso and K cup features are super loud and slow. It is twice as slow as my cheap Keurig, but the loud is a bigger problem — people are sleeping when I make coffee. I’m not sure I’ll keep it.UPDATE - the drip side doesn’t do anything. See video. This thing is garbage."
"The machine broke. It’s only been 5 months since I bought it. I put an espresso pod in there, and somehow it got stuck. The lid will not open at all. I’ve never seen this before in other machines. So the side where the pods go is completely stuck closed. Also the regular coffee pod never worked well, the coffee comes out watery and water leaks on the outside. Not work the high price tag at all!"
Some buttons you push and hold and some you just push.  I was very excited to get the coffee maker and with the expense of it I expected something extraordinary. Sorry but It’s just ordinary. Even with an additional scoop of coffee it’s not exceptional.
I had to return the first unit within 2 weeks  due to the water leaking out of the side when using the k-cup.  It caused the amount of the cup to be less and weak not to mention the mess. I have had 2 Cuisinart coffee pots with the combination k-cup that lasted 10 years plus and decided to add the Expresso option.  I returned the first unit and replaced it and the exact same thing had happened exactly 7 days past the return date.  I have been a Cuisinart customer for years and contacted them and are sending replacement parts would not allow return of the item. Very disappointed DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Way too expensive  to have had the exact same problem on both unit. Clearly a design issue.
"If you put in a K-cup,  does not matter what brand or make,  it will brew hot water into the kup and put water and grounds all over the counter and out the side of the machine.  The Nozzle that is meant to puncture the Lid is too short and also some weird cone plastic design instead of the metal needles you get with 99% of other K-cup machines and does not work.  Huge waste of over $200 as the primary reason we wanted it was to mostly brew K-cups and sometimes brew pots or Nespresso (both of which work fine)"
Was excited to get this and set it up. Followed the directions exactly to run the first cup through and kept getting error message. Unplugged the machine tried again error message over and over. Packed it back up and sent it back. Won’t waste my time or money again.
Every time I tried to brew I got an EO error. The manual says this is fixed by running a cleaning cycle but that gave me an EO error as well. Returned and got a Ninja which worked right away. Unless you enjoy spending hours troubleshooting your appliances I would look elsewhere.
"We use the pods more than the coffee pot . When using the pods , most of the time you only get hot water you then change pods up to 4 times. tried all major brand pods . no difference ."
I waited to post this review bc I thought I might be the problem- choosing wrong coffee pods.  Nope.  None of the pods I’ve used work in the single serve side.  I get lukewarm water.  As for the coffee pot side- it just makes ok coffee.  This piece of junk isn’t worth the big cost.
"This item was broken in several places, couldn’t replace with one not broken had to get a refund.  To reorder I will have to pay full price. So much for Black Friday deals."
Brews a decent cup of coffee.  Very loud.  Hard to use in the house early morning with other people still sleeping.10 oz cup max on coffee also a bummer.
"This machine had everything I wanted all in one machine . I thought the 1st one was just a lemon so I ordered a 2nd one because I loved the idea of everything all in one. BOTH machines got grounds in the k-cup section every time. I am talking the k-cup would burst and 1/2 the grounds were in the cup. The first one I tried everything to make it work (cleaning it, buying different pods etc) I  waited too long to send it back for a refund or replacement so I threw it in the trash. I ordered a 2nd one in hopes I just had a lemon the 1st time, but the 2nd one did the same thing. I am done now and will just purchase separate machines to do what I want and they will not be Cuisinart. It all sounds good on paper. Sadly it just doesn’t work well."
Nothing like I would have expected from Cuisinart. Could not log on using their app to fill out warranty so I have no warranty now. Seems like they tried to cram a lot of bells and whistles into it and none of them work well
"I have never had a coffee maker that sounded like a propeller plane taking off, but this one certainly does on the single serve brewing side. The single pod brewing sizes are also inaccurate. I just brewed 10 oz and got 12 oz, making for a very diluted cup of coffee that tasted awful. Seems Cuisinart cannot hit the mark on these dual purpose machines. This one will be going back."
The machine leaks when using Keurig pods. Brewed coffee is lukewarm at best. Total waste of money.
I have used my cusinart coffee station for three months and the lid for k cups and nepresso pods is stuck shut.  I tried unplugging it thinking it was pressure from the steam.  Checked it 24 and 48 hours after unplugging and it still won’t open.  It appears the lever failed to release.  This is a manufacturer defect.  The k cup doesn’t filter the water correctly and wastes every other k cup.  There is no resolution for this problems. The designers should be fired.  I recommend you save your money and purchase a product that works.  What a waste of money. The warranty is worthless because they will send you the same flawed crappy Machine.  They don’t even care enough to fix it.
I received this on October and at first I loved it but the pod side latch mechanism is broken and locked shut after only 2 months.
Very good looking machine but wow is it loud! Everyone in the house will know your making coffee. Doesn’t work with hot chocolate pods at all have to open up the pod and scrape the hot chocolate mix out. Oh and the hot water thing on the side is useless bc you can’t get your cup out from under it without spilling everything in it. I would return it but past the return date.
"Not compatible like it says with other pods. I started a return on October 4, today is October 14 and they are not going to refund me until October 25! I find this to be ridiculous and unprofessional. Went with the Nespresso which is a great machine."
"Beautiful coffee maker!The expresso part was easy and tasted good.  The frother/steamer took FOREVER to start steaming but once started, it worked well.The K-cup was horrible.  It leaked water and was a very very very slow stream.  I troubleshooted and it worked ""OK"" for a couple cups.  I kept a dry rag whenever I opened it to wipe up access water as it was always wet enough to drip down the side of the coffee maker.I did everything I could to fix it as it was a beautiful addition to my kitchen however it never did work well.It went back today (wherever substandard coffee makers go to die) and thank goodness I kept my old Keurig.  My cup of coffee was sooooo good  this morning!  Fast, easy and NO MESS!DO NOT BUY Cuisinart Coffee Maker Barista"
"I wanted to love this coffee machine due to its versatility but the single server side did not work. It displayed the E0 error code and despite following the troubleshooting instructions, we were unable to get it fixed. I ordered this twice and it had the same issue with both units. I wish it worked because it has all the options my husband and I need. Very disappointed."
The espresso/k-cup side is stuck closed rendering 2/3 of the unit non-functional. So very disappointing.
Sent back 2 for leaking water and decided not to try a third time so I went for the coffeemaker with keurig and it leaks also.  Cuisinart is very difficult to deal with.  They do not respond to emails and wait times on the phone are at least 15 minutes if anyone aswers at all.  Not worth the money!!!
Unit was used and obviously returned defective then sold to me!!!!
Have had for 2 months now and it started leaking water a couple weeks ago. Have to refill the tank every morning and constantly clean my counter. Caused water damage on the side of my cabinet.
"Should have rolled off the assembly line and straight into the shredder.  It never worked right from day one, and support was useless, warranty wasn't honored.  Couldn't make a k-cup, sometimes you'd just get water because it overflowed from the top.  Oh, and grounds all over the place, such fun to clean up!  The nespresso thing worked a few times, but eventually completely conked out.  Even the clock lost time, about 5 minutes per week!  RUN AWAY!!!"
"I couldn't use it, I just cleaned the machine like the manual said. I returned the product after calling the company as recommended because the steam and hot water supplier never works. I still like this machine but I'm afraid to buy again. Well packaged, safe and on time delivery."
"Was sad this device did not work as we had hoped. The pods for coffee maker part would at times run out hot water only and not brew the coffee pods. Sometimes it would work sometimes it wouldn't. Was an easy return for new device, but sadly the second machine had same issue."
"Frustrating after going thru all the prep to get the coffee make going the 12 cup brew side no problem. The single serve side keeps telling me to add water I have added water to the rear reservoir dumped it out many times, reset, unplug. It just won’t sense that there is water. I refuse to trouble shoot a brand new item that cost decent money. This is being returned."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This thing may have been a lemon, I’m not sure. First thing, as soon as I try and brew my first cup I’m met with an immediate error and the machine locks up. I unplug it, plug it back in and try again and this time it worked, but man it sounds awful. I was pretty sad to see this be as bad as it was because it’s a great idea. Too bad they probably saved $2 with a cheaper pump that will now scare people away from their products in the future. Give it another year to let them work out all the refurbished units then buy one at a discounted rate. There is going to be plenty of returns I’m sure."
"Without realizing it, we just missed the return window to return this item. If it’s possible to return it still, I would like to. Perhaps this unit is deficient because the water is just not hot enough especially for the espresso. Such a shame otherwise we like it But it’s not much good without hot water."
"After a month I bought this machine, the lid for the espresso is jammed and won't open."
This is a terrible product. About a week after receiving it the Nespresso side didn’t work. Now about 2 months of using it the K-cup side doesn’t work. I do not recommend this product.
"Loved the versatility of machine.  Loved the capability of brewing a full pot of coffee, or using capsules for expresso,  or the pods.  When the expresso portion malfunctioned, a Cuisinart representative finally would issue me a replacement if I cut cord and sent picture to e-mail address with a reference number.  I find this solution wasteful,  since 3 of 4 functions work fine.  I plan to keep machine, but NEVER  intend to buy another Cuisinart product.Couldn't they have allowed me to donate it instead of detroying it?"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I ordered this machine the end of December, received early January and honestly regret the space it takes up. I have yet to brew a pot of coffee, have used the Keurig side maybe 5 or so times and attempt to used the Nespresso daily. I say attempt, as I seem to only get 1 out of 4 pods that actually brew. The rest seem to explode over everywhere but through the the pod. Thankfully the pods aren’t as expensive as the Vertuo counterparts! Do not waste your money. This is the worst coffee pot ever."
"It’s been 1 month since I’ve had this coffee maker. It now leaks around the kcup holder and down the side. It will also brew water when it’s suppose to brew coffee (every now and then) I contacted cuisinart customer service on Nov. 17th. I’m still getting the run around with them, even after they stated my machine is under warranty and they’ll replace it. I’ve had cuisinart coffee makers for over 15 yrs now. Never again will I buy from this company."
I don't know what the folks at Cuisinart were thinking. On the surface it does all the stuff. 2 hour set up just to get coffee. Functions I have tested all work. I'll have to keep the instruction manual with it to use and no guests will be using it. For the price I would not buy again.
Sad customer.. Caffeine in the am is a girls best friend. The pod slot quit working after a week of use..Sadly it’s too late to return:(
"This coffee machine ships missing parts. After you finally get it, the coffee machine breaks, Cusinart makes you CUT THE CORD before sending you a new coffee machine and then they take forever to ship it.DO NOT BUY"
First if you want to go def his coffee machine is for you. Got the coffee machine unpacked it and it looked great That is the only good thing I can say about it. Plugged it in and tried it. It made so much noise that my neighbor in my apartment building came over to find out what the noise was. Just making a cup of coffee.Packed it up sent it back.  Do not buy!
This machine has been so disappointing. I would not recommend anyone purchase this. Half of the time the K-cup feature comes out very watery and pools water near the pod. It drips non-stop after use and when changing pods those are also full of water. Very disappointing for a $300 machine.
"I ordered two of these as I thought the first one was defective, but as it turns out when using the single serve feature (k-cup), it sounds like someone is using a power saw in my kitchen. It makes sense that because this supports nespresso pods it has to be pressurized, but the sound is obnoxious. I've ordered a Ninja brand barista bar that uses Nespresso pods, and it's nothing like this. Plus the coffee machine is overly bulky, just a bad design overall."
"I was looking for an all in one coffee system, and found exactly what I wanted.  However it lasted exactly two days. I tried to use the pod side, placed a Nespresso pod in and the machine froze up.  I could not open the latch.  I should have read the reviews before I purchased."
This product leaked from day one and I have tried everything suggested and it still leaks.  I have tried to submit the form for getting customer support and I have not received any response.  I'd suggest doing more research and perhaps finding a better item.
"My machine keeps brewing only water on the single serve side.  The paperclip needle cleaning does not help.  I purchased it on February 26, 2024.  Frustrating for such a pricey machine."
"It worked excellent for one month. Now all I’m getting is clear water in my coffee cup. I’ve cleaned the nozzles, still nothing but water. It punctures the k-cup correctly but that’s it"
"The pod part of the coffee maker does not puncture the pods properly.  Just runs water through it.  We have had to start poking holes in the pod prior to inserting it.  This isn’t ideal either because coffee grinds get everywhere while the pod is being brewed.  Bad design, very dissatisfied."
"Not sure about all of the good reviews. We’ve had two lemons. The first had the door to the pods get stuck when trying to make espresso. No amount of force would get it open so we opted to exchange. The second arrived and the lower half of the display (for pods, espresso, water, etc.) does not work!"
"Wasted too many pods to count in this machine.  It makes water, water and more water and leaks …"
"Worst coffee maker I have ever owned . Doesn't make a pot of coffee, doesn't work with ANY coffee filter or the filter basket they give you. 100% only going to work with pods."
This item leaks and we found out a month after our 30 day return window closed now it’s useless
A coffee maker that was almost $300 should not be leaking three weeks in. The return window closed YESTERDAY and now I’m stuck with this $300 piece of GARBAGE
Single cup very loud.  Pot of coffee - did not work
"Within a month the K-cup/espresso/steam wand section stopped working. Nothing to do with a clogged needle or being dirty. Bought in May ‘23 and stopped working June ‘23. Great idea, terrible build. Should have bought the Ninja"
Tried multiple times to run it differently to make sure we weren’t missing something. It aways wound up leaking and making a mess of water.  Very disappointing
Less than 90 days in the espresso portion of the machine does not work.
"I read some lid issue reviews but because we have always enjoyed our Cuisinart coffee makers, I bought it from Cuisinarts site. They are replacing the unit after 10 or so espresso's and a few months of having it- the lid is jammed and nothing has worked to open it. I have my concerns about the espresso pod side.  The coffee side works great."
"It needs a lot of counter space and will not fit under upper cabinets. To fill it with water you have to open the top lid all the way up and pour water in the back which is difficult, and why it won't fit under cabinets. The Pod side has its own water reservoir. The controls are not intuitive and took some time to figure out. Brew time for a pot is extremely slow. Way slower than any other machine I have ever owned.  I recommend passing on this coffee maker."
"Looks great, works terrible.This is a subpar kcup with a substandard frother. It’s does nothing well. It definitely doesn’t make expresso. It makes kcup like sort of maybe  kinda expresso. Sure some machines in this price rage don’t do the best expresso ever. This machine literally doesn’t do it, they just claim it. Though the expresso container is sold SEPARATELY.The coffee pot lid snaps on. There’s no hinge or anything. It’s answered clip on lid. I can tell it won’t last long as plastic constantly exposed to hot water won’t hold its shape for that slight of a clip.I literally bought a krups caffe duomo II 10 years ago at a garage sale for like $15 and it it did all of this better than this….AND ARILL DOES!!!!!  When the steam lid cracked on the krupps I thought this would be an upgrade. I looked at many options ranging from $100-$1,000.  All seemed to have shotty reviews.I thought that I could at least count on the brand to be good, but no.Extremely disappointed."
"Received this as a wedding gift. The kcup worked for about 2-3 months and now it just distills hot water and leaks everywhere. We have cleaned the needle numerous times, and it still does not function properly. At this point I wish I could get rid of it, but it is past the return window since it was a gift.Nespresso works fine and is consistent. Same with drip coffee, but the kcups are what we would primarily use on weekdays.Other than the durability and craftsmanship being awful, my only gripe with the design is that the wand does not move up or down. If the machine is on your counter it’s hard to get your cup at the right angle to use the frother.I will not be purchasing another cuisinart machine anytime in the near future. The cost of this was too much for it not to be functioning. I feel even worse knowing my family came together and spent hard earned money to buy this for us and it doesn’t even work."
"The carafe/ drip side of tge machine are poorly engineered and it leaks and drips all over the counter.The controls are confusing and very poorly designedTgepod and nespresso side seems to work okThe dial has to be in ""brew"" positio. To set the clock, but they don't tell you that in the manual or the quick start guide.It looks nice on the counter, just don't try to use it for brewed coffee, oh, and there is no way to turn it off except to pull the plug.Should I keep going?It is going to be returned."
"I was so excited to use this and have run into problem after problem with the espresso part since setting it up. From errors to now not being able to open that chamber at all. The coffee side works fine, but for the money…I could’ve just bought a regular coffee maker since we can’t even use the espresso function."
1. Kurig coffee.- it shoots clear water for 3-4 seconds before coffee comes out (into the cup) not only that but it’s extremely slow at doing a kcup about 2x as a slow as a kurig.2. Drip coffee its drip coffee hard to mess that up same setup as any $30 drip coffee machine nothing special nothing bad I guess . Than again the thing costs $300?3. Nespresso and my gripe with this machine. It works with some pods doesn’t work with others.its not compatibly with anything other than the basic nespresso pods. Peet’s doesn’t work lavazza doesn’t work Dunkin’s don’t work it just splatters inside the machine cause it doesn’t puncture it right.Overall I had this thing for about 3 months before the issue of the espresso working or not working when it felt like it with selective brands made me grab the unit and toss it out my window. After battling all week trying to just have a cup of coffee in the morning I decided my sanity is worth more than a plastic $300 pile of junk. That’s what this machine is ultimately is all low grade plastic components mashed into one machine and up charged a lot because it’s 3in1 but it doesn’t do anything good kcup tastes more watered down nespresso roulette in the morning outta really start your days right .When I wrote there CS they just replied with “return it” not even tryna find out what’s wrong with it they know this things a heap of crap4. Steamer wand. It will turn on by the time your coffee has become a grandparent that’s how long it takes to start .
"Worst coffee maker I’ve had. It worked great for a few months. If you remove the water reservoir it will leak all out when put back in place. The k-cup part of the machine worked for about 8months. Now it over flows and the water won’t go through the pod. We end up with an excessive amount of coffee grounds in our cup. The espresso part works great, but the milk frother has always make the milk have a metal taste and the hot water that comes from the wand had a funky taste when making hot Chocolate. I haven’t had this a year yet and wasted over $200 to last less than a year. Very displeased!"
"I purchased the K-Slim to save counter space and got rid of an older working Keurig.  I gave the K-Slim the benefit of the doubt, but it failed to perform properly.FIRST THE GOODThere are no bells and whistles such as temperature control, brew strength, power on timer, etc.  This is in the product description, user manual and reflected in the selling price.  I don’t need or want bells and whistles. I am not a picky coffee drinker so the K-Slim should have worked for me.  I will even drink gas station coffee.There is almost no waiting time for the brew to start even if refrigerated water is used. Insert a K Cup, select brew size, press the brew button and the brew will start in about ten seconds.From my personal experience Keurig has excellent consumer support where you can make a voice call and speak with a live person. For valid warranty claims a replacement is a no hassle, with free shipping included.NOW THE BAD**** ORIGINAL UNIT (single entry needle style) Purchased October 2020.  I followed the user manual descale instructions exactly.  When brewing coffee, the reservoir will brew three 12-ounce cups before the add water LED is displayed.  This is normal.  While in descale mode instructions say to keep pressing the brew button until the add water LED is illuminated.  After the third 12 ounce cup of descale solution the add water LED did not come on. So, I pressed the brew button again and the power died and the unit would not power back on.Since the K-Slim does not have an internal water tank I suspect the unit overheated and a (should have) safety feature kicked in to prevent a possible fire.  I googled my situation and found another person with the same issue.  Maybe a software bug?**** WARRANTY REPLACEMENT #1 (single entry needle style)Replaced August 2021.  No issues with the descale cycle.  My issue is the amount of brew is gradually reduced to about two ounces less than the selected brew. 12oz selected=10 oz.  10 oz selected=8 oz.  I confirmed the amount of water without a K Cip pod and using a measuring cup.  See attached photos.To return the unit back to the correct water dispense I will have to run one or two descale cycles.  I also cleaned the unit including needles per the user guide.The user guide says to descale every three months.  To be fair a more frequent descaling may be required depending on water quality and amount of use.  I use filtered tap water and we brew about four cups daily on average.  I descale no more than every four weeks to return the unit back to the correct brew size.  I had a couple of non K-Slim Keurigs in the past and did not have these issues.I used the Keurig brand descale solution and a third-party generic solution with the same results.  After about ten months of use I could not get the unit to operate correctly.  Keurig sent a second warranty replacement.**** WARRANTY REPLACEMENT #2 (newer “Multistream Technology” five entry needles)Replacement July 2022.  It is now mid October 2022 and it has only been about three weeks since the last descale.  My 12-ounce brew is only getting 10 ounces again.  Time to descale again.**** FINAL THOUGHTSKeurig does make some good products, but the K-Slim is a dud. I assume I am not the only one with this K-Slim issue.  I will not ask for another K-Slim warranty replacement. I am going to shop for another brewer.  Maybe another model Keurig, maybe not. For the amount of money I spend on descale solution the K-Slim is not worth keeping.MY SPECULATIONThe K-Slim does not have an internal water tank as confirmed in the following quote from Keurig:“Unlike the other Keurig systems, the K-Slim coffee maker has no internal water tank. As a result, only the external Water Reservoir needs to be emptied prior to storing.”The K-Slim heats water using heating tubes as it is pumped from the external reservoir.  I confirmed this by watching youtube videos showing the internal parts.  I suspect the design of the K-Slim does not allow the descale solution to stay in the unit long enough to do its job.********  UPDATE 10/25/2020 ********The low output of my third warranty replacement is getting worse even with descaling.  I purchased another brand coffee maker.  Before recycling the K-Slim I removed the cover.  I added a couple of photos to this review showing the heating tube and thermal switch (safety feature) I discussed in my original review.********  End Of Update ************"
"I am frustrated with this purchase and it's threatening to turn me off of Keurig for good.I am in a skilled nursing facility as a patient.  The coffee they serve is decaf Folgers and absolutely terrible.  Weak, not hot enough, tastes like they haven't cleaned their coffee maker since the facility was new in the late 70s - and for a coffee snob like me, that's virtually torture.At home I have a Chemex and use that to make my coffee.  Yes, I'm *that* kind of coffee snob.That being said, I've had a Keruig in the house .. since before 2004.  That original one lasted until 2010 when we moved and got dropped during the move.  Up until then, it was used in a household with my wife and I and our two late-stage teenage boys.The next one was just as reliable. Lasted until 2016 when we moved again, and for some reason that one just didn't power back up after the move.Since then - it's been a diminishing return on the Keurig investment.  Up until I got in here.  My wife had gotten one - not sure the model - for her office.  It was one that you had to put water in for each cup of coffee.  Not a big deal - but it started acting funny.  Started leaking from underneath, but just a little, until one day I hear a *pop* and it stops working all together and water went all over my little hospital table and all over me.Enter in this KSlim.  I wanted the multistream technology to try, it had a reservoir so I didn't have to fill it up every cup, and it was still really slim and fit on my hospital tray very well.  I bought it on December 23, 2023.Here we are, the first part of June, and this one has quit working, not six months later.A: Credit where credit is due - the multistream technology provides a marginally better (read:  Stronger) cup of coffee than the normal ones.  It's still not as strong as I like it, but it is better.B: Six months of a lifespan for a $100 coffeemaker is absolutely unacceptable.C: It's mocking me, because if I fuss with it long enough - eventually it'll make one cup of coffee then stop working again.The behavior is that the add water light won't turn off even though the tank is full, and it won't make coffee because of that.Descaled about three days ago and it worked fine until now.  I've unplugged / plugged back in, hit the brew button and the 12oz button from power off, and it pumps water just fine.  Switched the type of bottled water I've been using from purified to spring water.  Cleaned the needle as instructed on their website.  I've burned sage, had a voodoo priestess come do a dance, had a priest come in and perform an exorcism on the room, and even cried a little.  I think it was the lack of caffeine that made me cry a little.The worst part is that I'll try everything repeatedly for a long time and nothing changes.  Then, on a whim, I'll try it and it'll make a cup of coffee.  One. Single. Cup.  Then it goes back to the same behavior.Like I said, it's mocking me.  Sitting in it's cozy plastic case, watching me, laughing.Or I just could have been in this facility to long and I've got a cylinder that's not up to pressure and starting to misfire.I've e-mailed Keurig support and I am waiting for a response.  Making phone calls in this skilled nursing facility environment is difficult as people come in and out of my room a lot.I just cannot imagine what other troubleshooting steps there are.So, I'm frustrated, angry, and disappointed to see how far the quality control at Keurig has fallen.  I may switch over and try a Nespresso for my next machine since a friend of mine got one and won't shut up at how amazing it is."
"This coffee maker does work well.  Unfortunately, the controls are on top and hard for a short lady to read and the water take is on the back and hard to take off and put back on.  There is not handle on the top and you can sometimes drop it into the water while trying to put it on if you fill in place.  If your remove the tank to fill the sides are slick and can be dropped rather easily. Also, the idiot clean light doesn't turn off after cleaning.  I've cleaned it three times in a row and the light remains on."
"Ordered this specifically for the pretty red shown in marketing pics. Even now, as I look at the pic here on Amazon, I feel disappointed for the actual color. In reality, the color is closer to rust. It’s very ugly. Plus, why so long. Makes it difficult to pour water in the reservoir. If I could do it over, I would have instead purchased the smaller version for less money. Paid $130 for this but the smaller one is just around $80 or $90. 42oz versus 46. The extra 4oz isn't worth it imo. So if I were you, I’d save some money. This machine does work very well, though I miss the 6oz button. And the water heats instantly. Maybe this is why the long body? I really don’t know. But I’d trade if I could."
"I like that it makes great coffee.  Great space saver, looks good! But,  I had to lift up cup so it wouldn’t splatter all over kitchen. Seriously!I was going to return but found there was another piece you can purchase to raise coffee cup up high to keep fromSplattering. Not right they did not design with extra piece fitting permanently. Extra piece is around 20 🤣"
"My old Keurig was acting like it was getting ready to stop working (after less than three years, not thrilled about that, but not the point...) so I quickly ordered what I THOUGHT was the exact same model -- clicked on it in my purchase history and voila, same day delivery, great! Didn't bother to read reviews as I usually do for purchases, as I'd already had the same model so knew what to expect... or so I thought.Because when I went to use it, the lid wouldn't close on my reusable K-cups. Wha? I went back and checked reviews, and now I see they've changed the prongs or something so you have to buy all NEW reusables. Gah!And yes, I now see it says ""multi stream technology"" - which come on, just sounds like one of those buzzwords, I didn't even notice it didn't say that on the old one.So this complaint is partly for Keurig -- a GOOD company might have tossed a free reusable cup into the box to get people started. (I actually think they, and makers of other similar coffee makers, should do that as a matter of course to encourage people to use those instead of the disposable pods. But that's another rant for another time.)I'm also a little salty at Amazon for not giving any indication that the product had changed in a vital way. I would have sworn that in similar instances, if you click on a previously purchased item, it takes you to the old, no-longer-available item, with options at the top for similar items to consider. If that had happened this time, it would have saved me some aggravation because I either would have gone ahead with this purchase PLUS some of the new cups, or (more likely) I would've found a different model that still used the old cups.By the way, a tip for anyone else in this situation, in a pinch: I had one reusable Kcup whose lid had come off, so I used that in the new machine, lidless. Coffee turned out fine!"
"Keurig is always hit or miss for me, and this one is the second. Not too surprising for its low price point, but it works, gave me coffee for the month I needed it and will come home and be used in my office. It does have the newer muti-stream brewing technology, but build quality, materials, and fit & finish isn't its best. Thnx!"
"Had this for almost exactly 2 years.  We used it MAYBE 20 times during that period.  I would have been happy if it was 2 years and used regularly, but it died with minimal use.  Got a burned wires smell and then it popped our breakers.  Disappointing considering the light use it got."
"I have had many Keurig’s, they don’t seem to last. I do drink a lot of coffee but these Keurig’s are not cheap and should last longer. This model is my most recent Keurig I purchased and it will be my last. Because I drink a lot of coffee, I can’t afford to purchase Keurig compatible brand of k cup. I chose this coffee maker because I don’t need all the options some of the makers have and I liked that this was skinny and didn’t take a lot of room on my counters. In that sense thus was perfect for what I needed. I use the Amazon brand of coffee, which I love. I’m on the auto shipment program with this but I had run out and needed to purchase a box of k cups from my local grocery store to get me through until my shipment from Amazon came. I purchased a box of off brand I guess you would call it, as soon as I started using it, something was wrong. Only water was coming out in different spots from where the k cup actually sits. When it was finished brewing I had a cup of very light brown colored water. It was so weak. This kept happening so I thought well maybe it’s just this brand, so when my Amazon brand came that I had been using since I got this coffee maker, I tried it and the same thing was happening. So, I cleaned all the needles thinking coffee grounds were clogging up the needles. I then trued it again, same thing, water sprayed out from several different areas, so I called Keurig. Here’s what I was told, you have to use the Keurig compatible k cups. There’s nothing else wrong with the machine, you just need to buy Keurig compatible k cups, which, like I said, are unaffordable to me. I didn’t believe the customer service worker but I went and purchased Keurig compatible k cups and guess what? It worked just fine. I put an Amazon brand back in and it was water again, back to the Keurig k cup and it worked. So, in order for this machine yo work correctly I can only use their brand or a brand that’s compatible. I’m sorry but I don’t want to own a coffee maker that the company is going to tell me what brand I have to use. The problem was when you shut the lid where the k cup goes in, with the non Keurig brand, it wasn’t shutting tight to push down on the k cup to brew right, so when I make a cup of coffee now I have to stand there and hold down the lid tight so it brews coffee and not water. I’ve been doing this for months now and I’m getting tired of doing this so I just ordered a new coffee maker and no, it’s not a Keurig. I will never purchase a Keurig again! When I receive my new one, this one is going right in the garbage. If I could afford Keurig compatible coffee I still wouldn’t purchase it. I don’t like that I have to use their products, which is way to expensive for me, in order yo get this to brew right. I did think maybe it was just this machine but after speaking with a few different people that have Keurig’s, they said the same thing about their Keurig not working right, it did the same exact thing. I’m a review reader when making a purchase, I read the reviews on the brand I just ordered and it’s not only cheaper but it has mostly 5 stars and no major complaints.. Maybe not everybody has had this problem with this coffee maker and that’s great but if you purchase one and it starts spraying water that’s not going through the k cup itself, if you read my review, you will know why."
I had to return the first one and the second one is now starting to put grounds all in the top. I don't like it as much as my Keurig compact that I had but those are too expensive now
"Old black Koenig died and I ordered this red slim one. Wife loves it, appearance wise. But coffee doesn’t taste as good, I think it’s because the water doesn’t seem to get as hot as the older model"
This model did not come with the water filter or reusable cups. Plan on spending another $25-$30 dollars for the accessories. Was not clearly stated in the description.
"Plastic made of looks cheap and discolored, not a bright red as displayed in the picture."
"I purchased this same coffee make approximately 3 yrs. ago.  It was maintained and cleaned on a regular basis, but all of a sudden the top closing down on the pod would not lock down.  I held it down probably for 4 most., then it didn't stay down and work at all.  I have a very small kitchen and limited counter space.  After shopping around, this purchase was my only choice.  I am hoping this company has made appropriate improvements."
"I gave a 3 because I bought one of these a year ago, and it already stopped working. I am trying this one more time and if it doesn’t last more than a year, I’m done with Keurig. I like the machine a lot for making a cup of coffee, but after following all directions it still quit, so I question the reliability & quality of this product. If you buy this product, I would suggest also getting the Amazon warranty. I unfortunately did not."
this takes up less counter space than my last keurig but i really miss my old water reserve.  it was on the side and held much more water. i have to fill this tank after 2 cups of coffee.  it may heat the water faster but it doesn't make my coffee any faster than the last machine i had.
You need good counter space for this maker.
"Just coming up on the three year anniversary in two weeks, and the machine has not been working properly for about a month. Just descaled it and went through the needle cleaning process with a phone rep. the 12 oz. setting produces 8 oz. The 10 oz. setting produced about 6 oz."
"It stopped working in less than a year!  So bummed.  It was in our workplace break room, so maybe just got overused!  Was great while it lasted though!  I have one of the original single brew Keurigs at home...still going strong!"
Slim design and got this for my mom who lives alone.UPDATE - got the same one for single daughter. Hers leaked under the water canister. Returned that one. The issue is the plate under the canister is flat and the o-ring must have been seated too low to keep water from leaking. I don't care for this slim design and ordered a more traditional Keurig machine for daughter. I am heading to my mother's to see if she has the same issue but I already got rid of the packaging
Could not use the single k cup pod holder . It was a gift and I was highly upset and embarrassed. The date to return the Keurig Coffee Maker has has expired.  How do you handle that?
"...just is what it is... my last Keurig was a Supreme, which lasted me for several years.  I should have just repurchased another Supreme, but I thought to save about $50 bucks to buy this one.I HATE that the water jug is behind the unit, because my older age and mobility makes it more difficult to turn around and to refill... or to even try to just remove the cap to add some extra water, while it is still in-place!I HATE that the water jug is so small, that it needs to be refilled every three cups (10-ounce cups).I HATE that there isn't a button to push for a BOLDER cup (slows the coffee going through the head of the machine).  The COMPANY must have paid their Engineering Department for the extra cost to have this already existing feature REMOVED from the card that was already designed for the Supreme machine, just to be able to justify the lower price point on this model... how stupid!That'll teach me to make a change, like this, just to save a few bucks in retirement!!!"
"I've had Keurigs for years now. When my last one broke I replaced it with this one. In a nutshell, this one stinks. If you pour water into the tank while the top where the pods go is open, it leaks A LOT. The amount of coffee fluctuates  no matter what size cup you want to brew. Like all Keurigs, it needed to be descaled in less than a month. I've had  Keurigs die after I descaled them. Even though I love my cuppa made with a Keurig, I do have to say that all the machines break down quickly and they all seem to use different (removable) filter cups. That being said, I'll always have a Keurig in my kitchen."
"I love the Keurig but we bought it in April 2024 but it was broken by October. It started leaking, after descaling it. Too short lived."
This coffee maker had coffee on it. So it looks like it’s used. Is it possible that it was refurbished and not cleaned up afterward?
Suddenly stopped powering on. My original keurig lasted 11 years. Bummed that they don’t make things as well as they used to.
Just arrived and the white product has a black cord. Looks terrible. Don’t know if it even works yet.
"Update: Keurig replaced unit under warranty but this one had other problems, too frustrating to get into but I wanted to edit with a crucial warning and the most important if you want to drink “coffee” and not weak, coffee flavored water. This unit is supposed to make 8, 10 and 12 oz cup of coffee. However though the amount of water is variable, the amount of coffee is not. So 8, 10, 12 oz of water filter down through the one size pod. When I asked Keurig about this flaw I was told that the amount of caffeine is the same. What? Don’t most of us want flavorful cup of coffee, not just a weak, diluted cup. This unit has too many issues to count but not the least of which is a complete waste of money. I’m past the return window so if you get a unit that doesn’t hold up to expectations and you miss the window beware!Back to my search, so if anyone knows of a small footprint coffee maker that makes a decent cup of coffee please advise!My unit started malfunctioning just days past return window. Amazon would not honor the return after the strict date. I was told to contact manufacturer who informed me that even after troubleshooting did not fix the issue they could not refund if I purchased from Amazon. They offered to replace but I didn’t want to chance that it was a design flaw and I’d experience same problem with another unit. One would expect it to last more than 3 months and expect to be able to returnable if the system is bad.Five stars for size, 3 for quality of coffee and less for the cost of time, money spent and hassle to remedy!"
"The only small problem with  Keurig coffee for me is that I really don’t like the coffee it produces.  It's amazingly convenient.  I use Peet's coffee cartridges but even with a premium coffee, the coffee tastes like cardboard.  I know some people like the coffee so the is a personal problem."
I have another keurig machine that I’ve been using for a longer period of time and it’s still working fine. This one was barely used during the time I’ve owned it and it already died after a few uses.
"The compact design is nice.  It takes up very little counter space which is nice, however, it is cheaply made with low quality plastic.  The reservoir truly only holds only enough water for 1 cup of coffee, so unless you don't mind refilling with every cup of coffee you make, it's not very convenient. I have made several cups of coffee and the K-cups have exploded a few times resulting in a big mess.  Overall, for the price it is okay, but I likely wouldn't purchase again.  I decided to order a Keurig to replace this.  I am going to keep it though. It will be handy to take along when we go camping or even a back up should my Keurig bite the dust.  For the price, it isn't a bad deal at all."
"I love this: simple to use, makes great coffee very fast, and the slim model doesn’t take up much counter space. I love it so much I bought a second identical one when the first one died after a year and a half. I hope the new one lasts longer! If you look inside the casing, there are lots of tubes, switches, sensors, and electronics—lots to go wrong. In my case, the “add water” sensor didn’t trigger during the descaling process, and it overheated. If it overheats, the thermostat switches off. One of the ways they got the retail price point below $100 is by eliminating the external reset button, so if it overheats, you have to find the YouTube video on how to disassemble it to get to the thermostat and reset it with a paper clip. I did this successfully, taking less than an hour.  But then, two weeks later, the lid switch failed, and it was too complicated to replace it, so I ordered another one with 2-day free delivery.  For the new one, I will take care to stop it before it overheats during descaling and hope I can get a few years out of it.  As much as I love it, I can’t give it 5 stars because of this, and I hope you will find this review helpful."
"Haven’t even had it a year and it’s done. The descaling light has been on for a while now so I broke down and bought the solution to descale it. Followed the directions and after the first round it started smoking and shut off. Was supposed to rest 30 minutes and then go through a rinse cycle but it never turned on again. After googling, turns out others had same issue and it required taking it apart to reset a heating element or something?!? No thank you. Bought a new one. Just won’t descale it I guess."
Love the quick coffee but have to “descale” too often.  Only 1-2 cups made per day & it seems to require descale every 2 mos.
"I purchased this to replace an older Keurig coffee maker I'd had for years.After 30 days, I have buyer's remorse for the following reasons:> No brew strengths or temperature control. Coffee often comes out tepid.> Doesn't come with a water filter kit (that's an add-on).> About 1 out of every 10 pods explodes and gets grounds everywhere inside the machine (even if you vent the pods by manually releasing the vacuum sealed air pressure). Due to the location of the buttons, there is no way to easily rinse out the grounds without getting electronic components wet. The only effective means I've found to clean up the mess is to open up the hatch, pull out the internals and rinse them out separately and  then let the grounds dry and vacuum them out or brush them out with a little paint brush. Just what you want to be doing first thing in the AM before work.> All of the old reusable pods I had for my older Keurig do not function in this model. This model uses the ""multi-stream"" pods. I plopped down the money for one of the Keurig branded ""universal reusable filters"" and that thing is the biggest hassle to load and clean and STILL makes mediocre coffee, no matter the roast or grind.The older refillable pods are simply a cup with a lid that flips up at the top, which was easy to clean and dispensed coffee like the disposable K-Cups.The ""multi-stream"" has 4 separate pieces you have to disassemble every time you want to use it. You also need to remove an integral part of the machine (the filter holder) and swap it out with an adapter to use refillable pods. If you want to use disposable pods again you need to swap this part back out. Every time. It's a brittle plastic piece that snaps in and out, and looks prone to breakage. The whole operation is a nightmare and makes the refillable pods a pain in the arse to clean.> To top off all of this hassle, the coffee tastes mediocre. It could be $20-a-box of disposable K-cups, with filtered water... Or you could ignore my advice and and buy the proprietary plastic adapter and lovingly load your own pods with the finest recently roasted single-origin beans ground to a medium-fine with your burr grinder... and it will still taste like plasticky, sour gas station coffee.Not all Keurig models have these issues. It's nice that the K-Slim doesn't take up as much counter space as my older model. I wanted something that was convenient with no hassles: Pop in a pod, hit the button have a decent cup of coffee. The K-Slim does not fill that role."
I know the color isn’t really that important but when you’re expecting “scarlet” red and it’s more like orange/clay red…
We called product support and 30 mi utes later had a new machine sent to us. It arrived in 3 days with a new one year warranty and we are hopeful this one will last longer. Reallyimpressed with their responsiveness. We bought our second Keurig October of 2023. It stopped working today. Really disappointed it stopped. Reaching out to support to see what can be done.
So I ordered my first Keurig machine after years of brewing differently. I just wanted something simple. It arrived and was absolutely wonderful. I knew that the water storage was not very big but I was okay with it. I used it for about 3 months. When I went to brew a cup I heard a winding up noise like it was going to blast off. Luckily it did not but also it did not work after that. So me being me and not wanting to put much into it looked at the manual to make sure I was doing everything correct and I was. I went to another site and ordered the same model for just a little bit cheaper. I must say I was a bit irked with something that just worked for 3 months. I really was addicted to it. I saw a number on the description and details of what I purchased from Amazon in November 2022. It had a link to press for support. What was even better is that there was a phone number to call. I am like most people and like to find the information myself many times getting frustrated. I called the Keurig support number and they answered within 1 minute. I spent no more than 5 minutes on the call where I was told it was under warranty and it would be replaced. They sent me an email for some pictures and a receipt. My new machine will be arriving very soon. So before you Chuck the machine in the garbage and waste more money make a simple phone call and hopefully you will have the results I did. I am still giving it a rating of three because of the technical issues.
"I bought this coffee maker in February and really liked.  I works great, the reservoir is nicely sized, it comes on and is ready to go in short order.  Then in May, the descale light came on.  I got some descaler compound and went to work following the instructions in the manual.  It was a three-step process.  Steps 1 and 2 seemed to go fine, but then it shut down and would not restart.  It would not power on.  I contacted Keurig and they said it was defective and would send a new one in up to 10 business days.  That means I am without the coffee maker for two weeks.  (Amazon would have it to me the next day, but this is Keurig.). Well, I did like it.  I will be hesitant to run the descaling system on the replacement."
"Likes:  Compact = saves counter space  No preheating of water necessary - instant on - saves energy & fast to use  Shuts off after a few minutes - saves energy  Easy to fill  Clean ""no fuss"" designDislikes:  The water reservoir holds an odd amount of water - 46 oz, enough for three 12 oz cups with 10 oz left over. Couldn't they make it a tiny bit bigger so you could 4 full 12 oz cups? 46 oz is such a weird amount, anyway. Five 8 oz cups is 40 oz, four 10 oz cups is 40 oz,  three 12 oz cups is 36 oz. So why 46 oz? Just two ounces bigger and you'd be able to get six 8 oz cups or four 12 oz cups before refilling.  When open, the lid handle is just a little too tall to allow it to be fully opened under the upper cabinets. As a result, the machine needs to sit further from the wall than I'd prefer so the lid handle will open in front of the cabinets instead of under them.  Making sure the machine would sit back far enough on the counter was one of my primary concerns prior to purchase. I actually looked for this exact information before buying the machine so I could be sure the machine would fit. Somehow thought I read the height as 16.78"" which would have been fine but it's actually over 17"". Keurig site states height open is 17.28"". Unfortunately, my cabinets hang at 17"" even. I don't know what information I looked at before buying but it was wrong. My mistake, for sure, but still annoys me every time I use the machine.Undecided:  This machine punches five holes in the top of the K-cup. As a result, the brew is a little stronger than with my classic machine. Not sure if I like this or not."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This Keurig has been a piece of crap since it arrived!  This is the 2nd K-Slim purchased since June '24.  I used the first one for 2 months when I was staying with family in the states (purchased at Walmart)... and it worked fine.  I carried it with me, carefully packed in the original packing in my luggage for the plane ride - and when I got home it did this.  Purchased THIS one on Amazon, and have only been using it for a little over 2 WEEKS - and it's doing the same thing!  It doesn't do it every time, but it's a pain to have to try to get a full cup of coffee out of it every morning!  I would NOT recommend purchasing this model... maybe a different model would work better?"
"I bought one 8 month ago It was ok but after a few month when I was making a coffee smell of coffee start to low smell. I changed the coffee brand every month but it was lower and lower last month the Descale light turned on and never off. I cleaned it with white vinegar and keurig kit every morning, I used 2 gallon white vinegar and 2 kits but, doesn't work. Unfortunately I didn't buy a protection plan.I will buy a good one from another brand. I hope I can help to people for find a great coffee maker and not stop enjoying from drinking coffee.Hit Descale."
"I bought this unit to replace an older one and for ~$70 it's still pretty solid. There have been some design changes in the years since I bought my last one which is to be expected. Unfortunately my unit's lid does not close down all the way when a k-cup is in the pod holder so I have to manually hold the lid down to make sure the brewing process isn't interrupted.I'm not sure if this is an issue present in newer models or if it's just my specific unit that has the problem. It's a slight annoyance but I just hold the lid down while brewing and haven't run into any issues since I started doing that. I haven't had this unit for very long though, so time will tell if this becomes a bigger issue or if more issues pop up.EDIT: Holding down the lid while brewing no longer guaranteed the brew would finish. It went from a minor annoyance to a moderate/major one. I returned this and will purchase a different machine/brand. My old one was great for the years that I had it. The replacement I purchased did not work as well and was unfortunately not as great."
"I initially purchased the Keurig Single Cup Brewer for my Airbnb guests, and it served its purpose for the first year. After transitioning it for personal use, I noticed consistent issues with splattering every time a cup was brewed, making cleanup a constant hassle.The final straw came when the machine randomly stopped working after two years of use. For a premium brand like Keurig, I expected much better longevity and reliability. While it started strong, the overall experience left me disappointed, and I won’t be recommending this model to others.Save yourself the frustration and consider other options!"
"I  like the way the K- cups load and the way it brews.  If you have traditional  cupboards you have to pull the Machine forward and sideways  to get the water tank out to fill,  then slide it back.  Great idea but I wont buy this model again.  The switch stopped working on the one I had and they can't be repaired so it only lasted 2  years' so that was 75 $ a year just to brew and then the coffee is more."
"Good brand, not sorry good product.  Took 31 days to break. Go figure. 1 day past return stage. The togel under the water resivore gets stuck and prevents the add water light to go off enabling a great brew.  Unless u play with it w your finger, it won't brew and the light won't go off.  Gross right?  Also, there is a slight white crust that's caused by the water in the plastic resivore.  Uck.  Not worth the sale price. Sorry, I do not recommend.  Do not buy this product. Doesn't work well.  Cannot return"
"The machine was pretty cheap - it lasted a couple of years.  Called product ""service"" at Keurig tonight - as it stopped working.  The only good thing I can say is that a human answered the phone.  The first person I spoke with had great difficulty communicating (and did not seem to understand a phone number has 10 digits with an area code) - I ended up hanging up and calling back it was so bad.  The second person I spoke with (at Keurig) spent a laborious amount of time getting my name, e-mail, phone number, serial number, date of purchase... only to tell me the coffee maker was broken (with no actual tips to try to help me fix it) and I needed to buy a new one.  Some support..."
"I purchased this K-Slim in Oct 2022. In Sept 2023 the machine just powered off in the middle of a descaling process. Keurig had excellent customer service and was able to ship me a brand new replacement in under 5 business days to replace the original as it was still under warranty. Today, Oct 1 2024 the replacement has stopped working in the middle of the descaling process. As this was already a replacement I doubt that they will ship me another K-Slim. I had the big bulky Keurig for 6 years without a single issue! I just wanted to upgrade and I wish I’d kept my old one. Going to try the K-mini as it’s on sale right now but I will NOT be spending another $100+ on a Keurig machine again."
"Got this for my parents... I feel like it's a novel product but not worth it unless you really like gadgets.My parents drink instant and it's as simple as loading up our tea kettle and waiting for the water. This on the other hand, is also simple but comes with the caveat of maintenance and potential break downs.I just got it, works okay unlike others who have it dead on arrival. But the coffee/water does not come out in a consistent stream. It is brand new so it isn't dirty, I believe it's just like this for some reason. Also there are other minor annoyances like having to empty out the water tank? You apparently shouldn't leave water inside, which is already a huge downside to my parents instant coffee method. The water tank is in a VERY inconvenient place, at the back. We put this on our counter under the cabinets (no other place to put) and it's very annoying having to pull the whole machine out to grab the flimsy water tank with no real handles.One other serious complaint is the temperature of water. It is also inconsistent. If I use it straight away, it'll give me my water, it's warm but not very hot as you want it. I brewed a second cup that did come out very hot... Not happy with the inconsistent temp. It should just wait to brew my coffee if it isn't as hot as it should be.The things I do like will just contradict what I don't like... I think there's a lot to love here, but just wait for a sale please, I feel like a lot of people will just throw that money down the drain... These aren't that great, trust me, don't buy into the pressure. The bad, ever so sightly outweighs the good."
"The product is not that bad but I had a problem with the descaling light which would not shut off after I descaled, and cleaned it. So I called the seller and he told me to press the 8 and 12 oz. buttons, but did not work so he offered me a replacement and I didn't have to return the one that I had. All I had to do was send through their Email the proof of purchase, with the date of purchase price, serial number and who I purchased it from, which I did, and then I received an Email from them that it wasn't valid, so they didn't keep their word. So I purchase another brand from Walmart which turned out to be a better coffee maker. Do not trust this seller. he would look for any excuse so as not to return a refund or replacement. I would have given it a 4 star rating if the seller would have been more honest and kept his word. The coffee maker is not that bad but there are better ones in Walmart."
I had a full size Keurig for over 10 years and never had one issue with it.The original one finally quit working so I bought the slim model.  The slim model when you push the brew button sometimes it'll start sometimes it won't.Now about every other cup it keeps telling me I need to add water?I have tried all the troubleshooting suggestions on the website and it still continues to do the same thing!?Now I'm out of the return window!!
"I hate that I can not find reusable plastic pods that fit the coffee maker. I have purchased k cup one and it is too big. I can not close the lid. Pretty disappointed. My last keurig was able to use even generic pods to make coffee, I hate using paper and do not like the waste from real keurig pods. They are not recyclable. I would have returned the machine had I realized before I used it:("
"I really like the space saver and convenience, unfortunately all the sudden stop working."
The coffee drips out slowly doesn’t come out nicely like a normal flow
Love the product but it just stopped brewing 4 ounces at most and also has coffee grinds mixed in.I did all the testing with Keurig and google and it just stopped working.  Now i have to order another and hope it lasts more than 1.5 years or I will find another coffee machine brand to  use.  Ridiculous that it does not last long at all anymore.
"I’ve been a Keurig fan for many years. We first bought this model one year ago for our vacation home. It is used only occasionally during the summer by a small family. The rest of the year it just sat on the counter. When we opened up the house in spring, the Keurig would not work and emitted a burning smell. We had to ditch it and buy another one. I expected the appliance till last more than eight months with occasional use."
Despite not what I expected. But did not return.
Water lid is not well aligned. The 10oz button is already bent down not sure if you can tell by the pics but my last keurig is was 100 straight and got bent down over time.the bottle cup holder has a gap.. not sure if it's defective or it has been used.
"It quit working after two months.  And would not turn on.  I had to remove the case, and reset the thermostat. See picture. Round component you can see it from the side when the case is removed.  Insert paperclip, you can feel/ hear a tiny click.  It should then work."
Worked great until the Descaling button started blinking. I descaled exactly as directions suggested… Keurig turned off after the process and never turned back on. I read other reviews that this happened to them also. I think it overheats the system. Keurig needs to do something about this.
Used this for 2 months then left for the summer. We just got back for the winter and plugged it in.  The power light came on and when it started up it shut off and won’t restate. I had read that others experienced the same issue after the machine sat for awhile. Its a piece of trash now.
"We did all of the right things- Filtered water, descaling regularly- but this coffee maker still gave up the ghost after less than a year of light use.  This was our third Keurig machine and none have lasted very long.  My advice?  Buy the cheapest one you can get because you'll probably need to replace it in 12-18 months!As for the taste of the coffee, couldn't really tell any difference from the last machine.  It brews a decent cup if you just want a good cup of coffee and aren't an aficionado."
My husband and I have a retro kitchen and red is basically the go to color.  It is a nice piece but the body was more of a dark pink instead of red.  It stood out like a sore thumb.
"Love a Keurig but every one that I have purchased since 2020 for myself and others have failed at around a year.  Luckily, I kept my older one which works great.  Maybe it’s just the slim ones…."
I never leave reviews but feel compelled to warn consumers about this product. We got our first one and it quit working within about a month. Got a replacement and now less than a year later that one has also quit working. This is the third Keurig we have bought that has lasted less than a year.
"Bought this Sept 2023, first couple times of descaling went fine but last month when I did it the descale light will not go off. I’ve tried everything. I don’t want to wait for it to not work for me one morning, so unfortunately this one will go in the trash."
"We're on our second Keurig K-Slim after having replaced the first unit, which was defective. About the first unit: It just stopped making coffee.  The lights would come on, it would make a little noise, but nothing else happened. Calling the Keurig support line is a complete waste of time.  After several hours on hold I was told, among other things to ""make sure the coffee maker is the only device on the electrical circuit."" Yeah, that's not going to happen; the coffee maker's gonna have to get along with my blender.In the thee weeks it took to receive the replacement brewer I was bombarded with spam offers from Keurig. Daily, messages arrived encouraging me to sign up for this-or-that recurring order service or buy cases of their over-priced pods. Each message a not-so-subtle reminder of their crappy quality control and terrible customer service. How about you send me a working brewer and then we can talk about me spending more money with Keurig?The replacement brewer arrived and I've been using it but the fun and excitement has certainly worn off. It's fine.  Is worth 80 bucks? Not really but it's nice I can brew a cup of coffee anytime I want. Is it going to break again? Probably. I have no faith. I'm not buying cases of pods; not getting stuck with a bunch of pods I can't use when it breaks again. Would I buy it again?  I might; I'm a slow learner and frequently make the same mistakes.Yes, I'm a little butt-hurt over it. The brewer you get might just work fine, you'll buy cases of pods and life will be good. Don't worry about me; I'll be fine. It did brew a good cup of coffee this morning."
This coffee maker is slower than most keric coffee makers. Also it does not give u the same amount of liquid every time.
After only 2 months the descale light went on only making 2 cups a day.  Tried following the instructions to descale.  Did it 6 times.  Descale light will not go off.  Tried resetting the the coffee maker...didn't work.  Won't buy a kuerig again.
"I had been drinking nespresso every day for several years and loved it but the maker started malfunctioning. So I decided to buy a new coffee maker but the Nespressos had gone up in price. The keurig K Slim was on sale so I decided to try it. First thing I noticed was the smallest cup was 8 oz. I was used to having 2 lungo espressos each morning. The K cup 8 oz brew is just too weak for me. I’ve tried at least 3 brands of dark roast cups and can’t get it strong enough. I tried shutting it off before it completes the full brew but it really doesn’t put out the full flavor. Some of the keurigs have a 4 oz option and/or a Strong Brew option but not on the Slim. Wish I had noticed that. It’s too late to return it now. I’m satisfied with the looks, space on the counter and water tank."
"This version Keurig missed the mark putting the water reservoir in the back.  It's awkward to remove, fill, replace the small water container.  Looks odd to me. Doesn't come with charcoal filter holder.  Seems they cut to many corners with this model."
"The way the water/coffee drips out of the machine it gets coffee spots all over the counter after each use. I guess not a big deal if you have a bar mat or don’t mind wiping up coffee drips after each morning or whenever you use it. Or you could buy tall coffee glasses which I don’t like.Additionally, the location of the reservoir in the rear makes it a little odd when wanting to refill with water - that is if you plan on having the coffee maker pushed all the way up against your wall. You can absolutely just pull the maker out from wall and remove/refill/replace but just seems like it will be daunting over time.Also, 12 oz of coffee is not 12 oz’s. After brewing this morning (first use and 3 cups of coffee I decided to measure because my 12 oz cup was not close to full) it was not even 10oz’s of coffee for the 12 oz setting.  More like 9.25 ounces.I’m returning not because of the reservoir location but just because I don’t feel like cleaning coffee after each use and that it didn’t brew the the full cup of coffee that I want each morning.It does work and it does brew coffee and the coffee tasted pretty good hence the 3 stars."
"Looks good, makes a decent cup of coffee. But it isn’t hot enough. The coffee is warm enough for the first few sips but cools quickly. I even use a pre heated coffee cup. I fill it with hot water then microwave for a minute to make sure it isn’t the cup being to cool.When I make coffee the regular way I use a Areopress my coffee is almost too hot to sip for a minute or two.Not happy with purchase and would not recommend. I will be calling customer service"
"We had a Keurig 2.0 for a decade before it finally died with occasional issues toward the end of its life. We bought this as a replacement machine and we're very disappointed with the quality. We've had this machine for six weeks and it has stopped working fairly consistently. We've had to clean the needles, run Keurig cleansing pods, and Descale. We never know when it will just stop working and need attention when you just want a simple cup of coffee. Keurig has been in the market for 20 years, and you'd think they would have improved on some common issues with their machines. This one is much worse than the old machine from a decade ago!If this had started within the Amazon return window, we just would have shipped this piece of junk back and been done with it. We have to work with Keurig warranty now because we're outside the Amazon return window, but it's a scandal this is happening only 6 weeks after purchase. I would go with a more expensive Keurig option and skip the Slim or any other Keurig model under $100."
"I got this unit because of its size, color, and Keurig reputation. The ""descale"" light never goes off, even right after I clean it. I have discovered I can still brew coffee, with pushing the buttons the right way, but I think the light should go off. Is there something I can do? I feel like a Keurig should be better than that."
"As the headline says, this worked well for about 2 and a half months before it started having issues with brewing. It will, approximately 75% of the time, start leaking from the top of the kcup when brewing. The top foil of the kcup seems to burst, and the hot water spills out the top of it, and then down through the top of the machine, bypassing the kcup and watering down whatever it is I'm making. I've done a good amount of researching and troubleshooting myself, and nothing that anyone says should help does. I clean and clear the needles, top and bottom. I run 2 full flushes. I only use official kcups. Nothing seems to matter, it still just ruptures the kcups and leaks. And of course Keurig doesn't actually sell any *real* spare parts for these, only reservoirs and drip pans, and all the offbrand spare parts that *might* fix the problem (the gasket around the needles) are all reviewed awfully.Honestly, If I was buying a keurig again, I'd buy one of the slightly larger ones that has the 'standard' top needle bits rather than this one, which seems to be the only model that does it this way. At least then when it breaks, you can find decent replacement parts."
It's ok hope it last a little more then last one.
Small parts loosened and it quit after a few months
Not able to use regular filter cup.
"I have purchased Keurig coffee makers many times for myself and for others.  This maker was NOT complete. the part that filters your coffee is a additional purchase  and you don't know this until you buy the pot.I called the company thinking the part was missing, I was told it was a separate purchase ($17.00 more). and would I like to buy it or use the pot without the filter!  I will NEVER buy a Keurig coffee maker againI feel the company is falsely advertising!"
"I've owned 2 Keurig K Supreme machines over the past 12 years and have been very pleased with them. The Supreme machines are heavier and solid, they're easy to maintain.  Most importantly, they brew a great cup of coffee quickly with no fuss, muss or backtalk.  With proper care, they work beautifully for 10+ years.  My current K Supreme Plus was mistakenly put into storage during a move so I purchased this smaller model until I can go retrieve my big machine in the spring.This model is all plastic and feels very flimsy when closing the top.  It makes decent coffee but doesn't feel durable. After approx 6 weeks of daily use, 1 cup per day, this machine started making snap-cracking electrical sounds during the brew cycle. When I stepped near to listen, the machine suddenly erupted in fire and immediately was furiously burning and melting, giving off toxic fumes and threatening to ignite the cabinets above the machine.  Thankfully, I had a can of fire extinguisher in arm's reach and was able to quickly put out the fire.  If I had not been standing right there when it happened this incident could easily have resulted in a house fire.  The fumes from the burning/melting plastic were painful to  lungs and stunk up the house.  Cleaning up the charred, melted plastic was difficult and time consuming, the plastic had liquified and stuck to the countertop and the ceramic mug.There were no exposed wires or obvious problems that might have caused this fire. I have never in all of my decades of adulthood had any kitchen appliance start a fire.  I will stick with the higher end Keurig models but I would never buy or gift one of these little plastic models again."
Granted it lasted 8 months until the handle broke. Tasted ok but really liked the size. Descaled several times but the light is still on. But to put a claim on the warranty it is hard to do since Keurig wants an order/ delivery confirmation which Amazon provides the order details but not the delivery confirmation. Yes I got the email 9 months ago confirming delivery but I don't know if it will past muster from customer service.  The other paperwork that they require is not bad. Might buy my next Keurig from a  brick n mortar store. Might look at other brands.If it lasted longer I would give another star but not 5 stars
"Coffee isn't very hot, lid doesn't close completely. I have to hold it down while coffee is brewing. I may go back to the Keurig that I replaced this one with. I would not buy this particular one again."
brewed coffee not hot enough
"I bought this Keurig as a replacement for another Keurig Slim that had a lifespan of one year (purchased elsewhere). This unit, now 10 months old, is showing the same signs of failure that the other one did.  Perhaps it's a flaw in the manufacture of the units, but they do not last long. Buy something else"
"Twice now the maker broke after doing the descaling.  I followed the included instruction, but both times with the final „cleansing rinse“ the product turned off an would not turn on again.  There were puffing and hissing noises during the final rinse.I do hope this third machine will not do the same - I will switch brand if it happens again."
"This is my third Keurig.  I use these machines twice a day until they stop working.  Got this Keurig in April. I had company over yesterday and someone filled the reusable Keurig cups I use, put the cup in the machine , and pulled the handle down.  The machine was stuck in the closed position because both sides of the handle attachment broke.  Unfortunately it is too late to return this item.  I am so upset because I use  these machines for years, it is brand new, I can’t ask my visitor to replace it,  and the price has gone up since I purchased. My husband took off the broken handle and it is usable but the quality of this unit is not good.  Do not expect to have this machine for a long time compared to older versions…."
"I bought mine last December and it was awesome!  I love the slim fit because I don’t have a lot of counter space. So the size is perfect for me!  I use a travel mug and that was a selling point for me in that one could fit.BUT after about 6-7 months I started running into the difficulties I’ve seen on other reviews.  I’d get grounds in my coffee, and then it started brewing a partial (maybe 4 oz) cup.  (And I clean it after every use and also descale it as needed.). Anymore it takes two attempts to brew to get a full 12 oz cup.  I don’t like reusing the grounds so unfortunately this is wasting a lot of pods.  That adds up … $$$. 😟If Kuerig would fix the issues people are mentioning, this would be a perfect unit!!"
"First thing, I love how they designed a keurig that doesn’t take a lot of counter space. I’ve got so many different types that I can say this one is the best one for my kitchen. HOWEVER, I keep finding that it’s leaking somewhere and I can’t pinpoint where it’s coming from or why but I find water underneath it everyday and it’s getting quite annoying. I have to keep an eye on whatever I set next to it so it doesn’t ruin papers etc but if that wasn’t happening I’d give it five stars."
This product worked fine at first.  After 2 months it started slowing down.  4 months after purchase the product wont even power on.  Really disappointed.
"Bought it for the name and size to fit in our motorhome.  First one died in a year.  Second one died in a little more than a year.  They were nice enough to send a replacement after the second died, but I couldn't wait for the replacement and bought a Ninja with frother.  This is comparing what I had in the Keurig Slim to the Ninja PB051....same size footprint, but so much more than this.Keurig: COULD NOT FIT MY TRAVEL MUG under the drip.  Had to cut out the base, remove the tray and tilt the machine back each time to fit my very common and regular size travel mug.Ninja: Taller with removable tray which can adjust upward for smaller mugs.  My travel mug fits under the drip without a problem.Keurig: Cleaning.  Complicated process that I had to look up each time and press the right combination of buttons and repeat over and over and then power off, power on,....oh yeah, and they want you to buy their ""special"" cleaner to clean it.Ninja: Has a cleaning button.  Has a label that says to simply run some vinegar through it.  Simple. Cheap.Keurig: No simple way to run regular coffee ground through it.  Can purchase a tiny little container, but a pain to clean and fill.Ninja: Has a whole tray built into the side that simply pulls out and replaces the tray in the top where the k-cups can go.  Swap takes 5 seconds.Keurig: Only a couple buttons, but no real options other than size of brewNinja: More sizes, several brew variations including one to make ice-coffee.  Sweet!!!  Also shows the progress of the pour in a lighted scale.Ninja: Got the only with a frother built into the side that easily pops off for cleaning.  Made the wife really happy with that surprise.Keurig: NothingI have high hopes that the Ninja will last more than 1 year.  I know from experience that if the Keurig slim reaches 2 years old, you should hold a retirement party quickly.  Oh yeah, the Ninja is less money as well.UPDATE: A FEW WEEKS LATER.....-Hands down, the Ninja is better in every way.  Closing the lid is more gentle than the force required and the snap that occurs with the Keurig,-Wife is thrilled with the included frother on the Ninja.-Easier to see how much water in stored with the cylinder shape behind the Ninja than the Keurig.In short, Keurig has become complacent with using their name to sell old products and not try to make their items better. Just selling their name."
"Enjoyed a similar model for almost 1 year. When the descale light came on, I bought the solution, followed the instructions and began the process. The ""Add Water"" light was supposed to come on at the end (but didn't) so I proceeded to fill the reservoir with fresh water and then none of the buttons would work. It literally died. Threw it away and ordered another. Hopefully, this one will last longer. Never had a problem before this happened.UPDATEThis model did the EXACT SAME THING! Descaled and the machine died. It didn't last a year. I bought it in January, 2024 and it stopped working in October 2024.I did call Keurig support and they were very helpful. They are sending a replacement."
"The Keurig K-Slim Single Serve Coffee Maker with Multistream Technology falls short of expectations. While it promises convenience with its slim design and compatibility with various K-Cup pod sizes, its performance leaves much to be desired. The multistream technology, touted for ensuring a more flavorful brew, doesn't quite deliver on that promise; the coffee often comes out weaker than desired, lacking the boldness and richness I prefer. Moreover, the machine tends to be noisy during operation, which can be disruptive, especially in quiet environments. On top of this, the plastic construction feels flimsy and less durable than expected for a product in this price range. Overall, while it may appeal to those seeking a compact coffee maker, its performance and build quality could be significantly improved."
"Something is always wrong with it. I only use filtered water. I descale on schedule and hand wash the removable cup regularly. But still, something is always jammed or clogged or leaking. My first ever Keurig lasted me almost ten years. I’ve gone through three in the last two years. If I can’t fix the leak this final time, I’m done.Don’t waste your money. When it does work, it’s awesome. But it’s not worth the numerous, repeated issues."
"Really not your fault but we returned kurig to kurig  because the light came on to descale.  When we did this per their directions, the Keurig would not come back on. We sent it back. They sent us a new one. We used it when it was time to scale. The same thing happened again. They told us to send just serial number a picture of it, or name and address, and they would send us a new one. Evidently they’ve been having trouble with them because they had too many being returned and no place to put them, anyway, we are still waiting for the replacement to come and it’s been a month."
This coffeemaker hesitates  and I need to punch several times to make it drip.
I purchased this in Nov '23. The reason for the three stars is; the coffee maker did not come with a filter or the piece to add a filter.  I recently descaled as per the instructions and the descale light will not stop blinking.  Curious as to how long this will last.
"My two year old Keurig just quit. But I liked the convenience using refillable cups and it brewed well. The new design will not use the old design refillables so we had to buy new, expensive ones. Reminds me of the past when you bought a new phone you had to buy all new charging equipment. Plus the old one could be opened under the cupboards. This one we have to slide out."
Second time I used and smell like burn not sure why
"Ordered this as a replacement for our aging Keurig. Its no where as good as what we had with out larger one that we used for a few years. The drip has already clogged, and you cannot just descale to clean, the quantity (in ounces are off). Oh well... what else  can be said..."
"It brews an adequate cup of coffee.  The lighted switch doesn’t always indicate when power is on, but jiggling it a little will get it into a position where it will stay lit.  Even if the light is out, it continues to brew, so I’ll just make sure to unplug it every time I’m done making coffee.  Having a minor defect out of the box doesn’t instill confidence that it will last though."
"I knew that it didn’t have a timer and that’s OK but I did not know that it did not have a two hour shut off either. So I had a little bit of coffee left in the bottom of it and several hours later it had burned in the Pot. I am replacing it already and unfortunately, I threw all the stuff away so I can’t return it. If you’re OK with it, not having an automatic shut off it works well. I like that the water reservoir is easy to fill without getting water everywhere. I also like the basket not happen to have filters, but that automatic shut off is super important And it doesn’t have that."
"This little coffee maker worked fine, but only lasted 9 months until it stopped heating water.I expect greater longevity from an appliance."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I had a B&D 6 cup and broke the carafe. But replacing it was more than half the cost of a whole new machine. This is sad and probably because the tempered glass is the most expensive part.However, after searching I found the Elite Gourmet that was cheaper and smaller footprint than my B&D and any of the others I saw on Amazon. It had good reviews so I decided to get it.When it arrived everything looked good. I initially ran a pot of water through it and saw how fast it heated up. I was really surprised. I do like that this one has a warmer although I don’t really need it and it’s just one more thing if I forget to turn it off m, that I have to worry about burning. There’s is not safety cut off.But after I brewed the first pot of coffee I noticed that it was really short. My old one would be 1/2 cup off. So if I wanted 3 cups I had to put 3.5 cups of water. But with this one I have to put a full cup more than what is shown on the markers. Either someone doesn’t know how to measure or this thing evaporates a lot of water. See pics.Also the water brewing arm inside gets in the way if you have the pot and brew basket holder inserted at the same time. The little brew stopper spring (that is nice), keep the basket from sitting flush and the lid will not close (see video). You have to hold it down while closing the lid. This is a pain. It’s not a deal breaker but definitely loses a star. This is a $12 coffee pot at best. Not a $23 one. More thought and engineering should have went in to its design. Not sure about longevity, but we shall see."
"This isn't a 5 cup coffee maker, its more like 3 1/2 cups max.  It has 5 lines, I'm not sure what they measure.  It otherwise works fine, and is compact so I'm keeping it."
I didn't expect it to be so small
Disappointed overall. No autoshutoff. Hotplate recess and matching pot protrusion too large. Makes it difficult to get the pot in and out.
Doesn’t really make the hottest coffee but warm coffee is still good but it’s a 20$ coffee pot so you do get what ya get.
Getting the old grounds out of the wire basket is a little bit of a process.  I would have preferred a paper filter.
Purfect size for my house. Only one of us drinks coffee. Before this coffee maker we were throwing out half of what was made a day. Now I don't feel so wasteful.
Don't work for me
"It brews a good amount of tasty coffee for one person, but the machine is a little fussy to use. The brew basket has to be turned at just the right angle for the top to close properly. And the whole unit is so lightweight that you have to hold it steady with your other hand when you flip the on/off switch or put the carafe back under the machine. A little more weight in the base would have helped considerably."
"I mean it works and its cheap. But the physics of this tiny coffee maker means that 1. the little filter overflows a bit and you almost always get grounds in your coffee. 2. the pitcher design spills when your pour water into the machine and into the cup. This has been retired as an emergency backup and replaced with a large sized one.Basically they just made this without any testing or engineering to mitigate these obvious issues. You cant just shrink and cutify an appliance and expect it to work like a full sized, engineered one. Liquid physics is a thing."
It does the bare minimum job but nothing beyond that. It doesn’t have an auto shut off so it will burn the coffee when it gets to a certain point
"Although the item says it is a 5cup brewer, the final brewing yields only 4. This is rather misleading.  I guess that means to get a true 5 cups, we must order a 6 cup brewer?"
Glass carafe is not very durable. I've been careful setting it on my granite counter top and it hasn't broken yet .
Works fine. Two gray rubber feet missing. Took off the ones from old coffee maker and glued on. Too much trouble to repack and drive to return.
"This little coffee pot did not meet expectations, but I guess you get what you pay for. The lid never closed all the way and then after about a year it began to leak and sputter hot coffee on my counter, then it finally stopped working all together. I contacted the manufacturer who required so much red tape and proof of what happened that it just wasn't worth it. Manufacturer's warranty was still active. So think twice before purchasing this little coffee pot if you intend to use it for more than a year."
Nice price. Works. Made coffee.5 cups. NO. 2.5 cups
I did not like the way the carafe was difficult to remove from and returning it back to the warming plate.
"I like this coffee maker it makes the perfect amount of coffee for one person. The issues I have are that I have to turn it off when it's done. It doesn't have an auto off. Also, it leaks a bit when you pour it."
The wire mesh design holding the coffee grounds leaves a sludge-like residue in the carafe that I found unpleasant.A paper filter type would not have that residue. The carafe has to be precisely centered for the thing to drip; otherwise you get grounds in the coffee carafe.
"The reason I am only giving this a 2 star rating is, because... I feel like the description is misleading! I was expecting a 5 cup coffee maker... I measured it out... the 4 cup mark on the coffee pot is actually only about 2 cups in my measuring cup??? Although, it seems to brew coffee well... I just can't get over the fact that it is so tiny. I have to brew three pots of coffee... just to get the 5 cups this is advertised for... I am still a little confused by this."
"22oz last time I checked that's less than 3cups. I have a 40oz insulated travel cup. so, I though a 5cup coffee maker would be just right. imagine my surprise when I made a pot of coffee, and it only filled it halfway."
Got this last weekend when my old Hamilton Beach gave out. It's definitely different. I am finding myself still getting used to it. It had leaked all over my floor the first 3 times I used it but I think it was user error. It's working fine now. I do recommend using paper filters because the one it comes with leaks the grounds into the coffee. But other than that it's good for the price.
10 months later. It just SHORTED OT? 10 months later. Not acceptable. Probably just threw away that money? We'll see if they offer any remedy
"the Parts of usage, kind of cockide. Not as well designed Mr. Coffee."
Great for rental properties. Not expensive and easily replaceable.
"I only drink one cup of coffee per day and bought this little pot to get away from using pods.  For $20.00 it's definitely a ""you get what you pay for"" product.  Easy to use and clean, but very delicate and requires gentle handling.  The black coating on the warming plate is already coming up in places after only two uses.  That said, would recommend it for occasional use."
"First off, no automatic shut-off means that if you forget to actually shut it off, it will stay on and then you have burnt out mess at the bottom of the carafe, which is a pain to clean out. Second, the filter isnt great and there's a lot of residue/grounds that slip through which can be annoying. Cheap and still works but there are similarly priced and better options in my opinion."
"This product works and wasn't expensive. Love the included washable filter.  I should have read the dimensions better because it is only big enough for one person to have coffee (it's small!).  Thankfully, that works for me.  On the bonus , if you are in a Dorm this is probably perfect in terms of sizing.  For me, this product leaks while pouring no matter how firmly I hold the lid."
"The descriptions clearly states in the specs that this is a 40 oz liquid capacity coffee pot. It is not. It is about 25 oz max. I also says it is programmable in the specs, but then describes that it is not programmable later on, so at least that information is corrected. Did not care about the programmable part, but it is only about half the size advertised. Specs need to be corrected on listing. Seems to heat fine and run fine. Pouring from the pot seems to dribble a lot. Photo of coffee pot with measuring cup for scale and showing the total liquid that fits included."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            So I’ve had this coffee maker since November. In the beginning it was fine. It made basic coffee, just like I needed it to. BUT the coffee just does not get hot enough at ALL. I like my coffee at a temperature that I have to blow to cool it, this coffee comes out LUKEWARM. Also a month in, the coffee maker began to leak when I filled to the “3” cup line. It literally leaked all over my counter.Like many other reviewers mentioned, getting the coffee carafe on and off the hot plate is difficult. When placing it back on the hot plate you meet resistance from the filter above it which ultimately ends in the coffee spilling onto the hot plate or your hands.I’m not a big coffee drinker so I figured this would do the job, but even for me I think this could’ve been created better. I believe I bought it on sale, so honestly I got what I paid for. A cheaply made coffee maker for very basic use."
"Make sure you know its only a 5 cup coffee maker.  You have to scroll pretty far down to figure that.  The title would have been a good place to put that.It only has an on/off switch.  No automatic shut off.  So if you forget to turn it off when you leave the house, it could turn out bad.I was in a little bit of a hurry when I ordered this and should have waited until I had time to read the page fully.Its noisy. One of the noisiest ones I have ever heard.But it makes coffee!😊"
This coffee pot is awful and for reasons I never knew a coffee pot could have issues. If anything is on the burner the pot will not come off. The majority of the time I was yanking the coffee pot off and spilling coffee everywhere.The pot itself has a design flaw where if you use that to fill up the maker then expect water everywhere. For some reason the pour area is not long enough to pour in a straight line. Every morning I was cleaning up water.I threw it out in a month I was so annoyed my old coffee pot I had for five years never had either of these issues.
This coffee pot was the perfect size. It stopped working after 4 mths and doesn’t qualify for a replacement! Very disappointed!
This coffee maker is smaller and much lighter than I expected.
"THE PRIDUCT DESCRIPTION DIDN'T SAY HOW MANY CUPS THE MACHINE MAKES. I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO MAKE 5, BUT IF I PUT 5 CUPS OF WATER IN IT IT LEAKS ALL OVER MY COUNTER. I WILL BE REPLACING IT SOON WITH A BETTER COFFEE MAKER AND TOSSING THIS ONE."
This said this was a 4 serve and it's only 2. I was disappointed but it will do for now
This quit working after about 9 months .The burner wouldn't get hot any longer
"I received the coffee maker on June 15, 2023.  After one and half months, the glass carafe was broken.  I used the coffee maker every day and cleaned it gently. I didn’t know why the glass carafe was broken after one and half months. According to the warranty of 30 days from the purchase data, I should buy a new glass carafe. But it is a little weird that the glass carafe costs more than a new coffee make. In this case, who can buy the glass carafe. For anyone, it's an unpleasant shopping experience. Buy a coffee maker and just use it for one and half months."
poured in 4 cups water got just under a cup of coffee. where the heck did the water go? Not worth the time or energy to return.
"Elite Gourmet EHC-5055 Automatic 5-Cup Brew & Drip Coffee Maker with Pause N Serve ,This coffee maker paused alright and never started again. The thing stopped working after only 3 months and for the first month there was a plastic smell and after taste in my coffee . Dont let the name fool ya ,Elite Gourmet Coffee Maker is a low level product. I'm going with a Mr Coffee machine the extra couple of bucks is well worth it!"
This item had me drinking coffee trash. It was returned for that reason. It was used if I didn’t used it I wouldn’t know if it was working. I’m not a magician
The best feature I that I liked with this machine is the built in filter . What I didn’t like is that the water dispenser doesn’t quite measure up . To get a full cup of coffee I actually have to fill the water up to 3 cups indicator for the water . Besides that it’s a pretty basic machine .
Coffee maker plugs occasionally  when using . I have too completely empty out filled cup that does not drip into glass pot. I have owned many other brands but thus I e is not worth the mess.I should have returned it early on after it happened a few times  but  waited too long. Recommend do not buy this one!
"I liked it but thought it was overheating so I kept my eyes on it and cut it off as soon as it was done dripping because it would burn the coffee if I left it on even for 10 minutes. I decided to make due with it but after 5 months it completely quit working. It is really too small but like I said, I decided to make due. I would love it if it was a little bigger and it worked properly because I liked the basket that came with it and I could have stronger coffee when I chose as opposed to the Keurig  kind that is pre measured."
"It is smaller then what I had expected. If you are looking for a small pot, maybe to travel with, then this would be perfect. It is just too small for me. It works well though."
I liked this coffee pot for the short time it worked. Very sad it only lasted 4 months and just turned on and would no longer brew coffee. I guess you get what you pay for I was hoping it would last at least a year. So I ordered myself a Mr.Coffee maker which has always been my go to brand and I hope I have better luck this time around
"Good brewer and the ""good"" ends there.  It drips everywhere when pouring . No automatic shut off.  Hard to clean wet coffee grounds out the basket.  All and all, disappointing.  Annoying, but cheap enough that I can get rid of it - and buy something else.  Good Lesson!"
"Too small. It does NOT make the advertised  quantity of cups- unless one wants a teeny teacup of coffee. I consider a cup of coffee a normal sized mug/cup. Otherwise, it works, it makes water and ground coffee or tea, or..... into a hot liquid."
"This looks like a standard coffee maker in the listing, but it is only half the size of a standard coffee maker. CAUTION!"
Makes coffee fine but the carafe feels like you have to bust something when you remove it from the base or put it back in place to make coffee. Will probably just go with the $10 walmart model next time.
.... Basket for coffee grounds is somewhat small for regular filters.
This is a junky coffee pot...very light and tinsy feeling.
"After little more than a month of using this coffeemaker (ordered to replace my 6-7 year old one that wore out), I was very disappointed in this one.  I thought I was getting the exact same one as my worn out one  (which I loved) when I ordered but sadly it is not the same.  It is a 4-5 cup like I had but has a permanent filter which is most annoying to clean.  I was elated at first that I wouldn't have to buy, then bother to discard the used paper ones, but I found the paper filter was so much easier to just take out and toss.  With this one you have to pound on the bottom to dump in the garbage then have to rinse good to get rid of the coffee grounds left.  I was elated at first to get the permanent filter but give me the paper one any time!  The grounds stain the mesh basket. The coffee pot itself does not get sparkling clean as my old one, and I would use old one but it doesn't fit on the plate under the new basket.  I am most disappointed in this coffeemaker."
"It is a good small coffee machine except for the filter, filter holder, and no auto shutoff.The filter holder has to go into the coffee machine only in one way, and you need some light to see how it fits.  The whole body is dark brown or black, and it is hard to see how to fit the filter holder under a cabinet, and how to remove it.  It is a round filter holder, and I should be able to just drop in.  It does not work that way.  The notches have to match the coffee machine, or the lid won't close.  It is an unnecessary and complicated design.  The notches don't serve any purpose other than causing frustrations.Also, this coffee machine does not have an auto shutoff feature."
"I returned the first coffee maker because it stopped brewing after about 10 uses. and replaced it with the same one, which also stopped brewing. I'm again returning this one for a refund and going with a different brand."
Buyer Beware!  Only lasted 3 weeks.  Stopped heating completely after less than 20 uses.  Terrible product and very disappointed.  Will never buy this brand again and will forever avoid this seller.  Wasted my money.
"Pros : great for small spaces , keeps coffee hot, doesn’t take long to brewCons: not 5 (8oz) cups. It’s actually 3 cups despite what the label on the carafe says .Pouring can be tricky . I try to pour from high above the cup so water doesn’t spill.Also there are two holes in the back which prevents you from adding more water because it will leak out ."
"I purchased the product on October 25, 2024. The power light is on, but the heating element inside the machine isn't functioning, preventing the water from reaching the optimal brewing temperature. I need a new replacement now."
"The coffee leaks out from the sides messing up everything.. The filter is NOT filtering, the grinds are left in the coffee, may need to use a paper filter with?. The carafe is not leveled, so it looks like its tilting when you look from the bottom up. Overall, DO NOT waste your coins.Cheaply made plastic ."
"How on earth does this coffee maker have such high average ratings? They must have changed something recently that made it useless and defective.I ran it for the first time today with plain water only before making the first pot of coffee. Soon, steaming hot water was spraying all over the place, bubbling out from under the lid, and sizzling on the warming plate. Less than one cup of water actually made it into the glass carafe. The remaining 3 cups of water was all over the countertop. I scrambled to move nearby items so they did not get ruined.I can't return it because I tossed the original packaging.CHECK ALL THE RECENT ONE-STAR REVIEWS IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS COFFEE MAKER. OR JUST DON'T BUY IT. I'm going to buy a different brand of coffee maker to replace this defective mess."
Product was “ok” when I first got it. It worked but made a loud banging noise when it was brewing. Now 4 days later it completely stopped working! 🤦🏻‍♀️Update: Amazon sent me a new one… thought this one SMELLS awful! I did as the instructions say and only brewed water to rinse everything. The bottom platic was BURNING! The photo is after 1 pot of water!
Needs auto shut OFF
"No longer have to go out for coffee, should come with extra coffee filters"
It’s basically on or off. No features of any kind. Just be aware
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This thing exploded coffee ☕️ all over my counter tops and floors causing me to further exhaust myself after a 14 hour shift.😭So tired, so exhausted but still I had to go on and clean up  🧼 the mess and it not only burnt the coffee it did make but wasted my coffee grounds and water.My water is expensive here because it’s contaminated with PFOA and it hurt to waste so much on coffee that got thrown away.Cannot use or recommend. I regret throwing out the return box and now I can’t return it, and it doesn’t work !?!… it worked fine for a few days and tricked me.😩Now I still need to buy a coffee machine.Don’t waste your money, cheap but expensive in long run.***Malfunction seems to be that it stops filtering coffee and when I cleaned it later discovered that the coffee was accumulated and spilling from filter as well. Although it was also leaking somewhere from the bottom too. Anyways, not good 😤 not good at all!"
"PROS:  Although listed as a ""5 cup"" machine, that is only true if one remembers that cups of coffee are 6 ounces each, not 8.  On this machine perhaps even less.  But the real part to consider is that this coffeemaker is not programmable--one must push the button to turn it on and remember to push it again afterwards to turn it off or it will stay on the entire day.  CONS:  It does have the ""steal a cup"" feature which allows you to pull the pot out while the coffee is brewing so you can pour the first cup and not wait for the whole pot to fill.  And you won't have to buy filters as there is a washable mesh filter included."
Bought in Nov. 2023 and July 2024 it died. Light is on but nothing happens. I retried 3 times. It should last more than six or seven months.
I like the taste of the coffee I make better
"Since it loses water when brewing , it is hard to make a good mug of coffee. It is either too weak or too strong. I will get it right eventually."
"I like that this product does makes great coffee but, the size of this machine actually looks like a toy something you would buy for your child. It states in measurements that you could make 5 cups of coffee but in actuality it only makes one full cup of coffee."
Not quick and easy to use for elderly
"Got this pot to replace the one I had and I’m not satisfied with it. If one uses the reusable filter it limits the amount of coffee one can brew, if you use too much coffee grains to brew a good 5 cups of coffee, it’ll overflow and end up in the pot. Ended switching to disposable filters to accommodate for a good amount of coffee. Removing the pot can be tricky, not a smooth action. Lastly, to pour the coffee from the pot without it dripping one has to open the lid. It does maintain the coffee’s flavor but that’s the only good thing about it. Don’t really recommend."
I bought this coffee maker 6 months ago and awoke this morning to a coffee maker that would not work. I am now shopping for a different coffee maker. Would not recommend this coffee maker.
"I ordered this because it was the size I wanted. I used it a couple of times a week for about 3 months, then it stopped working. I was brewing a pot of coffee when I smell something burning. After removing the glass carafe, I noticed a thin black rubber liner which I believe was around the hotplate but it was lying across the hotplate. I pulled the plug, cleaned off the hotplate and let it cool. When I plugged in the machine, and turned on the hotplate, it did not get hot at all.  I sent a message to the manufacturer and have not heard a thing from them. I am writing this review, hoping I will be contacted for a refund."
"Worked fine for the first week then the bottom started to peel away and now it’s just metal, black flecks will forever be found throughout my kitchen. Also is now burning the coffee and it makes its “sludgy”"
"I bought this coffee maker to keep it my friend's house, for when I stay there. I have used it maybe seven times! I bought it in January and it is now September, and it is not working! Turn the power on and it does not brew! Have done the vinegar thing and it is not working! Had my roommate take it apart and test the wires in it, and there's nothing! No power to it! The wires are fried! It's a crap coffee pot!!"
"It is very poorly designed. I have to push up on the carafe to receive the coffee into it. When you've awakened in the morning, you don't want to spend 5 minutes holding the pot up to connect with the basket to make your morning coffee. I went back to instant coffee until I buy a coffee maker that actually works."
I ordered it for my rental unit. So I’ve never actually used it. It just seems a little small but I do have a small kitchen and that was the purpose of why I purchase it
It's the perfect size for my needs but even with a filter the grounds leak through and it leaked water/coffee into the counter. I was using it with a wash cloth underneath to catch the liquid but the coffee is full of grounds and yet weak ?
