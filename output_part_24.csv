"Doesn't Do eSIM on T-Mobile Network (including T-Mobile MVNO)  - no DSDS with T-Mobile only pSIM no eSIMI Am very tech savvy. This item provides dual SIM DSDS with eSIM and physical SIM. The device is sold unlocked, however; when trying to add the eSIM with T-Mobile or one of their MVNO it did not work. I didn’t fully go through with it, but the eSIM would apparently work on say Verizon, Red Pocket, or AT&T according to their BYOD tool. Strange that T-Mobile would only work with the pSIM and not eSIM.AS of December 2023, the device was still running Android 13 on Sept 2023 security patch. While the value is there, the software is behind. The glass on the back of this phone is absolutely perfect. I want whatever material/coating this is applied to any glass back electronic I have, that is how marvelous it feels to hold! Moto if you are reading this, make this your STAPLE FEATURE omg it felt so I good I wanted to keep the phone just because LOL! (That being said) The edges are quite slippery and can make typing with challenging/fatigue depending on how you are holding the phone and what orientation you are in(standing, walking, lying down, sitting, etcetera).A case alleviates that by giving more grip, but ugh a case on phones takes away the feel, and I just don’t use cases or screen protectors, so I only wore the holster case while out & about.There were some concerns about the mic quality, people having hard time hearing on speaker phone which was a bummer. The 165Hz is fantastic, the device was zippy and easy to use. Did I say how much I loved the feeling of this device?!Ultimately, I had to return it because I needed a DUAL SIM device, even though DSDS is not the preferred method over DSDA! Hopefully DSDA is implemented on the x70 modem in an update or at least the upcoming Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. I Am excited to see what the 2024 Edge+ will bring to the table! The 2023 model is nice if you can look past the issues that may affect your specific use case like mine. I had to go with another device, that came with physical NANO SIM, same SoC, already has the Android 14 update and while I prefer the build of the Moto Edge+ 2023 over the Sony Xperia 1 V; I like the ease of pSIM over eSIM but I was willing to make an exception and use eSIM if I could have got DUAL SIM working on this device. If I was a single SIM user, I probably would have kept this device, just because it felt that good to hold!"
"I had purchased this phone based on hours of research into the current phone market during the summer of 2023. I have had numerous other Moto phones previously and was generally pleased with them. However, the previous phone I had before the Edge+ '23 was the OnePlus 7+ due to Motorola falling behind in the mid tier/flagship phone categories.. and i liked the OnePlus if I'm being honest.  However, from what I had read, things have changed with the new Edge+ 2023 so I took a chance and went with the Edge+ 2023..  The new Edge+ is definitely a good performing phone out of the box. Fast processing, Nice screen, does not seem to slow down when filled with a ton of apps, speaker sounds good for a phone, decent camera, fast battery charging, good battery life, very game capable and doesn't get very hot, and more!  However, I have had a few pretty major issues as time went on. The phone will randomly freeze up and I have to do a hard restart at least once a month. I use my phone for an alarm and it has left me waking up late for work multiple times. VERY frustrating. Also, people cannot hear me clearly when using the speaker phone. They say my voice sounds very muffled and cannot understand me. Also VERY frustrating. Aside from those major issues its a pretty solid phone. But no one should have to deal with any of those issues even on a $150 phone, never mind a ""flagship"" quality phone. I was on the fence between purchasing this or the new OnePlus flagship phone.. and i sort of wish i went with the latter at this point.  I have always had a place in my heart for Motorola since the original Droid came out years ago. I had a few other solid smart phones from Motorola such as the Moto G phones and Z phones in the mid-late 2010's. The Edge+ 2023 has a ton of great potential. It's a great phone aside from my personal experience with the one i received.. but evidently quality control seems to be an issue with it. I wanted to love this phone, but it has left me disappointed. Maybe its just my phone, but its the one I'm stuck with and I have only had it for 4-5 months at the time of this review. I give it 3 stars overall. I'd give it an easy 5 stars if i didn't have the issues.Edit: Feb. 25, 2024Just a quick update.. I haven't had any freeze ups in a while. Possibly due to an update. Also people have been hearing me slightly better while on speaker.. still not great with speaker, but better (somehow 🤷‍♂️) not going to bump it up a star but it is 4 star worthy I suppose.. this phone at its current sale price would be a worthy buy as long as your speaker phone works  😬"
"The package arrived on time for once, and the packaging (besides a few small dents and blemishes on the packaging) was very good and the product was perfect. Among many other Motorola devices I have owned, tested and reviewed, this device is in a league of its own with the most recent specs, one of the most vibrant and fastest performing displays ever found in a Motorola device! It has a 144Hz refresh rate and only very high end flagship devices have a 120Hz display refresh rate so to see a device that can’t be called a “flagship” device but can’t be called a “midrange” device is something of a very peculiar phenomenon. One that I’m not complaining about. The phone has a very good 6.6” 1080x2040p display with a very high 1,200 nits brightness that is absolutely stunning. The size is a bit too big for my taste but the width is a bit better at typing one handed compared to other devices at this size. The weight is almost as if you’re holding an iPhone mini due to the beautiful amrid fiber backing that prevents any fingerprint oils, is extremely scratch resistant and is just aesthetically pleasing to look at. The sides are made of an aerospace grade aluminum frame that is polished to look like a black metal and is outright the most durable device on the market for this device doesn’t even need a phone case due to its above military grade drop protection and it’s IP68 rated that makes it water resistant, unlike other Motorola devices on the market that barely have splash resistant protection. The screen is made from Corning gorilla glass victus that can withstand heavy scratches and can withstand a drop of 2.2 meters with no harm from the fall. I’d still recommend using a screen protector for maximum safety and piece of mind. The device is up to date with the latest UI which is Android 14 and currently runs the latest security update. It’s the most feature packed device on Android that has a slew of new security features that aren’t on any other Android, despite the latest version. Only problem is that it is currently incompatible with my service provider and I have tried every troubleshooting solution available and have even spoken with Motorola and my provider (straight talk) about this issue and they said that it’s compatible with all of the four big carriers but might be incompatible with other prepaid services as of this moment. Will be returning, unfortunately but please give this device a try. It’s true that Motorola has gotten a pretty bad reputation as far as security updates that arrive months after their discovered and the every Motorola device is only eligible for one OS update and 2-3 years of security patches, and take a long time to get to the devices, but with this device, you will receive security patches on the same level as Samsung devices and you will get updates for four years from the 2-3 that Motorola has released before, along with full Android OS updates from Android 13-16 guaranteed! For the amazing low price of this rare gem, this device rivals even the best Samsung and google pixel phones available on the market. What is not as impressive as the other Android phones are the cameras. Don’t get me wrong, the camera setup is amazing for a Motorola phone and I dare say that it is the best Motorola device to produce such quality images. It can even shoot video in 8K 30FPS, but I advise you to stick with the 4K 30FPS HDR. Flagship display, flagship processor, and a very robust set of security features built into the hardware itself to prevent phishing attacks and ensure that your device is secure and monitored 24/7I have previously owned this device which is why I know so much about this product and this is coming from an avid iOS user. This is the ONLY Android device that has made me think of switching from iOS. Unfortunately I would consider contacting your carrier to see if your device is compatible with the ThinkPhone prior to purchasing the product.Features-10/10Design is a solid 10/10Durability is off the charts-10/10And the value for the money is a no brainer for a 10/10Overall I rate this a 9.8/10Due to the incompatibility with my carrier but would I recommend this to anyone who has been wanting to buy it? I’d say jump for it! You will not be disappointed in the slightest for the price point."
"it has been said this is the best moto phone that no one will buy. first 5 minutes the included case broke. and no premium manufacturers (spigen, etc) make any thing for the phone. I should have realized this phone was a dud from that alone. should have bought a samsung."
"This IS a good phone. It performs well in almost every aspect. It's snappy, smooth, the screen is nice, build is what you'd expect. The biggest downside is audio. This thing sucks in every aspect. Especially recorded audio. There is a built in noise cancellation that is engaged for every single camera/recording app that makes recording anything other than voice horrendous. They do have a way to ""disable"" it. And it disables it to a point. But the audio is still very phasey, metallic, old compressed MP3 sounding. The absolute worst I have ever heard even compared to old budget phones. The only way around this I have found, is using an external microphone, (hoping your USB-C to 3.5mm adapter doesn't also have built in ANC. And yes, a lot of them do) and using third party apps like Open Camera and hitting the ""disable audio processing"" setting under video settings. I have had a Moto G5 plus and a Moto X4 and these didn't have this issue. So it's a new thing Motorola is implementing with awful microphones and noise cancelling. I really hope they change this in the future. Otherwise this is my last Motorola phone."
"This phone is ok, but there are better options at this price range. Feel cheap, camera is ok, the only thing I like the most is the cleaner android compared to Samsung.."
"It goes up to 16GB of RAM.It's very fast/responsive.Can multi task easily.The dual external speakers on top and bottom gives it nice STEREO sound when watching movies/music/games.Sound quality is pretty decent.The battery is lasting me like 3 days before needing charged....so far....anyhow, lolIt charges EXTREMELY FAST as well.It has many options, and is like a mini p.c.Up to 8k video recording.Picture is nice !It has dual... ESIM/ Sim card.Can use two different carriers at the same time.Such as T-Mobile GSM.AndVersion CDMAPretty much never lose signal.So far, I'm liking it alot.Revised:So after owning awhile now.I've noticed when on automated calls and you have the phone on hands free speaker mode.It picks up it's own sound, and messes up the automated call.....Reverberation., and it's very annoying!!!Also the curved glass LOOKS nice.But...sliding your screen and touch sensors are not good around the curved edges.Performance-wise the phone is great.But speaking to someone or automated systems on the external speaker is junk.You can hear them fine.But they have trouble hearing you.And if it's an automated system ...forget about it... on the hands free external speakers.So idk how I feel about this phone now ?!"
No flagship phone made in the last 5 years should come without wireless power sharing. I needed to charge my watch and went looking for this feature and it was nowhere to be found. Thank good a Samsung s23 was nearby. Motorola definitely did not save the day.
"I purchased this phone as a replacement for my two year old Motorola G Power, which blew the battery (swollen up). The transfer of my data and apps and everything went really smooth as both phone needed to be connected via a USB-C to USB-C cable. It took only 30 minutes to transfer everything. After that the phone was ready to go. Motorola says on their Website that this phone does not work with my provider, but it does flawlessly (TING - Verizon).[Update 7/26/2024] I had to reduce the rating due to the Camera issue I am having. The camera most of the time takes forever to focus. It does not matter which camera I am using, they all have the same issue. It may not be a hardware but a software issue which I hope will be correct at some point. I wish the ratio of 3 x 2 would be added instead of 4 x 3, making it easier to print 4x6 pictures without losing anything (otherwise the picture would be distorted)"
"This was an amazing phone. The only things it lacks are a higher resolution screen and to ditch the curved screen edges. If not for that,I would've kept this as my daily driver. Also go back to 5000mah battery"
Very slippery phone Think Phone 2023. If you have dry hands this things will slide out. The case that comes with it is still slippery and its really slim protecting just the edges really. The aftermarket for cases is dismal. You have a couple choices only. Lenovo will force download the Microsoft suit. I tried to stop it but it kept fighting me. I had to uninstall them. This isn't uncommon for Lenovo as my Edge 2022 got forced to download games. I really wish Moto would relax a bit and stop with all this forced downloading programs and all in your face with trying to assist you with everything. I thought it was a secure business phone but to me if the phone takes off and doesn't things on its own like dl'ing programs thats not so secure to me. I happen to not want it on my phone
Switching over from my old android phone was fairly easy. Like the display quality. however the phone has problems picking up cells. I'm often without service in places I had service with my old phone. Disappointing to say the least for the price of this phone.
"Great phone for a grandma or grampa that only use it for calls and text. I use this phone for work. Sometimes 4g is faster than 5g. You can't go into mobile settings and manually change it. It automatically switch on its own. So that means, if 5g is only getting 2 mbps speeds. Your stuck on that slow network unless it decides if it want to change to 4g. It's very horrible because sometimes it won't switch unless you turn airplane mode on/off. This phone is a big regret. Had to switch back to my old phone wit a cracked screen not having freedom to manually pick my own network is a deal breakerOtherwise good camera and battery"
I’m not sure if it is a known or common thing but the red action button is pretty loose as is the volume down button. Compared to my S23 Ultra and IPhone 15 Pro which don’t have any “wiggle”. The last device I had with a similar issue was a Pixel 7 and the power button actually fell out eventually. Just something to consider.
"-->> 2nd edit to my review: i returned the phone to Amazon and bought it again with best buy and it worked right out of the box. - Verizon said the IMEI of the Amazon phone wasn't compatible<<--I bought this phone on May 19th 2023 when it was first available. I got it two days later. The following day I wanted to activate it with Verizon, this phone was clearly advertised as being compatible for Verizon. Verizon told me otherwise. Motorola told me it's compatible with Verizon. I had to argue with both companies that they oppose each other's opinion and I'm just the person who pays for the device. There was no solution being offered from neither of both parties. It is unbelievable that Motorola could not find the issue and you would think they work long enough together with all the carriers to figure out how to make a phone and how to sell it. Since Motorola couldn't find out this problem the literally told me I want to return it and ask for my money back.I asked them if they are going to tell this every single customer who wants to buy this device and cannot activate it, opposing the initial compatibility as per advertisement. I got nothing but apologies.Don't buy this phone!The initial title of my review was :""not overwhelming for a current flagship""This is my second motorola. The first one I just replaced with this edge Plus 2023. I must say it's nice but not overwhelming for the price I paid. My old Motorola MOTO z4, which is now 4yrs years old, had also already a 50 megapixel camera. So this did not change much except of the software. Also my old Motorola has a much more saturated colored display ( if you compare one by one). However the display is very good and the stereo speakers do the rest, YouTube videos are a charm. It's a downside not to have an external memory card slot. However, I can use an adapter cable and access a flash drive through USBC. I may update this review."
"At face value, this is a great phone with some incredible specs for the price point - especially when on sale. But I was hugely disappointed like other commenters with the fact the seal on the box was broken - suggesting I received a previously owned phone. Also, I subsequently discovered that these types of Motorola phones have a very low trade-in value - meaning buying one of these devices, however good the specs, offers a very low return on investment. All that said, if you can pick up one of these phones on sale and you intend to keep it for a while it is potentially a great value device with awesome performance on several key metrics."
"I like this phone or I want to like it I should say, had it for a little over a week and during that time I immediately noticed how terrible the battery life is. I'm a light user on my phone but it's  somehow significantly worse than my Huawei Mate 10, which is elderly at this point. Besides the battery I received tons of system updates which is fine, especially for security etc. until one  of these updates seemingly botched the camera settings. There are no longer any options to change resolution etc. Only one option is now available in the swipe down menu and it's like ""active photos"" or something. It's very bizarre, at some point in a three to four hour timeframe the camera app became bugged, I researched what I could and it seems to happen to various motorola phones for no apparent reason. I'd like to have a phone that just works and not have to worry about the camera becoming a potato at random, having a decent camera is important to me, and now this one is stuck in a low resolution with no way to change it. Also I really like the little case that came with it, until I was GENTLY removing it to try on another case I ordered, and it proceeded to break in two spots. I would give this phone a solid 4 stars if these issues weren't so major. For $400+ I would hope the device would have a competent camera app and battery life. I will be returning it, I don't want another motorola anytime soon."
"I was so excited to go back to Motorola after switching to Pixel for the last couple phones. Unfortunately when I got it and turned it on, I realized that Google Fi was not supported even though T-Mobile is.I thought about switching carriers because I think it's probably one of the best phones out there for the price, but ultimately had to return it since I have several phones using Google Fi."
"I have always liked my motorola phones but since purchasing this one through amazon there continues to be issues.  When making outgoing calls there is silence for a few seconds after the call connects or there is nothing at all and I have to redial.  Then today the phone screen would not come on after pressing the usual button.  I could not get past the black screen and had to reboot the phone.  Although I purchased on Motorola store it was through Amazon, I hope it was not a mistake.  Trying to save a few bucks could have resulted in a refurbished phone, but I cannot confirm this."
I got excited buying this phone because I saw reviews on YouTube saying this was a great bang for your buck phone. The phone exterior is solidly built. The screen looks good and it works well outdoors. The camera is good enough for day to day use. It does work well with the Verizon network.  The battery does last all day and sometimes it last a day and a half. I really thought this phone was going to last me at least a couple years. However yesterday I don't know what happened but now phone cannot connect to Android Auto and it has trouble charging. It will not stay charging. I connected it to more than one cable and it keeps disconnecting every time. It's been less than a month and luckily I can still return it but Amazon or Motorola have made it so difficult to return the phone that I don't even want to buy another Motorola phone anymore. I was going to return this one and get the same one again but seeing as how they are making me waste a day waiting for UPS to show up and pick up my phone I think will just go with a other brand. I gave them one chance and they blew it. Now I will never buy another Motorola phone again.
"The phone works great so far, only had it two days. The seller didn't state that the 68W charger was not included with the purchase. One of the primary reasons I purchased was for the quick charge."
Good:near stock android softwarebuild qualityMoto connectCharging is super fastBad:Battery life so far. I have done  hard reset to see if it was an issue in the set up but I would not currently call it an all day phone as advertised
wrong information from staffno dual simangry and will not buy from amazon
"Bought this as a ""new"" phone, but like others have stated i recieved an open box item.Cant speak for the phone as Im not keeping it at full price if its been opened. Buyer beware"
"Phone box was opened when delivered. Looks New but unsure. All seems to work ok, But BS for full price. Bought two 1 day apart and BOTH were opened."
"I love Motorola, but this is by far the worst phone I've ever owned. The screen sensitivity is horrible. You can't scroll without the phone taking you to a different page. I may never buy a Motorola again with how frustrating it is."
"On the positive side, this device offers very good value-for-money: it offers a lot of storage, a large and high-quality screen, significant battery life, and a clean version of Android that is regularly updated. This is exceptional within this price range of phones.On the negative side, there are so many software glitches and inconveniences. A few examples: the Moto Gestures work in some conditions but not in others; the auto-focus on the camera works mostly but not on text; the phone vibrates seemingly randomly or for some push notifications but not for important notifications (messages, calls, emails). Switching from Huawei and Samsung to Motorola has been challenging in that regard. Hopefully future software updates will address this"
It's not been a year but my phone's hardware looks bad. The touch screen doesn't work sometimes. On crucial moments my phone hangs up and it happened almost 1-2 times every month. After restart it works fine but overall it's buggy and really upset to buy this phone.
This phone has better specs than my Google Pixel 6 but my Pixel runs a lot smoother than this does. I continuously have cellular connection issues with this phone. At least once a day I have to reboot this phone that way it will actually connect to cellular. The specs look great but the performance is very upsetting. Buy a Galaxy or Pixel.
"I've been a Motorola users for the past ten plus years and 7-8 phones. I needed a dual-SIM phone and this seemed like the greatest option on the market currently. Setup was a bit of a hassle, cloning everything over from my old Moto G took several attempts but after a few hours it did 'most' of it, only a few apps and conversations lost. However! When I went in to swap my SIMs the SIM tray is only open on one side, the other is partly blocked! A call to Motorola had the expected results, they offered NO solution and claimed their own website said single SIM, even though I was on the site staring at the words 'DUAL NANO SIM'! I wish I knew if the dual SIM tray would actually function, because I can buy that elsewhere. Otherwise this huge disappointment will be returned..."
Title says it all. Ended up returning because quality pictures are really important for me as my daughter young... But I do miss getting a full charge in 15 minutes. Not going to lie
"I did a lot of research and really wanted this phone. I read and reread the ad regarding the unlocked status. I also called my phone company, Consumer Cellular, before I opened the box; they verified from the IMEI number that ""it should work."" However, it did not, it really is only configured for Verizon per my regular phone guy. I would not even mind having to return it, except you don't get a refund, you get an account credit. So that $371 cannot be used to buy another phone."
"Bought this phone as it had everything on paper I needed and, most importantly, compatibility with the relevant network frequencies. On those fronts the phone delivered. Unfortunately, after 3 weeks of light use, one night this slippery phone fell off the bed about 2 feet onto the floor completely shattering the glass camera lens cover.This part is impossible to find online to repair it myself, and Motorola wants $560 plus tax to repair. Probably a $5 part, they want 80% of the phone value? Not very happy with the phone. The glass bezel over the camera lens sticks out, I imagine I am not the only one with this problem. If there was better support or options to replace I would probably give this phone a 4/5. As it stands I am not a happy customer and will likely take my money elsewhere unless I can find a prompt solution before the cameras are ruined."
"Love this phone except for the screen. I have had several phones over the years but never had a screen crack until now. The scream is described as ""Take whatever work throws at you with impact-resistant Gorilla Glass Victus display protection. MIL STD 810H-tested1 for durability"" I thought great -extra protection from screen mishaps. Boy was I wrong!!!! I accidentally dropped it from 2 feet and the screen cracked. Unfortunately there is no warranty for screen cracking. It is 42 days old so I can't even return it to Amazon. Very unhappy!!!"
"I'm extremely happy with this phone. It's what the pixel pro should be.It's as snappy as it gets.Very little bloatware.It just works great.My only criticism is that the flashlight could be stronger.But the performance is great all around.Of course, this is for $700.So, overall, a great value.I come from pixel 5 and before that pixel 3a.I purchased a pixel 7 pro when it came out and it was terrible.Very happy to see another android phone that can compete with Samsung.EDIT: The phone soon after I purchased it started having a freezing issue sporadically. I updated it to Android 14 and started freezing as soon as I was entering the screen lock passcode. Tech support made me reset it to factory default and it was still having the issue. I sent it to repair a week ago. They won't send me a replacement. Only a ""like-new"" phone if they can't repair the one I sent. Today I called and they said 3 to 5 business days I'll have news. Really? They leave you without a phone for two weeks! How am I supposed to keep doing business without it? I had to buy a new one and will need to sell the one they return to me."
Can't talk on the phone unless it's on speaker
I was expecting Android 13 per the item description. Appears it could to be re-manufactured or something else. Evidence that it had been online for the Motorola initial online requirement. It did have the Motorola safety seal on the box.
"If you care for recording video in concerts or very loud background like a dance club, skip all new moto phones. You don't believe me, google distorted recording sound on new moto phones. I am furious that this major issue hasn't been addressed and most importantly there are no fix for it. Good luck."
"I am not just an Android user, I am a Motorola user. I love Motorola's technology, my phone always takes the best or highest quality photos and my Motorola phones last for years. Having said that, I now tell you this Motorola Edge+ is the worst phone I have ever encountered. The phone started randomly shutting down about 7-10 days into owning it. Usually it would take first 2 minutes and then about 5 minutes to get the phone to turn on again. I reported this to Amazon at the time. Now, less than 60 days into ownership, the phone is just going dark randomly. And it takes at least 10 minutes to get the screen to 'wake up' or to turn off the phone so I can turn it back on and use the phone. When the phone responds to efforts to wake it, there's no rhyme or reason to what works to get a response. I don't know if I got a lemon, a refurbished product (sold as new), or something else. What I do know is this isn't the quality of product I expected from Motorola."
Didn't think the phone responded well and I returned it and it's taking forever to get my refund think twice before you buy a phone on Amazon
"I had a Galaxy S22 Ultra that I damaged. I replaced it in January 2024 with a Moto G 5G that was way too slow and had a very low quality screen. So, I quickly replaced that with a Motorola ThinkPhone this past February. Initially, the ThinkPhone was impressive - other than storage size, it was very similar to my S22 Ulta. It was fast/snappy, had great battery life, and a good looking screen. However, today (May 2024), while I was using the ThinkPhone, it turned itself off and I have not been able to turn it back on. It also won't recognize when a charging cable has been plugged into it. It is now a useless brick, after only 3 months of use. Motorola phones are absolute garbage."
For 700$ I expected sum thing better. Alot of glitches with the new updates. Battery barely last a day from brand new.
Im one of the ones that this phone would not connect to Straighttalk.  The phone seemed awesome otherwise except the edges of the display are rather steep.  But overall it would of been a good phone.  Motorola needs to fix the Verizon/Straighttalk issues some people are having.
"Definitely, the worst phone and worst customer service I've ever had. Huge software issues, your information is not safe! Bluetooth is not compatible with most Android auto vehicles and the audio lags.It shuts down periodically in the middle of the night, JUST WHEN YOUR KID MIGHT NEED YOU!Do not waste your time on this and whoever does can file a class action, I have no problem with joining."
"The phone works fairly well, but the battery died just after a couple months. Motorola dropped the price of this phone in half, and I think it's because it's wasn't holding up."
"Tried several solutions with none of them working.  Missed alarm several times due to the phone randomly shutting down.  Looking into warranty solutions.  Screen, without a protector, appears=s to scratch much easier than other screens I've used and screen protectors do not always stick well to the curved glass.  Otherwise, would be a good phone but the shut down problem is a severe issue."
Bought two phones in January this year my phone got excessively hot and turned off let cool down never came back entries to charge phone nothing happened.  Tried to contact insurance dept kept getting the run around between amazon and insurance department  never buy insurance on anything I get thru amazon and since I've already canceled all my subscriptions never again have I been so disappointed with them
"I don't believe the cell phone was brand new. As advertised. The seal was broken when I received it. See the picture I added. It could have been a display or return; I will never know. For you Verizon users, the Motorola edge + 2023 does work on their network. All I did was transfer my sim card from my old cell phone into the Edge + 2023 and it linked up with no problem. I'm even using Verizon's messaging app. Only get 2 stars because I have my doubts it was new in the box.Update: after 3 months of use it has developed a horizontal line in the screen that will not go away.  Looks like the screen is cracked. Also it's very bulky and hard to hold on to without an even bulker case."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            For some reason the phone keeps disconnecting and reconnecting to the Bluetooth. It did this several times today.  Maybe I got a defective one?  The phone itself is pretty good, with a great screen but has the Bluetooth issue."
HEAT on charging is almost too hot to touch. Recognizes in the system once activated as a..... Galaxy S24? Something is definitely off here
"The phone started bugging after a week of use and it didn't want to turn on/off, didn't recognize touch and just froze on a couple of occasions.I returned it.The phone is a beast and I would recommend getting it from an official store or Motorola site, not over Amazon."
"I previously had a OnePlus 7T, which turns out to be better than this phone in almost every way. I can tell with even simple games (Candy Crush) that the animations and gameplay are slowed down. When shooting video, I usually get ""stuttering"" in the beginning. This is just unacceptable for a phone of these specs in 2023. Probably going to return it if I can't resolve it."
"Totally useless as a phone. Call volume is super low. No boost available. I literally spent a week setting this phone up to my liking... Tweaking color, text, pictures, settings... Installed the sim card today... Made a call... Could barely hear at max volume. Tried another and another call... HORRENDOUSLY low volume.Going into the audio settings... Touch each volume slider... Call volume is the lowest at max volume. Alam volume is 3-4 times LOUDER! Normal volume is 2 times louder! LIKE WHAT THE... Why are all the volume levels different at max setting? They should all be the same and LOUD at max. NOPE!I'm going to give them a week or 2 to patch it if they read this review. If not, I'm sending this phone back. Total joke."
"I have e joyed this phone since March, one reason I purchased it was because of the water proof feature. That being said I have had bad luck with it. Water fog in the lense and stuff. Seeing how I enjoy fishing I thought hey! Would be cool to capture some photos of fish and not worry about the water. No such thing here."
"The seal was already opened on the box.  This is supposed to be a ""NEW"" product.  Having concerns now."
Been a Motorola customer for years. This phone broke in a matter of days. Read the warranty because Motorola will screw you over. They try to give you a like new replacement for a brand new phone and won't refund the difference.
"camera stopped working after 2 weeks. Doesnt like instagram and there is no fix as of yet. So if you like a camera that you can use, this phone isnt it."
"Phone was delivered on time, but was already opened, as shown on picture.Did not turn on yet, but hope it works."
My new phone arrived in a smashed shipping box and the items inside were opened. I sent back immediately. Never tried the phone because the seal was broken on it. Haven't tried to buy a new one yet.
"Enjoyed the phone for three months or so.  All of a sudden get a notification the sim card was not being read.  Two days later the screen is black.  Great phone until then.  Oh well, took a chance and now it's back to Samsung."
"This item is not worth buying under any circumstance. For what it has, it should be much faster and more performance. The battery heats up from charging so when I try to return it, the only option was pick up from UPS. I called Amazon five times because UPS never came. They won't allow you to drop off the item anywhere. It has to be a pickup. The most frustrating experience encountered for a crap product."
The phone was working for a few hours. Then it automatically downloaded Android 14 and stopped charging. Could never get it to start charging again. Called support and they just said send it back. Support was zero help.
Phone sucks
I ordered a brand new phone and received a box that was already opened. The seal was cut.
"I am an internet infuencer. I know i hate the term too. I saved up my money,, as my old phone was dieing. I did a lot of resurce before i bought it. No one menchend the mic. it is low and muffled. I loved my old moto phone BUT I HATE THIS ONE. Honistly it makes me ont to cry that i spent all my mony on it!"
"Ordered new, used sent. Item was cleary used. Covered in dirty prints. Charger dirty, camera dirty. It is absurd to advertise an item as new and send out a return. How do I know if camera is broke, antenna not working, etc.."
"As in the photo, the phone came with the seal opened. Sent me a used phone.. get it from motorola direct.Not happy."
Get spotted wet after shower and speaker stop working for 5 hours
It works perfectly for 4 months. Now it can not be turned on. Trying to send back to Motorola for repair or replace.
"So apparently whomever had the phone before I received it, never did a factory reset and so I am having to send the phone back... Highly pissed off"
"Received USED PHONE!!!!! Do not buy this!!! I received a used, dirty and opened phone 2 TIMES!!!!! And now have to wait 30+ days for my refund for each phone!!!! Absolutely ridiculous!!!! BUY IT THROUGH THE ACTUAL CARRIER NOT HERE!!!!"
This phone has horrible microphone problems. Will never buy Motorola products again. Customer service wants me to mail the phone for repairs and then I'm left without a phone. Stay away from Motorola.
"Offered as an unlocked phone. It doesn't work on all 5g networks. My carrier is Xfinity, need to check with carrier first."
"Shipped/sold by amazon. Sent in opened box, this ""unlocked"" phone was carrier locked to someone else."
Phone had problems tried to deal with it but failed and returned.  Returning phones to Amazon is not easy.
Was completely nonfunctional
"Got a used unit, returning this and buying directly from Motorola"
"This is by far the worst Motorola phone I've ever purchased (from Motorola website). This phone is way too glitchy (ie. Flashlight turs on by itself, alarm clock doesn't always work, will drop current call for another incoming call without permission, vibration notification is very weak, there's more but hopefully you get the picture). The camera is the best thing about this phone. Motorola did try to reach out but offered no real assistance in fixing the issues. If you want a Motorola phone try the moto G or Razer, but avoid this garbage phone."
"I have had Motorola phones for about 10 years now. I love them: minimal bloatware, stability, reliability--in a word, a great value in my opinion. I have never regretted my purchases, including my current G7, except for one infuriating aspect: Motorola chinzy, almost contemptuous disregard for its customers when it comes to updates and security patches. They are usually very late and few--one of the worst in the industry.Whenever I am  tempted to click on the Buy-Now button for this phone, the nagging issue of updates brings me back to reality.So, Motorola, show some decency and join the ranks of Samsung and Google and increase the number and frequency of updates. That may well pull you up to the first-rate phone manufacturers and enable me to remain a customer for the next decade. Absent an improvement in your OS and security patches updates, my current phone is the last Motorola phone I will own."
"I love just about everything on this phone but... And it's a big but.. the automatic beauty filter on the camera is HORRIBLE!!! I look like a cartoon. It's so ridiculous that I never take pictures of myself. Like I'm a guy, I don't need to look like Barbie. All that's missing are some butterflies. There does not appear to be a way to turn it off either. I have messed with all the settings but there's no way to shut off the filter."
"I'm on my 3rd Think Phone. Motorola services and repairs phones but since mine started to act up after a their short refund period they refused to refund.The first one died completely died out of the blue and I couldn't get to turn on at all. I sent in under warranty and got it fixed. A couple weeks later the repaired phone also died. In both cases the screen just went black and never turned on again no matter what happened. After this issue they sent me a ""Like new device"" which was just another repaired phone with scratches on the screen out of the box. That one has worked so far but has gotten much slower and buggier.The front camera no longer works at all. Tried multiple apps and restarts. And other slow downs occur often. I switch between Android and iPhone every couple of years and have never had a phone this bad from either of them. In fact each time it gets repaired I grab an older phone that still works from the drawer until this cursed thing comes back to annoy me again. It feels bad that the company doesn't stand by their products and I'm now out 400 bucks and stuck with this thing.Save yourself the headache and steer clear of this device."
"It's a really fast phone, but the battery life is horrible.Can't even make it though a single day. Also I keep accidentally touching the sides and causing weird touch actions.Finally don't buy directly from Motorola. The return process is horrible. You're on the phone for 20 minutes just to get a return label."
"With the new OnePlus 12 coming out at only slightly more with 12Gb RAM / 512Gb UFS 4.0 storage and the fastest USB-C port, this phone is no longer a midrange contender for its current price with only 8Gb RAM and far lesser features."
$400 for a phone without 5G?  You must be kidding!
"Almost everything about this phone is great or good enough, EXCEPT phone calls. I've bought and returned or sold 4 of these because of such issues. It's either a software issue or hardware fault because of the noise cancelling. Callers can't hear me when the window is down in the car and when driving or near a fan or similar ambient noise. I tested this with my other Motorola phones and it's only this device. It has 4 mics vs the 2 or 3 that the others have. That's my only guess. The issue will never be fixed either. Not enough people make phone calls in those seemingly simple conditions. Not enough will complain. I scoured the Internet and forums and Motorola itself. Only one other person has found this to be an issue. A few reported mic issues when recording video, but it was something I couldn't deal with. So I bought the Motorola edge 2023 instead. It's way better imo. I left a review for it."
Their phone was too skinny and long.
"DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. It has terrible software problems, especially with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Several months after its release, Motorola has not addressed many software glitches. Save yourself the headache and buy something else."
"I don't care how good the phone is if you don't respect the fact that more and more people are switching away from windows every year and going to Apple laptops. Not to support Reddy for on the Mac platform is a huge marketing blender. It's a definite no go for me, otherwise I might have been tempted away from my iPhone. Couple that with Motorola's historically, miserable software updates and the fact that last year's edge plus is still running android 13. Well, it's just too big of a risk to take."
"There is very little info about this watch on the internet at this point but there seems to be a few saying it is very difficult to attach the watchband so I watched the video on the TOZO website and followed it. I was able to attach the watchbands without any issue and had the watch set up in about 5 minutes. Everything worked and I was able to get text messages and phone calls but was not getting email notifications until I messed around with my iphone notifications settings. I only had it for a day so not much to report but it seems to be pretty good for the price of 32 dollars (pre black friday deal). The only thing missing (for me) is camera control but I can live without it. For the money, this watch has a great display and is a good deal.**UPDATE: (more info after using for a few days)1. the software updated and had to re-enter most settings2. battery life seems to be about 3 days max (for my settings)3. watch face changed unexpectedly (found that the crown changes the watch face and rotates 6 faces.  Five of the faces seems fixed and only the 6th can be customize.)4. watch face can be customized with your photo but this feature only worked after repeatedly trying5. battery drained when I wasn't wearing the watch (seems like it might be trying to monitor health)"
"According to the website description, there is oxygen monitor with the watch. But when I received the S6 model, I didn’t see the O2 monitor. Am I the only one? I haven’t tried on it yet. I have sleep apnea, I think. I need one watch with good O2 monitor. I think, I have to return it. Otherwise, the watch is very nice looking and well worth for the money if you don’t need O2 monitor."
"PRO: The watch is priced right, comfortable to wear and is accurate for Blood oxygen. Using the Always on Display, I could get 1-2 days battery life.CON: Calling is a problem. I was never able to receive a call on the watch using Bluetooth from my Samsung S23 phone. NEVER. Despite this, I could initiate calls on the watch. The other person said the audio quality was good, but on my end the audio would often break up."
"This watch was so close to being great. Unfortunately when you receive text messages, it only says ""messages"" instead of who the message is actually from. The issue is that this feature exists and works perfectly on the Tozo S5 watch which is frustrating! Why would the newest iteration of your watches have less features? Also, the Tozo S5 has a very fluid and seamless screen, on this new S6 its kind of laggy and not as good looking. When I contacted Tozo they indicated the contact not showing on messages isnt even an issue of the watch, rather a software feature missing from their app since the S6 uses the ""health"" app and the S5 uses the ""wear"" app. Tozo is always so close to hitting a home run and then misses on something small like this. Hopefully they update their software and I can update this review."
"Ahhhh for the price point and listed features I wanted to like this watch so bad. I even gave it a week before reviewing to be more fair in my assessment. For starters the calories and step counters, they are SIGNIFICANTLY off…as a human being just existing I burn roughly 1700 calories based on my height and weight if I just sat on the couch all day. Well I’m extremely active and work 6 days a week so I wanted to see how many calories I burn a day and this watch says I only burned 627 calories after I worked a 9 hour shift ?? How does that make sense 😂 and the watch said I only took 9K steps but the miles said 6.2 ?? I thought it was going to be like Fitbit and continuously track my stats every minute of the day but it seems to just stop here and there.Secondly, the wristband is PURE TORTURE I swear I spent like 15 minutes of my life trying to get the band to snap into the sockets…I tried several methods and just when I thought it was good it would snap right back out, I finally got it but it should never have been that difficult in the first place.As far as what I do like ?? The brightness, clarity, and contrast of the screen is honestly amazing, the size is perfect and I can read everything on it without problem. The UI layout is simple and integrated which I appreciate. The sleep tracker is accurate as well which is good. It came fully charged and I only had to charge it once since writing this review which is just phenomenal.Like I said I really wanted to like this watch but it’s just LACKIN in the department that I solely bought this watch for. Maybe just stick to the headphones and earbuds for a while, Tozo until you can perfect the health aspect for watches."
Device constantly loses connection to my phone. Calls automatically switch to phone even when using my watch to answer or call out. Battery lasted 3 days when it says it has a 10 day battery life. I'm disappointed. I had High hopes for it as it worked great at 1st.
This is a good watch.  Face is bright and easy to read.  Getting about 5 days battery life.  Biggest problem is keeping connected to the phone.  Have to restarting Bluetooth or going to the app to reconnect. Other than that it's good.
I like the watch and the many functions it has but it disconnects from the app frequently and because of this I miss incoming messages.
"Putting the straps on the S6 is a pain in the ass. Hopefully Tozo addresses this seriously frustrating issue. Other than that I love the watch in comparison to my S4. I was able to get it for $39.99, which in my humble opinion is a great deal. Tozo seriously continues to impress me with their tech and pricing.3stars because the watch band attachment issue is a critical and serious issue. It tarnish an otherwise great user experience."
Watch work very good but the band don’t fit the design is great
Item has very good quality
"The watch band is hard to get on. I struggled for an hour. I have contacted customer support 3 times. Twice through the live chat and gave 2 different email addresses since I never received help the first time. I never received help on either one. I ordered this watch on Amazon. I have also emailed their support team with the email address on their website.I have owned this watch for a small 22 days. My watch band is already tearing off the metal bar that attaches the band to the watch face.My heart rate is WILDLY inaccurate. It is also nowhere near real time. It seems to only update every once in a while on my watch face in random minute increments. The step counter does the same. It only updates every now and then. It just seems to dump all the information at the same time. When I use the exercise mode, like yoga, it shows heart rate  as ""--"" and never starts showing the heart rate. When I am on the treadmill, I am trying to keep my heart rate between a specific rate. When it only updates every few minutes, it doesn't help AT ALL.Also, I was wearing the watch for 1.5 weeks and then I had it on in the rain and it completely removed the skin from my wrist. It has been 2 weeks since then and my skin is still healing. I changed my wrists and haven't had the issue since. I am not sure what that is about, but it is a terrible downside. I almost don't want to wear it while working out in the rain ever again even if the description states that it is waterproof.Despite having ""Always On"" when using the quick preprogrammed exercise function (yoga or running) it STILL TURNS OFF and goes black. I'm not sure this watch does half of what the description states it is capable of."
Drained out battery very quickly with normal use only 6 days not 7 or 10 days look like described.
"Despite trying a number of times, I was not able to put a strap on this watch. I am returning it."
"I have had really good luck with tozo items in the past, and in particular their earbuds. I have been looking for a smartwatch and decided on this one after some comparison amd reading the reviews. However, I recently received this product and how they have you attach the watch bands is probably the dumbest idea ever and unless you have the dexterity and hand control of a surgeon, good luck. I was able to get 1 side to fit in (also looked at the diagram to make sure I put the correct side facing down and the correct side of the watch) after a few minutes of trying. The otherside, I gave up after 10 minutes of trying to slide a small metal bar over while pushing in and rotating to get it into another small hole. I mean magnets or a more robust click in option is the way to go. Not trying to do a circus maneuver and hoping you get the bar into the hole. In my case, the machined step up part is too long and will not fit in the designated space thus rendering the watch useless as I cannot wear it. I have requested an exchange, so hopefully #2 actually works and I can ammend the review because everything else from them has been decent."
"It took 15+ minutes to put on the straps. I work with small objects all the time. I need to put on a jeweler's glasses to see what's going on. The needle that's supposed to pop into the hole has a long tube that doesn't want to retract into the sleeve. One needs to push the tube down inorder for the needle to properly seat into the hole. It's insanely frustrating. TOZO, you really need to redesign the pin locking mechanism. My nails tips are chewed up due to this poor design."
"I have used this for about 45 days now and I wish I would have explored the features even further. It does nothing correctly. First, the time is now several minutes off. Second, the heart rate monitor is completely inaccurate. I was taking a run recently, and my heart rate stayed in the 90s. The treadmill itself stated that I was at about 150bpm. Third, the stress meter does not change. It never shows anything other the 'mild' and I an a very anxious person.There are almost no redeeming qualities and I don't even think I can make a return at this point. And if that's the case, I won't be buying another Tozo product. I already have earbuds that were okay but if they don't stand behind their products, I am done with them."
Couldn't get the watchband on even after watching videos.  Had to return it.
"Well I can't review how well the watch works because like many of the people before me, I absolutely couldn't get the wristband connected to the watch! I spent at least 45 minutes trying everything I could think of to get even one band connected to the watch, and just over and over and over again it wouldn't connect. Foolishly, I felt the other people that had previously stated in their review how hard it was to get the wristband connected to the watch just weren't that good at doing it. But even though I'm usually really, excellent at getting things put together, I never got to first base with this watch and wristband! How they could put out a watch, which may be a good product, shipped out with such a horrible connection on the wristband I don't know; it gets me!???"
Low quality interface and sensor. Cheap for a reason
The watch band will not stay on
Three people tried for about a total of 4 hours and we could not attach bands.  They are too thick for the opening.  This is probably why they are not attached as other watches I have ordered come with bands attached.  This is an ongoing problem with other re views.  Researched profiles of positive ones and see that many only re  view  Tozo products.  ???
"I was really excited to get this. I attempted to put the wrist bands on, the directions make it look very simple to put them on however, I have not been successful in getting either one of them on. I don’t want this item any longer. I’m returning it already 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼"
"This is a nice watch, I mean, if I could use it. Seems like I got a defective one. It would turn on and then 20 seconds later it would shut down on it's own. I wasn't able to see how it works so I can't say anything about that. I returned product."
"Watch is great, however I can get the springs to stay closed on the watch band. It’s like the band is too large.  Tried for over an hour and the soft silicone is tearing now. Really should come on installed already. Very disappointing."
"This is a huge deal breaker for me, i gave it all the permissions and it didnt work, same with the messages it only shows you the message and not who sent it, save your money this aint worth"
"The watch randomly, for no reason and without warning, resets itself. When that happens, I lose all of my data for that day. Seems to happen every other day, so comparing day over day is impossible. Also doesnt integrate with google fit.Straps were dufficult, but not impossible to attach.Overall, dont waste your money"
"The watch cannot constantly connected to my phone and I don't get much notification for app notification, phone calls, text messages, etc. In addition, the watch skin changes itself randomly. I will not buy this brand again."
Got it charged but three people tried to get it off of the first screen with the QR code on it. Hit the start button and you get jibberish. Tried to pair with bluetooth would not connect. The print on enclosed instructions is tiny and not very helpful. The Tozo website is even less helpful.
"It is very difficult to put on the bands of the watch, I have been struggling for hours, I could not put it on, I finally gave up and left it, it will probably be a desktop watch."
"Been trying to put on the bands for over 30mins, and have only gotten ONE attached. THESE SUCK!!! And I own a Samsung Watch6, literally takes me 2 seconds to attach the bands on to it. Got this watch for my son. Returning it tomorrow. Horrible design."
"Total piece of plastic junk. Can't even get  the wristband to attach to the watch face, which makes the watch useless. Totally frustrated."
The bands suck. The watch is really pointless. Wish I never bought.
What the hell is up with the watch band?? 2 hours later and I'm still trying ro attach it. WTF?
Watch band is too much of a pain to attach. Will be returning; I like to change out watch bands too often to deal with this.
Can’t even get the band to attach. This is a piece of garbage
Your band will not go on. This is a piece of garbage.
"Latest update.All the same problems as before, but now the home theater doesn’t work with this tv at all and I moved it to a fire tv in the basement.  Also had frequent problems with Prime and a few other services.  Prime will frequent lock up, turn on and a bunch of blank panels will show up but no pictures, words, etc. , will show up. Checking other tvs in the house and everything works fine. Customer service had me run through a bunch of algorithms that fixes it for the few days and then, boom. Bottom line, this tv sucks bad and I recommend that you buy anything but a Samsung.Bottom line up front: great picture, everything else sucks.When we purchased this TV, I was excited. Picture quality was great. But things started going south pretty quickly. The remote is wonky. You click a button and nothing happens, you try again, and nothing. You contort yourself to get different angles and finally it scrolls forward or raises the volume or whatever you wanted. But then it keeps going, like it stored all those button presses and ran them all at once. It is marginally better using my phone app to do these things.  It has the same problem only less often. The problem with the app is that sometimes it randomly severs the connection and you can’t turn it on. It then wants you to go through a whole diagnostic process which took about 15 minutes. Unplug it, plug it back in, check the WiFi, check some other crap. I am starting to get nostalgic for the days when I got up pushed the button on the tv to turn it on, turn the channel with a knob, even old tube tvs which took a few seconds to warm up are faster than this crap sometimes.The external speaker feature is also crap. I have a home theater than is a few years old, that works perfectly on my old tv or when I listen to music via Bluetooth, but only randomly works with this tv. We will be watching, and it works great. Turn off the tv and turn it on later and no sound. Play with the settings for a while and eventually you just use the tv speakers. But the next time you turn it on, it decided to use the home theater and maybe sound comes through the home theater but mostly it doesn’t. Their tech support is useless here. They have a list of algorithms for you to walk through, and when those don’t work, they give up and tell you it’s not the TV but the home theater. Finally the “Smart” features are anything but Smart. Trying to add apps, put them on the screen in some semblance of order is not intuitive with this machine. This is such an ugly process that I guess enough people complained, that tech support actually has an effective algorithm that they can help you set it up. I recommend that you write it down, because next month when you want to add Hulu, and put it on your screen in a convenient place, you’ll need to call again to wind your way through the process."
"I feel that this TV perfectly matches the description of ""OK"", even when compared to other TVs in the price range. The OS is clunky and slow to use. Needing a Samsung account to set up the TV is very annoying, and I couldn't find an opt out. The audio quality is incredibly poor. Sounds like a phone speaker. The picture quality is good, but not amazing. Out of the box, it has that Samsung super vivid color calibration that makes things look really unnatural. If you have a little extra cash to spend on a TV, I recommend spending a bit more for something like a Sony brand TV. I purchased a Sony around three years ago, for maybe 20% more, and still find it to be a much better TV."
"It wont screen mirror or cast to the tv from my s23 ultra. I had to hook up my old Chromecast to make it work. This is unacceptable. I bought a Samsung TV so that it would be compatible with my phone for screen sharing. The female delivery person literally exuded hatred. The man was all smiles and handshakes. I hooked the TV up and it works great except that I can in no way get it to hook up to my JBL 2.1 soundbar. I tried Arc, HDMI and Bluetooth since the TV has no Optical output I could not try that. The remote is intuitive and easy to use. It literally holds your hand through the entire setup process. The picture is amazing. I was a little gun shy on this purchase since my last 59"" Samsung lasted 18 months and now just goes through a power on loop."
"The remote is awkward. Picture is okay. Sound okay. Not impressive in any way, but then the price reflects that.Set up was easy other than any steps requiring use of the remote. I ended up bluetoothing my phone and that was much faster.Again, the remote is horrible. We are going to buy a good Universal remote."
I’ve been happy with my last Samsung TVs.  They last.  I had my ROKU dongle and My Google Dongle. I was happy with dumb TV’s with many ports.  Older now I was looking to simplify.  The 55-inch UHD 4K DU7200 2024 is VERY GOOD at showing lots of ADS EVERYWHERE!I find the over abundance of AD’s to be VERY DISTRACTING I’m concerned as I age BUY and BUY will be a  problem.  I’ll need a clean interface. Even the Smart Things app with the remote has ads. I am a customer not a prospect.  Service people do not understand the I don’t know how to navigate on a new TV.  Go to this setting is not enough.I still use my dongles. They Work.  The Samsung VLC app for DLNA does not exist and sound when using the YouTube TV app crackles.  The TIZEN operating system may be part of that compatibility issue.I don’t think I want the struggle to return and replace it.  I am very disappointed. It's mounted on the wall.
"The tv is fine, I’m not a gamer so can’t speak to that. HOWEVER…..the remote is horrible. Others have stated the same but I figured how bad could it be…..it’s that bad!!!!!!!! I’m trying to find a good universal remote to replace it.It’s that bad……."
"This is the first new television I've purchased in almost 20 yrs. and I'm only giving it 2 stars because it does turn on and off. But, it's hands down the worst electronic I've ever spent money on. Luckily, the price was low. Unfortunately, so is the quality. Not the picture quality. The OVERALL TV is just crap. Samsung makes it a nightmare to navigate through the apps. Everything is a challenge. Absolutely nothing has proven to be user-friendly. THE REMOTE!!!! I've never wanted to break something more in my life, but then, I'll be stuck with this giant turd that barely works already sitting in my living room, reminding me of the terrible mistake I made when I purchased it!!!! The remote is JUST as bad. The buttons change daily. Some days volume is volume. Today, volume is Netflix!! If Amazon didn't make it such a pain in the you know what to send back large turds, I'd gladly take a refund, for half, of half, of I don't care what.Don't waste your money like I did. GO WITH A DIFFERENT BRAND!"
Great picture but... the remote is awful so I bought a universal remote. The audio out is bad and never quite in sync with the picture. It needs a simple RCA audio out.
"The remote is seriously awful. You have to press the button like three to ten times sometimes before it registers a click, and this makes it really annoying when trying to search something, find an app, or log in and it doesn’t pick up the key presses, then you make a typo and have to go find the backspace. I tried brand new batteries and it didn’t help. The TV has nice picture, sound, everything else but you use the remote for everything and it’s seriously so bad. Also I don’t use the apps that are hard coded into the remote, I wish you could just program those buttons in the TV settings to go to whichever app you want instead of it only being able to go to Disney plus, Netflix, etc. I’m going to have to get an Apple TV or something similar so I don’t have to use this pathetic remote.Changing from 3 stars to 2 stars after owning for a month now. Remote is infuriating"
"It's ok, but you get what you pay for I guess"
"Samsungs great, the tv is amazing and the features are insane buuuttt, the shipping service used is a joke. NSD held it in the warehouseSitting still forever and delivered it by rented a moving truck from the uhaul company.. could have made it weeks earlier but no. Use your local search engine.. the ironery of the company name, ""none stop shipping""Buy from walliworld instead, 3 days u got it, not 3weeks over due"
"The remote control is horrible I’m a senior citizen and can barely see the remote laying on the table and to try to read the buttons on it,is rediculous. There isn’t a decent owner manual to help me understand how to use the remote. If it wasn’t such a hassle to get someone back here to package it back up, I would send it back."
Is there another remote control option for this tv????!!!
The sound on this TV is terrible.  The last Samsung  tv was wonderful in the sound.
"The first one they mailed to me arrived in my town In south east Georgia after 3 days, but for some reason was sent to South Carolina from there, to Savannah, to Jacksonville, then back to Brunswick. After arriving 4 days late we unboxed it to find the tv was shattered, as mentioned in previous reviews there was no issues with the packaging just a shattered tv. My new one came in today after 14 days and not one follow up from the seller or any olive branch for the difficulties with purchasing, I guess that just the cost of doing business with these folks. Will be getting my next tv from somewhere local. With shipping difficulties aside the picture is clear and crisp. The bolts to wall mount on my bracket are a different size from the ones from my last lg tv so have it on stands now until the right bolts (m8) come in later in the week, maybe a nice thing for the manufacturer to include??"
"I like that the TV was delivered on time and the delivery guys were very friendly upon arrival however what I don't like about is the fact that no matter much you adjust the brightness it's like the TV still shows goo dark for my liking, I aslo love how it shows in HD, maybe it will take some time to get use too."
"I bought this TV after my last samsung flat screen died after 10 years. The image looks nice, but every app (youtube, rumble, prime, hulu) is littered with bugs and problems. Everything from crashes, hangs, freezing for 10 seconds, videos don't display at the correct size, etc... Also, the remote doesn't respond half the time you press a button. I don't think samsung or the developers of apps for their smart tv platform have any quality control whatsoever."
First one didn't work. Plugged in and title screen came up then everything went black. New one came no problem. Biggest issue was with amazon pick up. Finally had to do myself thru Amazon using a third party. Took 3 tries to get them to come to right address even after explaining during the return request that the delivery was made to a temp address due to buying a house and need the pick up to happen at my current address
Still trying to get familiar with the functions.
Disappointed that I have a really good sound system I can't hitch it up to the TV and in the ad it does not tell you that you can't have a sound system added to the speaker that's on TV itself. The picture is pretty good I have to say that it's good. The other thing is when you switch from Montana TV to any other ones it doesn't have a TV guide either so that's pretty disappointing.
"Our TCL just up and died after 6 years so at the recommendation of my daughter, purchased this Samsung.  It is so hard to navigate between the remote and the apps on the tv screen.  After the simplicity of the TCL tv, this is very hard to adjust to.  I started a return on it but hate to go thru the hassle.  I keep thinking I’ll figure it out but after 2 weeks, still struggling with figuring out how to navigate.  The volume button is a joke.  It’s a tiny little bar that you push up or down on and it’s also the mute button so it you don’t get your finger just right on it, it’s always muting.  One nice thing is, the picture is very good.  I wanted Roku so downloaded that app.  I have a lot of issues with it on the Samsung after never experiencing any issues on the TCL.  It will go dark and silent when cutting to a commercial.  I often have to turn the tv off and on again and then go thru whole process of finding the show I was just watching.  It is definitely not user friendly."
"No comparison to my LG, saByme size and price . No booklet to set up-have to go online not easy. I am returning."
"While I'm not unhappy with this TV, I am disappointed with some of its functions.  When turned on, it is slow to load.  I  use bluetooth earpieces to listen to TV.  Each and every time I turn the TV on I have to go to 'settings' and reconnect them [unlike my old Samsung which kept the connection].  When I unmute the TV, again, it's slow to engage the sound.  The remote which came with the TV was both cheaply made and useless.  The 'function' buttons were all black on a black casing and needed pressing multiple times.  I almost immediately replaced it with another remote.  This is not an expensive television but having just bought it, I'm not ready to replace it."
"I wanted a standard tv, not a smart tv, maybe I read the listing wrong but to me it didn’t reference this being a smart tv."
"I bought this TV as a Bday present for myself and was quite disappointed. As I went to return the TV, they offered me $100 off to not return it. Wish I would've still done the return...1) I used the TV for maybe a few days at which point a thin line of dead pixels going from left to right across the entire screen.2) The user interface, where the apps are, is sooooooo slow to move around. There is sometimes up to a 5 second delay on just navigating the menu.3) It does random things. For example, I'll start up Netflix and as it's loading Netflix, it will just switch over to the news channel? Like why?4)  When I went to return the TV because of these issues, they did not offer me a replacement. Well, fun fact, I threw away the TV box and so I had no idea how I would return the 55 inch TV... In order to return it, I would've had to find a box to ship it back in and then wait ""up to 90 days"" for a return to verify I wasn't lying. Eventually I decided it was bad enough to return and figure it out. As I went through the process, they offered me $100 off to just KEEP the TV and not return it. I took the offer and regret it.I don't know if I just got unlucky but if I had to do it all over again, I would not buy this TV."
"I have the 65 inch version of the same tv and it came with a regular and acceptable remote control.  This one comes with a ""throw in whatever you can find that's a remote"".  I was highly disappointed that the TV is good although the speakers are subpar compared to the 65 inch and then the remote is a joke."
The previous TV I had (T-L) had a much better experience. But the backlight went out after about 6 years. This TV has no tone control. It is very hard to search for apps. The picture is so so. I typed in a search for a movie and it could not find it even though the Amazon Prime app had that movie. Getting back to or trying to find the antenna tv stations very difficult. It will take a lot of getting used to. But very disappointed with it. I would not recommend.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            TV arrived in a timely fashion, no damage to shopping box. Hooked it up and turned it on and the LED panel behind the glass was cracked throughout the entire screen, mirroring other complaints here. Its a great deal but I'm returning it and getting the same thing from a box sorry for peace of mind. User mileage may vary, I just wasn't lucky this time. If you're looking at this, buy it. If anything is wrong with it, just send it back - they'll come pick it up."
Im elderly 'putor dinosaur...& dyslexic HMPH! Took me about an hour or 2 on the phone w/Samsung to set it up. And dealing w/an impatiant tech. Almost in tears...but I pushed thru.
"Great picture, easy setup. The audio went out about a month after buying it."
"Very clear picture. Good value. Do not like the remote it is not user friendly. The buttons do not luminate, the right upper button is suppose to be the microphone instead it’s a multicolored button which I am unable to understand its use. It’s too small and difficult to use. I will have to purchase a better one from Amazon. In addition, there are not many apps installed. I will have to spend more time adding them."
"Was easy to hang on my existing mount. Took three people. It is a big TV.The remote is pathetic! Small and difficult to manage.  No back lite!Decent picture for the money, HATE the remote.Reminds me of how much I don't like my Samsung microwave.Likely my last Samsung purchase."
"I still haven't gotten my streaming channels loaded! I got the most popular ones, although  Paramount+ doesn't show up on the home screen, I have to search for it to find it. Disney+ still isn't on there, between the TV, my cell phone. and my laptop, I can't seem to get that one working. I had the TV for two weeks, but still can't get everything working right.Also the sound. The volume seems to fade over time, I start out at about 40%, but end up having to increase the volume ever hour or so. By the end of the evening its at 80% to 90%. Then when you turn it on the next day, BAM! it's blowing out your eardrums! I have to remember to turn down the volume at the end of the evening before I shut it down for the night.The picture is great though."
"Very sharp image, very bright picture generally, great colors, but all of the whites are super washed out and exaggerated, so much that the detail is lost. Very significant adjustment of every single one of the expert settings does not fix this. I called Samsung Support and they thought it was defective, so I returned it and got another one it was exactly the same. I ended up going with the cheaper model which wasn’t quite as sharp or brilliant but it had normal white balance"
"Television set up should be straightforward and clear, I didn't find this true with this model. Also, less than three months in, the remote stopped responding, the infrared signal isn't working. I spent an hour on a text message and am told I will be sent a new remote - this too, is too sleek and would do better with more buttons rather than a few that do several things. The on-off button when the remote isn't working is very hard to find and requires a lot of effort to turn TV on and off."
"The picture looks good, sound is alright works as intended.  However, the ""Smart"" part of the device that you are paying for is garbage.  It's slow, there is no way to force close an app, clear cache or anything.  Netflix has locked up 3 times already and Ive had it for a week? maybe 4 hours of use per day.  Have to constantly unplug the device and let it sit then plug it back in to get the onboard apps to work again."
"The remote is confusing, and very difficult to use.  If this can't be resolved, I will be returning the TV. The volume button doesn't work well.  Also, the is a voice that navigates every move in the TV, we have no luck in shutting it off.  Not the best TV, not happy at all."
"After 7 years, our previous Amazon flatscreen bit the dust. We bought this Samsung to replace it. We have buyer’s remorse. We wish we had bought another Amazon TV.  This TV sucks.Pros: decent picture and sound (but not any better or worse than any other TV in this price range)Cons: clunky user interface, awful home screen layout, slow to move from one streaming service to another, difficult to navigate through features, hard to download apps, sometimes starts playing random crappy live tv shows when we turn it on, no screensaver, terrible cheap remote (way too narrow, no voice control, stupidly placed buttons, buttons don’t  light up in the dark)"
"Picture quality is perfect. However, the remote is difficult to navigate. I've spent days trying to figure put how to turn up to volume. Super frustrating..😡😡"
Disappointed remote control was NOT voice activated
I expected a remote control and interface similar to the Samsung 75 inch smart tv I bought last year. The remote and interface are near impossible on this tv.  I would have been much better off buying a $228 Roku tv at Walmart
"Description is not correct, the remote is not like a magic remote, (point and click) it is button pressing left and right. Also has no art. Description deceptively makes you think it has the art, which it 100% does not. Picture quality is amazing , per usual Samsung, but I bought it for the remote and art screen saver. Returning."
"The TV arrives with small bubbles in the middle of the screen.  It seems to work okay, but if your purchasing new, you should get new.  Probably going to re-box this unit and return it. Not very happy"
The unit was as advertised. But after purchasing it I discovered it did not have ANY Audio Output Function.Plenty of HDMI Input and a Bluetooth function that would have required a stereo receiver upgrade.
Only con is they changed the remote and base setup where it seems to be more of a pain to switch hdmis with no input button on remote
"The remote doesn't work right. seems every button leads to Netflix.  I can't turn down the volume, it moved to 100%. I can't figure out how to get the volume down.  Small buttons. I just received this TV brand new about 5 days ago. Changed the batteries 4 times, the IR light never comes on. They should send me a new remote as it is still within the warranty period."
im not rating the tv im sure tv is great i love samsung but came broken i believe its amazon dilivery process they need to pack thing like tv with care
The product is fine but the delivery experience was exhausting. The shipper (Ship Right) didn’t deliver for days after the promised delivery date passed. Had to call up Amazon to complain after which the shipper just left a very large package outside and was unwilling to schedule delivery. There were water marks and mildew on the package and obvious holes in the package. Luckily the TV was not damaged and worked fine.
Actually returned this because the picture quality wasn’t good. Also the sound wasn’t great and no optical input that matched my soundbar
"Day two sound wouldn’t go up or down later no sound Next morning sound was on but stopped again.Background pictures blurred Going backReturn was awful They had wrong number , couldn’t contact me so didn’t come Re scheduled gave new number and waited from 1-8pm called to verify they were coming They never came. Waited 2 day for pickup They gave me a UPS LABEL I had to bring to store and have staff unload from car New will buy a large item again Return service was terrible"
"Pretty good TV for the price, but the problem is that there is no way to disable the Bluetooth broadcasting, which means anyone can try to access your TV!Most systems will only broadcast like that while trying to pair, but this one is always on, so it's constantly using extra energy and can even interfere with other nearby signals!"
"Just got this today, give 2 stars for the shipping, no apparent sign of any damage until opened package, there are many dents in the front lower side of screen, and noticeable cracked plastic casing, a brand new tv with many defects, Amazon WTF."
"First off, the batteries for the remote were dead. Had to get new one .Set up instructions inadequate. Have been unable to connect to home WiFi. Enter WiFi password but get error message connection not made. I don't need WiFi to watch TV with Dish, do I? Plugged in Dish but keep getting prompt to connect to WiFi. Not a very  smart  TV."
"We got this tv to replace a roku that I hate. However this Samsung does not seem to be much better. The remote sucks, and the app that I have to use on my phone is full of scams trying to get my cc number.  The picture is ok and the sound is ok, however we did get a sub-woofer and speaker to go with the tv. The remote has not volume control on it and the only thing I can figure out is how to get back to the home page. I will have to say that I would not recommend this tv to anyone."
The tv was advertised as having alexa but it dose not per the samsung representative I talked to. I was also told I needed an echo speaker for alexa to work. The box the tv came in says alexa and has a picture of the remote with an alexa button that I don't have on the one I got. I also ordered a samsung sound bar that is compatible to the tv. Looks like the advertising is misleading.
The TV arrived with the back panel broken
The tv is woukd be perfect if it wasn't for the fact that when ever there aren't a bunch of colors on it yiu can see waves in the screen like someone pressed on it so everytime your watching something your immediately lose all immersion. Don't waste your money on cheap stuff just get the expensive ones they'll pay off better
"At first the tv was great.  Now it won't go to regular tv (?).  It streams on it's own.  Unable to find a source button to put it back to regular tv, is 'MIA'  From what I hear all tv's have a source button.  Beings this tv is way smarter than I, I am not happy with it.  It's not a cable tv provider it's a tv problem.  At $65.00 for them to show up, to see if they can fix the problem or not, still $65.00.  They got it running once, but the next day it went back to what it did when I called them out before.  Not a happy camper."
I’m very disappointed that Amazon said this tv has Alexa on it and it does not. Besides that it isn’t a bad tv but I wouldn’t have bought it I know this.
"Very clear picture, but not as easy friendly older users"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Would be a good tv for the price. Except mine came with cracks in the seal at the top of the screen. Looks like the seal has been somewhat eroded or not applied properly. Not sure , but I will be returning it and picking a different product entirely to avoid any future problems"
"Save your money and get a quality TV. This ""smart” tv is anything but that. I can’t connect my gaming consoles due to the issues with their ""source inputs” instead of having a basic source button they made it overly complicated and tries to auto detect my console when it’s connected. Then while it’s powered on it says the console is off and then when I click on the button to take me to the HDMI source for the console it turns the console off. Worst tv I’ve ever owned. I will pay 3x the cost of this to get a regular non-smart TV. Not to mention major lag switching between streaming services if they even come up at all. Will likely be returning."
Badly cracked screen on arrival... now I have a huge return to deal with. :/
"The picture is great for videos taking the whole tv screen with light and colorful scenes. When watching a movie with dark scenes the picture quality becomes terrible, clearly showing severe backlight coming from points around the edge of the TV (the TV tries to make the image lighter). This is not normal, especially comparing it to a similar LG TV in the same price range. A good benchmark to test the TV is ""The Rings Of Power"" on Prime, which looks terrible. I decided to spend a bit more and got a Roku TV. It is great."
My biggest gripe with this tv is you only get 2 options on screen size 6:9 & 4:3 you can’t get full screen. Picture quality is not so good either.
"the bezel is so thin and doesn’t protect the TV. Having the first time hung with two people when we were trying to hang it up the tv, front was cracked and we never touched there to it as from loading in box (they open from bottom now). I finally got a replacement it has been fine ever since. Now I just touched the bezel. (Side of tv slightly touched but installed strep by step.  Not even the front with no pressure at all and it has lines now going up the screen. I’ve bought a lot of TVs for me all and this should not have been cracked. It is wall mounted and I re-angled it, but I held the back of the TV not the front or by the basil to move it so it shouldn’t have cracked. ."
"This is a piece of garbage. The product descriptipn clearly states that Alexa is built it. When I tried to connect this soundbar to Alexa, a firmware download failed using their Smatthings app. I called Samsung tech support. After more than a hour, two different departments, I was told this device doesn't have a built in Alexa. They obviously don't know their own product. They tried several times to push the update and that failed. The next tech told me to buy a USB drive, connect it to my laptop and and they would email a link to download. No guarantee that that would work. Save your money and do not buy this device."
"When we opened the box, the screen was cracked."
Unit came in damaged I went a replacement but can’t see an option. Unit damaged 0n right bottom where stand area . Also the  foam packing inside box is damaged. Also do not see option for pictures. Had to put in a review to show pictures.  Had do in cancel the extended warranty on this product. Because shipping back today. Would have like a replacement but also did not have an option. Only one star because of shipping. Can’t speak on the product itself. Did not get the chance to use the TV
"It arrived and it looked fine and I wrapped it up for a birthday present. After a month of storing it for my husband‘s birthday, he unwrapped it. it looks fine plug it in and The screen has huge marks on it and they won’t refund it because it’s past the 30 days since I bought ahead of time and stored it during black Friday. Now I have a broken and I can’t return it. It’s even in the original plastic still."
There is a black curve reflection / blur from inside the tv . I would need a replacement
"2 stars because the picture is wonderful.  The remote is horrible. Before buying this TV, take into consideration that it has No voice capabilities and using a Fire stick with voice control causes a weird static/popping sound."
"The hdmi ports connect my PS5 and Apple TV, but they aren’t fully functional. The eARC port does not connect my soundbar. Tried to call customer service, couldn’t set an appointment for what they had available across 7 days, tried calling back, now they won’t let me open a new ticket because the old one is caught in the system or something. This is my second and last Samsung TV. It doesn’t work any better than a Vizio so why pay the premium?"
"TV might have been fine but when we received it, back side had a crack down the whole back. Received it quick but have to wait till it gets back to the warehouse to start the refund process which may take 2 weeks extra. Not happy I get it quick but to order a replacement we have to wait much longer.Lessoned learned I guess NOT to order a high priced item for delivery."
Tv will not turn off!
"Basic Bluetooth functionality is too much to ask for a 400 dollar television. Connection would quit when switching between apps and even when playing the next youtube video in a playlist. I couldn't even wait in the menu too long without my connection dropping. After samsung support failed to help with a factory reset and hung up on my call, the Bluetooth isn't even pairing anything. A name isn't quality. Avoid this trash brand."
I unpacked the TV and put it on a stand as instructed. I pugged in the TV and it worked perfectly at first. After a couple hours the TV stopped working. At first I thought it might have disconnected from the Internet. So I connected an Ethernet Cable to it. This did not solve the problem so I turned the TV off and unplugged it for about a minute. I plugged it back up and turned the TV back on. The Samsung Logo did not appear and it just stayed on a black screen for about 10 minutes and then shut off. The TV was bought brand new and it’s broken after 2 hours of use. I am returning this but have to wait 30 days for a refund from Amazon before I can buy another since they did not offer to replace the broken television.
"Remote control was flimsy and di not power on. Tried the batteries that came with the product, tried my own new batteries. Nothing. no red sensor light to be seen when pushing power button on. Called Amazon product support and got 10 minutes of happy, word salad ""feelings"" chatter and told it was a reps birthday. ""Product support"" was simply an off-shored help desk that did not know anything about the product.  After 10 minutes Amazon told me they were not able to simply replace my remote control!!!!!!!!! I did not want to return the TV, but they made it impossible to get a simple, inexpensive resolution. Off to Best Buy to get a TV. ."
"I ordered it on dec 11. I received a tv with a cracked screen, which I found out after I installed it and turned it on. Double waste of time. Then I started the return process. Pick on the 22nd. I won’t have a refund before mid Jan. I’m not going to buy another one before I get my refund. No new tv for Christmas. Thanks."
"Arrived a day late and damaged (screen cracked) with no visible damage to shipping box which tells me it was packaged this way from the manufacturer. I cannot fit the box in my car so have no choice but to have Amazon pick it back up and the soonest is 6 days out, refund could take another 7 days. Very disappointed with Samsung and Amazon. I will not be re-ordering on here."
I bought this tv and after setting up the first time it looked fine. I turned it off. Couple of hours later it has lines on the screen (the one with the football game). I contacted Amazon and they sent me a replacement. Upon turning on for the very first time the screen was broken again (the one with the welcome screen). I am very disappointed that 2 tvs were broken. I don’t know if this is a software issue or a delivery issue but either way I am very disappointed with it.
"Going to install this Moring and give a review of this Samsung smart tv in the very near future.UPDATE: AS OF OCTOBER 19TH 2024 DAY AFTER RECEIVING THE SAMSUNG TV AND SPENDING NEARLY 2 HOURS READING INSTRUCTIONS AND MOUNTING THE UNIT, I PLUGGED IT IN ONLY TO DISCOVER THE TV HAD A BLACK SCREEN AND WOULD NOT POWER DOWN. DEFECTIVE!Currently beginning the return process and will report as to how Amazon handles the matter via a review.A MONTH AFTER RETURNING THE DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG TV AND STILL NO REFUND FROM AMAZON. Will be canceling my prime membership!"
"Tv screen was not wrapped, just packages with some bubble wrap against the screen, not the way you would receive a brand new tv. Also the tv won’t to my network and I’ve been working with Samsung to get this resolved. I have a feeling I was sold a refurbished tv that still is not in working order. I’d stay away from this seller"
"I guess you really get what you pay for. This really is a terrible TV. First thing out of the box screen backlight is damaged so nothing shows on the screen. Contacted Samsung for warranty and they diagnose the issue and pick it up. They come back with the TV a week later and I kid you not, the tv turns on with huge tears in the screen. Samsung rep looks embarrassed and asks to take the tv back again. They do so and I have to wait another week. This is a horrendous product with weak service and will never buy from Samsung again."
"This seems as though it is a very nice television however when I got it out of the box, the screen was completely shattered. Box had no damage to it except one small place where the packaging strap was at. Hopefully the replacement comes without any issues. Depending on how smoothly the replacement goes, I will update my review."
I saved the TV until it was my brother's birthday and when he opened the box containing the Samsung TV it was damaged on the bottom right corner and the TV would not come on or anything. It was a great day until he opened it up and saw that the screen appeared to be smashed in.
"The Samsung 65 inch TV was a big disappointment from day 1.  I contacted Samsung customer service to help with issue and was on phone for hours (5 plus hours ) and kept being transferred from representative to representative and no one seemed to want to help or didn't know what to do. I was so frustrated that I just decided to return TV, it was not worth the money or time I spent trying to get help."
"No optical output for soundbar. You can bluetooth, but theres no auto-connect, so you have to accept a prompt every time you turn on the tv. The CEC is subpar. Turning my tv off would also put my roku in standby. Now it just keeps streaming.Samsung is forcing me to buy new stuff when my current stuff worked fine, just to appease its new dumbed down connections.The universal remote also doesnt sync with roku.Horrible experience.  Basically, i have to keep 3 remotes handy when 1 used to work perfectly.Smart TVs are not smart. Tizen OS is terrible and super limiting. I kept searching the menu trying to find practical options I find on most devices and was shocked to find how little you can customize."
First one was broken was told not to do anything another one will be delivered found out not so ordered another to come Friday didn’t come was told to select another delivery date did so for Sunday have to stay home from church hoping it will show up in one piece.
"I noticed some oddities when I was unpacking the TV. The band that go around the box were cut and stuffed into the box. The bag that holds the remote and power cable was already open. The remote had finger smudges all over it and the batteries already in it.  Took the TV out and placed it on the entertainment stand and what do ya know, the entire screen shattered. It looks like this TV was previously opened and repacked. Paid for a new TV and what I got was a repacked broken one. Buyer beware."
One side is higher than the other delivery was included with set up package. This was not even checked to see if it was inserted correctly so now the TV is off level
When this tv I had to wait for help to open it up. This looks as if it had some thing done to it. Now you’ll need to replace this tv with a new one not this defected one that was sent to me.
Our smart TV was broken from the whole screen and we barely open it and came like that I'm so upset with how it came.I need to get my refund of money and tv back in the less possible time please.
"Received my 65in with the screen damaged as shown in pictures. Contacted customer service and suppose to be sending a replacement, but decided not to chance it with the replacement being the same way so refund it is."
Box was partially crushed on left side. Didn't open the TV until a few days after receiving and noticed the TV is bent on the left side as well. Sort of looks like creased plastic. Will be returning.
"This was purchased as a prize for a work event. Unfortunately, when it was opened, it was cracked even with white glove shipping. The return timeframe was only three weeks, and we missed the window. Very disappointing."
"Delivery was ok and on time. TV started but it didn’t last even an hour, it turned off by itself and we were not able to turn it back on. Big disappointment as we took a long time saving and making a decision on which one to get. We paid more for the brand but we were wrong. We have started the return process with Amazon but had already thrown away the box."
"THIS ITEM SHOWED UP DEFECTIVE, WITH A BLURRY SCREEN AND TWO VISIBLE PERMANENT LINES IN THE DISPLAY; THIS WAS EXPORTED TO THE BAHAMAS, SO THERE IS NO WAY TO RETURN THE ITEM. THERE IS NO DAMAGE TO THE BOX; ONCE WE SPOKE WITH THE VENDOR, WE WERE TOLD THAT SOMETIMES A FACTORY-DAMAGED UNIT  SLIPS THROUGH, SO NOW WE ARE STUCK WITH A $ 1,000.00 PAPERWEIGHT. AMAZON CREDITED 25% OF THE COST, VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE-"
"Product was delivered damaged, it was returned 3 weeks ago and my money still hasn’t been refunded. Originally I was told the refund would happen on 11/23 and now I’m being told 12/3.  Still waiting."
I stated above the interface absolutely sucks on this TV should have just bought a better brand but it also reminds me why don't buy Samsung my mistake won't make that again can't even get the TV to power down by simply hitting the power button nothing smart about this TV
"The TV itself was easy to set up, although a bit time-consuming what with all the signing in and all that for apps...I like the interface better than the different brand that I have in my living room.Overall, it seems like a perfectly good TV. However, I bought it specifically because it plays .MKV video files theough a usb thumb drive. Some tv's do not play those files.So when I got it, I immediately checked to make sure it did work with those files. It did.So I mounted it on my wall -And if you've ever done that you know what a pain it can be - Only to find out that in the end I couldn't use the TV with that mount because they stupidly PUT THE USB ON THE BOTTOM of the TV, and most TV mounts block it.So I couldn't get my hand in behind the mount to take the USB in and out.I say it's a design flaw, because even aside from the issue I have with the wall mount, having the USB on the bottom makes it very difficult to put in and pull out. And with the mount, it's impossible.So if you don't use a USB to play files ever, then this TV seems to be a good choice.However if you do use a USB, this TV makes using it a real pain, or impossible with many TV mounts.Now I have to either keep the TV and get a new TV mount, drill more holes etc in the wall. Or I have to return the TV for one that will work with the TV mount I have.My living room TV has everything on the side. The HDMI connections, the USB, and so on.This one puts the HDMI connections on the side, but the USB on the bottom, which - as I said - makes it difficult or impossible to use.Why they would put the USB slot on the bottom is beyond me!"
The TV's visual quality is fine but somehow we received our TV with a massive dent on the back. Didn't notice until we put it up. This causes the screen to curve slightly. Not a huge deal to us for what we're using it for so not really worth the time to send back but makes you think if it was packaged or delivered like this?
"Took over 3 weeks to get, you have to pay for the 4k quality.  There is fales advertisement on it. Saying you you get 4k, you do but it is a membership you have to get.Other then that everything works alright"
"This maybe a great TV. If you're looking for a normal TV for a bedroom/living room then this review probably doesn't apply but if you want to use this as a monitor read on.I bought this TV to use as a monitor for a computer. I've been using a different brand 4K Roku TV as a monitor for a few years now and I love it. When I saw this one on sale I thought it would be a good option for a second setup. I read reviews on other sites that said the Roku Select was a good option as a monitor. I'm not sure what TV they reviewed but this one is not good.It does work, and in the right circumstances I can get 4k at 60hz and RGB 4:4:4 but I can still see the LEDs. In a close viewing situation, less than three feet, one pixel lines are a series of dots not a line. Grayed areas are more of a checker board pattern than gray. It's like everything has screen door in front of it. I've tried adjusting backlight, brightness, contrast, and other settings and nothing makes a makes it perfect. The dimmer it is does seem to make it worse.That is also when I can get those settings. Most of the time I can only get 4k 30hz and RGB 4:4:4 or some times 4k 60hz YCbCr 4:2:2. Some of this may be limitations of my GPU but I don't seem to have this issue with my other Roku TV.So if you're planning to use this as a monitor less than three or four feet away would avoid this one."
"I got the 43 inch for my bedroom. I’m not sure of the measurements on my bedroom, but it’s probably average size. I wouldn’t say it’s a large bedroom by any means. I have a queen size bed and my tv is just a couple feet away from the foot of the bed. Even on this tv’s darkest picture setting it still illuminates my room. I like this tv otherwise. I just wish it wasn’t so bright. I’m also thinking I could’ve done better with a slightly smaller tv."
"As you can see in the picture we were only given wood screws, not the ones shown in the  instruction book."
nice TV. but shuts off when I first start it. Have to start it twice most of the time. I just hope it lasts for a while.
"Tv works fine. When I try to use my cable box, spectrum doesn’t have codes to program the remote. They argued with me that Roku doesn’t make TVs and there had to be some other brand name. Please get code to spectrum to program a spectrum cable remote."
"Right off the bat, please know that the sound is really bad. I mean, really, really bad. Minus 1 star for this. You will want to add a sound bar if more than 1 person is watching or use the phone app & listen in Headphone mode for personal viewing. You could also add a bluetooth speaker & listen with the phone app by selecting the app’s Headphone mode.  FYI - it does offer sound through the remote control, but this chews thru batteries at a ridiculous rate. Phone app is the best sound option, imo.The tv is super easy to link to wifi & set up. Nice, simple remote. It was a little challenging to get my LG DVD player to work via hdmi. For some reason, this Roku tv only recognizes my old-school dvd player as a BlueRay player input. It only works when plugged into the far right HDMI port. Neither of the other 2 HDMI ports recognize my dvd player. Weird! Unfortunately, the tv does not allow you to use the phone app to listen to dvd’s. The tv itself does not have bluetooth. Minus 1 star for this.My picture color is somewhat green. I have not figured out how to manually adjust the color yet.Good price. Easy set up. Bonus for me is the legs are recessed toward the middle, rather than located on the far ends. This is great, allowing me to put this size TV on a smaller console table. If they fixed the sound issues, I would give 5 stars."
"I have spent a ridiculous. amount of time trying to attach cable. Hookup location is nearly impossible to access - tight to TV with obstruction below. Finding a more flexible cable took time. Finally got it, but shouldnn't be this hard."
The thing about buying a 50-inch TV is that you have to have somebody who can help you especially if you're older. So as much as I wanted to keep the television I couldn't because I couldn't lift it and I had no one to help me. So there's my story
"I received the TV, set it up and everything works great. However, I later found out I am missing the charging cord for the remote which comes with rechargeable batteries. I tried contacting customer service and instead of sending me the cord, I would have to return the entire TV. That doesn't make any sense."
"I dunno, seems like there are a lot of good ratings. My experience is not great. The TV picture is okay, at least to me, color is okay. But beware that I'm half blind, so maybe I'm not the best judge. Or maybe I am. If you're an eye surgeon, maybe you know how these issues affect TV viewing. :::shrug:::What I hate:1. I always knew this was why I did not want a TV with a smart thing built in. I like my Rokus, and this TV comes with a Roku. I think they get these out of the clearance bin. It's always have to reload apps, doesn't matter whether it's Netflix, Apple, whatever. It just has to reload. A LOT.2. The apps/channels take a lot longer to load than when I use separate Rokus on different TVs. Netflix takes forever for the logo and sound to arrive. Youtube, same. Max, same. And so on. Again, Roku obviously an old model from the junk bin.3. The Roku has to be restarted a lot more often. Sound craps out a lot, and a restart fixes it, until next time.4. Now, when I turn on the TV, the roku turns it back off. As soon as it's on. It may take ten tries to get the TV to stay on. I've fiddled with settings, checked things. Confirming the Roku is from Santa's return box of junk. Let's give these old returned Rokus to the TV company.This is a cheap TV/Roku combo. It's not very good. You get what you pay for, except I've had much better quality TVs (with Bring Your Own Roku/Fire thing by Apple) and they die at about 1.5 years of age. My motto: make sure you spend the extra and buy the insurance. At least that company makes it good, minus tax and shipping/handling if there is any. You have to eat the tax...thanks cheapo Uncle Sam. You get your taxes again and again. Kind of a ripoff.I would never buy this brand or a Roku/TV combo again. Unless it was on sale for one dollar. Then I might."
"The TV has a great picture. The only issue we are having is that the remote isn't working correctly. We have trouble shot and done all the things, but the remote is crap."
"I have an older ROKU and it's wonderful. Great vivid screen and I like their software a lot. I haven't figured out how to set it up so it powers up with the XBOX but that's a minor complaint.I feel like this is a fair review as it really is a 3 star TV. If I watch a movie or regular TV such as sports, it's not a clear picture and as a primary TV I'd be disappointed. But I purchased this as a secondary TV so my two boys could play with each other on XBOX and of all the ""things"" to watch, the XBOX is not bad. Speakers are good too.Although I give it 3 stars, I'm just being honest about the quality of getting what you pay for; for the low  price it is a solid buy and I am glad I got it."
"Enjoy the easy of use, but the colors and sound are less than ideal."
"Good but not great picture.  Do not like sound quality at all - sounds like coming through a tunnel.  We've tried different adjustments to the sound and picture and neither are as good as our 10 year old LG TV.  The sound is better through streaming than through cable TV but picture is no better.  Plus since we still have cable TV we have to use the Roku remote to turn the new TV on and off and to adjust the volume.  Then we have to switch to our Spectrum remote to navigate through our cable channels.  So now we need two remotes just to watch cable.  We also have issues with a pixelating picture periodically.  Never had that with our old LG tv.  The new tv also has a more distorted side viewing angle than our old tv.  Our old LG looked great from any angle.  We bought this TV to replace our old LG tv with Roku stick, but we are so dissatisfied with this Roku TV we're going to put it in the bedroom and put our old LG tv back in the living room as our main tv."
After a week the audio developed very distracting vibrations and distortions. Will try a sound bar with it but its really just complete junk at this point.The picture is good and the ethernet connection reduces alot of loading issues but it doesn't matter because the audio makes it unwatchable.
I’m sure this a great TV….but it arrived damaged. No box damage so happened prior to being shipped. I will update on the return experience at a later date.
Had this for awhile.  It connects to the Internet with no issues.  Have noticed it coming back on about 15 minutes after turning it off.
"ouldn't get it to work with HDMI input from my computer. The instructions are confusing. FA screen appeared say input pair your remote? What does that mean and how do you do it?  I thought it meant pair your remote with other remotes that you have (I have three other Roku 50"" TVs, but they are much older.Finally called support - langauge was a barrier. You have to push and hold two buttons at the same time to ""pair"" (actually, esrablish connection) between the remote and the Roku TV.  Proceeded to look for connection to HDMI port 1, but could not find that choice. Only choices were wireless or wired, and wired was limited to connecting to my router via ethernet.Roku help desk person spent 45 minutes. Got overthe first hurdles. But still can't connect to HDMI."
"I am so very disappointed in this product. I’ve only had it for two months and the last two weeks in the middle of watching TV. The TV turns off. I’m unable to get it back on even after unplugging it and waiting a significant amount of time. Open the next day it will come back on. However, a few days later, and it goes off again. Not sure what the issue is"
"The upgrades in the screen makes watching a pleasure!!  I’m a person whom streams period.Why not purchase a tv that’s designed for just that! I’m disappointed with the lack of ability toPlug headphones into the TV ! I don’t understand that at all? I mean really disappointed, I’ve never seen a TV that lacks that ability!!"
"11/29/2024 update: I called Roku Support - Ticket # 10874308. They confirmed the steps below are the only way to watch via local antenna TV on this television. You cannot just perform the Settings steps once then, next time you turn on the TV, watch local TV via antenna without going through the Settings steps every time. Deal killer for me. Thankfully Amazon is accepting the return even though I no longer have the box.11/25/2024 update: I found posts with a workaround to the issue of not being able to view channels via your home antennae rather than streaming Roku channel.The steps are:Go to ... Settings > TV Inputs > Live TV > Manage channels - check Hide streaming channels > Scan for channels. On Set up Live TV, OK on Antenna. You will see ""Scanning for channels..."" When you see the ""You're done!"" screen, select ""Watch live TV"". You are now able to view your antennae channels.If that was the end of it it wouldn't be too bad. However, EVERY TIME you you start the TV, you must go through all these steps again.  Has anyone found a way to correct this so it sticks?11/22/2024 post: I setup the TV today, connected it to the antennae, and scanned for channels. But there seems to be no way to view actual antennae TV. Watch Live TV is via the ROKU app. It's effectively streaming. Some programs available via antennae, like ABC Nightly News, are not available. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove the ROKU app and/or remove my ROKU account from the TV."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I can't believe I'm resorting to writing a review.I purchased the 50"" TV back in June. A couple of weeks ago the speakers started fading in/out and now whenever there is bass, it is unintelligible and very crackly. See video with volume on. That's not a bad phone recording. That's what the speakers on the TV sound like all the time. All I watch is YouTube and stream some shows, so it's not like I personally blew out the speakers blasting music.It was outside the 30 day return window for Amazon, so they suggested working directly with Roku since they have that 1 year warranty. Funny enough, Roku suggests working with Amazon.Over multiple calls with Roku's customer service they tell me I should receive an email with further directions/follow-up and then hang up. The email never comes. The only time I made traction was when I started a new call with an Amazon employee and had them on the call with me while talking with the Roku representative. They even chimed in when Roku was trying to redirect me back to Amazon's customer support. This finally gets through to Roku support, they tell me they will ship me a replacement TV and give me a ticket number to write down, and an email confirmation should come shortly. Both me and the Amazon said, ""Great!""Well the email never comes. After a few days, I call Roku support with the ticket number and they have no idea what I'm talking about and start me back at square one troubleshooting for the TV (literally turning it on/off again). I call Amazon literally this morning and they again tell me to work with the manufacturer.This has been a miserable experience. It's such a stupid first world problem and I just want my money back at this point. I hope your TV works well and you don't have to follow up on any warranty. I will not be purchasing a TV through Amazon or a Roku device ever again."
"Picture quality was surprisingly good and the Roku interface worked flawlessly.Attaching the feet was not acceptable. The screws for the feet provided were too short to firmly and fully attach the feet to the TV leaving a wobbly scary result. In addition, after the first time screwing them in, the screw heads which are made of very soft metal were already stripped. Customer service was a bit tedious and resulted in a package from them a week later with only one foot (and it was the wrong one and for a much larger TV) with the wrong screws. Luckily the wrong  screws were a little longer and a tad fatter and after using them instead, I was able to attach the original feet reasonably well. The TV still wobbles a bit because the feet asssembly is very poorly designed and are made of a plastic material that is too flexible . They should be made of metal and should just slide in without havlng screws at all."
"Set up was easy- you can change brightness of picture but does not have that great contrast- cheap price but if you want better quality, pay the extra $"
"I think Roku is the best TV is generally. It’s very simple, works well, and supports all streaming platforms.I’m docking 2 stars because there are too many ads on the Home Screen. You can disable some of them in settings but they’ll get automatically switched back on. For example a new promotion category called “Summer of Streaming” just appeared, and I had to disable it in settings, even though I already hid all prior promotions. There should be a “disable all current and future promotions” option in settings."
Very slow connecting to wi-fi
"Picture quality and sound are very good. However, connecting bluetooth headphones is impossible. There is no option for connecting headsets or single speakers. You cant connect a single speaker, it has to be a pair. I need options that are quiet so i can watch at night when others are sleeping. This TV does not support those options."
"It worked great for 6 months, then suddenly it can't find the internet. It's a wired connection. My desktop computer is right next to it and it works perfect. I can watch movies on my computer, but forget the TV. Reset all setting back to default and it still can't find the internet when it tries to update. Only thing is it must be the ethernet port, but when I connected wirelessly - it does that same thing."
"I got this to use as a cheap large 4K display for a home office, but this TV is a poor fit for that role. The image itself is fine if a bit grainy, but the setup forces you to connect the TV to the internet to even use the HDMI inputs and has ACR that scans what you show on the screen (supposedly can be turned off but I don't trust Roku) which is a serious privacy concern when using this display for sensitive work info.Also the way the display is manufactured the edges get cut off when viewed at monitor distance which also hurts my use case. Probably will be returning and getting something that doesn't force me into going online."
"This is a great Roku TV that is easy to install and configure.  My Amazon transaction, however, didn't go smoothly.  It took almost three weeks for the set to be delivered - and when it was, it was obvious that the set wasn't new, but an ""open box"" item that had been returned (the straps for securing the box in transit were missing, and the taping of the box was haphazard).  Even worse, when I opened the box I found that the TV's screen was shattered (see photos).To Amazon's credit, they picked up my return at my home within 24 hours, and quickly refunded my purchase.  But be careful if you purchase this one."
The remote doesn’t work so will be reaching out to get a new one. I would not recommend buying this on Amazon. Maybe buy in person at a store so you know what you’re getting.
This little Roku device simply didn't work no matter what I tried. There was only one piece to plug it in to so all I can think of is that it was defective.
the volume on ths tv is terrible  I have it on 100 and can hardly hear it and what i do hear is hard to understand.  i would love to send it back and just might do that
"I used this product for my sister who can't get out, she is 79 years old. She has a personal speaker that she uses that is Bluetooth connected. This description you have on this TV says it has Bluetooth, when in fact it doesn't. Cost another 60.00 to get a transmitter to make it Bluetooth. it is a beautiful TV but I am very disappointed to have to spend more than she had....."
"Like I said, the Internet wouldn’t hook to it so I sent it back and they took it with no problem"
"TV works great, but the speaker is horrendous. I guess this is how they want you to purchase a separate sound bar."
"My cheap-ass 8+ year old TV has better audio quality, this thing sounds like its speakers are made out of tin cans"
This is the third time I've had this TV replaced in 2 months. It just stops streaming and goes back to the main menu. We'll see how this third one works when I receive it. I do not like the fact that the colors are very bright and you have to change the color for each show you watch.
"This TV has a beautiful picture, but the Optical output is completely useless. It has a TERRIBLE audio video latency. I have a very high-end surround sound system and I cannot use it. I have no interest in returning it, because it is a brand-new TV, why would a replacement be any different? It is a pretty nice TV, and it has a really great picture quality, but waste your money on any audio system for it."
I'm really surprised how bad the audio is.It just doesn't sound good at all.I was going to go ahead and add a Roku Streambar pro since i know they sound good (my parents have one) but I see now they've been discontinued.I guess I'll need to get a soundbar or wireless speakers.
"I researched and researched trying to find the best TV for the size, benefits, and screen quality.I settled hereI noticed that the smart TV part runs rather slow and sticks.My 10-year-old TV had a better screen quality.It is not a horrible TV by any means and not worth returning.I just hope it lasts"
I love this TV for the price but the quality of the audio is poor. I suggest that you purchase the TCIF soundbar to provide good quality audio that you need..
"TV lasted for a little less than 4 months. The screen is black, but you can hear sound from it. I looked up how to fix it. Nothing has worked. A TV should not go bad that quick. It was working great before then."
"If you want a large screen this will do it.  However if you want a clear, sharp true 4K picture, either settle for a smaller screen or spend a few hundred dollars more."
Picture is excellent however the sound is very tinny.  Various efforts to adjust it via the menu options were unsuccessful.
"so i loved the tv description and everything it was gonna be used for it was perfect, but i didn't get to try this item cause mine came broken.. but it was a good sized tv,  i would of loved to try this tv and give it a better review cause my review on it was gonna sell another 3 tvs if i liked mine, but on another note it did come on time and they handled this situation well."
"I should have turned it on first thing. I gave it a glance over and the screen (not on/black) & all looked OK. Went ahead and mounted the wall bracket to the back, put on my expensive govee backlighting system bought 2 hours worth of work just to plug it in and see this.There's other reviewers whose also came shattered. Word to the wise, cut the annoying tie wrapped cord and plug it in first, don't just examine it  from the outside.At 5'2 Muscling a 65"" TV back into its original packaging and down two flights of stairs to my front porch, by myself, for Amazon pick up was no easy feat. But At least they're coming to get it."
"I have used ROKU sticks on my Samsung TVs for years with minimal problems so I figured I would just buy a ROKU TV this time and expected the same quality. NOPE! The apps (netflix, youtube, etc.) randomly just drop out and return me to the home scree. I then go back into the app and try to restart the movie, sometimes with luck other times it just drops me out again.I strongly suggest avoiding the TV and use the ROKU sticks on other brand TVs if you want Roku.I don't know what ROKU is doing with these TVs but between the apps dropping and their data collecting and ad serving, I will probably start moving toward different streaming options."
"I bought this from amazon from a 3rd party and there was a problem with the tv... I called them up and they said send it back after 20 days of me having it sounds good ,not so good...they told me to ship it back by my local carrier that.sounds good right. NOPE have no box and it coasts  1/2 the cost of the tv to send a defective tv back.. I bought a samson but ups smashed the screen so amazon took it back no questions ask, AMAZON IS GREAT. These people sent a defective tv and  I suffer.I should of bought to another samson and not bought a ROKU from a 3rd. party...Buyer of tv.s  beware 3rd party sellers"
Disliked Tv picture Quality and the going off and on and not being able to watch Tv comfortably and not being able to enjoy my New Tv.
"At first power on, it'll ask you to select your language of choice then ask if you want to set up for home or for ""store"". Selecting home setup forces you to give it internet access via cable or wifi so it can then make you sign in with a roku account. This already put it 1 step in the grave for me.Selecting ""store"" setting rather than home, removes most menu options you'd expect to have beyond basic settings and will show things that look like ads every so often on the screen until you dig through the settings to hide that too.The final nail in the coffin for this TV was the awful audio latency/lag. The audio when delivered via HDMI lags behind a solid 150ms to 250ms compared to the video regardless of passthrough, encoding settings, or ""game mode"" adjustments. Far too distracting of a delay to watch anything on."
"The TV did not work properly.  The screen went on but looked like something was pushed into it because it only showed weird streaks and figures.  I was EXTREMELY careful with it.  Trying to return it was a nightmare.  I was given a First class USPS label.  I went to 2 post offices.  They both said the post office has not allowed first class postage for parcels for a year.  The 2nd PO said I needed a Ground Advantage parcel label.  The Seller said that Amazon had to supply the correct label and Amazon said the opposite.  After lugging the TV (I'm not very young) to and back from 2 post offices, and only thing that happened was a lot of wasted time and pulled muscles.  Amazon did step up and is giving me a gift card credit to use on Amazon."
"The TV was great the first evening we installed it. Beautiful picture and sound. The second day it developed a vertical line of blue pixels, had to return it."
"Amazing tv for a bedroom, except that when I turn it off, it makes a buzzing noise... still looking for a solution, but if don't, will replace the TV. Would be a shame."
Everything works good except sound which is ok... I had to buy a sound bar to fix this and it's a good tv for the price.
"This TV worked for less than a day before I started to get an error message stating, ""This USB device requires more power. For more help, visit: go . ruko . com / USB.""Note: I have no USB devices connected to the TV, yet the error persists.I did some research online and it seems that this is a common issue on Roku TV 's, which apparently has no fix.Pros:- Great picture quality- Nice remoteCons:- Very thin sounding speakers- Suffers from what seems to be a combination of bad hardware and software, which causes a constant on-screen USB error even though I have no USB devices connected to the TVOverall, I would not recommend this TV to anyone based solely on this error message that takes up the lower quarter of the screen.Update 11/08/2024:Frustrating error message is still on screen, covering captions and any other information that would be in that area.This is the WORST product I have ever purchased in my life."
"We missed the return window, so now this dissappointing purchase is relegated to the basement.  Why:  The sound volume buttons on the Roku remote never worked.  I had to use the cable TV remote to adjust or mute the sound and going on line didn't help.  The cable connection kept losing the signal until I pullded the HDMI cable out and reinserted a few times, very annoying.  The home screen is full of icons (on screen buttons) you might not ever use, but can't get rid of.  There are more things but, I will say the picture is pretty good."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I’m so mad because I had 60 inches TV before and it was bigger this looks like a 40 inch and I’m pissed off I feel like I got gypped because even the man who put it up said this is not a 50 inch
"The TV turns on by itself in the middle of the night. It's a problem because the TV is in the main bedroom. I have contacted support twice, spending over 2 hours on the phone with no solution. They claim they will send an email with a solution, but no email has come. They have terrible customer support. Do not buy a Roku Smart TV unless you can fix it yourself."
Handled with care for sure works great all functions work perfectly
"For a streaming TV, the promotes fact as a selling point, it kicks me out of hulu netflex and prime everyday several times a day to the point of not being able to watch the programs is frustrating. Had it in my main family room moving it to an upstairs bedroom. May it will allow visitors to watch regular TV or just maybe one show they stream without kicking them out. Poor streaming devise. Maybe will attach a fire stick to it for better streaming. I should have spend my money on a Samsung or LG."
"I wanted to use this TV with my amazon fire stick.  The TV forces you to create an account wiht ROKU before you can use it.  It also forces connection to your WIFI , which isn't needed if your using an Amazon firestick.  IT also doesn't let you switch to any of the HDMI inputs.  It effectivly wants you to abandon your amazon fire acocunt and use Roku.  No thank you.  I returned it"
"THIS IS SO SAD, T.V. WAS BOUGHT FOR A VET, DISABLED ON OXIGEN.  ALL HE HAS FOR ENTERTAINMENT IS A TV.  THIS TV WORKED FOR ONLY 35 DAYS.  I JUST SAT AND CRIED IT MADE ME SO MAD!!!WHAT HAPPENED TO QUALITY PRODUCTS.  I WILL SAY THAT AMAZON WAS GREAT AND IN NO WAY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS PRODUCTS DEFFECTS.  THEY WERE HELPFUL ON GETTING ME THE INFO TO DEAL DIRECTLY WITH THE MANUFACTURER SINCE MY WARRENTY WITH THEM HAD EXPIRED 5 DAYS BEFORE.  BEWARE OF ROKU SMART TV'S, NOT SO SMART OF A DEAL.  UPDATE:  I HAVE SENT 2 EMAILS AND I PHONE CALL TO ROKU, NO RESPONSE 4 DAYS AND COUNTING, THIS COMPANY IS NOT TO BE TRUSTED.  WE ARE NOT ABLE TO REPLACE THIS TV FINANCAILY, SO THE POOR MAN JUST SITS THERE, IT BREAKS MY HEART."
"This TV is very, very dim. I realize the price, $199 on sale, is a cheap TV. But the colors are terrible, its dark even on the brightest  and vivid settings etc. Im familiar with dialing in TVs. I have 10 TVs in my house currently. This is garbage and definitely  a “you get what you pay for” scenario. Spend a little more and steer clear of this one"
"This ROKU ""smart"" TV is aggressively switching into demo and advertising modes. I tried both the Store and Home modes. The Store mode launches internally stored ROKU advertising. The Home mode demands internet connection before it can even be turned on.Deleting the ROKU apps in this TV, also removed those apps from other ROKU devices associated with that account. If you don't want All-ROKU behavior, then use a separate throw-away ROKU account during setup.When configured in Home mode with no apps, computer screen display via HDMI is fuzzy. It is downconverted and anti-aliased."
After one month it won’t connect to the internet reliably. Roku won’t help at all and is blaming it on my internet provider. The TV is completely useless at this point. Don’t waste your time and money.
After purchasing tv when 2 months old it stopped working correctly.  It took roku a month to send a replacement and within a few days it stopped working correctly.  Of course I can't return now and the the support is horrible.
Used tv for 3 days and picture went black. I could hear sound but no picture. Tried all the reset and trouble shooting ideals. No dice.. Im not happy!!!! Waiting on manufacturers to replace.. Didn't keep box to send back to Amazon.. Lesson learned!!
"I purchased this THIS IS SO DAMN MISLEADING.  THE ACTIAL SCREEN SIZE IS 37.5"" IT'S NOT 43"" ACROSS BUT DIAGONAL IT IS."
Making use of soundbar ordered an issue as week as game console sticks out 1/4 inch
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            iam dissatisfaction because I planned to enjoy a movie and game on weekends with my friends and now I can't invite them again to watch a video because of the damage product .I really need a fast replacement of a better product
The tv was obviously a return as it had no mounting screws. We will see if it works. We are very rural so my son had to make a 2 hour round trip to get the proper mounting screws. I would like composition for this.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            After using the tv for 34 days it lost its color! It doesn’t matter if you use Direct tv, Netflix, Amazon prime, or Roku tv.Would not recommend 😡Update: If you have this problem, press the reset button🤣"
"We bought this tv to replace our old TCL Roku thinking it would be as good as our first one.It worked great for 3-6 months and then it stopped working. We had sound, but no picture.We had to replace the tv yet again, and decided to go with a different brand after reading reviews online.Buyer beware."
"Good quality picture, but reception is very poor"
Product was broken  in box
"I really like this TV, but it was severely damaged after my child threw a plastic ball at it, and the warranty apparently doesn't cover any kind of physical damage. It's to be expected but I feel that a tv this expensive should be made better than to be damaged so easily."
Why don't thinks come with paper instructions? That would have been so much help for us.
Nearly indecipherable menu system for getting local stations from our off the air TV antenna. Returned.
"This product had to be broken before going into the Roku box. No damage to the box containing the TV that could’ve caused this. Terrible product control. No I get to mess with returning and reordering because I was given a broken TV. When this type of stuff happens, THERE SHOULD BE AN EXCHANGE. I mean, I should be able to put this on my porch for the driver to pickup and replace with a new one that very day. Instead it is chosen to inconvenience the customer that was already inconvenienced. This is pitiful."
It is damaged as we are now unpacking it . I need an exchange
"Have fun screwing leg screws directly into plastic. Forced to create a Roku account, then forced to fill out a survey to activate the product you own. I filled out nonsense. Never buying Roku again. Tracking everywhere. Roku doesn't need to exist."
Even on vivid I'm disappointed with the picture quality. It's not sharp. Does not look like 4k. Disappointed with Roku.
"Received set up found remote and one leg not in the box. Powered on an screen was broken/ damaged in several places. With the missing pieces and rough shape of the box I ponder if it was a return previously.Return process a pain, pick up was on the wrong day initially. Now watching the slow process of it tracking through postage to receive my refund 😑"
"Tv came in ORIGINAL TV BOX, this is how I unboxed it. You have got to be kidding me! You’d think they would have handled an almost $400 item with better care, upset isn’t even the words for it!!!"
I was looking for a budget TV to purchase but still had decent picture quality. If you are looking for the same DO NOT PURCHASE THIS TV. As soon as I got the TV set up the screen began flickering. I reached out to Roku support who said I would get a call back for troubleshooting. I never got a call back. Ended up having to return this TV to Amazon. Worst picture and sound quality I have ever seen in a TV. Do not purchase!!
I was really happy with the size. This is a 65 inch tv. But I had to immediately return it because it came damaged in two spots out of the box.I’m unsure if I will buy this again or get one from a local store.
It is a TV set that I don't know how to work.
"First TV bought from Amazon and returned right away. This thing crawls, and I mean crawls. The apps are so slow on it I got frustrated right away. I also had dead pixels on it. I will say for where there was no dead pixels the picture was pretty good. Sound was ok, but man, too slow to even think about keeping. Instantly gone."
"Came broken in a good box, even the piece of cardboard covering the screen was in perfect condition. After taking it off it became very evident that the TV was broken before packaging"
Bought this and the tv stand screws are not fitting in the holes. Roku said they will send new ones and after so many calls nothing happened. so returned it
This TV is NOT 43 inches wide. It is 37.5 inches wide. The width of the screen is several inches less than the description. Scam. Picture with measurement is posted!
Box is dented. Opened and screen is shattered.
Received a damaged box and tv
The TV came with the wrong type of screws and not the ones I needed for the stand it came with.
It is very large for a microwave other than that its working great. I would not purchase another one because of the size.
"The microwave is fine, I just hate GE appliances - period. Unfortunately, the rest of my kitchen is GE, so I wanted to get one this time as well."
"Very noisy. Thought it would die very soon after I bought it.  Bottoms on touchpad are VERY had to push.  Hate the location of the start button. It should be a larger button on the bottom, like the LG.  We returned it."
"MIcrowave when working was fine, nothing exceptional or bad. It died about 14 months after purchase (our of warrenty). That is probably the worst life of a microwave we have had. Buy something else."
"@ years, 5 months, and no more. First one, same model, lasted several years. Second one is worst microwave purchase of my life."
Lasted around 8 months and stopped working. Based on other reviews here these units seem to only last around a year. I would look elsewhere.
Never worked right.?? Faulty electronics?
Lasted less than 3 months!!! Bought a LG INSTEAD!!
Don’t buy. It was faulty and rerun cost yet not recovered!
"way to big ,hassel to return never took it out of the box"
"I was disappointed that my JES2051SN2SS microwave (manufactured April 2015) only lasted for 32 months of light use.The microwave still looked like it was operating properly (display, lights and sounds) but failed to heat anything up.  Based on other reviews here, I’m not the only customer to experience an early failure with this model.Although the longevity fell short of my expectations, since I really liked its capacity, features, and overall performance I decided to replace it with the same GE model.I found that the store is currently selling a JES2051SN3SS model (manufactured December 2017) which looked extremely similar to my defective microwave (and is likewise labeled JES2051SNSS on the outer packaging).However, once I started using the new unit I found it had some very disappointing design changes compared to the previous version:DEFICIENT DISPLAY.  The display on the old model was large and featured prompting for various functions with scrolling English phrases and could be read from multiple directions and heights.  The new display is smaller overall, lacks any prompting and the last digit in the display is not visible if you are more than a foot to the right (when facing the microwave).  This is disappointing since the time of day and cook time remaining are the main reasons I look at the microwave.  The microwave is in the left corner of my kitchen so I am always looking at it from the right and running into this.  If you generally look at your microwave from directly in front or to the left of it, I don’t expect you’ll have this issue.  One example of the missing prompting is after a power failure the previous model showed “Please Press Clock” while the new model simply indicates “PF.”  The prompting also assisted with programming various cooking functions.DIFFICULT TO REDUCE COOKING POWER LEVEL.  Since this is a very powerful microwave, the ability to select lower power levels when cooking things like oatmeal is important.  The old microwave allowed me to press one of the Express Cook buttons (1 – 6 minutes) and then press Power Level to select a lower power level.  If something was boiling over, I could also easily change power levels anytime the oven was running by pressing Power Level.  However, on the new oven, the only way to select a lower power level is to use the Time Cook function and then press Power Level at the very beginning of the cycle.  If I want to change the power level on the fly with the new oven, I need to cancel the current operation and start over with Time Cook.  This is a big inconvenience.CAN’T CONTROL BEEP VOLUME.  The old microwave allowed me to select a high, medium, low or off level.  The new one only supports on/off.I think these changes are significant enough that GE should have reissued this unit with an entirely new model number instead of just changing a single buried digit in the full model number.While each of these deficiencies is annoying, I think I can live with them.  I just hope to get at least 5 years out of the new unit since the 32 months I got out of the old one seems way too short for a lightly-used appliance."
I bought mine in 2017 so it lasted 5 years. GE not the company it once was.
"This product worked well while it lasted, but it only lasted 2 years. One more piece of junk microwave is headed to the landfill."
"Had to replace our built in GE microwave with a countertop version.  Had been very happy with the built in so looked to another GE.  Initially, I was satisfied with it, but here I am 4.5 months into owning it and it starts making a ""growling"" noise.  Determined it's the turntable motor.  Should be in warranty, and I have an email into GE now asking about it.  If I have to replace it myself, it looks like an extremely easy job...but GE's appliance website wants $61 for the part (assuming they won't send me out a replacement part for free)!!  Amazon has it for about half the price.  I see the little turntable motor is made, where else, China.  Should anything major on this microwave go, I definitely won't be looking to GE.  No doubt every other microwave in this price range is also made in China, but I won't reward shoddy quality with customer loyalty.  This tiny electric motor couldn't possibly have cost more than $5-10 and GE wants to charge 1/3rd of what I paid for the whole microwave?  Darn thing should be made by NASA for that price, and be capable of powering a small child's motorized car!!"
Very disappointed in GE microwaves. This one died after only 2 years of use. The previous GE had a similar life-span. I'll never buy another GE appliance.
"I bought this in September of 2020 and it worked ok for the last couple of years. I would say that we probably use it a little bit every day. Mostly reheating food.I thought that it was ok and I didn't really have anything great or terrible to say about it. However, I expect a device like this to last more than two years. Now it is crapping out and I find out that it cannot be even be repaired. That's poor quality."
"To be fair, this microwave worked okay when it worked--but it died after just a little over two years of light use. Its lack of durability, coupled with its lame warranty (as another reviewer noted, the magnetron is only covered for a year, compared with the five years offered by other brands), leaves me with a really bad taste in my mouth. Still, I guess it's an improvement over my previous microwave, an Amana, that only lasted a little over a year before its innards fried beyond repair. Like many others, I remember wistfully the 70's dial-control Amanas that would still be going strong if we hadn't all trashed them in favor of updated models with push-buttons, sensors, and custom cooking settings. Suckers!"
"Died after 13 months. Everything seems to be working but it no longer cooks food. After a bit of research I found that this is a common problem with GE microwaves. I contacted GE and they said it was out of warranty. I left a negative review similar to this one on their site and they deleted it. They should rename their microwaves as ""disposable"" as they're dead after one year."
"While it worked, we liked it a lot. It quit working an hour ago. Based on the manufacture date of July 2022, it failed in less than a year. Bought at Best Buy, but we have no receipt. That means no warranty support."
"Sadly, I've gone through 3 of these GE microwaves in 5 years.  The first GE JES2051SNSS came with the house.  The second was a replacement I bought, which failed after 10 months, and the third was the warranty replacement that failed after 18 months.  I honestly only bought the GE microwave because buying a new trim kit for a different microwave would cost about $100-$150.  Well, I'm now trying the Whirlpool WMC50522HZ, since the face plates and outside dimensions are a perfect fit for the GE JES2051SNSS trim kit.  A warning that if you want the trim kit to fit properly in the opening, you will need to modify the metal base (i.e. cut new holes in the metal or make your own out of wood), so if you're not comfortable/capable with a Dremel or cutting wood, I don't recommend you try the modification.  However, after modifying the base, mine worked out fine (see before and after pictures)."
"This is a nearly exact replica of the GE JE1860SB (lasted 12 years) made in Korea, via the LG corp, but lacking the 9 year warantee on the magnatron.  The China version is dimensionally the same but with a different face and comes with only a 1 year warantee on the mag.  I only bought this unit since it fits the JE1860 built in trim kit, requiring only a 3/16"" shimming on the left side of the trim kit lower pan.  It seems that all of the microwave manufacturers have severly reduced the quality of their products and I don't expect this microwave to last more than a few years, but since a trim kit cost about as much as the microwave itself, one is left with few options."
"My previous GE microwave lasted 33 years (I bought it when my daughter was born).  This one lasted 2.5 years.  It suddenly failed to heat.  All the buttons work, no smoke or smell etc, it just won't heat.It's not the diode, HV capacitor, HV transformer, or magnetron filament, as far as I can tell.  Might be the power relay, which means replacing the PC board, which isn't happening."
"First, I did not buy from Amazon, but here's the review. I had my sharp microwave for 12 years. Before that, I had an Amana for 15.this is only 18 months old and it's dead. When it worked, it was very good, but very noisy. But no way will I replace it with another GE."
"It seemed to be a pretty good microwave at first, but after barely 1 year it was emitting strong burning odors - like burning rubber. Attempts to get a human at GE for possible support proved unsuccessful and very frustrating. More junk for the landfill."
"Be aware of the fact that GE appliances is majority owned by the Chinese company Haier since 2016 and has the right to use the GE name until 2056 according to Wikipedia.  The brands, according to Wikipedia, include GE, GE Profile, Cafe, Monogram, Haier, FirstBuild and Hotpoint."
Died after a year and a half. Warranty is only good for a year.
"We purchased a GE Monogram microwave and had the touch panel fail multiple times.  Service technicians made multiple (5+) unnecessary visits (one to diagnose, one to finally repair - even though it was obvious what the problem was after the first failure....) and the fix would only last a short time.  I have 20 year old microwaves in my basement that still work and have never had a service call.  This is my 2nd GE microwave to fail and they do NOT stand behind their name.  Avoid GE microwaves at all cost - or you will pay plenty!  (Case #18112-004828)"
This microwave was very good but did not last 2 years.  We seldom used it and thought it would have lasted longer
"GE's manual does not indicate that you cannot use variable power settings when you use the EXPRESS feature. After exchanging my microwave at Best Buy I discovered that the new one doesn't allow me to use  variable power settings on EXPRESS either. So I contacted GE and they said their manual is wrong. It doesn't explain that you cannot use variable power settings when cooking with the EXPRESS feature. I asked them what they would do to make things right with me and they said they would correct the manual. That leaves me, the buyer, high and dry. This is a good example of American/Chinese capitalism at its worst. Don't buy it if you want variable power settings to work in the EXPRESS cooking mode."
"Never buying GE appliances again. Died while popping popcorn after just over a year. STEER CLEAR OF GE. Please, I beg you. No power. Zip."
Very poor quality product. They fail after the warranty expires. Don't buy Ge.
Stopped working after one year and 2 days just passed the warranty dateGE said they are sorry. That's allExpensive microwave to only last one yearWon't be buying GE EVER AGAIN
"Worked for year's then the paint on the bottom had a small crack. Last week when wiping out most of the paint on the bottom crumbled and it came out, will not be using unless GE says it's ok?  Looked for a recall but can't find one????"
"This microwave was already in the house that I purchased, it went out shortly after moving in, so not knowing how old it was and since I liked the way it looked with my other appliances I bought another one. Second one did not last 2 years, will not make that mistake again."
"Just got this model, took it home, plugged it in, turned it on and the sheet metal covering vibrates very noisily. Repairman is on the way but I don't see much he can do to fix it. Will probably wind up returning it.  It appears to be very cheaply made. Too bad GE can't find an American manufacturer. Just more cheap Chinese crap I'm afraid."
"I replaced my 800 watt Emerson microwave on Monday that was almost 16 years old with this model.  I put it on the curb with a sign that said it still works and it was gone by the next morning.  Big mistake!  This microwave no longer heats anything.  Worked 5 days only.  Of course I can exchange, but what an annoyance.  What has happened to GE quality."
"I bought my GE from a local appliance dealer because it was the right size for the cubby in a remodeled kitchen and had 1200 watts of cooking power. Fresh out of the box, the turntable would stall in a particular spot in each revolution, let out a terrible CLUNK and begin to move again. I took it directly to the dealer who had it for about a week to repair it under warranty. It worked OK, but was never quite right in that one spot. I live alone and didn't use it much so I didn't let it bug me. One day my sister is visiting and uses it to warm up a cup of coffee for a few seconds and the sucker WON'T TURN OFF! No function in the keypad whatsoever. You had to open the door to stop it and leave it open, or unplug it. It was less than 3 years old and (of course) out of warranty. The dealer wanted more than it was worth to fix it, especially since it was never right to begin with. I left it on their counter, won't go back, and won't buy GE again after this and the GE range thing, but that's another review. Bright spot: I took the turntable and wheely-ring thing and got $4 for them in a garage sale."
