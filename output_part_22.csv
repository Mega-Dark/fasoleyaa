"What a nightmare. The reviews were hit or miss but I really needed a washer so I ordered this. It came out in pieces and has clearly been used, though Amazon sold it as new. It‚Äôs covered in some sort of yellow chemical that smells like gasoline or ammonia. Not sure if a rat was living in this or what. When I contacted Amazon they said they couldn‚Äôt do anything since it was sold to them under the guise of it being ‚Äúnew.‚Äù So now it‚Äôs my problem? Also it says not intended to be mobile or for use in RVs (just in case that‚Äôs what you were looking at it for)"
"Cannot even explain how loud my model of this machine is during the wash cycle as well as the spin. It‚Äôs enough to frazzle my cats and me. I‚Äôm seriously considering taking it apart and stuffing the insides full of sound dampening foam.And it doesn‚Äôt seem to matter how little or much I‚Äôm washing, it‚Äôs just LOUD."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This thing is DESIGNED to leak. There is a pipe with no end just leaks a certain amount of water each load. There is no customer service or technical service, don't bother calling or e-mailing. Only reason we kept this is to avoid going to disgusting laundry room during the pandemic to avoid getting sick. Other than that, washes just fine."
"This is the worst experience I have had. The machine turned on perfectly then as soon as the water was loaded with my clothes and soap, the machine gave me a dE error message. I looked at the handbook and they referred me to contact the manufacturer! It was a waste of my time and energy as the washer didn‚Äôt work upon arrival. Save yourself from a headache and extra work as I had to drain the water out on my own and take my clothes out in order to return the product. So frustrating! I returned it and will wait for my refund."
This person sold me a used machine that came with soap suds on the tumbler of the machine. The protective plastic on the lid was ripped. It was NOT listed as a used machine. The little stoppers on the feet were used up and the protective casing for the motor came out dirty. The machine for most part works fine in all aspects...if you love flooded floors. There was a leak from inside the machine and a when I flipped it over there was an open plastic pipe with no stopper or end to divert whatever comes out. Guess what it‚Äôs above...all the electrical parts.
Started to leak really bad after using it for less than a month
"This product cleans clothing well, but is rather loud when drying."
"Size is ok, but it keep showing ERROR code when I‚Äôm trying to wash my clothes. It literally stopped while washing it. So I had to hand wash the rest of it, and dump all the water out using a bucket. And return was terrible, the water was in the pipe under the machine. Very heavy to put back in the box. I strongly suggest buy some different brand."
"Do not buy this! We bought it five months ago, have used it following every single rule imaginable, and it has just stopped spinning. Clothes are soaking wet. Amazon's response: too bad, check the manual."
"I was very happy when the washer was hooked up 5/6/21. I am now VERY UPSET as my return window has closed and the washer leaked allover the brand new carpet. I am disabled and cannot maneuver a washing machine around to ""troubleshoot"" or ""fix"" the problem. It is nearly impossible to file a claim and I continue to get disconnected while on hold for Amazon. As I write this I find NO WAY to fix the problem"
Daughter used 4 times and its already leaking.
"Complete garbage. Doesn't clean anything. I am currently on my third wash of the same load of clothes because the machine doesn't get stains out. I even made sure it was only half full, which is basically a single outfit. Plus, it leaves lint all over everything so my clothes come out dusty gray with streaks where the lint collected in the wrinkles."
Mine just stopped working idk what is wrong with it I bought back in April and all I was in it is baby clothes and my 12 brothers clothes .how can I get in contact with the seller or insurance?
"This is a pretty powerful little washing machine, but I discovered damage in the hull after closer analysis. Returning to the seller."
Computer panel completely broke and leaking water out the bottom flooded my house ridiculous amount of water junk junk junk !!
"Got it hooked up and working... and it just endlessly says ""Code E3"" after washing for about 5 minutes... Then I restart it... and it does it again... and then I restart it... and it does it again.I've tried taking clothes out, using the manual, shutting it off and on... nothing.  Won't wash a full load."
Upon agitation it makes a grinding metal sound? It stops but I don't think it's supposed to do that.
"This is the second washer am buying within a month , the first one came and was leaking water all over. Returned it and bought a second one, this time it will not spin I did noticed that some of the parts were used. Never buying this brand again."
"Im normally skeptical of negative reviews, because obviously people who are upset are going to leave a negative review. I received a very obviously used product. It was covered in some kind of yellow fluid, had someone else's hair all over it, covered in scratches and gunk. Honestly its disgusting this was brought into my home."
"Leaks like no business, I‚Äôve only used it about a handful of times (I just moved into my own space) and it‚Äôs already leaking. And when I say leaking it literally flooded my kitchen. Soapy water and allüò´üò´ kinda upset it literally was a waste of money, for a already struggling college student.."
"The washer I recieved was very used, even though it was advertised as ""New""; Dirt and hair throughout! Seller: VMinnovations. I only had this washer not even a year and I am having problems with leaking and pooling at the bottom. BUYER BEWARE! Don't buy any washer or dishwasher labled as BLACK+DECKER because the real company doesn't recognize those products."
"This worked great, but only for 14 months..."
I feel it doesn't have enough agitation to properly clean the clothe. My clothe smelled sour after drying.
Washer worked great when it worked. After 2 months noticed a plastic smell one wash. Washer quit spinning afterwards. It will try and start to spin but shuts down after about 2 seconds. After it tries to spin water spits out the bottom. Super disappointed considering the price.
This thing is the loudest most horrific thing ever . Gave me an anxiety attack I thought my neighbors were gonna call and complain so I stopped it mid cycle and returned it immediately. I‚Äôve never heard a washing machine make so much noise before In my life!
We were only able to use it two times before it started to over flow even when we had item of clothing in the machine. I tried everything to stop it but it just continued. So we returned it
My first review was good but not a couple months later this lil washer will leak so much water it‚Äôs a head acheFirst 3 months were fine and now I feel like I wasted my money
Do not buy this machine. The drain hose pops.off in the middle of the drain cycle. I have the hose on tight and check it every cycle and it still manages to pop off. Creates more laundry and a huge mess because you will end up flooding the area its in.
Machine was missing parts and it leaves badly and very loud too. üòï
Mine is so used I had to finish the spin cycle to empty the water.Did anyone get anything about a manufacturing warranty?Maybe we should start a support group?
"In almost a year I have used it a handful of times. Did not clean well, not even lightly soiled clothes. Hose disconnects from the bottom causing floods with each use. Only worked on one setting from the beginning. Total loss of money."
Arrived broken. It also sounded like there was water in it but not in the drum. The drum was dry It sounded like there was water under the drum where the electronics are.
Leaks terribly. Part missing or bad design as others noted. No way you can get this to work properly without rejigging it yourself or putting a basin to catch the water.
"This washer had a broken sensor and produced and error message on the display right out of the box which locked up the functionality. Upon calling B+D customer service, they told me to return the unit to Amazon. I ultimately decided to not get a replacement and went with another manufacturer."
Drum stopped moving after 10 months. Customer service doesn‚Äôt respond to emails. Total waist of $260. ‚òπÔ∏è
Drainage hose started leaking after 4 times of use. Called black and decker customer service 3 months ago and replacement drainage hose has still not been delivered.
This product is a waste of money and time.  I bought it for the isolation and the unit I got didn't drain.  The replacement came 3 weeks later and it doesn't even turn on!  The hotline recommended a NEW replacement!!... This is surreal.
Do not buy this 55 pounds of nothingness. Never worked. Three phone calls to seller were never answered. I got my money back and l walked away. It was like a week of hell.
It is very easy to install. Too easy. It does not handle well small loads. Spins VERY LITTLE. Leaks too much water from the back hose. Hazardous product
"There is indeed a hose in the back that is not connected to anything and it leaks. A lot. My temporary fix is to put a towel underneath it, but it gets soaked up very fast."
"I bought this so I could avoid the laundromat during the pandemic and it has never worked, not once. I've read every manual and watched every YouTube tutorial. It doesn't agitate, and it floods the bathroom. Total waste of money."
This machine gets the job done however it leaks in the back...which is not safe. Water and electricity don‚Äôt mix!
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This product said like new, it came cracked and without the attachment to the sink I WILL BE RETURNING!!!!"
"Did anyone else experience this? The machine is working ok, it's just really loud and sounds like an electric knife.Could my machine be defective?"
Item stopped working 7 months later
This portable machine would be good to wash 2 or 3 small pieces of clothes at a time.
It came broken and I only realized about it when I started noticing the water coming out.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Having a hell of a time finding the part to replace this. By the way, my house is flooded right now. Thanks."
"Mine came defective. It looked nice and modern, but a bad lid sensor wouldn't allow me to use it."
machine arrived broken outside and inside
Broken with 3 months of usedDoesn‚Äôt spinning
Leaked after a week ! Junk
Stopped working within first week. :(Loud clacking and error message.
Just got it today and it doesn't even work!
Don‚Äôt function well
"Update Feb2023Unless your mechanically inclined, I would not spend a lot of money on this if you have to buy one. I‚Äôve had this machine for 1 yr and it makes this loud annoying noise on the spin cycle. It sounds like it‚Äôs a belt or the motor going out. If you call black n decker they will ask for a receipt for warranty. If you have none, there‚Äôs nothing they can do for you. They can‚Äôt even point you to a repair technician for their own products.Also I have noticed that this washing machine does not properly clean. My clothes that I washed in this appear dingy in comparison to newer clothes. So if you like your clothes, please invest in something better.I have washer connections in my apartment and I hooked this right on up to hot water side. I have a extra large dog cage tray underneath it to protect the floors. I have a stocking over the drain pipe to catch lint and it needs to be washed every 1-3 washes to prevent lint buildup and water from coming up drain pipe. The washer doesn‚Äôt leak as far as I can tell. I wish it could wash more but it gets the job done well and saves me $$. I didn‚Äôt get mine from Amazon but it‚Äôs so efficient I had to leave a review. If I could buy it again I would just buy one with a bigger washing capacity size. Other than that it‚Äôs really good."
"A wire broke on the transformer in the head unit, I bought this item last July (Different supplier) trying to find the part is impossible.  I went to the Black & Decker website, they don't recognize the product.  Buy at your own peril.  It does a good job until it breaks.  If the supplier wnats to respond with some info on where to get parts, I'm  all ears."
"I was so excited to use this washing machine because I had just moved into a new apartment. The apartment didn't have a washer-dryer hookup so I thought this would be my saving grace. However, when I got it set up and started filling it with clothes and water, everything was working well, the electronics and the water pump was working. What wasn't working was the main component... it wasn't washing and rotating as a washing machine should. Then after removing the clothes and water from the machine I found out that underneath there was broken components to the motor.  This really ruined my day. I do not know how well these are made or if it was damaged in the moving process, but I do not recommend this item."
"Good washing machine, but sometimes I found leaks from internal pump"
"I wanted to like this washer. It arrived well packaged everything in good appearance. Read manual, connected and did a medium wash, followed by a small. I was happy, upon the next day I go to do a small wash and it was leaking internally. This seems to be a defect from factory.Returning to Amazon."
"Cheap plastic. Didn't even get to do a single load of laundry because it leaked in 5 seconds after turning it on.I attached photos. The baseplate made of plastic and metal is attached with screws to the plastic tub where it leaks heavily. The dark plastic that goes around the whole motor is cracked on both sides. This design is flawed and likely made worse if shipping was rough. However the box arrived looking fine.The saddest part about this is that once I return it, it will just end up in the trash and hasn't even done one single load of laundry.Now if it did not leak and it did work. Look how much space it has inside. I placed a standard paper towel roll and it filled the tub from top to bottom, lol, crazy. Yeah this thing is tiny, super tiny. And the lid is only transparent if you shine a super bright LED light thru it. You will never be able to actually see thru the lid during normal use.Also my last complaint is that the pictures on Amazon show the grey version which I got to look more silver in appearance but in reality from my pictures it is a very dark and ugly grey.Guys, I took a risk. And I got what I paid for. Don't repeat my mistake. Run away from all these generic washers, they are built way too cheap, it is garbage."
After receiving my washer I had a huge leak I only used it 5 times.i regret not getting the warnty. I had to call a plumber to take a look and it cost me more than the washer. The man took out the tube where the leak was coming from and all I saw was a bunch of glue in the tube .I can't upload a photo because it says can't process your request. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY
"Well we got the first one today it is March 28th the replacement will be here April 5th maybe we'll see and about the first one power's up select your switch water hooked up no problems getting water to it water will not flow through the machine into the drum fill it up manually the machine will not wash will turn on in program it you can set the water levels it will not wash will not go through a cycle of any kind fortunately after I filled the drum up the pump did work and it would spin but that's all it'll do the first one is crap hopefully the second one will be better. Besides everything else I paid for a brand new machine, was sent a used broke down P.O.S!!! Will never purchase this brand again. Can't trust them to do what's right"
"The reason I give this machine three stars, it's because (pros) 1. With Just detergent and a normal wash cycle my discolored whites were lily white once again. 2. Even though the drum is small it holds a lot of clothes and the water fulls right up to the top. (Cons) 1. Falls advertisement of dimension the machine is actually smaller. 2. The shell of the machine is plastic very soft plastic that can easily break. 3. The machine leaks when you use soak. Overall this machine washes it close very clean."
It's a wonderful washing machine but the spinning isn't fast enough to my liking. The clothes are still really wet to the point when i squeeze it you see some water comes out but not a lot. Other than that its great!!
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            constant errors on lcd... would not drain... . ZERO CUSTOMER OR TECH SUPPORT OPTIONS... Will never purchase from brand or seller again.. Don't do it
The item doesn't work. The washing machine doesn't move when washing. The motor buzzes but doesn't do anything more. It looked used and as if I received a broken item that someone else returned
Like item but did not have item for one month and it's already not working sent emails and no response as of yet want to fix or get another one I have insurance on item
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Stopped working after a few short months. I dont know if I was sent a refurbished machine, but I sure as heck didnt intend to buy one. As shown in video, it powered off and would not power back on. After a few minutes it would power on and then back on again. Owned a portable manual machine prior to this purchase, its spin cycle worked 10x better than the automatic machine. Clothes were left quite damp. Its being returned."
I ignored the bad reviews and bought it anyway big mistake!!!It‚Äôs like a toy made from cheap plastic hoses are trash!!Leaked all water when attempted to fill water all over my floor.Returned next dayThey should not be able to sell.Waste of time and moneyAgain trust me don‚Äôt buy
The shipping was horrible my washer is dented on each side and it‚Äôs hard to figure out the water hose it kept shooting out water no matter how tight we put it on finally gave up & just used my old one it‚Äôs cute tho!!! And was kinda hard to drain water the washer kept stopping drain hose must be tilted a certain way
"Discharge pump won't work, returned"
Don‚Äôt buy it is a piece of crap. It‚Äôs hard to install and it leaks. They say the water hose has to lay flat on the ground. Who ever heard of that especially if you are hooking this to a kitchen sink. Where is the water going to go if the hose is in the floor?
I received this 2/28 thinking it was going to be great. Just like the dryer I was highly disappointed. After following the directions the washer only displayed ‚ÄòDD‚Äô on the dashboard and it wouldn‚Äôt wash. It only spinned.
broke in less than 10 months and started leaking from the bottom.
"This looks like a toy, not a serious machine. Not easy to set up. I returned it and still waiting on my refund it s been a week"
Broken had to ship back ..then cancelled the replacement due to bad reviews and reviews about completely different items. Buyer Beware.
Worked washed a pair of jeans but had a very steady leak from the bottom first time I used it
This cannot drain into anything higher than about 10 inches high.
"washer broke after 2 months of light use, stopped draining entirely"
I liked this washers description and price. The reviews however seemed to be mostly on electronics so I couldn't get a solid overview on the washer although it did seem very appealing and I bought it with satisfaction
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            No how many times they change the name of this washing machine product it still functions the same way, they‚Äôre trying to get over on us. I purchased a machine with a patched holes in the plug. It was too late to return it after I discover it."
"We received this as we needed something small & simple for our garage. The product was wrapped & secured pretty well. 1st thing we noticed is that it feels very cheaply made, like flimsy plastic, but it looked ok. We‚Äôve had it 2 weeks & have adjusted the temp numerous times & it just doesn‚Äôt work properly. The freezer part barely freezes & the refrigerator part freezes everything. Nothing we do seems to work so I believe it‚Äôs just a very cheaply made product. I tried to do a return, but they sent me an address & now I am expected to find shipping packaging to send it back @ my own expense‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.why should I have to pay for & be inconvenienced for being sold a crap product. BTW, you c s find these at other places for the same price, so it‚Äôs not like I got some great deal."
It‚Äôs smaller than I thought it would be of it‚Äôs for some one who doesn‚Äôt have a family a second xtra refrigerator for a single person
"One of the plastic shelves in the door was cracked - severe enough it won‚Äôt hold any weight.Condensation build up in the back that requires periodic wiping down of the back wall. Have tried turning the thermostat down, but has not alleviated the problem."
"when I first got this it would leak water all over the floor, now it doesn't leak as much but it freezes everything inside the refridgerator part usless I put the temperature so low that everything in the freezer thaws. I have thrown away so much produce and constantly have frozen cracked eggs. I will say that it came with a small dent and the seller was quick to respond and offer options."
"My package was damaged in the inside of the refrigerator. When i took it out the box I noticed the shelf with the lead was broken up. I took a picture of it. Also in the freezer,the glass shelf cut into the inside frame on the left side. I took a picture of it. I would love a new one."
Product came damaged. Packaging around itwasnt damaged just the product itself. Super disappointed.
DO NOT BUY FRIGIDAIRE!. The fan has failed 3 times and is now on backorder for 3 weeks so I am without a refrigerator.  The fridge I had was 20 years old with NO problems.  This is less than 2 years old with 3 repair calls having to be made including having to trash spoiled food.
"My Upstreman SD 321 unit stopped cooling after two years, I emailed their customer service who are of no help whatsoever.I replaced it with one by another manufacturer.  Forewarned"
"The refrigerator is good, but there was damage to the plastic parts and the stand at the bottom"
"We really like the size, quietness and look of the fridge but it keeps forming a lot of condensation on the back wall."
"working fine even with dings and dents from delivery, found major dents only after unboxing and ready to install upon completing summer kitchenet remodel"
"I‚Äôve had this fridge for a while now and it was great until it started oozing some substance into a plastic tray behind it. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs in the photos. It‚Äôs disgusting and it stinks up my studio apartment until I remove the tray (which is attached with two small screws), drain the liquid and pour bleach into it. I end up having to do this about every other month because the smell is so bad. I don‚Äôt know where the liquid comes from and I am in no way handy so unfortunately I can‚Äôt identify it. If you need a small fridge I recommend spending more and getting one from Home Depot. The cheapness of this one shows. You get what you pay for."
It‚Äôs a nice refrigerator. I just wish it was a little bit bigger.
Never held temperature after a week at highest setting.
"This was delivered with clear damage to the outer box.  I had to remove the plastic wrapping to see the extent of the damage.  It appears to have been dropped at some point in storage or delivery.  The bottom of the refrigerator is very dented and crushed in where the motor and exposed part are.  I initiated the return process and the pickup appointment time was scheduled, but it is still sitting here two days after the appointment has passed."
Ice formed on the back wall of refrigerator section
"The specifications and measurements show the product is 21.5‚Äù wide. The product is 24‚Äù wide. Now I have to schedule for someone to pick up the refrigerator, print a shipping label, and attempt to find another refrigerator that‚Äôs the correct size. Waste of time and money unless you need a 24‚Äù fridge."
"Product works fine, as intended, quiet as well, 3 stars because it came with a small dent in the center of the bottom door"
"I bought this fridge because several reviews, here and elsewhere, described it as ‚Äúwhisper quiet‚Äù. That is a joke. It‚Äôs a normal fridge, and when its compressor is running, it makes a loud buzzing sound. It works fine as a fridge, just know that if you are sensitive to sounds, you do not want this fridge in a sleeping space or office space. I cannot imagine why anyone considered it notably quiet. It isn‚Äôt."
"I have not actually tried the fridge, but I know the brand is great, but it came to me damaged twice, and I believe it was UPS that kept damaging the package. Great product and support, but poor shipping and packaging"
"I was very happy with this little refrigerator, kept food & drinks cold, kept ice cream frozen for a year & a half.  Now it is either too cold or not cold enough. If I turn the temp to max it freezes my drinks, if I turn it up just a tidge more the ice cream melts.  Was going to get another one anyway but it's not available right now.  Should have gotten the extended warranty."
Machine makes too much noise to use in a place where one would sleep like a studio or bedroom
"This product is way too overpriced for what it actually provides. First off, the freezer on my unit only works in fluctuation. In other words, it seems like half of the day the freezer will work just fine, but then the other half the temperature will fluctuate to the point where stuff you have in their (such as ice cream) will start melting. Essentially the freezer should only be used to store things momentarily or if you're really trying to get certain items cold very quickly.The fridge itself is okay. It still has a bit of temperature fluctuation as well, but not as bad as seen with the freezer. The main problem I have with the fridge is that the very back is much colder than the front, so if you have the fridge at a decent temperature, some things may freeze back there.The reason I gave this three stars instead of 1 or 2 is because if you're looking for a mini fridge that you can use as a side-kick for your main refrigerator, such as to put some drinks, snacks, desert, etc. in, this will work great. HOWEVER, given the outrageous price of this thing, I would not recommend at all. You can get other mini fridges for half the price that do the exact same thing. If this was priced closer to $100, I think this would be a decent buy, but at over $200, it definitely isn't imo."
I've had this fridge for 7 months and I've had nothing but problems and I can't get any answers or warranty help. The fridge makes everything ice in the back row but warm in the front and the freezer keeps not working and I keep having to throw out 80$plus of frozen meat and food due to it thawing out the. It re freezes and I think the problem is fixed and it happens again. I would NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN. You loose hundreds of dollars and get no solutions. I'd give 0 stars if I could.
"Fridge cools nice, freezer on the other hand does not. Ice cream melted, ice wont stay cool enough. Don't recommend."
"This min fridge is beautiful to look at. Having two doors, one for freezer and one for the lower compartment is great. The noise however was so loud we couldn‚Äôt leave it in the bedroom. So we moved it to the living room and it was so loud we had to unplug it in order to hear the television. It was advertised as being whisper quiet so I don‚Äôt know if ours got damaged in shipping or if the company‚Äôs idea of whisper quiet is different from mine. I contacted the manufacturer to see what can be done."
"I've had this for a few months now at my office. When I received it, I unboxed and put it together right away. Only after I had mounted the door, finished taking off the protective wrap, and stepped back to admire my work did I notice a big fat dent right in the front of the lower door. Disappointing, but not a show stopper - I already had the assy work in, and it's my office fridge anyway. Still, STRIKE ONE.The next disappointment was a week or two later, coming in to work after a weekend to find the door veeeery slightly ajar. The inside was warm and all my food spoiled. Plus it was probably running all weekend nonstop. Turns out, the door doesn't really positively seal and I need to always check it when closing. It's really easy to miss. And come one, I've been using fridges all my life and never run into this issue. STRIKE TWO.Fast forward a few months later. The motor/condensor/whatever has steadily gotten louder over time, with associated vibration increasing as well. Recently it developed a buzzing sound. The noise is coming from somewhere on the left side, I'm guessing from the panel vibrating against something internally. This is driving me CRAZY at work. The noise is way too loud for a quiet office setting. I tried moving it, shimming it, adjusting the doors, and nothing helps. I shoved a roll of packing tape wrapped in a hand towel between the left side and the wall. That slightly decreases the buzzing, but it's still way too loud. STRIKE THREE. This fridge is OUT.SUMMARYPros: Looks nice, keeps food cold, delivered on time.Cons: Damaged upon receipt, noisy motor after initial use, buzzing from side panel, door seal is weak and easy to leave ajar. Also, it's non-vented so it starts smelling easily and moisture just collects inside - so it requires frequent cleaning, no matter how cleanly you use it.Conclusion: Initially it was okay but now I've had it. This thing is about to go in the dumpster. Conventional ethics prevents me from selling it to anyone else, even cheap. And I must point out, this was not a cheap fridge. Overall, very very disappointing."
"It seems to work well, as in- it functions as it's supposed to. It's fairly quiet, it looks nice enough for what it isI don't like that it's not frost free- My fault I should have read the description better, I just assumed than a 2 compartment mini-fridge would be frost free like larger refrigerators There is ice that forms on the back of the refrigerator compartment and frost forms in the freezer that you have to scrape out from time to time.My biggest annoyance though is with the spacing of the shelves. Every other mini-fridge I've owned seems to be planned out for common things to fit inside them. This fridge isn't- Half of the door is taken up by a somewhat pointless can dispenser thing- it works, but honestly I think just regular shelves would be better instead of a can dispenser.The shelves aren't spaced correctly to fit cans or bottles. None of the shelves are tall enough to fit a beer bottle standing up and are a lot taller than a can, it's just oddly spaced.I just feel like it's weirdly space inefficient inside because of odd shelf spacing, which is kind of annoying in something intended to save space."
"I got this fridge primarily for drinks and some frozen deserts in my basement. The fridge/freezer package arrived in excellent condition (aside from the delivery guy leaving it on it's side!). It was very nicely packaged and protected. I left it upright for a couple days before plugging it in. The unit appears quite nice, and it has decent room inside. The freezer is quite sizable. The fridge has ok space, but awkwardly sized and positioned shelves. For instance, the second shelf does not allow you to store cans in the upright position...they have to be on their sides. The storage bin in the bottom is a bit bulky and doesn't really serve much of a purpose in my opinion. I'm also not a fan of the storage compartments on the door - cans and bottles move all around on the right, and the can dispenser on the left is difficult to load and unload. My greatest frustration has been the temperature control for the fridge. When I would put it on medium, my drinks in the door were barely cool, certainly not cold. When I would put it just below max, my drinks (especially those in the back and on top) would freeze. This resulted in one of my sodas exploding all over the place and creating a 30 minute cleanup job. So far I've been unable to find a temperature that allows things to stay cold but not frozen. Additionally the temperature in the fridge does not seem to be uniform throughout. The freezer has worked fine for me, but the fridge is ridiculous. I would not recommend this product."
"As others have noted, the can holder is weirdly designed - American 12 fl oz soda cans are a tight fit though I haven't had any burst on me yet.  Also the shelf spacing and depth is a little weird, and a 2L bottle doesn't quite work on both levels.  All that said, having the separate freezer compartment is great, and both freezer and refrigerator work well at chilling things.  Noise can be noticeable at night, but not bad, just a bit of background buzz/hum."
"So far, not impressed. I let it sit upright for about a week because I was waiting for an electrician to route power to a pool shed. Since installing, I let it cool on a setting between medium & max for a day before putting 4 beers and a pack of those cheap flavored ice pops in. The beers were in the drawer and the ‚Äòcold indicator‚Äô of the mountains turning blue was not there. I‚Äôve since moved them to the back of the fridge and maxed the temp. They took about 6 hours to get cold enough to change the color of the cans. The freeze pops have been in the freezer for nearly 24 hours since maxing the temp and only 3/4 of them are frozen solid.So, yeah, not impressed. I‚Äôll give it more time but I‚Äôm fearful I‚Äôm stuck with this fridge as I‚Äôve already tossed the shipping box and material. My recommendation to future buyers. Either stay away (it‚Äôs clear from reviews that not all of these are created equally... poor QC), or gamble but save your shipping box incase you need to return it."
"Arrived quickly, works ok.  As mentioned in another review I can't get the refrigerator to drop below 40 F.  It holds a good amount but that can holder is a total waste of space.  The top freezer is the selling point.  I luse it mainly for a larger ice  holding container, and it will keep things frozen.  You can fit a few other things in it too. Gets frosty in there though, and water drops down into the refrigerator section.Read the return policy if you have a problem.  I didn't and luckily it worked fine.  This thing weighs 52 lbs and its a sizeable box.  Should you have to return it for malfunction you may have to pay for shipping.  Ouch that  will be darn close to what the unit cost, and one major hassle to box back up.  Had I known this in my case I would buy something this size locally.Mine had a big dent on the top corner but I'm happy with it and if I get 2 or 4 yrs out of it , that will be fine"
This fridge is fairly quiet. Was perfect for my mother's room at the nursing center. However the can holder/dispenser racks were installed upside down making that space completely unusable in a refrigerator that already has limited space. They are fixed racks so I am unable to take them out and put them the proper way. I would have returned it but I needed it immediately and couldn't wait another week or longer to get a replacement. The initial shipping was long enough even with being a prime member.
"Piece of junk; never worked. Called Amazon ‚Äî was told to call vendor. Vendor ((MIDEA)) agreed to refund me‚Äî but only by check. Hello I paid w credit card‚Äî why can‚Äôt you just put the $$ back on‚Ä¶?!?! Took close to a *month* to get the check, by then I‚Äôd contacted my bank to stop paying & begin fraud investigation.Giant pain in the ass. AVOID‚Ä¶!!!üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•"
"Whisper quiet?  I think not.  I bought this to replace a less expensive Insignia mini fridge.  The Insignia made a loud 'click' noise every time the compressor turned on or off. Did I mention I sleep in the same room as the fridge?  Now, although it's true the the Midea's compressor 'click' is about half as loud as the Insignia's (phew!) it's still audible.  The main problem is that the sound of the fridge running is actually louder than the Insignia!  And it's an unpleasant sound, kind of like a buzzing electrical type noise. I'm hoping I adjust to it, it's only been 24 hours.  Ultimately, the Insignia's 'click' noise was so loud that it would wake me up pretty regularly so I pretty much have to stick with a Midea which I was able to sleep through last night with the help of a white noise machine.  Main lesson learned:  Don't rent an open space studio apartment ever again, get a place with a separate bedroom!"
It‚Äôs an okay fridge. It‚Äôs a little loud. It runs a lot. I can hear with my noise canceling ear buds in. If you want a quiet fridge I wouldn‚Äôt get this one. I shopped around and it said this one was quiet. I may end up returning.
"Delivered -  April 26 2024Stopped working on - July 30 2024It was great till it died after 3 months.It was working & I went shopping. I put over $120 worth of groceries in & hours later realized things weren‚Äôt getting cold. 3 Months WTFUpdate- now it‚Äôs working ? Moved it, checked that nothing blocked air flow, turned off & on, unplugged & replugged, nothing. Finally started working but had to turn it all the way up ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è concerned about if I‚Äôll have issues again  Never found a reason for why it stopped"
"I am a college student and I live in a home sharing therefore I have the fridge in my room. The sound is low and not annoying at all. It cools everything very well, yes the power goes on and off automatically to save power but that did not seem to hurt cooling. My only complaint is as shown in the picture that the milk bottle itself takes 50%, yes I can push it back but it will block the ventilation hole, more about the ventilation hole, I attached another picture showing some ice on the panel, I have no idea how water got there and ended up freezing up. The 'drinks' tray seemed useless, it could not fit any 'drink', so I used it for dressing. The butter is placed where the eggs are supposed to be because it does not fit more than 3-4 eggs. Therefore I have the eggs in the bottom in vegetable section and so far so good. The freezer is good as well and roomy enough."
The most irritating thing about this refrigerator - and I cannot stress enough just HOW irritating it is! - is the dysfunctional drink rack on the door.  It takes ridiculous effort to both retrieve a can and to load it fully.  They do not load from the top and you have to push others up and out of the way to load it from the center.  You also need to go through maneuvers to get a can out as well.  Not sure who designed this but it never should have gone to production this way.I have 2 other lesser but still valid reasons for wishing I had not purchased this model.  I did not quite understand the other reviews talking about the refrigerator compartment being low to the ground but it most definitely is and makes it unpleasant to use.  Not sure where the difference between this and others I have had in the past come in but definitely a detraction.  Third issue is that the freezer ices up quickly.  Having to thaw it is just one more task that I do not need on a regular basis.Shelf space also seems much tighter than other models I have used.I would NOT recommend this model!
"The fridge arrived earlier than expected. The packaging appeared to be fine. However when I took it upstairs to my bedroom and removed the packaging, I noticed that the fridge is tilted to one side. It is because there is a big dent at the bottom and one of the adjustable knob was bent. I therefore let it sit on the Styrofoam. Overnight, the fridge is not too noisy, and both the freezer and cooling compartment are working fine.  Right now, I am debating whether I should return it or keep it.Will update in 2 weeks"
"I bought this fridge because it was a great price. It came is a reasonable amount of time, un damaged, its fairly light, and it was packaged very well and easy. However it says the doors are reversible and although in theory thats true I can't do it. The bolts for the hinge are on so tight that not even my drill can get them off. Also the bolts aren't the best of quality and they will easily strip if I try to use anymore force. I'm extremely disappointed because I really need the fridge to open the other way. I'm sure I'll figure out a way, but it's a problem I shouldn't have to solve."
"This is a little bigger than. I anticipated, but it looks like a sleek fridge just 1/3 the size. It is exceptionally quiet, and can fit a decent amount for a mini fridge. The only qualms I have with this are that if you put freeze pops in the freezer, they take days to freeze. Even on high it only will keep frozen what was already frozen. Also make sure it isn't on a fuse circuit that has much on it, I had to relocate it to several different rooms before I found a place it wouldn't blow a fuse (older house)Overall I recommend"
It does its job but I've only had it a couple of months and it's progressively getting louder... like every week a new noise
"I purchased this mini fridge for my room about two weeks ago. After hearing all the reviews about how quiet it is, I was eager to use it. I will say it is a good functional fridge. Even on medium setting it keeps food very cold. I adjusted it to in between medium and low. almost everything about the fridge is nice quality.HOWEVER I am very dissapointed by how much noise it makes. I'm not sure if I have a defective one but it has woken me up at night with water trickling noises and other mechanical whirs that I was not expecting. It is quieter than my previous mini fridge, but it is not ""whisper quiet"" like advertised.I'm looking to see if any of these issues are covered in the warranty I bought.If these noises I'm hearing are normal, I apologize for the negative review. I was just not expecting the mechanical whirs after reading so much about how quiet it is.Update: had this fridge for a few weeks now and the noise is has gotten louder. It groans and makes water trickling noises to the point where i woke up at 4am because of it. Not sure what to do except see if the warranty can cover a replacement.I can't even get a hold of the customer service."
Fridge came in with obvious signs that it was returned and re shipped.
"I bought this fridge 14 months ago for my office at work. It was the perfect size and the little freezer was just right for holding a couple of frozen meals.  Perfect.  It was not loud, it kept everything at the right temperature and I raved about it to everyone‚Ä¶until yesterday when it just quit working.  Lights are on but no cooling at all.  Just dead.  So for 14 months it was perfect, but now it‚Äôs dead and for the money I‚Äôll look elsewhere."
We ordered the fridge in August 2021 and today it broke by starting loud obnoxious sounds.It was never fully filled with items- it served us to have cool beverages upstairs in the house.Very disappointed!
"Hi, I'm a college sophomore who wanted a mini fridge in our college apartment aside from the communal one. When I first ordered it, the second glass tray/divider in the fridge came all shattered and I even got a cut from it on my finger. I was pissed, needless to say. Then, i called Amazon Customer service and they say they cannot issue a refund but they can send a replacement. Not only did I not get a compensation for my effort to unbox, install, and clean the inside of the fridge only to find out that the glass tray has been shattered, they also required me to go through it again once more. I said, fine I'll suck it up. The second one came, and now this one has a perfect everything - trays, dividers, etc. BUT ONE OF THE LEGS WAS F-ED UP AND IT'S WOBBLY. NOT ONLY THAT, THE BOTTOM OF THE FRIDGE IS F-ED UP WITH DENTS. Are you actually kidding me? For a recap, they wouldn't give me a refund not would they send me a nice, perfect one. It just had to be flawed. This has been the most frustrating amazon purchase in my life. Don't buy this. IT SUCKS"
"We bought this as a second refrigerator for drinks and the occasional grocery overflow. It worked great for 31 days. Since it's not our main refrigerator we kept a thermometer in it so we'd know if it wasn't working properly. Day 31 the temperature swung from 45 to 30 multiple times during the day. I called the customer service number provided on the warranty certificate. Despite having registered the refrigerator with Midea the day it was delivered they requested a proof of purchase and said they'd call back that afternoon. So I sent the Amazon receipt. Nothing. Two days later I received an email from Midea saying they had my receipt and a customer service rep would call. Nothing. I called again and was told that they had the receipt, but they'd tried to call several times because the serial number I'd registered was incorrect. They repeated my telephone number back to me correctly, but they'd never called. They asked for a photograph of the serial number and they'd call me back. I sent the photograph showing the exact serial number I entered. Nothing. I've got huge brick in my basement and I'm out the $200."
"AAAAAAND of course something I bought off Amazon was sold to me with false information. I wonder if Amazon gets money for every return they have to process because they'd have made quite a bit off me at this point. This product's description said the product is 20 x 27.5 x 17.5 inches Which one is length, width and height? You got me. The box that it came in, and ultimately, its ACTUAL dimensions are: 18.5 x 19.4 x 33. 33 being the height. Now as you can see all these numbers are quite a bit different from what was advertised, regardless of the order. This is important as I was looking for something under a specific height. Now I have something that is unusable in the area I bought it for with no way to change it, in a room that has no other place to put it. Will I return it? Probably not. Have you ever tried returning something like a mini fridge? A pain in the ass is a mild way of describing it. I don't know what I'm going to with this now brand new useless item."
"I ordered the black version. I normally wouldn't write such a negative review based on one feature, but in this case it's clear to me that I've been intentionally misled by the manufacturer.The refrigerator looks nothing like the photos.The photos have a very refined look. The black finish is smooth and silky. The photos depict it in sleek, modern rooms and it goes great.In reality the refrigerator is shiny and highly textured and has all the elegance of a 1960s cottage cheese ceiling. It looks cheap and cheesy. See attached photo.Hugely disappointed. The manufacturer's photos were either either highly photoshopped or else of a different product. I feel had."
"For the size, if you need a little extra space, this will do it. BUT the noise level is atrocious. Would return it just for that but shipping it back to amazon will cost a fortune so stuck with it. other than noise, its a nice little fridge."
"The fridge part is basically a waste. I just keep my drinks in there because the food would probably go bad, I don't trust the fridge for my food. The freezer is absolutely amazing though. I'm not sure how the fridge sucks but the freezer is great, usually its opposite. Luckily I needed a freezer more than a fridge, but sucks I can't really fully use something I paid for. The fridge barely fits ANYTHING, I took one of the shelves out so I could fit taller items, but still it fits about 6 1 liter water bottles and thats all you got to work with. tiny tiny tiny fridge. the freezer is spacious and worth it though. the only reason this gets 2 stars is the freezer."
"Trash, noise is big voice, can't sleep"
Paying the extra price for this fridge was not worth the money. Others have more options and better temp control for a lot less money. There is a whole in the back of the fridge where condensation drips out the back. Not a very well designed fridge.
"Had this unit for 7 months before it stopped working out of the blue. No noises, no issues, just stopped getting cold. Dealing with getting this disposed of in NYC is a nightmare as well, as it is flammable so sanitation will not pick it up. I am now having to contact waste removal vendors that are going to charge me almost the same or even more than it cost to purchase this fridge in the first place."
This has worked okay so far.  When I received it it had a giant dent in the front door.  I just kept it because I didn't want to deal with the hassle of repacking it or any of that.  Sometimes the freezer starts to freeze up but has worked alright for what I need it for.  The dent almost goes through the door to the inside which obviously diminishes my feelings about the product.  It seems to work good though.
"Seems to be made sturdy and has a nice modern look to it.  However I have placed a thermometer inside a very accurate 1/10  degree one,  and after 24 hrs of said thermometer I  maxed the cold setting and have found the freezer to be at 19 degrees F,  and main compartment struggling to reach 39.  Which would not be so bad if it where summer,  its Dec 24th and the room its in is between 63 and 67 degrees F.So in the summer I'm thinking this will not be good due to the ambient temp being near 80."
"This mini-fridge came in a box but the condition was not so good, several scratches, and when you removed the ""blue"" tape holding things in place, removed the finish as well. If my fridge in my kitchen wasn't on the out, I'd return it, but really need it like now!!"
"In the fridge compartment, the back wall in fact freezes, so any produce/fruit that touches it will become frozen. Very unfortunate issue.The fridge door also features odd compartments, making it difficult to store things other than canned beverages."
"Does not maintain consistent & safe temp in refrigerator portion. Even when kept closed, temp check will vary from 36 to 43 degrees Fahrenheit when set to coldest setting. Unusable."
I bought Midea Ref because i  had good impression of the product However I am scared of using thref because it was damage by the delivery man. He even left the ref on its side knowing fully well it was a refrigerator that has condenser coil. The damage is on theright side edge corner extending fron the side to the back.
"I am less than thrilled that I paid more for this mini-fridge versus other similar models because it touted ""whisper-quiet technology."" I put this in a small home office and the loud buzzing of the compressor drives me crazy. Yes, it's quiet when the compressor is off but so is every other fridge? To add insult to injury, the price is now $30 less than what I paid for it less than a week ago. Strongly considering returning it, if that's even possible.It does keep my beer cold, so it's got that going for it."
I unbox my ‚Äúused‚Äù new fridge. I plugged it in and opened the door and it wouldn‚Äôt shut. I tried everything I could but it would not close without something in front of the door. I contacted Amazon and they refunded me my money and since it was already returned once asked me to dispose of it. Which was done. üòû This is twice I‚Äôve ordered a used item and it was either damaged or full of mildew. üò¢
"I am not really sure if I got a dud, or if the other reviewers are just lying. I saw a truck driver review that he has a very quiet one, and that is a very small space. I have mine in a small bedroom/office and it is EXTREMELY loud. There are rattling noises at times. I have had some temperature control issues as well. Sodas have frozen solid, and there is a lot of condensation on the back wall of the fridge at all times. The freezer works great however, and keeps my small pints of ice cream perfectly frozen. I wish I liked this more. I don't really know what to do with it. My dad has offered to buy me a new one because it annoys him so much, his bedroom is next to mine and he can hear it kick on at night."
"It's fairly quiet and seems to hold temperature well, but the photos are totally faked. It shows a coke can on it's side in the door, and I can't even fit a tiny 6oz V8 in that spot.Otherwise, nice. Good for what I need."
Item was delivered to a college dorm damaged beyond repair. Now I have to wait 24 hours to see if it can be picked up. It's shipping from Amazon- delivered by Amazon.Damaged by AMAZON It would make more sense for Amazon to open and inspect the item before leaving distribution. Now I have a frantic College Freshman in a unfamiliar place that can't pick up the item to return it.DON'T BUY THIS! The duck tape is neat and full of hair. Proof this item had been tampered with / damaged before it reached my child. It's completely smashed. Amazon asked for pictures proving my claim. As a buyer I should ask for proof of inspection prior to taking my money/sending garbage.  It's day 2 . Ill update my review when Amazon offers a solution.
"While both the fridge and freezer work correctly, the unit began making an annoying rattling sound which progressively got worse and is now constant.  I'm at the point where I may have to just defrost it and leave it unplugged (and maybe just throw it out entirely) because it's difficult to work with this in my office unless i play music loud enough to cover up the noise, which isn't really reasonable.I tried calling Midea and got a scammy run around the first few times (some sort of ""free vacations"" B.S.) and couldn't get ahold of a customer service rep.  When I finally did get past the scammy part, there is a ridiculous wait time and no one is available to talk to you.  There is no online support or email readily available either.Even I can find some way to get them to come fix or replace the thing, the whole experience has been a horrible waste of time and I won't be purchasing anything or recommending this brand ever again."
"Definitely not frost-free.  We used it 2 weeks and had to defrost everything.  Other than that, it works fine.  It's good in a pinch, if you need ice/water for a patient in a ""sick-room"" after illness or surgery, or when it's the holidays and you just need a little extra space for all that extra holiday food."
"This unit stopped working, after a few month. Went out to get something out of the freezer, which we hardly use, found mold in it. Then the refrigerator part is warm at best, the light in that part, is the only thing still working. The customer service phone number, they hardly speak English, then say I just need the model number and I can call back; so I call back now they are saying they cannot do anything until I provide them with the serial number. Then they said I could only call if I was with the unit to trouble shoot. They will not just let me explain what is happening. Therefore instead of fixing this one, I am throwing it out and buying a fully different brand. Bought it in September and by New Years it was done for."
"The freezer works fine, however the refrigerator section has to be set on max for mediocre coldness.In other words, even though it keeps food cold, the refrigerator is not as cold as would be expected when set at max setting."
Very noisy and annoying as heck. It's not just one hum. At times it sounds like a jackhammer and other times it rattles around sporadically. I've never heard a fridge make so much noise. Also the soda rack is really cluncky in it's design. It's hard to put sodas in and take them out.
The fridge came dented with plastic seal damaged on one side but the fridge works fine so I just pushed the damaged side against the wall
"I bought this Midea mini fridge/freezer as a replacement for my full size fridge, which died after 23 years. I did not need all the space in a full size fridge and felt that spending $1,000 or more was unjustifiable. I allowed the Midea to settle for 24 hours after unpacking it. I plugged it in and set the temperature. The space it provided was adequate for my needs. It was working fine, but then died on the 8th day. What am I to conclude? That if these things work for any significant period of time it's out of sheer luck or due to The Grace Of God? Now I'm going to see how long I can get by without a refrigerator. I've had enough."
"I really like that it has a separate freezer compartment, but it makes the fridge section smaller. You need to take that into account the separate freezer space as it makes the cubic foot size a bit misleading. It's not frost free, but comes with a scraper that is convenient. Also, the soda can dispenser is not well engineered as cans get jammed and are difficult to remove."
This fridge looks nice but unfortunately the height is actually 33 3/8 including the hinge. We ordered this to fit into a pre built space  based on the size listed on the website.
My mini fridge came yesterday.  It must have been dropped somewhere because it has a big smashed in dent in one corner!  My grandson goes to college tomorrow so I had no time to return it.  For what I paid I think it should have come in perfect condition.  I have pictures.
"Mine arrived with a large dent in the bottom door, but I figured it wasn't worth trying to ship it back for a replacement. Just so people know, this little unit only automatically defrosts the refrigerator coils, but the freezer portion is not frost-free / auto defrosting. That being said, the double-door system is less likely to frost over than a single door system."
"The door of the fridge won‚Äôt close, magnetic tape on the side came off. What‚Äôs the warranty policy? Can it get fixed under said warranty?"
"I have only had this refrigerator for 3 weeks, and already the seal is falling off the door!  Not happy with this purchase."
"Disappointing. Never drops below 43¬∫F with temperature dial set at maximum. Only good for drinks. At least the freezer keeps things frozen.Update for August 2016: I thought I would update the review now that I've seen it sometimes drop to 40¬∫F-42¬∫F, but make its way back up to 45¬∫F. If this was more consistent, I would give it 4 fours."
"I rated a 1 star so people could see my complaint.  This refrigerator is not to be used  below 55 degrees F. I purchased to replace my RV tailgate (rear compartment) refrigerator.  It is a nice refrigerator and worked well during 55F + temperature.  However, I tried to use when the outside temperature fell to 40 deg F and the freezer would not work.  I bought this to replace the original refrigerator which also stopped working. I don't know if I did permanent damage or not.  When it warms up I hope it will work again.  So if you have a similar tailgate setup in your RV, be careful."
"It is ok, but my freezer accumulates a lot of frost which is a pain.  Would not buy it again for that reason."
Buzzes Constantly... very loud. Now I have to pay to get rid of it.
Nice size. Did work good when it worked. It broke in about a week. The freezer and the refrigerator just stopped cooling. But Amazon Prime picked up thru UPS for free the very next day after I put in for a refund and refunded me my money in a timely manner. So I can't complain. Things can happen.
The soda dispenser doesn't fit cans unless you really force them in. The freezer does have generous amount of space though which was a big selling point for us.
Beware and don't plan on keeping ice cream in the freezer as the temperture fluctuates and won't maintain aconstant temperature. May be a -10 and hours latter a +30. Never know what it will be.
"This would be five stars if it came exactly as shown in the picture. however, the product we got had one door and was a refrigerator, not a refrigerator/freezer. We mainly needed the fridge for the office and the price is good, so we're not going to bother with returns. But, somebody goofed."
Good small fridge working fine after about 10 months. Even with the dent I kept it 'cause I didn't want the hassle and I set it in the den in such a way that the dent is hidden.
The packaging was fine- no damage to the box - however the product was dented - back upper right corner;not horrible - but disappointing;  I don't really want to go through the hassle of returning unless it will effect the warranty
I read all the reviews pertaining to how loud this is. All the reviews says its very quiet. I returned mine. It's not very quiet. It has that erratic trickling sound as many or most cheaper fridges have. The motor itself is not extraordinarily loud but the trickling will drive you crazy when trying to concentrate (reading for example in small room with fridge near). I found a replacement without this problem. Also it's 3.1 cubic is limiting. The freezer too big and the can holder on door limits half the door from use if you don't want a can holder. Non removable.
"Great looking fridge and I was willing to chance it based on the reviews unfortunately it arrived I waited three days to plug it in and it worked for a day.  The freezer got cold.  The next day I noticed it wasn‚Äôt cold anywhere.  I unplugged it plugged it back in and nothing - the compressor didn‚Äôt turn on at all never got cold.  Fortunately Amazon was really great about refunding it and I didn‚Äôt have to Box it back up and ship it back.  But I would recommend keep looking, don‚Äôt buy this."
The leveling feet provided with the unit have an inadequate range to properly level the unit.  The unit is perfectly level with the feet fully retracted but the feet  run out of range before reaching the recommended inclination.  I tried calling customer service several times but they don't answer the phone.  I also checked their parts website and the leveling feet there are not the same as the ones on my unit.
"I use it as an office refrigerator - I can hear it whine from 2 rooms away.  I don't know if I got an unlucky unit or they're all just this loud, but I think I may need to buy another because I can hear it whining as I type this over the HVAC running and a TV on in the conference room."
"Works fine my only complaint is that it came with a dent in it from shipping, it only affects it cosmetically not functionally so it‚Äôs not a big deal just thought you should know that it may come with a dent"
"It works. But it makes noise, and it arrived with a broken plastic piece in the back.  I didn't return it because I wanted to give it a chance, and it works.  But I would pick a different brand next time."
"Decent size, holds a lot more than you think. However, whenever the compressor is on there is a constant audible buzzing / humming that is very irritating. I have 10 year old mini fridges and full sized fridges that make less noise than this. Will most likely return because I can not stand the noise (it is in my bed room)."
"The freezer gets cold but the fridge portion even on the colder setting doesn‚Äôt get cold, my yogurts I kept in it are almost room temp. I‚Äôve had it for less than 2 months."
"Ordered the stainless steel but received the black one. It works Okay but I ordered the stainless steel for a reason and since this one works fine, returning it seems to be to much of trouble. Really wish they didn't mess up the color..."
This was my mothers gift for mothers day.  I have no one to talk to and its all dented up.  While I am fine with it being dented on the side because its facing the wall.  It would be nice of the company to have a way to talk to them or at least offer something off since I did pay full price for it and its damaged.  My mother is in a nursing home and this is all she ask for this year... I was not about to tell her she  could not have it.
"I love the look and separate freezer section however my original unit stopped working within a couple of days. Amazon quickly sent me a replacement. I waited 36 hours before plugging it in, just to be sure, and it worked fine for about 5 days then once again stopped working. Amazon won't send another replacement and got on the phone with Midea's customer service to request a full refund. Midea just told me to throw the unit away. I'm wondering if there's something I can do to either fix the thermostat or the connection between the thermostat and the compressor."
"This is a nice unit, but I am disappointed in the storage space in the lower half of the unit. I feel as though the feeezer should be smaller to be able to accommodate more in the refrigerator unit."
ordered september 2021 and compresser went out in november 2022. would not not recomend unless you buy insurance. very dissappointed!!
"Good fridge, cools nicely. But....ARRIVED WITHOUT BOTTOM OF THE BOX! I WAS TERRIFIED IT WAS BROKEN. I was lucky. You may not be"
Refrigerator worked for 10days before compressor gave out. You only have 30 days to return. If you purchase I highly recommend getting extended warranty  be cause after 30 days no refunds. I‚Äôm lucky it broke early because I didn‚Äôt have extended warranty. But I did loose all my food that was in the Fridge. I‚Äôll be buying my next Fridge from Walmart. Because now I‚Äôm with out a fridge until I receive my refund which can take up to 3-4 days. At least at Walmart I could have exchanged the product there.
"Standard size beverage cans are nearly impossible to load into the can rack on door. Can not load or remove cans from top or middle, they must load from below and be pushed up which makes it difficult to stack cans - not to mention really annoying! Will NOT hold 6 cans, only 5 with wasted space at top. Rack is made of hard steel so you can‚Äôt even bend it to make 6th can fit or to make loading and unloading easier. Not a convenient design.... Would have chosen differently."
kind of wish i could get my money back this isn't a very good fridge
"Delivery was quick, but the box it came in was reconstructed from 2 different boxes. No foam insulation on the inside to protect the fridge?  Completely odd how it was packaged. Aside from that, the adjustable feet were all different from each other. One was missing and one was so large that it didn‚Äôt seem to belong to the model. Completely dissatisfied with the quality of products being sold on Amazon these days!!"
"I bought this to use as a drink fridge for our basement. After only 2 months, it completely stopped working without warning - 1 day it was fine and the next day I opened the door and the light was off and drinks weren‚Äôt cold. We definitely didn‚Äôt overfill it so it‚Äôs not like it was working overtime to cool an overfilled fridge. It worked great for 2 months, but I don‚Äôt recommend it if you want something that lasts longer than that."
"We purchased this fridge , set it up and nothing !!!! It just plain doesn't work ! Now we are in a dilemma  as we don't know how to wrap this fridge in order to send it back for another one ! There is no way to contact Midea here on Amazon ! We have the unwrapped torn box but don't have the plastic straps to hold the bottom in !!!  Very unhappy that we had to wait so long for this to be delivered , ( ordered July 12th and received at our home July 26th ) only to not work after setting it up !"
I have left it to sit for 2 days. Before I  Plugged it in. The light works but it is not cold. No noise or anything other than the light tells me that is on. I have tried moving it. Letting it sit plugged in nothing is working.
"Food/drinks on the top shelf of the refrigerator compartment freeze nearly solid, while food in the drawer at the bottom gets so warm it's unsafe to eat.  The only way I can get it somewhat function is to leave it almost empty...which defeats the purpose.  I had high hopes for this fridge based on reviews, I regret it now."
It is noisy
"I think all the negative reviews about the loudness are from people who just plugged it right in. This thing makes almost zero noise. I can‚Äôt even tell if it‚Äôs on unless I touch it and feel the slight vibration from the condenser. In one of the pics I put a thermometer in to test the temp. It‚Äôs actually below 32 that it‚Äôs set at. This thing does work! I did buy the suggested stand and drip tray. It went perfectly with it. The stand had levelers on it so you can get the fridge exactly even. It did come with feet for that but this is easier with the levelers. I‚Äôm storing almond milk in it so I was worried it wouldn‚Äôt hold under 40 degrees. It‚Äôs 30.6 in there as I‚Äôm typing this. Going to have to turn it up or everything will freeze lol. It looks really nice to. I have les led lights all around my room with a blue theme. This tied right in. I had a strip of LED lights ready to go for inside the fridge but no need. This blue light is strong and bright enough. It‚Äôs not heavy either. Very easy to move around. Very easy to get out of the box as well. It pulls off from the top and walla! Then pushed it over to the spot I wanted, lifted it for a brief moment and slid it on the stand.Overall this is one of the best purchases I‚Äôve made in a long time and I buy something every day‚Ä¶multiple items every day. Lots of disappointment. Not here. Oh, and the Matt black finish is really nice looking. It‚Äôs not just black metal. It looks better in person and it looks good on Amazon. So, just stop looking and buy it. Your search ends here! Best value for the money in a long long time.UPDATE 11/17:I‚Äôve had the fridge long enough to know how it works and I have only one complaint. To keep temperate you need a fully stocked fridge. 1/3 stocked and it iced up on me. Then I turned it up to 38 (from 32) thinking it‚Äôs user error. I was wrong. It still iced up and the temp got up to 55 before it turned on.It will still ice up in the back while running. Then defrosts when not. The key to having it fully stocked is that all the beverages work as ‚Äúice packs‚Äù to keep the fridge cool in between it running. Works perfectly fully stocked. It stays between 31 and 35 which is perfect since I‚Äôm storing milk in it. I‚Äôve tested the actual beverage many times and it‚Äôs always near 35 degrees which is nice and chilly!So for all the negative reviews about it not holding temp, this is the remedy. The spacing is a bit weird but workable. I‚Äôve got a 8, 1 liter brisk iced teas, 7 core power protein shakes, 14 Gatorades and a half gallon milk jug (standing upright too) and I still have some room. I left it intentionally to allow air flow.This is the best bang for your buck you will find in a fridge like this. Do not forget to leave it upright for 24 hours. I did this and there is no noise at all. I have to touch it to see if it‚Äôs on by the very slight vibration it makes. I think the complaints are from people who didn‚Äôt do this. The refrigerant has to settle at the bottom before turning on. HVAC 101. If not it will not operate properly and it will make noise. This is why I ordered anyway. I knew this was the problem. I have a 10 year background in hvac. Not directly but enough that I know the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts. Always allow 24 hours unless you just put it in which is not the case here. If you want to gamble $300 or so on it being upright the whole delivery time be my guest. Not me. Mine works greatUPDATE: I‚Äôve had this thing for months now. No noise almost at all. No fogging up.. except when you open the door and it‚Äôs humid in the environment. The reading in the picture is while it‚Äôs on and dropping. It will reach 31 before it stops which is where I want it. I keep milk in it so it has to stay under 40 at all times. I‚Äôve taken measurements countless times bc I‚Äôm major ocd and always it is at 38 out below. Exactly where I need it.The biggest thing I can say is make sure to keep it fully stocked or it will freeze up trying to keep temp. See, having all those items in there works like a sort of ‚Äúice pack‚Äù keeping the temp cold inside at all times. When the air temp reaches what it thinks is 44 is when it kicks back on. It just cycles like that. You might be thinking 44??? It auto defrosts between every ‚Äúcool down‚Äù. Trust me, your drinks or beers will be nice and chilly.There is a small problem I noticed. There is a sort of laminate on it that if scratched will start to peel off that nice look you thought was natural. I put black electrical tape over my spots and accepted it.I complained to Amazon and I got a full refund. So, the fridge was free. How can I complain right? It‚Äôs doing its job.1.STOCK IT FULLY 2.LET IT SIT 24 HRS UPRIGHT BEFORE PLUGGING IN.  and you will not have the problems others have described. 2 before 1 obviously‚Ä¶well not to everyone I guess lolMAJOR UPDATE!!It has been one year to the day since I placed the order for this fridge and now the motor is making a very loud noise and continues to get worse. It will definitely go out. It‚Äôs not something that just goes away.  I tried calling and their office closed at 4 o‚Äôclock and it was 4:02 PM. I sent an email explaining the issue. We‚Äôll see if they honor the warranty since it was not shipped until the 10th. I didn‚Äôt receive it until sometime after then that‚Äôs when the warranty should‚Äôve started.I‚Äôm changing my review To one star until I hear back from them, and there is a resolution. Major disappointment"
"Let me start by saying that this arrived well packaged and without noticeable damage. This particular design seems to be offered from many vendors with minor variations, and the EUHOMY variant just happened to be on sale when I was looking for a beverage cooler.The wire shelves are sturdy and the internal layout is fairly good. I think the claims about how many cans can be stored are maybe a bit exaggerated, but it has ample room for 80+ cans without issue. I personally have it configured so that the middle two shelves are at can height, the bottom can handle bottles or juice cartons / mixers, and the top can hold cans to the side of the temperature control bump and smaller items in the middle. If you're buying mostly 12 packs of beverages it can store quite a variety of drinks very easily. The shelves hold 5 cans per row.The reason I gave this unit two stars, however, is the temperature probe. The temp control bump in the top-middle houses the control electronics and has a small PCB into which the temperature probe is plugged. The control unit is held to the top of the internal compartment with two screws, but when the unit is attached it puts strain (almost pinches) the wires of the temperature probe as they go into the connector that is plugged into the PCB.The wires are routed through the insulation (which seems to be an expanding foam, making the wire entirely non-repairable) down the side to a small cartridge thermistor which lives behind a grate on the right internal wall of the cooler. If a wire gets damaged, as was the case in my unit, the thermistor will read either disconnected or an incorrect resistance, which affects the temperature readout and thus affects how often the compressor runs.Since one of the thermistor wires on my unit was pinched, it would expand and contract as the unit cooled and warmed up, constantly altering between over-cooling and getting too warm. I thought I had fixed it by removing the control unit, moving the wires around until it read the correct temperature, and then reattaching the unit. Much to my dismay, I heard a loud BANG later that day and a can of soda had exploded inside the cooler and the temperature readout was saying ""E1"" with the compressor running full blast. Multiple cans of soda had frozen.Since the wires are routed through expanding foam, there is only about an inch of the thermistor wire available to work with to try to repair. Through painstaking effort and care I was able to, using tools that I luckily had laying around due to a small electronics hobby, repair the thermistor wire to the point that it now has worked consistently for a few weeks.No one should have to do that just to get a working beverage cooler.I called the number for EUHOMY that came with the documentation and it went straight to a voicemail inbox without ringing. My best guess is they register a US-based number solely for the purpose of not putting an international number on their documentation, but that no one actually works at the location where the phone rings.I left a voicemail and I received a text message from the same phone number the next day at 2 AM (would be about 11 PM in the timezone where the number is registered). The text message was unhelpful, did not register any of the issues I mentioned in the voicemail, and just asked me to send an e-mail to their support with pictures of the order number, serial number, and a detailed description of the issue along with a video clip to show the problems. I chose not to respond as I had already dealt with the issues myself, but it left a bad taste in my mouth nonetheless.As always, Amazon support was incredibly helpful and responsive to my inquiries. I shop Amazon with confidence because they've almost always taken care of any issues I have, but I still suggest buying something else than this beverage cooler. The only reason this is 2 star instead of 1 star is that I was able to fix the issue that made this product unusable, and I like it now that it works. Unless you are a masochist like me, I urge you to buy something else."
Revision:  After pushing back I did receive a replacement unit. Which I do/did appreciate. Two issues. First the back inside panel is screwed in at an angle. I'm leaning towards the fact this unit may have not passed quality inspection.  It also ices up on that back grid. My other unit never did that. Once it gets covered with ice the compressor will not stop running and the temp indicator increases to 60 degrees. The unit needs to be unplugged and sit for an hour then plugged back in. Concerned the compressor will burn up if left running when this occurs. Will be unplugging the unit if being away from home for more than a day.Unit was a bit louder than expected when cycling but tolerable when first plugged in. Its located in our dining room. It became increasingly more noisy over time and in the last 2 months is so loud when cycling we need to increase the volume on the TV in our living room. It shudders and shakes at the end of the cycling period as well as bangs and clunks at random times. The sides of the unit are HOT to the touch during the cycling. When I contacted Euhomy I was told to submit a video showing my concern.  Their reply stated  that this is within normal acceptable limits. Seriously .... terrible product and even worse customer service.
"Customer support replied pretty quick to my email. But with bunch of questions, instead of answers to my questions.  Serial number is in back somewhere and I'd have to empty the fridge and remove it from the floor shelf i built for it.  Box is already cut up and gone.  I've decided to try modify and improve the unit myself.  A simple floor fridge chest is more reliable and gets colder. But you wont have the scenic glass door.  I'm going to search for a warm white LED light to replace the ugly blue light. And replace the fan with better one or two.  Also see if better way to dissipate heat from the condensor.  Maybe replace the thermostat and or temperature gauge also.  I did wait close to 24 hours before plugging in the fridge.  And read the manual carefully.  Box showed no sign of shipping abuse. But compressor bracket seemed to be bent with extra pressure on one side of a rubber bushing. And low pressure tubing side insulation missing or pulled down from the interior case.  Also door was slightly off angle.  Did not have a single dent or scratch when i unpacked it. But may have been dropped flat sideways during shipping. One bottom corner of box had slight impact and that leveling foot was unscrewed when i unpacked it. But not damaged.It runs fairly quiet, only a little refrigerant gurgle but i did add a shim between the compressor and drip pan to prevent any rattle. Because compressor was off center of the drip pan curve. As if the hole unit suffered a heavy impacket.Looks nice, think i can make it work better.Update, covered the little vent looking thing near bottom right side with two pieces of clear tape. Think the thermostat temperature sensor is in there.  Average temperatures have dropped at least 5¬∞F.  Now its just a matter of fine tuning what the sensor reads and the air circulation throughout the fridge."
"Nice looking cooler and plenty of space for multiple drink container configurations. Easy to set up and simple electronic control panel.Very quiet when operating.Cooler was received with minor shipping damage. Was unhappy to find a small dent in frame next to control panel & Cooler appears to have been removed from box previous to my delivery but it worked fine (so far) after I set it up. No leakage, or other damages but I will return if I determine this was a Refurb unit!"
Purchased because it advertised cooling as low as 32 degrees. Put into action and could not get it to cool lower than 41 - 43 degrees. Contacted seller who suggested unplugging for 24 hours and restarting. Tried this several times over a period of a week. No success. Seller did promptly refund total purchase amount. Probably an okay fridge if you don't want your beverage cooler than 43 degrees. I prefer my lagers at 35-37. Did not meet my need.
"I've been using this beverage dispenser for a few weeks now, and overall, it's been a convenient addition to my office. The ability to have drinks readily available without having to make constant trips to the kitchen is a huge plus, especially when working from home.However, the product does have a couple of drawbacks that prevent it from being a perfect solution. Firstly, **it's quite loud**. The operating noise is noticeable, which could be disruptive in quieter environments. Secondly, the design of the drain tray is a bit inconvenient. **In order to open the dispenser door, I have to lift the entire unit off the tray**, which is not ideal. It would be much more user-friendly if the door could open while the unit is sitting directly on the tray.Despite these minor annoyances, the convenience factor of this beverage dispenser makes it a worthwhile purchase for anyone looking to keep drinks accessible. If noise level and tray design aren't major concerns, then I would definitely recommend it."
"Ordered one and received it and plugged it in and immediately it burned out. Filed  a claim and received a new one. The New one works great except the fan was so noisy that you couldn‚Äôt hear Anyone else talking in the room?.  Rather than the hassle of sending it back, I put a new fan in and it works great and looks really good. Asurion was easy to work with on the return of the first one."
"We already own and like one of these fridges, so we ordered a second one. Unfortunately, this second one arrived damaged ; dented in on the side. However it does work well, so the damage is cosmetic. I would have returned it except the seller requires us to pay the return costs. Buyer beware!  Update:  seller gave us a 50% refund because of the damage."
Finish had some blemishes. I installed 2 digital thermostats to check accuracy. Fridge thermostat is about 5 to 6 degrees off. Thermostat is set at 32 degrees but won't get any colder than 37 to 38 degrees. Might be sending this one back.
The fridge itself is fine but the door doesn‚Äôt shut easily. If you shut it a lil hard it‚Äôll bounce off and not shut. This issue has caused the fridge to stay open without our knowledge for hours on end many times.
"Yep, it is a cooler that you can put beverages in.  It is fairly quiet enough and it is not junky but if you can stick even 60 of the stated 126 cans capacity in it I would be impressed.  We have 53 regular U.S.A. sized cans in it.  We have one of the shelves not in use because to add it in would hinder more than help.  We can only use the top shelf for limited items due to the controls blocking the entrance.  Also the bottom shelf is only 3 cans deep due to the compressor and drain being in that space.  Why I am so disgruntled is that with this same unit, I who is not an engineer, could fix it for not really any more production cost but just being smart enough to know what is needed.  Not enough space here to go into the dumb things you have to live with if you have this model.  The picture is like the fast food places--how your food never looks like on the menu--and the capabilities are much more limited.  Truth:  If I had no expectations it is a working fridge but since I spec'd it all out I was counting on meeting my expectations but they fooled me.  If you need just 1/3 of expected cans stored and do not care how it is arranged, then this is an acceptable item.  If you expect it to be as described or pictured in their marketing, you will also be fooled."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Cools things down perfectly and overall would be very quiet EXCEPT my unit seems to have a high pitched whine whenever the compressor turns on and it‚Äôs driving me crazy; it sounds almost like a dog whistle. I waited 24 hours before plugging in the unit, so I dont believe it‚Äôs caused by negligence on my part. I contacted support and all they said was to unplug the unit for 24 hours and plug it back in. Not sure how that will fix the whine but I will try and update with the follow up. If it‚Äôs defective I‚Äôm not quite looking forward how to ship it back after disposing the box. So far, disappointed and annoyed."
"Fridge makes a loud bang every now and then which seems to be due to thermal expansion. Sounds like someone stepping on an empty 2L bottle and can be heard across the house, especially at night. None of the panels seem loose so it might be the internals expanding/contractingedit: Changing from 2 to 3 stars. After much back and forth with company (through their website, not Amazon) they sent me a new fridge free of charge that doesn't, so far, have any issues."
"Got this on sale for about $215 + tax. Fridge is decent size (not too big or small) and noise level is very quiet. The fridge itself is nice looking and the door can be adjusted to open from either side, although the blue light is a bit useless as it makes it hard to even see what's inside.  If you want to put in a 12oz beer bottle, only 1 section can be used, thus you have to rearrange the shelves and that makes the very top shelf useless as it's too small to put anything in, and you're left with just 3 shelves.I was very disappointed that despite being able to set the temperature down to 32 degrees, it actually isn't accurate. I've attached a picture to show the digital temp from the fridge vs the 2 thermometers I put in to show the ACTUAL real temperature. Both thermometers show 41 degrees. I let it sit for a day before using but that isn't helping much.The reason I got this was to chill beers and sodas. The other things are a bonus. Not happy having to go through all this trouble and setting it up to find out the fridge doesn't get cold enough as advertised."
"Product fine, but too small for my area.  Return was difficult bc of size & weight.  Then I get charged a $50 restock8ng feee"
Was very disappointed when I opened the box and observed a hole all the way through the insulation. Decided to plug it in and see if it still works. Luckily it does work and gets ice cold. Water bottles froze on the top shelf at the lowest setting (32). It's a nice looking fridge and the blue light is a nice feature. Since it still works I decided to keep and not go through the hassle of sending it back and waiting for another and hope that one isn't damaged either. Would be 5 stars if not arrived damaged.
The seal does not seem very tight and things are not as cold as they should be. Down to 32 degrees and still feel like it should be a lot colder.  No noise at all for sure a plus. May be the seal is not tight enough because it takes very little to open.
"I have two of these, both the same model, bought about 2 years apart. The first one works great - keeps temp well, doesn't freeze up and is extremely quiet.  My second one i'm in the process of sending back. It's easily 5x as loud as my other one.  And it's not just normal compressor humming which i would expect.  It's very loud humming combined with grinding/growling. I've defrosted it several times and it doesn't help. It MAY have something to do with delivery - it was left upside down on my front porch. I let it sit right side up for about 2 weeks before plugging it in. At this point i'm not sure but it's way too loud to keep."
"Very nice beverage refrigerator,  quiet and easy to configure so it holds lots of bottles, cans,  wine,  etc.But the quality is very suspect.  The first one quit working after 2 months, so I contacted the seller via my Amazon order and they quickly sent a new one.  They had fast shipping and excellent communication via email, and then followed up to make sure everything was good.  Unfortunately the second one made a very loud and annoying buzzing noise whenever the compressor ran.  So they quickly sent a third unit which has been running perfectly now for a week.It has been a big hassle, but at least their customer service has been great."
"First of all I got delivered across the street and I had to handtruck it up my hill, 150 feet plus.The instructions to switch the door were very incomplete, but I was able to figure it out.The fan rattles like crazy and I will give it a few days or so to settle down, but if it doesn‚Äôt, this junk goes back‚Ä¶. refrigerator does look good and this reasonably handsome. The price should tell you something."""
Fridge depth is almost 19in. Not 17.5in as stated.  Not worth dealing with a return now.
It has gotten louder over the weeks that I have owned it and seems to run much of the time.  The temperature control read out does not correlate with the temperature gauge I put inside.  It's nice looking.
"While I love the aesthetic, it's unfortunate that it doesn't get colder. Maybe if they added another layer of glass or a beefier compressor -- but don't try to store food in this thing. I took some digital temperature readings (from a calibrated device) and while it can get down into the 30s in the rear, the front by the glass is in the 50s at the lowest setting. A 20 degree difference across maybe 1ft of the interior just screams that the front isn't well insulated. I mean it's glass, so that kind of makes sense -- but it's still frustrating.That said, it's a great drink refrigerator. I question the efficiency with the above insulation concern -- but I use it to cool my drinks and it does a dandy job. My brawndo energy drinks are refreshingly chill thanks to  EUHOMY. Cheers."
"I like the frig, BUT it is noisy. I checked reviews on many of these refrigerators and all have a noise issue of some sort. Few cited low noise as a positive. It does turn off when the temperature is reached, but once its on you'll hear it running."
"We purchased this fridge in April. We just unboxed this fridge and plugged it in. It became absolutely scalding hot to the touch on both sides. It was sitting in a huge, empty bonus room and was extremely well-ventilated and it was so extremely hot on the sides we couldn‚Äôt touch it long enough to move it. We unplugged it and tried plugging a toaster oven into the same outlet to check the outlet and the toaster was fine,so, it is definitely this fridge. When I contacted the company asking for a replacement or refund so we didn‚Äôt have an unsafe product in our home they said ‚Äúno‚Äù and replied with:‚Äù We have carefully reviewed the video you sent, and we can confirm that the machine appears to be functioning normally. It is common for the sides of the fridge to become warm as it operates. This is due to the compressor and heat dissipation system, which are located on the sides of the unit. The heat you are feeling is a normal part of the cooling process.‚ÄùIn my email I explained it was extremely hot. I do not recommend purchasing from this company if you like to experience customer service,you will not get it at Euhomy. How sad! I am now out a lot of money and have to find a new and safe fridge from a caring company. So, buyer beware!"
"Came damaged box was not dented, so fridge was put into the box already damaged. I like the fridge but not sure about the seller"
"We have an open concept house, so noise management is important. We were hoping to tie 2 of these together to fit our space, but they are definitely not 36db. One of the two clocked at around 44 which is manageable, but the second is closer to 57. Everything else is good, but strange that they can be so different. We followed the recs to keep them right side up for 24 hours before use. Sadly have to return them."
"Temperature fluctuates alot, I keep it at 34 and the thermometer I keep in it goes between 35 and 45 without opening it. Sometimes I will grab a drink and it doesn't feel very cold. And randomly there is a loud clank. And I can only fit maybe 100 12oz cans. Other than that, wasn't a bad price and it keeps my drinks colder than room temperature. Did a dryage in my previous minifridge and I sold it to get this one but I don't trust it to keep the tempature in the correct range to do another dryage."
"Keeps drinks cold, unfortunately I‚Äôm not able to fit as many drinks as I wanted and the mini fridge makes too much noise. I thought it would be quiet like a regular fridge but it‚Äôs very noisy. I‚Äôm not convinced I like it yet.."
"Yes, that‚Äôs right. The fridge works great until you have a power out at your house, even if only for a short bit, when the fridge comes back on it resets to 46¬∞F.  If you have beer and other non-perishables, no big deal.  We use it for milk and other perishables at our coffee bar at our house. So, in that case it kind of sucks.Otherwise, the fridge is quiet, works great, and looks nice.  Cools down very cold no problem.Even though we have it under a bar, I have a vent slightly above the fridge to let warmer out, and it‚Äôs not super tight. Which is important for this kind of fridge"
When I got the fridge the metal handle was dented and I don‚Äôt have time to do a return so I‚Äôm dealing with it. The bottom legs are metal so when you place it on countertop it scratches it. I liked that it‚Äôs digital cooling and it lights up blue on the inside. Love the glass front.
It came with some scratches.
UPDATE: after threatening legal action Euhomy sent me a replacement fridge. I will be setting it up soon and am hopeful it will work without overheating.Original review: Worked for 11 months then started getting very hot to touch on both exterior side panels. After completing an annoying series of tasks prescribed by Euhomy to troubleshoot fridge it is still overheating. They then refused to specify the acceptable exterior side panel temperature and stopped communicating. Amazon customer service said they would investigate but instead they gave me the runaround ultimately referring me back to the manufacturer after wasting my time. I am now filing complains with the Consumer Products Safety Commission and BBB and considering legal action against both the manufacturer and Amazon.
"Unfortunately, this has a really bad freezing problem even when the temperate is turned up. Causes water drippage and has ruined several of my boxes placed inside. Reset the fridge per customer service guidance and problem not fixed. Do not recommend."
The cans become a piece of ice and blowing there. The temperature adjustment doesn't work at all.
"The box it was shipped in was fine, but the refrigerator was damaged all over.There were dents on two sides, the back corner looks like it had been smashed, on the inside, the back panel was crooked and bent, and there‚Äôs a screw missing.Haven‚Äôt plugged it in yet to see how/if it runs."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            We liked the refrigerator but after the 24-48 hour cooling period it had the sound in the video that was not acceptable when attaining a desired temperature. The refrigerator sounds as if it may have been defective but fortunately Amazon‚Äôs return made it an easy return. I gave it a 3 rating as this may have been defective but did not want to try a replacement.
"I purchased this refrigerator because it was one of the rare ones that claim to be able to be turned down to as low as 32 degrees Fahrenheit. I bought it as a beer fridge which can handle temperatures well below that without completely freezing. I pre chilled enough beer in my existing full size refrigerator to 34¬∞ Fahrenheit and then completely filled this small refrigerator and set it to 32¬∞. After a week of not opening the door the temperature indicator does say it is at 32¬∞, however my beer is at about 44 degrees Fahrenheit. The side walls also say mid-40s, this is using a laser temperature gun. The only cold spots in the refrigerator are the very back wall which seems to only chill about 2 inches of depth from the back wall. This refrigerator would not even keep food at a safe temperature to eat, even turned all the way down to freezing. I was very much looking forward to coming home to some cold beer after traveling for the holidays, but unfortunately it might have been colder if I would have just bought it warm off the shelf at my local grocery."
"Sketch. Not a new product. Obviously refurbished bottom sign silver reflective insulation tape. Also an obvious dent on the side. Help yourself and don‚Äôt buy it only to return, just don‚Äôt buy it to begin with."
"This fridge performed well apart from the seal issue. The door no longer seals properly after three months of use. As a result it is running 24/7, leaking water all over the floor, and condensation has formed across the entire glass door. I would not buy this again."
Cosmetically damaged door right from the factory. Clearly not from shipping. Seems to work but looks like trash.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This refrigerator leaks water! Condensation builds up on the inside of the door, and water leaks out from the bottom. I contacted the sellers and they will not replace the unit. Do not purchase this item. The sellers offered multiple solutions for me to try at home, over six months, of back and forth emails. None of their ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù fixed the issue and now I am past the warranty. Such a shame and poor customer service."
"Overall it is a nice refrigerator. It is a good size and keeps beverages cold. However, the unit that I purchased is very noisy. Even after following all setup directions, including letting the refrigerator rest the appropriate amount of time before initial use, the refrigerator still makes loud noises. Every 5-10 minutes the refrigerator will switch from being relatively quiet to making loud enough noises they can be heard throughout the residence for long periods of time. I've owned many refrigerators in the past from the standard edition you may have in the home, to mini-fridges and none has ever been as loud as this one. I have tried changing the temperature, adjusted the fullness of the unit, completely emptied and powered off the unit, and nothing has helped. I reached out to the company via their website on 05/10/24 in hopes on trying to find ways to remedy the noise, however I have not had a response."
. After having this frideg for couple months . Been on going problems.  Customer service was horrible.  Does  not hold temp.  Door  seal is not good.  Amazon did not help with anything.  Can only  email and geys nowhere . They dont want help with nothing.  Starting to see amazon customer service is bad .  Return  is a hassle . No one is helping.  Toral junk do not buy
Bought for garage for drinks and it‚Äôs gets really cold but with the 90+ degree heat the window sweats bad and drips all over and some condensation on the inside. Would be great for inside though. We are keeping it to use inside at some point. But I wouldn‚Äôt recommend for a garage that gets really hot in the summer.
Plastic is melting/peeling on the left side and two dents on the right side.  Don‚Äôt wanna go thru the hassle in returning this item.  Not as quiet as I thought it would be.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I use this to keep all our drinks cold and free up space in the refrigerator.  It‚Äôs gotten louder. Like the amount of space but I hope it‚Äôs not breaking already.
I like the mini fridge its set up pretty good but its not as cold as i expected also its glass is fogging up alot which clearly says it not suppose to do that i'm not happy with it honestly i would like to get a response from amazon about this product ASAP
"I followed the start up directions, waiting 5 days before plugging it in.  Worked ok for about 35 days.  Then when it is just out of the ""warranty period"", it stops cooling.  Set to 38, but cans are at 55.  Set to 32, down to 51‚Ä¶. I had high hopes given the negative reviews, but decided to give it a shot.  Unfortunately, this is not a very good refrigerator.  I would not recommend at all.  Waste of money."
"Following the directions we removed it from the box and let it sit for 24 hours. When we plugged it in it made this terrible grinding noise. Unfortunately, the box was thrown out so retuning it was not an option (clearly our fault). My husband spent two hours attempting to fix it. The fan was installed incorrectly. He got it to run quietly but the glass is constantly covered in condensation on the outside. Very dissatisfied in this product."
The fridge came with a grounding plug but the their prong was missing. It‚Äôs too heavy for me to bring back to a place to mail it back.Also didn‚Äôt help that the box has so many labels saying this side up and yet it was at the door upside down.
This unit did not last a full year.  Stopped cooling.  Luckily I got the protection plan but still had to shell out more money for a different unit.  Protection plan gives you Amazon credit for your purchase price.  I would not recommend.
"It was half assembled, apparently previous customer tried to assmble it but they couldn't finish it.Some scratches and missing screws. Loosen racks. I had to fix all issues by myself but it's working properly for now."
"I had reservations about buying this style of fridge online and having it delivered and I should have listened to my instincts. The unit I received has a pretty major dent in the side of the door that looks bad and causes the metal frame around the glass to bulge outward. If it wasn't such a hassle I would return it, but instead I'm stuck with a fridge that is going to annoy me every time I look at it."
"Absolutely horrible temp control.  If I set it at 45 for example, I'll come back later and the top rack shows 31 degrees and the bottom rack shows 32 degrees.  If I set it at 46 degrees, I'll come back later and the top rack reads 57 degrees and the bottom rack reads 59 degrees.  This is repeatable.  This is unacceptable.  I do NOT recommend this refrigerator.  Very disappointed.  I'm going to have to figure out how to send it back."
"Should have heeded reviews about noise as very noisy and getting worse.Arrived in good condition,  easy to unpack. Scratched floor so be careful. Easy to set temp and turn light off and on. Love blue light."
This refrigerator doesn't get that cold. It says it gets to 32 but doesn't feel like it's lower than 50.
This fridge does not work . It won‚Äôt get cool but the sides get really hot like so hot you could get burn . When I reached out for refund or replacement they were no help and got no where . Ended up paying 200 for a broken fridge . DO NOT BUY
"1st one stopped cooling after 3 days. 2nd one has a large dent on the top and the seams are bad. Been texting back and forth for a week and all they want to do is issue a $40 credit which only covers the haul away from my waste company. They also wanted to send me a return label to send back the 2nd one. Terrible experience and overall customer service and a waste of my time loading, unloading the fridge, paying to have it removed, and zero resolution!"
I love the look but... There is a lot of condensation and does have a puddle of water so I have to put a towel in front of it
Shelves are not leveled and beverages slide forward falling out of the fridge when you open it.
"This makes barely any noise when running and keeps the temperatures within about 4 degrees of what it's set at.  The bad thing about it is that the awful blue light is so weak, you can't even clearly see what's on the top shelf.  This is in a slightly dark space and I have to shine my phone in to the fridge to be able to see anything in there.  I will have to find battery powered lights that can tolerate cold."
Wouldn't hold a temp so I return it and it took 3 months to get a refund after I returned after only having it for a week
Does not cool to set temperature
This beverage refrigerator looks great and we had high hopes that it would suit our needs.  Unfortunately after letting it sit for several days (way more than the 24 hours they recommend) the unit was plugged in and basically never stopped running.  It would never get down to a temperature below 50 degrees which for beverages isn't good enough for us.  Returning within the 30 day return window.
I was very disappointed to learn after unpacking that this item was severely damaged. It has only been plugged in for a few hours so I don‚Äôt know yet if it is working properly.
"Seemed like a solid little bev fridge. And two weeks ago it just completely stopped. We unplugged in and let it warm up, we‚Äôre looked through the back to see if somehow the there was somewhere air should get in and couldn‚Äôt, no. We have a deep area where we put it and it has 2 unblocked feet in the back and 3 inches on all sides to the sides and top, considering most are built into a cabinet I thought it would be okay.  I can‚Äôt believe it just quit working after just 5 months. Wasted money,"
"Its a refrigerator. It keeps things cool. Unfortunately the picture of the product was obviously photoshopped. The standard size 12oz soda cans do not line up as neatly as shown in the picture. In fact, you have to stagger the cans to make everything fit. This is being used in a gaming store to display drinks for purchase. The top shelf is also misleading. This is where the cooling fan is and therefore cannot have standard sized cans or bottles around it. Once again, photoshopped. Shame on whomever posted this."
Everything about the Euhomy Refrigerator is cheap. Horrible design. Leveling knobs aren't  even the same size. The seal around the door is garbage right out of the box. The shelves can fit a case of cans but the weight makes the shelf sag resulting in the shelf below it to be unusable. Typical China made junk where they design it but don't test it in the real world. Do not buy.
"Fridge looked nice, but after 6 weeks it no longer cools. Has power and light up but will not go below room temperature. Very disappointed"
"Temp control doesn't go lower than 40 degrees?  A beverage fridge that doesn't get you cold drinks?  A nice fridge otherwise,  quiet and efficient,  but I'm really disappointed in not being able to turn it down and get cold beer.  Would not buy again."
"We purchased this from amazon, and it was delivered on 5-1-24. On 6-9-24 the fridge would not work at all. We tried plugging in a different outlet to verify it worked in no outlets. It completely died. How does this happen on a just a little over a month-old product? We are out the money. So frustrating"
"I bought two of these for my bar, they are very very noisy when the compressors run. Sometimes it even scares the dog."
I waited 24 hours to plug it in. Both sides of the cooler got very hot. This is a fire hazard. The vendor kept going back and forth and refusing my refund. They also wanted me to cut the cord and take a picture. üôÑ ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I do not recommend purchasing from this company!!! ü§¨
"Very attractive and easy to install.Digital controls are on body of fridge and not on door. We leave the fridge inside light on all the time so contents can be seen day or night.This fridge fits perfectly in the built in cabinet space where our traditional mini fridge quit. Only negative is that it's rather noisy. I've tried leveling it and moving it to different positions, but rattling noise always returns."
I bought this item for my son for Christmas 2023.  Two weeks ago there was water in my basement.  The coolant has leaked and damaged my hardwood flooring.  I called the company and they would not refund me or replace the item.  We used this for 4 months.  This should not have happened. Shame on customer service!! I am not impressed and will never purchase any of their products again.
"I purchased one of these a few months ago.  The first thing I noticed, is that you had to push the door closed and hold it,  just swing it closed it bounces back and stays ajar. Currently I have had this for like 3-4 months it does not keep the beverages cold. I reach into get a drink and they are barely even cold to the touch.  I wish I had not wasted my money of this item.  It is trash, spend more money and get a brand name with a better warranty."
"I usually do not like writing negative reviews, but I could not hold back. This product stopped cooling after about 5 months. I turned it off for about 1 week and turned it back on hoping that it would come back on. No chance. I will 100% not recommend."
"This thing is dark inside and freezes in the back freezing items near the back and can barely fit 3 gallons and eggs and food, I‚Äôm beyond disappointed I bought this I‚Äôll be replacing it with an adult fridge and giving this away"
The fan inside hits the cage and makes an awful noise. The refrigerator is unusable.
"Perfect for what I was looking for! Fits and functions as advertised. Reversed the door in about 20 min.Update: After reversing the door it continues to crack open and I have to keep realigning the door. I have tightened, retightened and retightened again the door to keep it fully closed. Overall it is a good fridge just ensure the pieces are perfectly aligned so the door aligns correct. I am going to try some lock tight to see if this fixes it.Another update: The door keeps not closing all the way. After multiple attemps to get this fitted properly I am still frustrated. The price is right but the performance is not there."
"I really like the size of this fridge, but the temp control is ridiculous. I have to set it to 33F to achieve 39F. Over time it drifts between 36F and 41F. It resides in the basement rec room which is cool, so there are no heat or airflow issues that would affect cooling."
Just received this a couple days ago but didn't get it unboxed and plugged in til today. I really like it and it seemed to work really good. I'm not sure if it's normal for these beverage coolers to CONSTANTLY be running so I checked it over and found that the seal is bad right out of the box.
The fridge looks great.  Love the light and digital. thermostat.  The fridge produces lots of condensation that eventually leaks out the front of the fridge onto the ground.  Not great.  Might be ok in dry climates.
"I have been reaching out to this company about the problem I having with it and they don‚Äôt stand by their warranty or their productTheCondensation is between the double glass.  They are saying it‚Äôs only condensation and it willGo away..  you can wipe condensation off glass this is in between the glass. Can‚Äôt wipe away, not my first refrigerator. They make more excuses than fixing the problem.  Clearly the seal is broke or it‚Äôs defective.  Worst ever.  DO NoT BuY!!!!!  More problems than cold drinks"
It works but the package came with a dent on the side and the plastic was peeled off in certain places
Dislike because of making knocking noise when is turn on or off. So annoying at night when is quiet.
"Didn't advertise as a refurbished product. Even if it is refurbished, they didn't take the time to fix anything on it. If it wasn't such a pain in the ass to send back, I would. Seems to run well enough, so I'll keep it but wouldn't recommend buying this product."
"Bad quality and no parts or service.  Circulating fan quit after two years, making it unable to hold temp correctly.  Unit has always been inside and is not heavily used.  Customer service‚Äôs solution was to try defrosting it, which did not work.  They then refused to sell me any parts to try to fix it and only offered a small discount on a new unit.  Why would I spend hundreds of dollars again on one of their products if they cannot build a quality product or offer any support?"
I was not happy with the fridge and the seller didn't want to take it back and refund me the money because I opened the box once....
"Well, I am very disappointed. I saw really great reviews on this product. It was damaged upon arrival and I am returning it. I doubt that I will order a replacement for fear that it will be damaged, too."
"Nice looking but it does not hold temperature. I set the refrigerator to 34 and placed a separate digital thermometer inside. After many days of being set and cooling, I have seen it fluctuate between 34 and 40, but it stays mostly around 38-39 degrees."
Opened the box to see this dent. Very disappointing for the cost.
This fridge worked great for two weeks and suddenly began having condensation on the outside of the door so excessive it's dripping off and puddling on the hardwood floors. This started a week ago and we've had to keep puppy pads under the front because the flooring had started swelling. It will have to be removed and replace. Contacting customer service tomorrow. It's been running three weeks total.
"After about 8 months the unit started beeping incessantly and had an ""E4"" error code on the display.  After looking through other reviews on Amazon it looks like I was not the first person to get this error which basically means the defrost sensor on the unit has stopped functioning.  For a small fridge that costs $300 this really should last more than 8 months before having sensor issues.I've contacted the seller through Amazon, but have not heard anything yet about a replacement.  I may update my review if they actually get back to me and do something about the defective unit.  As of right now I would suggest you look at other fridge options on Amazon and save your $$."
The compressor makes a loud noise. Doesn‚Äôt seem to be cooling very well after 24 hours of being plugged in. Can‚Äôt send back due to having to tear open box to get it out. Not happy with the purchase or price of the fridge with it having the loud noise coming out of the back of it. Do not recommend. My video will not upload to show what we are hearing.
Item arrived with a dent in the side left side of the fridge and also scuff marks everywhere around the front door. A little disappointed as the shipping box was in perfect condition so can‚Äôt even blame how it was transported.
Opened box. Pulled fridge out and it is dented.  Says past return window.  Please help.
"These are junk! I‚Äôm on my 2nd one in less than a year, at my lake house that is very seldom used. Everytime I come here it has a puddle in front of it & is barely cool. JUNK!"
"Overall it‚Äôs a good fridge. However, this heatwave has us demanding cold water! Unfortunately the water is dispensed at room temperature, requiring that ice be added. Our family of 6 has run out of ice a few times."
"""Gallery"" is supposed to be the better line of products, nicer finishes, more features.  Frigidaire Gallery has been a massive disappointment.  The freezer drawers fall out because the drawers are too narrow (or the cabinet is too wide).  The rails for the refrigerator drawers are so fragile, one of them broke in the first couple of months.  The shelves have almost 1/4 inch gap between the edge of the shelves and the wall of the refrigerator, making a precarious situation even worse when you have to think about how much load these shelves can take before they collapse.It keeps food cold and makes plenty of ice for our household.  But this refrigerator is an embarrassing example of a ""Gallery"" line."
"Ice maker is under recall. Noisy, doors will not align. Doors creak, the company canceled my repair date wants me to wait....its been 2 months. The Frigidaire gambit...keep making excuses till the consumer gives up."
The size and space is good.  I like that it doesn't have a freezer.  BUT....IT IS SO LOUD that I've had to move it out of the room I work in because the motor noise is deafening!!! Would never buy again and am currently looking for another different brand. Do not buy if you need a quiet refrigerator.
"I personally don't like this fridge, but my mom wanted it for her kitchen.  It's nice looking, but the fan is going constantly and makes an awful noise.  It does keep food cold."
"The size is perfect, however, it constantly leaks with the condensation and we have to wipe it out daily.  We can't put anything on the bottom shelf or in the drawer and it just develops a pool of water in the fridge and on the floor outside."
"Needed small beverage, extra space refrigerator in pantry. This is amazingly spacious, cools down quickly, is somewhat loud but in distant room so we do not notice.However the door pops open continously! Appliance is level, door load reduced. No idea why door will not stay shut. Must prop heavy object against door."
"Looks like a nice fridge,  but stopped working after 5 months of use.It was a 2nd fridge, located in cool basement, so no overheated. And only half-loaded.It hums (so it's not completely dead), but it doesn't cool.Danby is responsive to warranty claims, but it's almost impossible to find ANY Danby-authorized repair service in my area in NY state.. Still looking..Update: Danby replaced the fridge with a new one, and dealing with them was quick and pleasant.No problems.Upgrading this review to 3 stars from 1 star."
"Even at max cooling, this fridge won't drop into the safe range for food. I've tested it with 4 different fridge thermometers, including a waterproof one using water in the fridge, and it won't get down to 40 degrees F even at MAX cooling.I can't recommend this fridge for food that spoils, but it's fine for beer, wine, fermenting foods, or an out of control hot sauce collection."
That‚Äôs all you need to know. Drains water like crazy. Fan is super loud. Honestly just waiting to break and i have had it a week. Buyer beware.
The compressor has gone out shortly after purchasing. Have repeatedly talked to seller. Each call has resulted in them needing more information from me. The last request is for a thermometer in a glass of water in the refrigerator. Seems like they are making up requests as they go along. I would never buy from this company again. The cost seems resonable until you have to buy two refrigerators. One new one that doesn't work so you have to dispose of it. Then replace it with another new refrigerator with a warranty that is not just a lie on the web to sell the product. Living in an RV full time is much more difficult without a refrigerator.
"The refrigerator was delivered with a dent on the side. Before I placed the order; I was reading reviews of the refrigerator delivered with dents , but I ordered it anyway!  It was delivered dented to me! I love it!"
there's a pretty good crease in the rear radiator frame.  I'll give it a go and see if it still works.
Door gasket wore out and there doesnt seem to be a replacement.
"This refrigerator was perfect for 20 months - 2 months after the warranty expired it died.  I had a repairman look at it.  They said the compressor was shot and it wold cost me more to have them take it apart and fix than it would to buy a new one.Contacted Danby directly to see if there was anything that could be done to get it fixed by them.  They asked to have the purchase receipt emailed to them.  Did it.  Heard nothing.  Called again, they opened the ticket #108214 and told me that they would give me 10% off of the purchase of a new unit.  REALLY!?  Why would I want to buy another thing from them if they don't stand behind the product I already bought from them!!!  I guess I never realized that a $583. appliance was disposable."
tracking and shipping was unreliable
"This sounded promising but didn‚Äôt pan out. First it came damaged and dented from UPS. Then we could never keep the temperature regulated. It is VERY light weight and not well insulated so the temperature fluctuates wildly no matter what setting it‚Äôs on. It runs forever to get it cooled down then waits till it gets 50 degrees inside before it comes back on making it not safe for food storage. And, when it runs it‚Äôs very loud!! What a bummer!"
"This seemed like it would be a perfect fit for our needs. However, refrigerators should cool at 38 degrees. Even set to MAX, it is 40. We have been trying to work with a Danby rep to get the unit serviced. Five different supposed Danby authorized technicians cannot help us. The one that can has 1/2 star Yelp rating. We really don‚Äôt want to get stuck with a lemon!"
I purchased this unit to hold extra supplements.  After 5 months is quit working. If you need help you have to email or wait on hold for ever until you can no longer take it.
"The inside of the refrigerator completely froze within one day, when we thawed it out it refroze. Turning down the temp did not help. We received an email back from customer service that gave us suggestions to adjust the temperature and make sure it was not pushed against the wall. Our next several emails, after having another wall full of ice on the inside of the fridge, have yet to be answered. The inside of the refrigerator does not keep a consistent temperature. We definitely do not suggest this refrigerator."
I purchased this refrigerator for a extra in my garage. It has only lasted just over 2 years and it died. This is not a cheap refrigerator nor is it full size. It only has an 18 month warranty.
"This unit is very noisy, we can hear it across the house and we are very disappointed."
"It is leaking water.  Freezes cucumbers, but if I set the thermostat lower, then it's too warm. Piece of junk."
"Was sold as Upright Freezer, but is only cheap made refrigerator"
"Design, appearance, use of space and layout are excellent.Quality not so much.  The first one had to be returned because the thermostat was whacked out.  Regardless of where it was set, it would decide for itself at random what temperature to hold, and no turn of the dial would change its mind.  Also, the fan was way noisy.  This one went back and was replaced by the dealer.The second one was much better, quieter, and more responsive to the thermostat setting.  Unfortunately, the temperature range was not the spec that the nice Danby people had quoted, 32 to 50 F.  Highest was about 42 - for our uses too low.  I was willing to have their service put in a new thermostat instead of getting the whole thing replaced, but of the three that Danby listed, the first said they no longer service Danbys, the second never returned my call, and the third returned my call a week and a half later, by which time the dealer had already replaced it for our third unit, which does seem a bit better (around 45-46 degrees), 'though it's a bit louder than we like."
"I would NOT recommend this refrigerator.  Our 90 year old Dad bought this model, and in less than 2 years, the thermostat has already gone out.  It's going to cost him over $200 to replace the ""defective"" thermostat, per a Danby certified technician.  Unfortunately, it is not something we can replace ourselves.  Ironically, it is sitting next to a working 50 year old Kenmore freezer.  Danby should make products that last longer and not have customers replacing major parts within 2 years of ownership."
did not last 3 years spent 500 $ to fix it and then went out again one week after warranty on parts expired- never will i buy  Danby products
"The fan makes a very loud noise, also Purolator would not ship to my door , we had to go and pick it up..very disappointing"
"I bought this product for my twins‚Äô freshman dorm room. On move-in day, we plugged it in, the light came on, and we just assumed it would take a while to cool down.  Cut to the next day when it became obvious it wasn‚Äôt cooling.  Tried multiple outlets, giving it ample time to cool each time.  Nothing.  Read the manual, just to be sure there wasn‚Äôt something we were missing. No luck.Brought it home and tried it again, just to be super sure before contacting the manufacturer. It simply didn‚Äôt work.  I was bummed because, quite frankly it‚Äôs a hassle, but not mad.  Stuff happens so not a major deal.Contacted the manufacturer and within a week was told it would be covered under the warranty.  Yay, right?  Not so much.  Seemed like an easy enough matter of sending them some photos verifying I‚Äôd done certain things (eg. severing the cord, writing/etching the claim number directly onto the fridge). No problem.  Submitted immediately.  But it‚Äôs now turned into weeks of submitting what‚Äôs been asked for, waiting days to hear that all is well, just to be told yet another photo of something is being requested.Enough.  The product didn‚Äôt work.  It never ever did.  So I don‚Äôt love having to spend weeks jumping through hoops to receive my money back.  I realize this isn‚Äôt a review of the actual product.  Maybe the fridge is amazing when it works.  But I think it‚Äôs important to also know what happens if a product doesn‚Äôt work out."
"UPDATE:We've made valiant efforts to use this small fridge but it's just a piece of junk. It came without a manual. After a few days of putting in food, etc. it froze everything near the freezer area; there were no instructions on defrosting it other than unplugging it. Went to website for support but there was NO SUPPORT FOR SMALL APPLIANCE, ONLY LARGE REFRIGERATORS!  AND NO SUPPORT FOR MISSING ITEMS EITHER.AMAZON HAS FAILED IN ITS ATO Z GUARANTEE POLICY. WE NOW HAVE  TO DISCARD THIS FRIDGE AS IT HAS RUINED ALL THE FOOD WE STORED IN IT FOR JUST A FEW DAYS. AND BOTH AMAZON AS WELL AS THE SELLER IS SIMPLY ABSENT TP PROVIDE US THE HELP WE REALLY NEED!PART I:I just received this little fridge. Unpacked it last night‚Äîwhich was very easy, although I would have preferred to have the instruction booklet as soon as I opened the box, rather than waiting until EVERYTHING was unpacked, untaped, etc. and the fridge door was open, when the sparsely informative booklet fell out. I had too many questions that were not answered.Most importantly, the inside fittings in the fridge I received were quite different than what was shown in the model I purchased. Although II included line drawings of the empty doors, fridge and freezer, they‚Äôre not very self explanatory! No ice cube trays. Freezer size is minuscule. No veggie bins, even IF they had to be small. And the fittings in the door‚Ä¶? I‚Äôm not sure what is meant to go in there.The appliance is very well made, quite handsome‚Äîbut after unpacking it and placing it where I wanted it to go, it looked really tiny.Because the legs were not level once I put it where it was supposed to go, I plugged it in but waited until today to adjust it so that it‚Äôs absolutely level. By this morning, it had gotten very cold. It‚Äôs very quiet. The door opens and closes very easily and quietly.Will fill it with food, etc. today and will update this review in a day.PART II [UPDATE]:This is NOT good news. In my effort to level the fridge‚Äîwhich it was very unstable once it was set up‚ÄîI followed directions but one of the two legs kept falling off. I was forced to empty the fridge, then gently lay it on its back so I could see clearly why one leg would not work, only to discover that it was missing a part: a metal hinge with screws that attached each leg to the bottom of the fridge. Mine only had one such attachment. I went back and searched the entire box it came in, all packing materials, the plastic bag which held the instructions and nowhere was that hinge‚Äîwhich should have been on the fridge in the first place.I went to where I placed the order and clicked on ‚ÄúProblems with item‚Äù. Was given two choices. 1st was to go to manufacturer‚Äôs website, which I did. They only had a category for LARGE Appliances, nothing small, no mini-fridge. There was no Customer Service Phone Number!The 2nd choice was to call Amazon. Which I did. They offered me no help in contacting the manufacturer to replace the part. They were happy to have me RETURN the refrigerator but repacking it would not be an easy task‚Äîand an expensive one. It hardly seemed worth the effort and time. So Amazon suggested giving me a partial refund and finding someone local to fix it!I now have $46.00 and a fridge I can‚Äôt use unless I can locate someone who‚Äôll I‚Äôll have to pay to find the part and then to fix it!This is clearly not an example of Amazon‚Äôs A to Z Guarantee!"
"I don't know how this happened.  It must've been boxed up and shipped with this dent as the shipping box was not harmed or beat up in any way.  I will use it as it is for work and I don't have time to send it back, but it's very disappointing to say the least."
I can hear this thing kick on all over my house. It‚Äôs annoying as all get up. It‚Äôs a very terrible frequency of buzz and it‚Äôs 3x louder than my regular sized double fridge. It might have to go in the garage because I just can‚Äôt get over the annoying noise. Otherwise cool little fridge. But this is almost a dealbreaker.
"Had this sitting in hallway for 3 years till it eventually stopped working for some reason, never figured out why as there's no type of support or anything if not on warranty. It also needed defrosted often; likely never getting another with an ice section, I can see now why so many don't have one. It's so small on this one that it's pretty pointless anyways."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The door is not closing like it should be you have to push it close if let it go it shouldn‚Äôt shut until you push it close and then it‚Äôs hesitant to close
when I leave the thermostat at the suggested mark the temp is around 50 degrees on the bottom half of the fridge. turn it colder and the freezer freezes up and the temp is no better. Top shelf cold but that is it. Defrosted twice in one year was overdue. Overall a disappointment for the price!
"Unpackaged this morning. Looks like something was dropped on it, or it was dropped."
"The freezer compartment is very small. The freezer doors is not solid, it has slats."
"There is a large dent on the upper tight side and one on the top of the new fridge. The shelf reaches halfway to the door, so it is a shallow shelf.  It is louder than our full-size LG."
The fridge arrived with a huge dent on the front
"It cools well, but a little noisy!"
"I bought this mini fridge while it was on a good sale, and expected what was in the picture. Instant disappointment.As others have mentioned, the fridge looked different from the photos and had a small dent. I overlooked this all at first because I didn‚Äôt want to repack a heavy fridge.It worked pretty well for the first few weeks, but then I began putting an ice tray in the freezer. In a short while, ice began building up in the freezer and limiting space. Defrosting has become useless with how often it freezes over. A few days ago, the freezer‚Äôs lid broke off.On the plus side, the fridge works well. Unfortunately, the different design limits how much I can put in my fridge.I bought the fridge based on the photos, features and price. After a few months, I can confirm that I should have bought a better fridge and done more research.It‚Äôs a 3/5 from me, mostly for the freezer and frost issues. At least the food is cold!"
"The fridge overall does its job. However, there are 2 things that left much to be desired. One, the freezer area builds up ice even when the temperature is at 2 (out of 5), which means at least once a month I need to unplug and defreeze. Second. The storage area is also limited. We purchased a similar size fridge a few months ago and the storage area was a lot more efficient. This model, has a bottom that fits nothing over 1.3 inches in weith. Very few containers are so small and very few times one finds the need to store anyting that small. Thus, 1 of the 3 storage are is pretty much useless. Counting it as a storage area is laughable and deceiving. Not very happy with the purchase but at this point it'd be more trouble to return than to keep. But I do caution future buyers. The product is ok but not very good."
"My husband has a fridge that gets much colder than this one. The drinks are cold, but not real cold that disappoints me because I like my drinks very cold not frozen but very cold."
"The fridge itself works and was nice and easy to get set up. But there‚Äôs a few problems with it. Like many of the other reviews said mine also came with a nice dent in it which isn‚Äôt great for the cost. But the big issue is the fridge wobbles because it‚Äôs uneven. There‚Äôs a screw on the bottom of the fridge which touches the ground and throws the whole balance out of wack which makes it a little harder to open. Overall it‚Äôs good, but I feel like it‚Äôs not worth it for the price."
"Wow, this has been an ordeal.I ordered two of these mini fridges.  One was fine, the other was smashed in pretty badly on a corner and looked like it had been damaged during shipping.  I returned that and ordered a replacement, the exact same item.  The third one came without any major dents, but all the plastic had already been removed and there were minor dings and scratches on the outside - it was clearly not brand new.  I opened it up and a shelf was missing, everything was out of place, and the freezer compartment didn‚Äôt shut properly, it was bent.  On top of all that, it was actually a different fridge, despite the same item number - the stainless steel was a different color, and all of the interior shelves were different than pictured.  So 1 of 3 mini fridges was new and not damaged, really not a great success rate.  Sure, returns are accepted no problem, but it‚Äôs heavy and frustrating to move around, and packing the fridge back up and waiting at home for a pickup or having to drop it off because it‚Äôs so large is a major hassle.Overall, if you don‚Äôt care about finish at all and just want something to keep things cold at a very good price, then this will be fine for you.  If you want something that comes new, undamaged, and as pictured, I would look elsewhere."
"Arrived on time with a sweet and funny driver.  Thanks, Amazon!The item is dented on one side in the back with low grade dents in other places.  The driver wheeled it to my door and I slid it to the room where it now stands.  No opportunity for dents and no stress signs on the outside.  However, in addition to the dents, the fridge itself had the protective coating peeled off in large patches, or simply left dangling in a number of places.  Despite some dried residue on the bottom of the fridge, it did smell clean.Disappointed that the fridge has been used or resold in some capacity without clarification as I'd likely have bought anyway and would have made the logical adjustments.  Perhaps the return is because of the noise.  It is most definitely louder than than 20 and 15+ year old standard full kitchen fridge/freezers that I have.  It is loud enough to be distractively heard on a phone or video call when in the same room with and odd loose metal rattling sound intermittently.I think it is a decent mini fridge.  With some noise dampening materials, I'm hoping it will be more quiet.Would not repurchase at this price or with the limited, fact based details provided by the seller."
"I bought this refrigerator because it was small for use in my garage and was one of the most inexpensive ones I could find.  The refrigerator arrived with the top rear corner slightly smashed and dented.  Additionally, and thankfully, I looked at the compressor as I removed the cord from the rear of the refrigerator and noticed that the compressor was only connected by two of the four feet.  The ""feet"" of the compressor are only attached with a thin metal plate that slides over thin metal mounts that are bent over like rabbit ears to hold the compressor in place.  Not a real smart or rugged design.  I cannot believe they saved much money manufacturing those cheap mounts instead of simply using stud and nut mounts.  I searched the packaging and found the missing metal plate and was able to refasten the compressor.  Will these mounts last, time will tell, but it doesnt look good.  Good news is that it runs very quietly and seems to be working keeping my beer cold.  You get what you pay for.  This fridge may last 20 days or twenty years.  Its a gamble."
"Received the package and brought it to my office to set up the next day. None of the packaging or boxes the fridge was in had any damage, but as soon as it was set up I realized the door had a gnarly dent on the corner that stretched about 6 inches across the door.The fridge itself it working just fine, but without any of the boxes being damaged, tells me it was packed this way. The fridge‚Äôs functionality should be 4-5 stars but the negligence of the company to have a product boxed that‚Äôs already damaged is dropping the stars."
"Very noisy fridge, which is why I immediately knew when it died. I opened the door and it was extremely cold inside so guessing the thermostat malfunctioned and it burned up trying cool more than it was capable of cooling. It was never a very cold fridge, milk spoiled in two days in it. I went to powdered milk and only mixed what I needed for the day as a result. Anything that was critical to keep cold went on the top shelf at the back, the only really cold place in the fridge. Everything else became a science experiment. ""Freezer"" compartment not cold enough to freeze anything or keep anything frozen. Disappointing performance and durability. Better than nothing. Barely. OK size for one or two people. Mine was not dented at all."
"Worked well for three years.  Kept in the garage.  Started to collect ice and upon cleaning it out, realized it had a Freon leak."
"Nice looking mini fridge. Bought it 10 days ago and works fine in my bedroom, very quiet. Came with a dent on the side edge of the door but door seems to seal well. The problem is that the sides do get very hot, not just warm, throughout the day and night. Even if the door has not been opened recently. I use it for light cooling of drinks and open the door to get a drink out (seconds) two or three times a day. I am concerned that it does get too hot for many minutes each time. Half of the time the sides are just warm or cool. Is this a safe hazard?? Temp setting is at 4 so not overworking, presumably.I will post this question for the general users to see if this is common. There is nothing in the manual about this. Many reviews are good about this ""Amazon Choice"" mini fridge but I am concerned."
"The fridge itself works fine and when you see the wide freezer compartment you might think that's the size you'll get, but you won't. The ice builds up and leaves barely any room for your food. Old fridges used to have this problem so I never expected modern refrigerators to have this issue."
"This fridge stopped keeping its temp after a few months.  The warranty process is pretty ridiculous; it took several months.

"This is a good-sized office or dorm refrigerator. But it suffers from two serious flaws. The first is the door, which lacks enough weight (or a sufficiently well-engineered closing mechanism) to close properly without an extra push, meaning that it can easily be left slightly open. The second is a combination of TERRIBLE instruction manual and the failure to clearly indicate how the temperature control works. As usual, on these small fridges, the control gives you an option of 0 to 5. Meaning what? Is zero the coldest? Or is 5 the most power to the cooling unit (meaning 5 would make it colder)? Setting it to zero turns off the compressor, turning off the fridge. So does that mean that 1 is the warmest setting without turning it off? What I can say, is the setting it to 3 will not keep a gallon of milk from going bad over the course of a week. So now I'm experimenting with a thermometer and checking every day to see what the temperature is. This is annoying. Would it be so hard to put ""Colder"" and ""Warmer"" at the ends of the scale? As it stands, I probably would not buy another one."
"I ordered this product in April 2023. It arrived with a small dent. I set it up in the garage and plugged it in. It worked well for over a year. In July, I opened the door and realized that it was warm. The refrigerator only lasted for 15 months..."
"This is a nice looking unit and fairly priced.  It has a fairly long three prong cord which is handy in terms of placing the unit especially since they discourage using an extension cord.  They also tell you not to lay the unit on its side, upside down, or at an angle so keep that in mind in the event you want to swap the door hinge side.  There are adjustable glass shelves which are really handy.  Unfortunately, the packaging leaves a lot to be desired.  Our first unit was DOA.  To Amazon's credit (and perhaps a lot of luck on our part),  Amazon had a replacement unit to us the next day.  The second unit had a fairly deep ding in the side which wasn't visible until the outside packaging was removed; since the unit would live in the garage and we needed it for our guests, I kept it.  The unit has a miniscule ice tray, but you can add your own.  I made the mistake of turning the temp dial all the way up and several items froze solid.  I turned it down to about 75% and items on the top shelf froze making quite a mess.  I've turned it even lower now and we'll see what happens.  So a word to the wise, go easy on turning the temp down and watch out for the top shelf.  We gave the bad unit to the UPS driver who delivered the replacement, no indication yet that Amazon has received it so I've got my fingers crossed."
I usually overlook most things just because I dislike the hassle of returning items but this is unacceptable. The damage is pretty bad. Just be aware prior to purchasing as this is sadly a common complaint.
"The refrigerator gets cold fast and worked well. I really liked it. I took a chance of it being refurbished with no dents, but even if you level it, it made noise. Every time the motor started to work, something was clicking against it. It was in my office, so it was too much of a distraction"
"bought for my studio; great price, size good; arrived dented in 2 places; no obvious damage to shipping box, though box had previous paper labels cut off; assume this was someon'es previous return.Returned it."
"This may be a good fridge for a hall way in a office building or to store drinks in a game room......I thought this will be big enough for 1 person. Maybe if you are a college kid and store not much else then drinks and sandwiches.....I chose this particular fridge for my studio apartment because it was supposed to be quiet. It has 2 different sounds - a buzzing sound, which I was supposed to get rid of by leveling it. The other sound is something like a howling wind.... Spent hours trying to level it on my rustic Saltillo tile floor with no luck.I have to adjust the temperature control all the time. Every time I take something out or add something the temperatures changes. Managed to freeze the blueberries and mushrooms on top shelf....Another reason why I chose this fridge is the freezer compartment. Sounded like a good thing to have..... But - when I read the manual I have realized that it is recommended to use only for keeping frozen foods for up to 3-4 days."
"Cute little fridge that works well, but the packaging in the box leaves a lot to be desired. Very thin styrofoam in a cardboard box. That was it! I discovered a few dents upon original unboxing of this, and while it doesn‚Äôt affect the performance, it does affect the overall aesthetic."
The product worked decently well but only for about a year it no longer works.
"Got fridge very fast, hinge holding the door was bent but no big deal. Let it sit overnight, read the instructions and followed to the letter, plugged it, it buzzed with a high pitch loud noise for about an hour. Irritating but I thought it was adjusting itself somehow. Noise finally stopped and I thought, good, this is not as loud as it seemed, which would have been a problem for me. Checked a few hours late, fridge was not cold. Checked the outlet but it was working, changed the outlet just in case, waited overnight. Fridge never got cold. Concluded noise had stopped because fridge was not working. I had no problem returning it with vendor, pick up and refund were very prompt. But if you are a single woman, or are buying this for your daughter's dorm, it is quite a hassle getting this unpacked and situated then repacked (bottom of box comes off which is great to unpack, but a nightmare to make sure box is secured when you repack it) and quite cumbersome and heavy in the end. I was glad I had not disposed of the box or it would have been a nightmare to return, That  being said fridge looked nice inside and out, although one cannot remove the grid that holds cans. Stupid because I don't drink pop and could use that space for a bottle of water but only cans will fit there. Was perfect size for my needs, top was a bit scratched but nothing I can't live with if only it had turned on properly and stayed on. Conclusion, I will never buy any igloo product again. Either their products suck or they have no quality control whatsoever. I don't know much about fridge technology, but the back mechanism did not look that complicated to me, rather barebone actually, I assume if it can be broken by transportation it must be pretty flimsy in the first place. If not then they never checked their appliance in the first place. Granted this is only $110 for a fridge but still. In short buy at your own risk, this cost me 4 hours of my time, some backache, and a lot of packing tape to secure the bottom."
"Can't give a full product rating review on functionality or anything - too soon to tell, just got it & unpacked it. benefit of the doubt cause so far it works on day #1.. Damaged - Was not handled with much care by whoever loaded it or delivered it seems, as the bottom of the box was barely attached.. the remainder of tape that was still adhesive is what was barely keeping the fridge from falling out the bottom -The fridge is dented on the lower left side, a smaller dent above that & then the top left edge/side is also dented. The glass shelf inserts that were taped inside, was mangled, (likely from being dropped or something bigger landing on it or something). The small bottom glass shelf was jammed into the plastic shelf rack and both corners of glass were punctured into each side corner."
"I first ordered the fridge that is in the box. Shortly after being plugged in, it would buzz and then I‚Äôd hear a ‚Äúthock‚Äù noise and the buzzing would stop. Then another ‚Äúthock‚Äù and the buzz continued. I called Amazon and the representative said that must be an issue with some part, and they sent another fridge. After boxing up the first fridge and sealing it, I plugged in the second fridge (pictured, unboxed) and not only does it do that same ‚Äúthock‚Äù thing, is heavily dented on the side. And the box was not damaged at all so my thought is that it was dented before it was put into its box. It was such a pain reboxing the first fridge that I‚Äôm going to try to live with the second. Part of me wants to return both but it is already going to be a hassle taking the first fridge to UPS. Suffice it to say, I do NOT recommend this fridge because what are the odds that the replacement is worse than the first order?  And the buzzing stopping and starting so loudly is annoying if you work in the same space as the fridge (which I do, because it‚Äôs in my office).  I will also add that the  first fridge has a long human hair inside of it, which really grossed me out."
"I'm giving this 1 star, but would give 0 if I could.  I had shipping issues, which caused a delay.  Ok, can work with that.  Ends up at the USPS and they tell me I have to come pick it up.  Nope, not going to happen in a 1996 Corolla.  It gets delivered and I'm so happy it finally made it.  NOTE: do not cut the tape on the top of the box, because the box just slides off, as it's sitting on a styrofoam bottom.  One packing strap, was hanging off the side of the box (not a good sign).  I get it back to my work space and remove the box.  Here's where the real disappointment kicks in.  This was an Amazon item, not from a 3rd party seller.  There were 3 holes in the box from where it had gotten beat up.  The bottom was beat up.  There was a small dent in the front (was not happy about it, but could live with it.  There was even some kind of greenish brown sticky looking  residue that had run down the side (did not touch it or try to remove it).  The final heart stomp, was a quick peek at the back.  It had been dropped on the top corner so hard, it pushed the metal in and the paint was starting to peel away from the top and the sides.  I called Amazon, and finally worked my way up to someone who was willing to help me (thank you Andrew).  The first lady made the wrath come out when she said she couldn't help me.  So...this one is going back, and I'm going to give it one more try, only because purple is my favorite color and I really want this fridge in my library.  If you order it, just be prepared to have to send it back.  Only upside is that they will pick it back up from my job, so I don't have to borrow a car from someone to drop it off to ship back."
"I received the refrigerator with a drip shelf that does not fit.  I tried to obtain a new shelf, but can only obtain a whole new refrigerator. It came in a box with no bottom.  Seems to work.  I tried Amazon customer service, chat message does not allow free form entry, only select from menu.  Selected I need more help (only applicable choice).  receive message ""type a little about what you'd like help with so I can get you to the right place"".  again, not possible to type, can only select ""Never mind, I'm all set"".  Tried calling, took 3 tries, after prolonged and thorough inquiry to make sure I am who I am, can only get a new refrigerator, not a shelf. They did give me a $90 credit so I could get my own shelf somewhere that fits.very time consuming and frustrating."
"Fridge arrived on time.  It works fine. Temperatures and freezer all work fine.  It's actually pretty good.  BUT, the packaging is terrible.  This is one of those boxes where you need to life it up to reveal the fridge.  There are dents and dings on several places and some places are bashed in (please see pictures).  I don't think the damages were made during transit because there are no corresponding damage on the box where the actual dings and dents are on the fridge.  This damage had to had happened during or before the boxing of it.  It is beyond me, perplexed to think what kind of abuse this poor fridge has gone through.  It would be such a hassle to re-box it and return it, so I decided to keep it since the functionalities of the fridge are all fine.  This thing should have sold at a cosmetically damaged price.  So if you buy this, don't be surprised if it also has dings and dents all over.  It's a question of if you could tolerate looking at the dents for as long as owning it."
"Item came in tattered box, literally falling apart. Upon opening the box, the fridge was dented on the back left side and despite a protective film covering the outside of the fridge, had several deep scratches.  I attempted to switch the door to the other side but the reverse side did not have the same configuration of screw holes (which would have required a separate drill hole to be made).  On the bottom of the fridge it had an uneven stance.  The door could not swing open with side being taller than the other.  I had to prop up the shorter side with styrofoam.  And this being a mini refrigerator it had difficult getting cold.  Not hours, but days.  It's serviceable but not for $109 plus tax.  I called Amazon to ask about returning the product for a refund.  The box was literally in pieces and was not salvageable.  At first I was asked to send it back in that box. I said that it was not possible.  I was then asked to find a box at home.  Again, I said that it was not possible. Finding a big enough box for the fridge would not be easy.  The I was told to go buy a box at a store. Really? Seriously?  I then suggested that Amazon mail me a folded box and that I would be happy to tape it together with my own packing tape. They said that was not possible. In the end they finally came back and said that they will refund the money and I could keep the fridge. Well, okay then.  It wasn't worth it for them to reclaim the item I guess.  So for free this item is worth it - it provides okay but not great refrigeration. Needs to be modified to stand properly and needs drill holes to properly switch the swinging door to the opposite side. But for nothing I will take it.  Don't spend the $109 plus tax!!!"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Bought from you about a month ago.in the refrigerator itself, the light is on and moisture constantly appears but does not freeze.what can i change to make it work? let me know if you faced this problem. Can change some fuse or bolt?)  Or return it to you so that you throw it in the trash And they gave me a new one?!))Please answer me soon because I need this baby food refrigerator. thanks."
"Refrigerator seems to work, but metal casing was damaged in shipping. Box and packaging materials don't seem sufficient to protect the refrigerator. Need it now and don't feel like the hassle of a return. Disappointed."
Was so excited when I received this frig.  It was absolutely perfect.  Got it all set up and then noticed the rear corner is crushed in.  I don't see any easy way to return this item and keep it secure in the box because of the way they ship it.  The strapping is the only thing really holding it in the box.There was no apparent damage to the carton it was shipped in so I'm wondering if I received a scratch and dent item.  I don't feel the price reflects that if that is the case.Have it turned on and it seems to be working.  Will have to wait a day or so to confirm.
"The fridge arrived in nice packaging.  However, the fridge had dents in the side due to the extremely thin metal used to construct this appliance.  (The cardboard packaging was actually stronger than the metaI!)I purchased this fridge with the intent to use it at my job to mainly house drinks, so I did not care about the external dents.  I expected to find multiple adjustible shelves inside of the appliance.  There was ONE wire rack and a plastic drip tray for the freezer which actually wasted the only fixed glass shelf space.  (I trashed the plastic drip tray.)  I would not recommend this as a cold drink fridge but it makes a nice regular-type fridge for a dorm room, etc."
"I placed my first order and it was beaten to a pulp by carrier. I immediately opened up the unit and discovered dents on the sides and back. I had to repackage the unit and drive to my local shipper to return. What a hassle!!The refrigerator itself is a good unit, nice all white finish, good compartments and perfect for a college student."
I was exciited about getting a new mini fridge but when I got it I couldn't open it when I finally got it to open...it did not look like the video then the I couldn't close it the bottom part of the tray holder was preventing it from closing I ordered another one and it looked like it was previously retuned finger prints all over it and manuel was opened I'm keeping it because I dont feel like returning it again...Wish me luck
"First of all, when this item arrived, the top and both sides were incredibly hot for the first hour. For that time I thought it was a fire hazard. Luckily it stopped being so hot an hour in. Periodically gets that hot again (along with a lot of noise).The noise coming from this fridge sounds sort of like that humming that old fridges have along with some snoring/gurgling sounds that are annoying enough to warrant me returning it even if it worked.And it doesn't work. It's been three hours. My ice cube tray feels exactly the same as when I put it in. My whiskey is still warm.I'll leave it on overnight. If my ice is at least frozen by then I'll give it another star.Edit: So the ice is freezing properly (overnight wasn't enough. Took longer than that). The top of the fridge when it's doing its cooling thing is dangerously hot. My mother unfortunately threw out the box without me knowing, so I guess I may be stuck with it. Which despite it working I still don't want it. This thing makes sounds like it's possessed by a demon, gurgling, electronic whirling noises, everything I don't expect out of a new fridge. I highly doubt the efficiency rating due to the heat of this thing, and if it's even safe to keep in a house. For now, I'm wishing I could pay someone to take it away from me while I buy another fridge that actually works how I want it to."
"I bought my fridge from the Amazon seller.I read a previous review stating the fridge does not get cold enough, so when I recieved the fridge and set it up I turned the dial to the max (7) in fear that if it were lower id spoil my items.I opened the fridge up the next morning and just about everything except my soda was partially frozen! The previous reviewer may not have known there was a temperature dial....Other than that, this fridge is a steal for the price. Like many before me, mine came dented. But the reason for these dents is the fridge is in a box thats just about a quarter inch bigger in diameter than the fridge. The only thing protecting the fridge is a tiny quarter inch styrofoam wall on each side / top and bottom of the fridge. My dent was in a minor place and didnt affect the fridge whatsoever.The inside of the fridge is HUGE and spacious.The freezer portion is very small and the lip for the little door sometimes is a little hard to get to."
"This refrigerator works well, but bought for bedroom for a sick person with meds that need refrigeration. This refrigerator makes loud noises 75% of the time."
The size is perfect but the temperature doesn‚Äôt stay set sometimes it is too warm and others it‚Äôs way too cold
"I keep my fridge super clean but find that whenver I put something in it, it either doesn‚Äôt get cold or freezes. No in between. The freezer portion at the top works fine. The drip tray does it‚Äôs part but is difficult to clean and mold collects in it if not cleaned frequently. Makes owning the fridge a hassle. Bright side: I‚Äôve had it almost 2 years now and it‚Äôs still holding up."
"7-19-24 - COLOR IS ALL WRONG-NOT LIKE PICTURE!! I ordered this for my classroom and wanted turquoise like in the picture so that it would match my classroom theme. This is light blue, like a sky blue. I'm very disappointed. I have not used it yet since it doesn't match, so I don't know how it works. I will say it is bigger than I thought it would be. It's a great size.Update: I plugged it in just to make sure it works and it's noisy. When the compressor is on it makes a loud humming and buzzing noise that is distracting. Maybe in an area that is loud you won't hear it but otherwise you will definitely hear it."
Received tonight with significant dents toward the rear of the unit. Box showed no sign of damage. This seems to be a common problem with this unit..look at the reviews. I am going to let it sit overnight before I plug it in to see if it works. Considering returning.
Dents here and there!!
"The freezer section didn't work at all- the food I kept stored in there defrosted completely. However, the food just outside of it managed to freeze solid. Go figure. The bottom level is basically unusable because of the large bump in the back. You can fit a few water bottles or cans of soda there, that's about it. I hate the storage on the door- things keep falling out.I wish that it didn't waste space with the completely unusable freezer section, and that the components taking up all the space in the bottom were moved up there instead so that the bottom shelf could actually be a shelf."
"The fridge came dented from slipping on the lower left corner and would not shut properly until I fanagled the hinge and mounting plate into a position that would allow the door to close all the way. The temperature control is not very consistent and the freezer box ices up constantly. Keep the temperature control on 4 and it works alright, but it warms up quickly if you open it too many times and takes a while to cool back down again. If I knew what I was getitng I would have passed and gotten something else. If you need a smaller fridge for a dorm room this can work, but it's not terribly high quality. Does it keep things cold? Yes. Does it do it well? No. Overall it's meh."
"The drip tray does not fit under the freezer so you have to place it on the shelf which means you can't use the shelf....only the drip tray as a shelf.  Also, it is much smaller than it looked..the bottom section is only about 8 inches deep.  I'm a little disappointed but do not want to return."
"This isn't as much a review as the definitive answer to all the buyers who, like me, have been plagued with this unit leaking water which leaves a lovely white residue on the floor.Though this mini fridge is good enough, the reason for the one-star review is, when the company that makes this product under RCA's name won't admit that they make it, despite the Web evidence to the contrary, I certainly wouldn't bother purchasing this because you'll simply sit on hold for 20 minutes and get no support when they finally answer. The Net wasn't much help in this leaky regard, either.So, I went over the manual a bit more closely to see if I could gleam some possibility to solve the problem, and sure enough, it says to keep the unit at least 4 to 5 inches from the nearest wall(s). The second I made that adjustment per the attached photos, the problem went away! The fridge hasn't leaked once in the last four months.Put as simply as possible, if yours is leaking, move it away from the wall(s)."
The operation and finish is fine but it needs about 5 inch adjustable legs wheels would be evn better .if yoiu set it on the floor it drags the rug and its low cut.It really affects the convenience and appeal of the whole fridge.
"This fridge has a middle shelf that is split, the front part slides out. So when you load it , and open the door, bottles fall out and break. That is the only shelf you can put tall things in like bottles. Very disappointing"
"Arrived with a dent (Amazon discounted for the dent). The 2-star rating is because the interior is nothing like the photos in the description. There is no 'chute' for 8 cans, but slots for only 6. The freezer control is different and the door shelves are different. Product dimensions are correct under the 'About This Product' section but smaller than the Product Dimensions in the initial description. Amazon support connected me to the manufacturer, which was a giant waste of time. The rep said he would call me back after researching. Once I was reconnected with Amazon support, I realized RCA had no contact information for me because Amazon doesn't supply it for privacy reasons and he didn't ask me. Disappointed in RCA, but Amazon support was very good. It wasn't worth the time to send it back and find something different as it was a gift."
"I had ordered this as it fit the space I have for a fridge perfectly. I initially was going to pickup a used mini-fridge, but they all seemed to have issues. I decided on the RCA both on price and size, It came damaged (box and front door) but I really needed something to keep dietary needs cool. I decided to see if it would work and it started up perfectly. A day later and it cooling (and freezing) as it is supposed to be. Very quiet. Overall a great unit. Only 3 stars due to damage."
"The refrigerator works well.  It keeps my beer cold which is why bought it.  However, it was delivered with a large dent in the door.  Since it is a garage fridge I kept it rather than pack it up and ship it back.  The container it arrived it was not damaged so the dent occurred at the factory.  Disappointing they would go ahead and ship it."
Drip tray just falls when you slide into shelf.  Tray is not that correct size.  Was told would rpeceive new Drip tray.  As of yet have not heard from vendor with when he will ship new tray.  DO not buy they say they will help and support but do not follow through.  CALLING AMAZON AGAIN AND THEY CAN TALK WITH VENDOR.  OR SUPPLY ME A RETURN AUTHORIZAYON ND my money.  Will set in street for them to pick ul.
"First of all, I am happy, so far in a day, with the product. The only reason I gave 3 star is because of the delivery and return policy. I understand it's a big piece of stuff. Returning is not usual. I didn't want to return it. But when I was trying to give some feedback about the damage on my smartphone app, I learned this product can not be returned. That made me upset. When I received this product, there is a big scratch, hole on the package, in the front. It's so deep, down to the refrigerator's front panel. There is a dent on the front panel. The dent is not very bad, but pretty obvious. For such a big piece of thing, I don't think returning is a good idea or worth the energy to do so. Just want to ask Amazon, what if the dent is really big and am I supposed to accept it as a new product but with damage?"
"This is the second time I tried to buy it and it happened again. The cooler arrived with dent damage, but this time less than the first one I returned. I couldn't find the front left leg and the tray that goes under the freezer, it doesn't seem to belong to this model because it's smaller and I can't place it. if you plan to place it in the bedroom, move it away from the bed because it is a bit noisy in the silence of the night. I stumbled again with the same stone."
"I bought this fridge for my 2 year old so he could independently prepare his breakfast and snacks.  He is so excited that he can get food and drinks out of his fridge all by himself and whenever he wants.  It certainly fits our needs. The outside has a very neat, low profile appearance (it disappears into the wall of our dinning room) and the glass shelves make the inside look roomy and clean.  My only complaint, and it is a bit of a big one for us, is that the door doesn't close very easily, especially for a (now) 3 year old.  My son is very conscience about closing his fridge but on many occasions I have found the door just an inch open because it doesn't really 'catch.'In hindsight, I wish I found a fridge that does not have the can holder in the door.  This is a huge waste of space since we don't store cans in here.  I wish it would convert to a juice box holder!"
"Well it came scuffed as a lot of the reviews mention but I didn't care about that. It hums and sometimes it can be loud but that could be due to it not sitting firmly on the ground. I have a wheelie cart under it, in case of leakage and ease of mobility. I will mention that the cover for the hardware for switching how the door opens which way broke. Some type of film or plastic cover is peeling horribly on the top of the fridge. It doesn't look pretty not sure what it is or why it is peeling but it keeps my drink cold which is what it was purchased for. If aesthetically you are looking for perfection in appearance this is not for you. If you want a small fridge to have drinks closer then running through your house at all hours this works!"
"After reading the reviews about the mini fridges being dented I figured that mine wouldn't be, but I was wrong. Mine has a dent in the fridge door. I like the color and it is for a dorm room so I as well as several others will keep it since with it being in a dorm room it could probably get more dents. But if you don't want any dents, I would not order this product, chances are you will be stuck with a dented mini fridge. The hassle of returning such a big item isn't worth my time which is where this company is seemingly becoming lucky that they are not being swamped with returned mini fridges with dents.  I'm hoping that when I get it to the dorm and plug it in it will work since several other reviews state that the moni fridge didn't work or stopped working after a bit. Spend the extra money and don't hassle with this purchase, move along....remember the old saying...you get what you pay for :-)"
"Big dent on the door which blocking the door to open on the other side. It is very hard to open the door. If you open it with force then it is hard close it. Actually, we didn't open the box because there is no damage for the package. After throwing out the package box we saw this issue. Also this dent is not visible for plain eye sight because of the color. Not sure what to do now.. Disappointed with the product."
"This refrigerator is fine, other than the freezer section frosting over every month or two. It is annoying having to defrost it. This takes time and a lot of wet towels.I would not buy it again."
There is a smell inside that I can‚Äôt seem to get rid of even with baking soda. The fridge also came a little damaged. It has some dents inside and pieces were off and it‚Äôs to put them back together. Doesn‚Äôt get very cold either. Or doesn‚Äôt seem like it gets cold. Takes awhile for things to get cold and doesn‚Äôt get ice cold and I almost have it to the max. But I guess it‚Äôs decent enough.
"I purchased this fridge for our summer camping trips.  The first thing I noticed is the box was missing the bottom.  It makes me wonder if it was returned?  I mean what product comes with only 3 of the 4 sides of the box???  The fridge itself is awesome inside.  I really love the layout.  It's also a nice size.  I did not plug it in so I can't comment on the cooling factor or efficiency.  Mine did come dented.  There was only a small dent in the left back top.  However, the back had several dents and some paint chipping.  Overall, this was only cosmetic and I could have easily hidden it.  But I returned it because if you purchase something new, it should be in new condition.  If Amazon would have offered me a discount, I would have happily kept it.  They did not, so I exchanged it.  Hopefully the next one is better."
"This isn't a bad product, it looks good, but the problem is it makes a lot of gurgling noise and doesn't seal very well. The main problem is the shipping. The box was very damaged with had large dents in the sides of the refrigerator which make the materials covering the sides peel away and it's missing 3 out of 4 legs.  The problem with all heavy large products like this is it's such a hassle to re-package and return so your stuck with it.Update: The refrigerator finally stopped working. Freon everywhere. I contacted Amazon which initially told me I would get another one, then backtracked and said I had to contact the Curtis company which sold the product. Waited 2 weeks for an answer. They told me then I had to destroy the unit and show them the evidence by cutting the cord, smashing the outside of the unit with a hammer, (which chipped and cut my face), peel off all the stickers and destroy them on video and THEN they would evaluate iF I would get a replacement or my money back.  At this point it's been 6 weeks.  I submit all the required evidence and wait another 3 weeks and they send me a refund. ( weeks from start to finish. Your results will NOT vary as this is their policy and how they do business),...as they say if you buy this product and yours goes bad, you were warned and got what you deserve. Look at RCA's record over the  decades...they have never been known to be customer friendly."
"Fortunately, this fridge is just being used in the garage and the multiple dents it has are not that big a deal. It's also good that the door is on the right side because the bracket is bent and over torqued and there is no way to switch the door. Also good I figured out how to secure the cover for the bracket with electrical tape since unlike the old fridge, this one doesn't seem to snap on.It's working and it's cold and the inside is nice, but whatever company thatsde this under the licensed RCA brand could use better quality control.  It also took almost 30 minutes to remove the plastic film they covered it in for protection that apparently didn't work."
"Overall this is an average refrigerator. It arrived dented. It had 5 dents on it. The box contained no damage upon arrival. It has an average storage capacity. The door has limited ways to store items.  It‚Äôs a little loud when it‚Äôs on. It has a dull hum and can be heard from across the room. It is a nice shade of blue and I like the idea of being able to choose the color you want. There are lots of options to choose from.I‚Äôm really not happy about the amount of dents all over it. I got this during Prime Days and didn‚Äôt need it until school started so I didn‚Äôt unbox this until I took it to school the other day. I kept it in the box so it would travel easier to avoid getting damaged en route to school. I read the reviews about the dents but figured after the multiple complaints this issue would have been resolved by now. Clearly not. Had it not had the crazy dents all over it, I would say this would be a 3-4 star refrigerator. But I can‚Äôt provide anything more than one star for a dented up refrigerator that should have been resolved by now after the amount of reviews that discuss the dents. I‚Äôm now past my return period and I‚Äôm stuck with it. Word of advice, if you purchase this open it immediately."
"If I could give this zero stars, I would. Bought this in November, for Xmas, for my son to use at college. Stored the boxed unit, up right and indoors (laundry room) until he moved in the following August.THE UNIT NEVER COOLED, RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX.It's past the Amazon return date, so I contact RCA (aka Curtis International). They make you jump through all these hoops, photos, videos, receipt, etc.They make you provide all of this so they can search for anything to claim the warranty is void. The picture attached is what they claim is damaged, therefore the warranty is void.If that's the damage, it was delivered that way. This was a new unit, straight out of the box. Never used prior to setting it up this August. Which consisted of taking it out of its box and plugging it in.Curtis International (RCA) doesn't stand behind their products, so I would stay away."
"I ordered this to replace an old mini fridge for one my offices. The first one I recieved didn't work at all when they plugged it in. I reached out to the seller and was informed I could not send the fridge back due to chemical hazard. They did send me a replacement but then I had to deal with disposing of the original broken one.The 2nd one works fine. The girls primarily use it to store lunches, drinks and coffee creamers. For a small office of 2 people this suffices."
"Fridge looks nice but opened the door and was knocked over by the smell of chemicals.  I am airing out the fridge before use to see if that helps.  If the smell does not subside, this will be returned."
Worked great until it broke down after a few years. Came dented and damaged.
"Dorm fridge stopped working after two months. Contacted warranty support and they require you to go through a convoluted process that also involves holding onto the item for effectively months. This is not realistic in a small dorm. I provided the photographic proof that I owned it, purchased it from Amazon, provided serial numbers, etc. They respond back with another set of photographic evidence which I provided. I then dispose of the unit. THEN, they come back asking for more proof that it has serial numbers scratched off and cords cut. Ok, by now, I have disposed of the unit as I had to buy my daughter another fridge and she couldn‚Äôt have two of them in her room waiting on $150. So, long story short, they know this is a crappy dorm fridge and most folks will not wait out the convoluted instructions so they do not have to uphold their warranty claims. DO NOT BUY. I went to Best Buy and got a fridge that works great from a reputable dealer."
"I love the color and it does keep everything cold. However, inside the door where a person should be able to put taller bottles and have them stay secure  is a little bar that, for some reason, is hinged. So rather than keeping things upright, it swings up just enough when you shut the door to cause the bottles to slide under it and out. Odd set up. Plus the can holder is also designed strangely. I can stack my cans in it but it's like pulling teeth out of an elephant to get one out when I need to. The floor of the fridge begins to slant upward about 1/2 the way in, making the entire floor of the fridge relatively useless. The company should hire consumers to design their appliances so that they are user friendly and make sense."
"Item ordered was delivered at 1:05 P.M. today, August 13, 2020.The unit is exactly what I ordered, however, the stainless steel door has three (3) small dents.  The packaging was intact, so I believe the damage was done at the manufacturer or during the packaging operation.I attempted to take a picture of the door in order to highlight the damage, however, the shine of the stainless steel prevented obtaining an image.I wonder if a new door could be obtained and installed.  I really do no wish to repackage the unit to ship back to you.  The original packaging is gone (to the dump).I jus don't want the refrigerator to appear junky or used.James R. O'Donnell"
"i love this fridge for my room, it fits perfectly. The only downside to this purchase was that it had a dent in the front left middle of the fridge when it was delivered. I'm not sure that ill have time to return it for a new one so now unfortunately im just going to have to cover it with magnets and stickers. I guess just make sure to check your package in detail when ordering bigger items."
Poor freezer compartment/bad controls/hard to see and adjust. I would not buy this again/wish I would‚Äôve returned it but I couldn‚Äôt because I‚Äôm handicapped. Just had knee surgery twice and really needed a good ice compartment. BAD!
"The freezer section has SLOTS in the door, so moist air turns to ice in a few weeks, requiring a complete cleanout. The compressor is very noisy, especially on start and stop. Don't waste your money on this."
"Like the product but when it arrived a few days ago the bottom of the box completely fell out while getting it out of the box and then noticed a dent  in the door.  For the price I paid I would've liked to receive a perfect product.  Would have been okay with getting a discounted price rather than returning it as my husband had recent surgery and I have neck issues (my neighbor helped me set the refrigerator up) but unable to do  this - the company, Spreewell  will only replace it."
"I really should have read the reviews a little more that looking at the ratings.  My big fridge is broken at the moment and returning this one is just not doable.  It‚Äôs working fine for the couple days that  I‚Äôve had it but I am disappointed that the fridge that is supposed to be new, arrived damaged.  There‚Äôs no damage to the box which makes me think that it was damaged before it was put in the box.  Amazon gave me a discount off for the damage, so that‚Äôs appreciated, but RCA really needs to work on there quality control.March 22, 2021- Working great!  The little freezer separates itself from the refrigerator and both are keeping everything cool and organized."
"Ok, I‚Äôll be honest to ya. For the price, yeah it‚Äôs a good lil fridge for a garage or work shop but there are some things you need to know if your planning on getting this particular make and model.First- I don‚Äôt recommend it in a dorm room or man cave/she shed or anywhere noice is a concern. This thing is as noisy as heck when the compressor is running but when it‚Äôs done with it‚Äôs cooling cycle on the other hand, dead silent. No it‚Äôs not broken nor is there anything wrong with it. It just gets really LOUD.Second- If you‚Äôre like me and you like things really cold then be prepared to set it to the max. Then that leads back to the first issue.Finally- DO NOT fill the door with anything heavy or the fridge will tip forward unless there is equal weight pushed to the back of the fridge and freezer to offset the weight of the door. If none of these things is much of a concern that it‚Äôll get the job done just fine."
"If I fill the door with cans & bottles, it's apparently too heavy for the hinge (10 cans) & the door comes off.  Also, whether from shipping damage (not obvious from appearance of shipping carton), the fridge doesn't sit level (even using the leveler) looks like the back corner has been dented in and the grounding part of the plug just fell off. Fridge works & keeps soda & water cold but I'm really disappointed.  Can't return since I've thrown the carton out & it works well enuf for the garage.  Maybe I got a lemon, but doubt if I'd buy again."
"After letting the refrigerator settle for a few hours I plugged it in. After about 20 minutes it began emitting a loud buzzing noise that cycled on and off with the refrigerator. I went online and tried to return it only to see the message that it was NOT RETURNABLE. After 45 minutes of chatting with the Amazon customer service rep, who reiterated that the unit was not returnable, I was transferred to the supplier. They told me to take photos, videos, make a copy of my receipt, fill out the warranty claim and then would review my claim. In reading the warranty I discovered that in the event that they approved the return I would be responsible for the freight charges to send it back to them. The time and effort involved, and the expense of the return freight charges is more than the $140.01 that I have already spent. I will take the fridge to the dump and take the loss. I have been an Amazon customer for 15 years and have never had this problem returning defective items that were sold and shipped by Amazon. Very disappointed with this transaction."
"Got this for the office.  First delivery it was dented badly.  Returned.  Second delivery dented badly.  This time I kept it because the office needs a fridge.  It's just cosmetic damage, but seriously, what's going on with the packaging that it can't handle the delivery service?"
This product was good for about a year. Now I dont have a freezer in my dorm because it doesnt get cold enough. I have the knob at the highest setting and for some reason it doesnt freeze anything in the freezer part. I wish they would send me a working fridge because this just lost me a lot of money :(
It takes forever to get the plastic wrap off and you will probably get a few scratches in the paint trying to get it off it is absolutely stupid I think it's only on the black one
"While i got my fridge and i'm sure i will be happy with it, it came to me after i opened the package pretty beat up. There are scratches all along the top and on the sides, while it wont affect the way it works for something that i paid $150.00 for and being brand new, i feel  it should look brand new not like someone returned it for the same reason and allowed it to get more dinged and beat up along the way to me.  I feel for that the price i paid i want a brand new item which is what i ordered and while i have something that works i am disappointed in the appearance of something i paid a lot of money for."
Works pretty good so far! It froze the can of redbull we had in it. So we know the fridge can get pretty cold. I love the color. It did come dented in multiple spots. But I‚Äôm not going to try and return it and get a new one. So much effortüòÇ
"While the box description includes the word  ""freezer"", the manual actual refers to this as the  ""chiller"" compartment. Had for a 5 days now- most times  temp in ""chiller"" reads 25 - 28 degrees on #5 high setting, which my refrigerator/freezer thermometer designates as ""freezing"" not frozen .  ice cream bars mushy, ice cubes about 8 of 12 frozen. Refrigerator does ok at this setting - hovering between 35 and 40 degrees (USDA says 40 or below should be fridge setting).Probably  fine as a ""dorm"" unit  but we are using to replace our ""dead"" fridge as there is a shortage of new refrigerators (at least 1 month wait) due to Covid delays."
"I've had this for 10 months now. I finally got around to putting a thermometer in it. It seemed to be working ok, but when I temped it, it was at 47 degrees. So I cleaned it and waited a day. After several trials, I have determined, the only way to keep the temperature at 40 degrees or below, is to remove the plastic tray that separates the freezer and the fridge, AND remove/open the freezer door.I did see the temp drop to 37 degrees once, but, it appears to maintain a steady 40 degrees when I do this. 40 degrees is the temperature that health inspectors look for. I prefer 37-38. With the freezer door removed this fridge works fine, however, I feel it should keep a proper temp with the freezer closed."
Arrived with a 2‚Äùx1‚Äù dent on the front door. I returned it as it was visible. Terribly inconvenient.  I didn‚Äôt replace as I worry the. Ext would be dented too.
"Got this little fridge to keep in my office and store my medical supplies that require refrigeration. The fridge looks great, although the Moonlight color has more of a green tinge to it making it look closer to Mint. The little fridge does not cool as well as a dorm fridge or a regular fridge but cools drinks enough to be acceptable. The fan noise is too much for me though. The thermoelectric cooler requires constant airflow and the fan in it is too loud for a quiet office environment. The biggest problem is that the fan has to stay running all of the time. Was hoping it might be able to shut down after a warm-up, I mean cool-down, period but it stays running at that whine, not hum, all of the time. Will keep it since it was so inexpensive are probably use it to cart around things on road trips since it works well enough on trips. Just have to always make sure to let it run 6-8 hours to pre-cool before taking on the trip."
"It's nothing to write home about but it does exactly what it says on the tin.It's a mini-fridge large enough to hold a couple cans of soda or beer, and you can maybe fit some lunch meat or utensils on top.  There's a switch in the back you use to turn it on or off and it stays running constantly, but the power intake should be minimal.  It's just a tiny fan and cooling element.You'll need to watch the door when you shut it.  It has a twist-lock on it so when you shut it, it stays closed.  But sometimes, if you try to swing it shut, it will catch on the lock but not close.  You'll walk away thinking it's closed and come back to find it's lost all its coolness and everything room temp.  But this is just a minor note.  Altogether, I do like my Frigidaire mini."
"Bought this fridge to keep in my office as I pumped for my baby upon returning to work. Ultimately ended up returning the mini fridge as it was too small for what I needed. It was unable to hold milk bags and my pump parts, therefore needed to upgrade to a bigger size. That being said, it is super cute. The red color is vibrant and aesthetically pleasing. It appeared to be a good quality if you are looking for a small pop storage!"
"They don't really put this information front and center, but in the user manual, the specs say that it's designed to cool a little under 30 degrees Fahrenheit below ambient temperature. That means that on a summer day, it's not going to get colder than about 45 to 50 degrees. For comparison, the standard consumer refrigerator is recommended to be at 37-40 degrees. That said, it's great for what it's marketed for (drinks), as well as for why I got it (overnight cat food storage). I was also thinking about using it for medication storage, but I would definitely check the recommendations of your pharmacist on the temperature before throwing it in there.That said, it's a very cute design, much better than your standard block dorm fridge. It's pretty low power consumption too - 600 milliamps (0.6 A) at 120 V A (plugged into the wall), or 3 amps with 12 volt DC (i.e. with the included car cigarette lighter cord). Unless your circuit is really saturated with a lot of stuff plugged it, it's probably not going to trip.Overall a good investment for the price - although I wouldn't try to keep an egg salad sandwich in it for more than a day or two.Edit - changed from four stars to three. Since this thing is basically an electric-powered cold pack in a pretty-looking cooler, it's prone to condensation, leaving a small puddle both inside and underneath the device."
"The cooler maintained a temperature below optimal for the first eight months.  Using a digital thermometer, it was consistently at 33 degrees F.  A real refrigerator should be about 35 degrees.  Ice would build up on the back wall of the interior, but it did not seem to affect its ability to keep drinks chilled.  Then suddenly, with no change in the environment or the receptacle being used, it stopped maintaining that temperature and had water on the floor of the compartment.  The interior rose to 44 degrees F, not optimal for drinks.  I unplugged it for several hours and reconnected it.  No change.  I called customer service and waited 25 minutes for someone to answer.  I provided the serial number, and the rep transferred me to Curtis, the manufacturer, who promised to call in 2-3 days.  They called 4 days later and informed me the cooler was guarantied for only 180 days and suggested I take it to a repair shop.  Doing that would be completely ridiculous.The fact that so many buyers report failure in less than a year makes me think the factory deliberately buys and installs cheap components with short lifespans.  In my case, I spent $4.25 a month for eight months.  Not too bad.  Just sad that some manufacturers are not interested in gaining a reputation for product longevity."
I am terrible at understanding how big things are so the fact that this is tiny is not disappointing - the dimensions are on the site...but it is tiny.  It works for me as I really just need it to keep my yogurt and water cool during the school day.  While it does keep things cool - it is not very cold.  I would not be able to put milk in it for a few hours or overnight.  It simply does not keep things that cold.  BUT it will work well for keeping my lunches cool during the day and it is adorable!
"The pink is a lot brighter in person. It can hold up to 6 regular cans of soda, but a small water bottle barely fits. It‚Äôs not heavy. The door seal is great. Cools down very quickly. I work 10 hour days and within a couple of hours of plugging this in it was already cool. My can of soda, that wasn‚Äôt refrigerated prior, was really cold a couple of hours before the end of my work day. The quality is okay and the handle seen in the picture is NOT the handle it has. It‚Äôs one of those that is permanently etched into the plastic that you slide your hand under. I could barely hold it by the handle with my nails. My nails are barely longer than my fingers because I type all day. Still totally worth it. I just wish they had the correct handle and color pictured."
Not sure plz expectations on a air cooler frig. Also all works better if you put a cold or maybe frozen water. Cools it down better. I got this girl literally concentrates. Told it's great for that. Oh n like the jade face roller n gel mask. That's all I know but that's bc I was told that. But definitely the cold item helps a lot. I wouldn't pay full price brand new to me it's not worth it. Go to fb these are all over. I think wrong expectations. Imo.
"i know its not a large fridge or anything but it took really long to cool the small juices i put in there and it also wasnt very cool either , the bottle barely even had condensation on it when i removed it"
"The seller was very nice as the product was shipped promptly.  However, I returned it because it didn't keep my food very cold, and everything took on the taste of an apple after 1 day."
Super cute and useful. Would recommend while it lasted. Worked for 14 months then died.Amazon sends you to the wrong customer support service website. The device is not actually Frigidaire but Curtis.
"Will be a Christmas present, it's a great nostalgic idea. Was just disappointed the item was delivered in it's original packaging and had a few dents. Hopefully the item didn't get damaged inside."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I've had chefman fridges in the past which are much quieter. However, they only last a few years so I thought I would try a different brand. I have this fridge in my bathroom and we have to turn it off when we sleep because it's so loud which defeats the purpose.  It works well so far so I gave it 3 stars."
"I liked the retro red look.  I needed it for meds.  It has quit working in 2024.  It was purchased new in 2021.  The compressor and fan are dead.  So, like everything else these days, not built to last a super long time."
"I would prefer if it kept contents colder.  The motor is quite loud, I have quieter fans.Still, works well enough to keep yogurt cool overnight."
"Been using this for about 3 months. It‚Äôs rly cute I use it for my skincare and it def keeps my products cold. The fan sound was quiet and didn‚Äôt bother me for the first 2 months. However, as I keep using the fridge the fan seems to get louder and louder which is getting annoying."
It freezes over at the nails that are inside and I have to unplug it and let it defrost at least once a week. I don't know where all the water is coming from but it ALWAYS results in a puddle.It barely keeps food cool (NOT cold) and my office is always very cold. I would NOT buy this again and wish I could find a better one but they all seem to have the same issues if they're this size.Update: it stopped working 6 months after I bought it. Waste of money
"This doesn't cool down to fridge level, only cools relative to the room air temp. Not great for breastmilk storage"
"We put sodas in this little cooler and left it closed overnight and running.  Next morning they were just slightly cool.  Definitely not cold.  Now if you put already cold sodas from the fridge in, it does maintain the temp.  Reviews were pretty good so we thought we would give it a try since we at the time we're delivery drivers and always in the boxtruck.  I would have purchased a pricier plug in cooler if I would have realized this doesn't work that well."
"This keeps my sodas cold REALLY well. However the thing has a condensation issue. if the fridge is full, half full, or only has one soda in it the condensation still happens. and its not a little bit, i have to replace the paper towel i put in it about once every 2 weeks b/c it will be soaked through after 2 weeks. and what ever is on the bottom of the fridge will be extra wet too.other than that it does a great just, just know about the condensation."
"It's a nice looking little fridge although the ""moonlight"" seems to have a very slight greenish tint to it. The cooling is fine. I was surprised at how loud the fan noise is compared to my previous mini fridge. It reminds me of how a gaming computer sounds during a gaming session. I turned it off for now until I find another place to put it where I don't have to hear it."
"Why would a yellow sticker that is impossible to remove be placed on the front of a blue refrigerator? I have tried everything I have to remove the sticky mess.  Other than current aesthetics, the product is great."
this is a good little fridge and it keeps things cold but I kind of regret getting it just because I don‚Äôt really know what to do with it (random impulse purchases) but other than that it works good and stays cold
"I wanted to like this more than I did, honestly due to aesthetics and price. It is super cute and goes well with my nursery. However, there are a couple of things that don‚Äôt make it practical if you intend to use it for your bottle-fed baby.Firstly, you would need to keep your house pretty cold in order for the fridge to be cold enough. There is an ambient temperature range in the manual, and it says the fridge can only cool ~30 degrees below that. So, not only does your house have to be cold for the expressed milk/formula to actually keep, but it also is an approximation. I didn‚Äôt feel too comfortable with that. We keep our AC on 72 in the summer, so 42 degrees is too warm for formula.Secondly, your pump may not fit in here. I have the Baby Buddha. Only one 4.5oz pump bottle can fit in here with the flange still attached if you remove the fridge‚Äôs shelf. So, I would have to decant the second one before putting it in the fridge. Not the best solution for overnight pumping, but if you consider expressed milk can still be good at room temp for 4 hours, you can feed it to your baby in less time and feel confident it‚Äôs still fresh.Things I did like other than style were the dc/ac plugs and quality for price. We switched to the car plug on a 3hr road trip so I‚Äôd have somewhere to put my expressed milk. Since it wasn‚Äôt 100% what I needed it to be for the baby, I appreciate that it is adaptable for different outings and trips. We might start using it on the back patio or something. Diverse uses and the price justified keeping it."
While the quality is good it‚Äôs quite noisy for my treatment room.
"Bought this little fridge to put my Zepbound shots in so they wouldn‚Äôt be in my regular refrigerator.  It‚Äôs TINY ~ like wayyyyy smaller than I suspected, weighs nothing, and is a very lightweight plastic.  However, it sits perfectly on my kitchen counter and got cold-cold in an hour!  It will hold three boxes of Zepbound shots. I am glad I bought it and I think it‚Äôs adorable.  I will not be carrying it anywhere or using it in my car so it is perfect for my needs.  I would never recommend this lightweight little thing for daily carrying to and from work or outside use because I can‚Äôt imagine it would hold up well.  It‚Äôs built like a child‚Äôs toy.  Fragile.  It‚Äôs still perfect for my needs.Update:  this frig is not meant to run 24/7.  I checked it often.  I noticed after about a week that there were times when it was barely cool at all.  I would not trust expensive medicine in it again.  It was a waste of my money."
Looks great but is very noisy and doesn‚Äôt get very cold.
I didn't receive the charging cord for DC use in the car or RV. Also did not receive the power cord for regular AC use in my office (why I purchased this refrigerator)
It's ok thought it would get colder
"I understand this is a very cheap fridge.  I honestly expected it to last no longer than two years.  However, it seems to have died after a mere 8-9 months of use.From the get go I was disappointed in this product.  It didn't cool my drinks very well, made them maybe 50F if I had to guess and the fan was some what loud.I cleaned about 2 months into it's very short life but I was about to just give it away to someone to see if they would like it better then me.  This is when I decided to research if I could make it cool my drink any better.  Sure enough you can and after watching a youtube video I found the company uses a very poor conductor between the cooling block and the fan.  So I took it apart, cleaned their thermal paste and used some leftover thermal paste I had from a past PC build.This fixed the cooling problem immediately.  My drinks were ice cold after this fix and I decided this was worth keeping.  So continued to maintain it for the next 6 months with regular cleanings and allowing it to air out.  However, the fan noise started to get worse a few weeks ago and I woke up a few days ago with the fan completely dead.Upon researching how to fix this fridge I came upon the most common issue with it dying.  Bad capacitors on the board that runs the fan.  The manufacturer likely cheaps out on them which is why it tends to die so early in it's life.  I even know the mostly likely fix but the question would be is it worth my time to do so based on it's cost.  Honestly no, unless you are really thrifty, have interest in electronics repair and already have the tools to do so.  Then you can buy new capacitors and fix the problem for less than buying a new one but factoring in time spent it's still not really a savings.This product is so cheap it's in between junk and worthwhile.  It made me actually consider based on the cost if this product should even be made on a moral level.  Obviously they make a profit but chances it will die and become garbage because people either don't know how to fix or are unwilling to fix with a mere year are very high and within two years almost certain.  This is the absolute zenith of a product made cheaply and not to last and it creates a considerable amount of waste and they know it, this is why some many reviews complain about their awful customer service.Don't buy it even though it's cheap, it's not good for our planet when we consume such cheap, bulky and replaceable products such as this."
"This fridge was great. I wanted a mini fridge to store my skin care items in my room. It was the perfect size and held a good amount. However, it did collect a lot of condensation inside, I ended up keeping a small washcloth on the bottom to absorb the extra moisture. And unfortunately the unit did not last very long. I purchased it August 2022 and it stopped working in August 2024."
"I was thinking that I had gotten a lemon and re-read some of the reviews but the Frigdaire I got the handle for carrying it are not recessed, it's a raised permanent handle that does not move. My biggest complaint is the electrical cord does not stay in the back of the outlet socket. So, you are not able to use it because it just falls out with no movement, it barely fits, and the plug is physically smaller in width, there should be some kind of indent on the plug-in adaptor end that enables the outlet socket to snap it into place, so it doesn't move but there is none. Looking at the pictures on the ordering page, the back of the Frigidaire 12v, 110v and Off/Cool switch placement are totally different. So, something must have changed with these units and the wrong plug or the same plug that was for the original unit before the change is still being shipped without updating the change, not good. I would have sent this unit back for an exchange or a refund but really need it for a trip I am going on. I'm an electrician and had some electrical black tape on hand, I wrapped the plug end to the width that it would stay in the 110V outlet socket. Tried opening and closing the door and the plug doesn't fall out now. The plus side is that I put two room temperature cans of sodas in it to test overnight (to make sure at least that works) and they were good and cold the next morning. Other than the power cord not fitting, which is a major big deal, I'm happy but not happy that I have to except a modified power cord to make it work and use it."
"The product worked great‚Ä¶at first. I‚Äôve had this for about 3 months. I use this mini fridge in my office at work and leave it plugged in and turned on consistently. For the first 2 months it was great. Kept items very cool and worked exactly as promised. Then one morning I came into my office to a very loud whirring sound of the motor on the minifridge overheating. Okay, it happens, so I unplugged it for the rest of the day. Next day when I got to work I plugged it back in and it immediately started making the same awful loud whirring noise again. I‚Äôve tried to leave it unplugged for multiple days AND weeks before trying it again and it still makes the annoying sound. Even if I could stand that sound, it doesn‚Äôt cool any more. GET THE WARRANTY!!"
"Not happy that I did not receive a brand new unit which is what I paid for. It was a birthday gift for my husband. He didn‚Äôt mind but I wish Amazon, the seller, someone would have put this as a possibility in the item‚Äôs description or something.Otherwise unit works well, I haven‚Äôt used a thermometer to see how the temperature compares to a larger scale unit but for unopen drinks I can definitely recommend this üëç Hoping we find some use of it aside from staying on a desk top, I enjoy the carrying handle and its small size. Hubby works in manufacturing and in an environment where a lot of other workers will elect to bring in full size mini fridges and put locks on them so they can store their food and drinks securely without buying expensive cafeteria food daily. Aside from the company provided fridges. This way he can keep personal size amounts of food temporarily and conveniently if he chooses to, or leave the whole unit in the car for a break!Overall, if you‚Äôre considering possibly purchasing a larger size unit in the future, this isn‚Äôt a bad way to experiment with what you‚Äôd personally find most convenient as it is quite an affordable option as well. Hoping it lasts longer than a year. If it dies soon I‚Äôll update my review."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It sounds the same as a desk fan. But there's also an underlying subtle hum at a certain frequency that annoys me. I'm not saying other fridges are any better. I'm just going to give up on little fridges altogether. This thing can fit 4 water bottles. But only the inner half of the fridge is the cooling plate. So only 2 of your water bottles deep inside will get decently cold in a decent amount of time. You'll probably have to keep rotating items in the fridge so they will have a chance at direct contact with the cooling plate.
"It‚Äôs really cute but it‚Äôs very small. It works totally fine, just a little pricy for the size."
"In 76 degree ambient temperature the drinks were only cold in the back, not front. Too iffy for baby formula."
"This is very cute, but it does not cool at a safe temperature for food (I bought a thermometer to check the temperature). If you put something in that you are going to eat the same day, it would be fine, but you can't store food safely."
"It's cute and it's keeping my sodas cold, but no sooner had I brought it out of the box, the handle broke.  I can still open it, and I'm tired of returning products, so I guess I will keep it, but parts are not sturdy."
"It's cute and exactly what I was looking for, but just one minor detail that I missed. It doesn't really effectively keep contents super cool relative to the temperature of the room it's in.I am in a hot climate and my upstairs bedroom gets really warm during the summer daytime (up to 80¬∞) and stays at no less than 72¬∞ overnight. Based on the 20-28¬∞ cooling capability, it will never be refrigerator temperature, and in all likelihood will stay around 50¬∞.That might be OK for storing a few bottles of water or canned drinks, but my intent was to use this to store breastmilk pumped overnight. Unfortunately, this little cooler isn't able to stay cold enough for that use. I will just add ice packs to it to bring the temp down, but a cheaper cooler would have done the same thing."
"Pros: Holds a few drinks. Looks nice. Very quiet.Cons: Doesn't get very cool. Does not last.First of all, be aware this is more of a drink cooler than a fridge. It does not get cold enough to keep anything that spoils at a safe temperature. Use it for water and unopened drinks only.Having said that, as long as you keep the above in mind it does work to keep drinks at a nice drinking temperature. I like the retro look. The peltiere cooler is much smaller and is practically silent compared to a traditional minifridge with a full compressor/condenser/evaporator. However, with that don't expext it to perform like a traditional minifridge either. It cools, but not near freezing cold, and is slow at that. Keep that in mind and don't expect too much and you may still be happy.Having said that, the real downside is the cheap components. The power board in mine fried in less than a year, releasing the magic blue smoke. Opening it up I see bulging capacitors and three blown reaistors. Reviews indicate this is a common issue, so they seem to use very low quality cheap components, and the warranty looks too much trouble to be worth pursuing if its not impossible to even get them to honor. Luckily it has dual power sources, so if you use the DC 12v input the power supply board is completely bypassed so you can still use the ""fridge"", and if you want to use AC power the power board is pretty easy to replace with a generic 12v power supply as long as it supplies enough current. I used a cheap 12v5a power supply which happened to nicely fit inside the rear cavity where the bad power board had been previously. I just had to cut and strip the wires from the old board and screw them to the terminals of the new board, just make sure you have the right polarity. Works just like new now."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I purchased this in September after I had my baby. I needed something that I could keep next to the bed and put milk in. It worked great for the first few months and one day it just didn‚Äôt work anymore. I tried all the troubleshooting and found no resolution. For $50 I would have at least liked it to last for longer than a few months.It‚Äôs a very cute mini fridge and was exactly what I was looking for. I didn‚Äôt experience and leaking and it was the perfect size to sit on my nightstand for those middle of the night feeds. I did have to take out the shelf to get my bottles or pump parts inside.It would be fantastic if the company would reach out and or send a replacement.
"This fridge is the perfect size for keeping baby bottles on my nightstand for nighttime feeding. However it is not quiet, sound is similar to a white noise machine on low volume."
"I love the retro look of this thing.You have to remember that it says it will only cool down products a certain amount below room temp. If you are going to use it for cans or drinks/food. Don't dare think you can fill it even half way. Otherwise nothing will cool. If you need something to keep things cold, and small, maybe think of a good cooler & ice."
I us it at my desk for meat and cheese and have had it now for a few months. It keeps it cool - not cold. Just a bit better than a ice bag.
"I could not even use it unfortunately. It isn't worth the money and delivery time. The color was pretty true to the advertisements/pictures at least!The item was broken when it arrived (and the first red flag was the fact that the corners of the box it was delivered in were torn up). A piece of the door was broken, as was the little fan in the back of the fridge. The broken fan made it insufferably loud! Also, I put a cold soda in the fridge, left it to cool while I showered, and it didn't cool down by the time I came back.Maybe mine was defective, but I personally would say it isn't worth the risk."
"It gets cold, but it is noisy. I keep it in my kitchen, so it doesn‚Äôt bother me, but if it was in my room, I would not be able to sleep. It‚Äôs louder than my actual fridge"
"Love the look, compact size, and carry handle on the top. It could be perfect, except it is noisy. Bought it for my room because I like cold drinks and wanted to keep my morning beds in it. It could serve that purpose except for the noise. I am trying to adjust but find it distracting and it make it harder for me to fall asleep at night."
Only gets your drink 20-25 degrees F colder than room temp. So not as refreshing as expected. But still cute for a desk sized fridge.
I didn't realize how small it was. I just wanted to put some water bottles in it.
Very cute color and fridge but the box inside was totally mangled and it was dirty inside.
"This was tinier than expected and like a hollow plastic shell. Technically it works and is cute, but the closure is cheap plastic and doesn‚Äôt always shut right, and you can basically only fit two soda cans and a couple ice packs in it."
"It doesn't keep drinks VERY cold, but cold enough to be much better than lukewarm. For those who want to know, the Interior Dimensions are 5.2"" wide x 4.83"" deep x 7.8"" tall, calculated by looking up the standard size for pop cans, which are 4.83"" tall x 2.6"" diameter stacked 2 wide x 1 deep x 3 tall. I also noticed that condensation gathers in the bottom of fridge space so you could drag some out onto your table surface as you remove containers."
"First off, this unit looks good, does what I need it to, and fits where I wanted to put it.¬† I will keep it.However, there are some important discrepancies and errors in the Amazon product description.¬† The main one is that the product description says item will cool ""up to"" 32¬∞ F below ambient, but the booklet says will cool 20¬∞ to 28¬∞ F below ambient.¬† I believe the booklet.Furthermore, the Amazon description has a number of things obviously copied from a different larger item.¬† This does NOT have a 5 cubic foot food section, nor a 2 cubic foot freezer; voltage isn't 4 V but rather switchable between 12 VDC or 120 VAC (both cords included); removable shelf type is plastic and not wire; there is no crisper drawer; the door is not reversible (hinges are on the right).A note about performance.¬† I put two room temperature 20 oz. Gatorade bottles in the refrigerator and it took about 24 hours for them to get as cold as they were going to get.¬† In future, I'll probably take items from my kitchen refrigerator and put them in the mini-fridge already cold.¬† This is not a problem for me, but it might be for you."
"This little unit is cheap and it's cute. What it is not is durable. This thing will take no abuse whatsoever and I am not sure how long it will last even treated gently. I have been trying to get the ""remove plastic piece before use"" sticker off of the front, but even gently peeling flexes the plastic so much I am worried it will stress fracture. It has a handle on the top. I would not trust that handle with the weight of even the empty fridge. The door opens with a twist latch instead of a normal handle, which is a bit annoying but not a deal-breaker. I don't dislike this enough to send it back, but I would not have purchased this mini-fridge if I had known how delicate it actually was."
Adorable design - very cute retro look.  Works well at cooling items but not insulated enough to keep items  cool once unplugged.  Won‚Äôt hold anything shaped differently than cans really so more limited than other car coolers.
"Yes, it‚Äôs got a nice finish and cute and all that.  The door isn‚Äôt straight all the way around with noticeable gaps here and there, small gaps nonetheless but enough for cold air to escape, and we certainly don‚Äôt want that!  Noise‚Ä¶It isn‚Äôt loud at all just the slight humming of the fan.  It goes cool/ cold (Depending on room temperature) roughly around an hour.  In one of the photo I‚Äôve uploaded, please note #11 says DO NOT store meats, dairy products that may spoil for more than an hour, probably due to the gaps around the door not creating a very tight seal, so ok, you‚Äôve been warned!Now for the life of me I don‚Äôt understand why Amazon shipped this in a box without packing it with bubble wrap, with that crumpled brown paper nor with those air filled bags.  Is Amazon cheapening out on packing materials?  This little Frigidaire was sliding around in the packing box when I picked it up off the front step to bring it inside the house and we all know shipping carriers are not handling our stuff delicately.C‚Äômon Amazon, pack stuff you‚Äôre shipping with packing material like if you‚Äôre shipping this to someone you care about and value - for example - Your customers!"
"It's cute. It's small. It reads can chill up to 6 cans down to 32¬∞ . Make note!  It cools based on the ambient temps in you room or car. And at most it cools about 20¬∞ less than the temp you are using it in. I wish I stoll had my old one that was duel cold and hot. It was great for traveling with snacks and soda, then warming baby bottles!!"
"Fridge itself is great for the price. Color true to pic, fan noise is noticeable but not absurd. Like a continuous white noise machine on low. Space inside isn‚Äôt great, shelf nice for smaller items but anything tall (not excessive) means you have to remove shelf. Latch on door is good, the only small amount of condensation pooling I found was I think due to my not latching the door. The plug, as other reviews mention, is terrible. Part that plugs into fridge itself will fall out if you look at it too hard. And is the ultimate reason I‚Äôm returning. It did come with a car plug option too but didn‚Äôt try as I got this for skincare storage not snacks/drinks.Does cool quickly once plugged in, but also looses chill just as quickly when the pesky plug falls out."
Holds 6 12oz cans but hard to extract due to the tight fit.
"It would have been great; BUT IT LEAKS ON THE INSIDE! üò≠ By the time we opened it and realized it leaked, it was too late to return. Definitely a defective one‚Ä¶"
This mini fridge is just as pictured but it‚Äôs unnecessarily loud.
"Unit does not cool well and after a week or so, water collects in the unit,  Did not send it back as the cord for use in a car was discarded."
This is cute but super small. One bottle of soda won‚Äôt fit but a can will fit.I have this at work. It will keep a sandwich and a small soda cold.
"So, this looks great. It is sized perfectly to sit on your desk and keep drinks chilled. The only problem is that the sound of it is just too loud."
Cute fridge that keeps drinks cold but it is so loud that I can hear it from two rooms away. I got a replacement one and it is just as loud.
"Bought for husband's work desk, but I call it my Barbie frig, way to small for what I needed it for. Works great in my car for traveling"
A handicapped person easy access to drinks
"I just wanted a little fridge to keep lunch in at the office - this looked like it would fill the bill.  It does work - cools off quickly - but it is very small.  Just getting a brown bag lunch in it was a squeeze.  It's loud, also.  I plug it in when I get to the office, jam lunch into it, and turn it off again after lunch.  Not really a ""refrigerator"".  More like a powered cooler."
"If you‚Äôre looking for a cooler that lasts long, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this one. I bought this mini cooler two years ago to store my skincare products, thinking it would last a bit longer with proper care since my previous one had a shorter lifespan. Unfortunately, it didn't meet my expectations. While it worked well initially, its performance declined over time. It‚Äôs a decent cooler for short-term use, but not the best option for longevity."
"This is my third time purchasing one of these type of mini-fridges (first time Frigidaire brand) and I generally like them and they all seem to be about the same.  I run them pretty much 24/7 and they have lasted about 2 years before dying.  I expect this one to be the same, but it would be a nice surprise if it lasted longer.I usually use it to put drinks in or short term food storage (overnight maybe).  It gets decently cold if the ambient  temperature is about 75 degrees or less.  If it gets warmer than that, it's still cool but noticeably less cold.It gets some water inside after awhile, as expected, so I keep it slightly tilted back so water doesn't spill out the front.  There's usually not a whole lot of water, but I just soak it up with a paper towel every now and then.It's nice and quiet so noise isn't an issue.Pros:+Convenience+Quiet+Relatively inexpensive+Works best in a somewhat cool environment.Cons:-Dependent on outside temperature.  Less effective if it is warm outside.-Some water can collect inside-Probably won't last foreverAs long as you know what to expect from it I don't think you will be disappointed.Update: So, I'm downgrading my initial review from 5 to 2 stars due to longevity.  It only took about 6 months and it stopped working.  I've had a few different brands over the years and inevitably this same thing always happens.  Sometimes it takes a little longer (or shorter) but they always end up failing.I wouldn't mind so much if it lasted at least a year, but six months is pretty disappointing.Still, when it worked, it was pretty good and was relatively inexpensive.  I doubt I'll buy another one of these unless they go on sale for around $20.  Any more than that and I don't think it's worth it."
Wish the fan didn't run so loud.
The plug doesn‚Äôt stay connected. Constantly falling out
The company this came from is called Curtis. They did give me a replacement but it had the same issue and started leaking quicker than the first one. Was moderately pleased with it until it started leaking condensation in under 5 months. I doubt I can return it but not sure what the warranty is. I will be contacting Frigidaire because that is the only recourse. It doesn't get terribly cold but it will keep water at a pleasant temperature but not as cold as a refrigerator. It's also fairly loud ‚Äî it has a fan that never stops so it can be annoying to listen to unless you can keep it in a room with a closed door. I'm going to have to get a regular mini fridge but this was nice because it took up a tiny amount of space.
"I don't know where people were at that things were ice cold, but it doesn't work that great for me, and I am in an office space that runs cold. Also, I wasn't sure if I saw it anywhere in the product description on the site, but the instructions tell you not to put anything that spoils into it."
"So, I was optimistic about this product but after trying it out the bottles inside (Small water bottles) were cool but not cold. Don't expect ice cold drinks because it's not going to happen. It's a nice retro look and nostalgia feel to it but that's it. Not too bad but if you want cold get a real mini-fridge."
"I was never in love with this little fridge; it kept stuff cold but always had a puddle of water in the compartment, which was kind of a bummer. Then one day it just quit working completely. What did I expect for under $30 I guess. I'm buying a replacement but not a Frigidaire."
It works fine but will only cool so much. I should have looked at item better before i made an impulse buy!
I do work indoors but it is not air conditioned I was keeping my chap stick and chocolate in this fridge. Worked great for a day . Just way too hot for the poor thing. So now it is in my daughters room :(Perfect for climate controled atmosphere
"Worked for about 9 months. I used it in my office to keep some cans. It's very handy for that purpose -- keeps the cans reasonably cold. However, now I need to buy another. Well, it was very cheap, so you get what you pay for..."
"I got this fridge to store baby's milk upstairs at night. It worked really well, but around 2am I noticed it wasn't cold and everything inside is warm. The light in the back is still on, but I've done all the things- switched outlets, switched off & on, unplugged from back, etc. We have had this fridge for a few months, it is too late to send it back."
This fridge is so mini I couldn't even fit my smallest plastic food container to fit flat. I had to return it because it wasn't going to do what I needed it to do - keep my lunch cold. I do love the style and color though!
"great size and perfect for personal use, but unfortunately, the door handle was broken when it arrived."
It's more of a cooler than mini fridge. The fan is loud and doesn't turn off
"it smelled kinda bad out of the box, but that's probably because it's 110¬∞ where i live and the plastic got hot. it was very hard to plug in since the plug was loose, but after about 20 mins of trying i got it to stay in. it immediately got cold, and everything i put in there got cold not even a minute later. it fit all my skincare stuff (after i took out the shelf), and it's almost silent. i don't think it'll last long, but it definitely works if you're looking for something cheap and temporary.after a couple weeks of use, all i can say is it's infuriating. yes, it ""works"". but holy s*** is the loose power plug annoying. i had to jerry-rig it into the fridge, and if i bump it slightly, it comes out and i dont notice, so i come back later to nothing being cold inside and i have to mess with it until it is good again. you shouldn't have to do that. it's a PLUG. it should PLUG INTO THE FRIDGE. it's absolutely ridiculous."
It‚Äôs so so cute but it doesn‚Äôt get that cold but it‚Äôs tiny and I personally love it
Love the look...it just a cooler ..doesn't get beverages ice cold....but I still like it.
"It is the perfect size for our breast milk storage that we don‚Äôt need to run to the kitchen at nights. Instead, we could store two packs of breast milk for our newborn. While I wish the temperature could be adjusted which I don‚Äôt mind to pay extra for it."
"This product works great as soda or beverage chiller. However, if you need true refrigeration, it is not the product to use. It does not reach true safe refrigeration temperatures. Was hoping to use this to store breast milk upstairs in our bedroom at night, but I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with the temperature. It does make some noise because of the fan, so be aware of that as well. It‚Äôs super cute - wish it could have worked for my needs! I could see it being great in an office or dorm room, though."
"Everything is nice abt the fridge expect im scared to keep it plugged in, not even 2 months of using the fridge it started doing this weird noise, im not sure what to do about it"
It's small. Just the right size for a bed side stand. A few cans or a snack is about all it will hold. Doesn't get very cold. One problem is the door doesn't closetightly  without holding. Make sure that the latch has caught before moving from it. It might not be closed. Can be used to hold medicine or makeup. I wouldn't overload. I prefer a little larger one but needed this one immediately
The handle was broken loose in box but I'm using it like that
I want to love it but it‚Äôs so loud.  I can‚Äôt keep it in my bedroom unfortunately.  I‚Äôll have to find a place in the bathroom or closet.
i use it bedside for breast milk. It gets cold enough for temporary storage‚Ä¶ the door does not seem sturdy.( i wish the handle was different). I‚Äôm constantly having to check if it‚Äôs fully closed.
"Could run colder, but not bad for the low price"
The quality isn't the greatest. But it keeps the drinks at a cold temperature. You can only fit 6 cans at a time. But if you want to adjust it it has a shelf so you can put snacks in there if you'd like for easy adjustability. It's making a noticeable humming sound and it has a weird electrical smell. Not sure if it's because it's new or not
"The fridge is cute but essentially, that‚Äôs where the functionality ends. I‚Äôm disappointed because I bought this for my daughter‚Äôs 11th birthday, she was super excited! After being plugged up for 24 hours the fridge barely cooled down. I ordered a replacement within 3 days of trying to get this one to cool down, which did come quickly, but that one also didn‚Äôt get cold after being on for 24 hours. It‚Äôs moreso designed for show because that‚Äôs all the product is good for. I returned both."
"This product worked well enough to keep a small Tupperware and drink cool for my lunches at work. No other items were stored in this mini fridge. It only lasted a year before it stopped working. I tried to troubleshoot it with the seller, but it is a AI assistant and useless.Will not purchase again."
"I am keeping it because it's cute and my toddler likes it, but this isn't really a fridge. You are not supposed to use it for perishable items for more than one (?) hour. It's basically just a cooler that stays cool. I bought it because I thought I could keep some snacks and drinks in my room so I am a bit disappointed. Just wanted to share with anyone else thinking of getting it for the same purpose that it isn't designed to hold perishable items for more than an hour or so."
I purchased one of these by different brand a few years ago which lasted for quite some time. My problem was that it never kept things really cold but it suited my basic need. I purchase this one because I figured the name brand Frigidaire would be excellent but it is not. It does not cool to the temperature of a regular refrigerator. I tested it and the coldest it got was 56¬∞. I use this for late night drinks like water and gatorade. I found that if I freeze my bottles first during the day then put them in the mini fridge in the evening it slowly melts through the night so I can wake up to a cool drink without having to go downstairs.
I did receive it three weeks ago although Amazon still has it as maybe lost and not delivered.  It‚Äôs a very nice looking appliance.  It‚Äôs a bit noisy making croaking hissing knocking noises.  But so far it‚Äôs working well.  I did accidentally break a side shelf since it was stuck and I needed to move it.  So I have to pay $30 for a replacement.  I hope it keeps working because I would not have paid this much if I didn‚Äôt need a smaller fridge. Again I hope it keeps working etc.
"I absolutely lovedddd this fridge. It was the perfect size to store on the counter top. The lighted mirror made it perfect to do makeup. Literally this was the definition of small but mighty. I never experience any problems with it until it stopped turning on. I did not over fill the fridge, I allowed space in the back for ventilation, never placed anything on it. I had it for less than a year and it just died. I‚Äôm extremely disappointed as I feel I didn‚Äôt put it through any unusual wear and tear. For what I paid for it, I would have hoped to get more use out of it. I pretty disappointed."
"Loved this but as other reviews stated, it stopped working roughly a year in. Great but wouldn‚Äôt buy it again unless they fixed that issue."
"This is the warmest mini refrigerator I have ever owned. It makes a buzz like it‚Äôs working, but inside feels room temperature. It looks nice on my vanity but the face products it holds are barely colder than if I left them on the counter. I threw away the box or I would 100% return."
For a tiny fridge it's loud.  Doesn't hold a lot but it fits in the space I had.  Still might return it for the noise.
"I did not realize how long this was from front to back. I should have measured more accurately before purchasing, it took up too much counter space. It seemed like great quality though!"
Sadly I bought this last August 2023. and it stopped working ( the cooling part) october 2024. Was awesome when it worked it looked like it kept leaking too woth nothing in it.
"Bought it in November 2023, kept on a table plugged in to one outlet. It broke in July 2024.  It was great while it worked."
After a few months of use it consistently has condensation in the fridge and everything in there gets wet. Disappointing.
"Oh, the Paris Hilton Mini Refrigerator‚Äîtruly a glamorous addition to my boudoir. The sleek mirrored door, the dimmable LED lights‚Äîevery inch of it screamed luxury and elegance. It was the crown jewel of my vanity, keeping my skincare products chilled and ready for red carpet moments. I thought I had found my perfect beauty companion.But darling, let me tell you, even the brightest stars burn out. This morning, just before heading out for a fabulous day, my beloved pink mini fridge decided it had had enough of being iconic and quit. No cooling, no warming, no dimmable glow‚Äîjust lifeless silence. It couldn‚Äôt even keep up with a beauty routine, let alone the demands of being fabulous!For a product that promises both style and functionality, I expected a bit more staying power. Instead, it fizzled out faster than a one-hit wonder. And now, I‚Äôm left wondering‚Äîif it can‚Äôt keep a serum cold, can it handle anything at all?I‚Äôd love nothing more than for this little gem to get a second chance at life (a replacement would be tres chic), but if not, I‚Äôll make sure every beauty enthusiast knows this: while it‚Äôs cute, don‚Äôt expect it to go the distance. Your beauty routine deserves reliability, not a meltdown.Consider yourselves warned, beauties.XOXO,A not-so-chilled customer"
"I have been searching for a cosmetic fridge for long time and wasn‚Äôt convinced about any of the ones out there until I found this fridge. Looked so cute and elegant with the perfect size to place on top of my bathroom  vanity. But what a bummer! üò≠ the fridge is perfect but that electric cord screw everything. The fridge is a beautiful delicate item and that incredible bulky black cord ü•¥ also, the place where the cord need to be plug take a good amount of space behind the fringe so it can be place completely back in the cabinet but also can‚Äôt be place completely close to the wall cause the cord is so bulky that have to be roll somewhere and is so bulky and strong that if I roll the cord too much will move the fridge and everything inside will fall off. Maybe for a different place might work but if is a cosmetic fridge the most likely is that people will place it in the bathroom.Well, at least didn‚Äôt meet my expectations. If that horrible bulky electric cord change I might buy it again in the future but for know I‚Äôm returning it. :("
"This fridge worked well, both the temperature and the light up mirror, for about 6 months. Then it just died. It started making a funny noise and, after unplugging it for a day, once I went to turn it on again it was dead. While it was good when it worked, I would not buy this fridge again."
"I‚Äôve had this now for almost a year. It‚Äôs really cute and compact. The mirror and light gives it a nice look. However it doesn‚Äôt keep the temperature cold. So if you‚Äôre using this for products like medication, ice roller, cooling or eye, packs they won‚Äôt stay cold. Not very functional. Wish i could return it and get a better one."
My daughter used hers about 7 months before it completely stopped cooling. Cute but didn‚Äôt last!
"This cute pink fridge worked for 8 months and then died, I‚Äôm hoping to contact seller to replace it or get a part to fix it. Overall a decent fridge."
"Do not buy! I bought this fridge to replace an old one that had stopped cooling. I fell in love with this one as soon as I unpacked it. It's super cute, the mirror and light is a nice touch. Since June, it has worked well for me until 2 days ago. There has been a burning plastic smell coming from the back. I clean it regularly and inspected the whole unit for any damage. The green light turns on, the unit is still cooling and nothing is warm or feels hot when it's on. But there's no way I will continue to use it with the smell coming from it. Not trying to burn the house down by mistake. There's also no one to contact over the issue. The link takes you the paris hilton website but there is absolutely no on to reach out regarding this device. The only option is for me to try to fix it myself but I may have to get a new fridge or just give up on mini fridges entirely üòÆ‚Äçüí®"
This worked great in the beginning. I liked it even though water would gather at the bottom. Few days ago the light started flashing periodically so I turned it off and unplugged it.
"Product is very cute! However, way smaller than expected.  Does not cool like expected."
Well it worked great till it didn't
I had this fridge for maybe 6 months and now it does not turn on cooling. It can do the heat setting but not cool.
"Please do not buy this mini fridge ! It is extremely dangerous !!! Out of the blue and thank goodnesss during the middle of the day at 2 pm, the motor of the fridge caught fire while my daughter was playing in her room. She smelled the fumes and we were literally able to extinguish the fire in five minutes but I just shudder thinking about what could have happened had this occurred in the middle of the night while she was sleeping or if no one was at home. In five minutes, the flames from the mini fridge were about 1 meter high and caused great destruction in the room. I advise you to please not buy this and even less for a kids room!!"
It would be nice to have a white cord. The large black cord hanging around in the bathroom window is intrusive to say the least. It is a cute petite white or pastel frig with a huge black visible cord.  White cord would be a much needed addition. Im shocked that noone has not addressed this.Thank you
"Ordered a Paris Hilton makeup fridge as gift, mirror on  front was cracked.  Exterior box was fine but there was a hole on the interior package and could see the glass was cracked once package was opened."
I purchased this for a Christmas gift and I was a little disappointed it was not very pretty pink and I felt like the quality was about the same as a $20 mini fridge
"To my surprise I was able to get the pink 4-liter mini for $18.02!! That was an incredible markdown from $54.99. I should have known that the deal I received was too good to be true because the item I received was already used and/or returned. The outer package had so much shipping tape which should have been my second red flag. When I opened the item it had SO many finger print smudges and to my further surprise, it did not come with any of the cords to charge or plug it up smh. Needless to say, I returned it swiftly. I would not recommend unless you are possibly paying full price."
"Bought this as a surprise gift for my teenage daughter. She loved it! Super cute, worked as expected. And then all of a sudden 5 months later just started blinking, and wee noticed it wasn't cooling anymore. We unplugged and plugged back in, and no luck, it just stopped working. Just beware if you're  purchasing it expecting it to last. Needless to say my daughter was super disdapointed."
"This refrigerator had okay reviews, it was cute,  and it was the perfect size for just a few products but didn't break the bank.However, the cooling was never cool enough, you'll get much cooler products with your standard refrigerator or even a mini, than with this tiny one.The deal breaker though is the fact that it died with less than a year of use. Not worth it, definitely disappointed."
"The first one I received had a chip on the mirror, they quickly sent out a new one. The fridge is cute but very small and does not fit face masks in the door. It also leaks inside, there is always a puddle inside if I don't clean it out every day or two the water leaks out onto my vanity."
"Unfortunately I returned because not even half of my skin care fit inside.  It‚Äôs a very good looking mini fridge, nice color and the mirror is a plus but it‚Äôs definitely not useful.  The measurements are for the outside however on the inside is way smaller."
"I really loved this fridge for its sleek design and mirrored front. Then, just 8 months later, the mirror light started flashing and wouldn‚Äôt stop until unplugged. When I went to plug it back in, it was dead. No power, nothing. So disappointed."
"I would have given it 5 stars. Unfortunately, this adorable little makeup fridge did not even last a year. Thankfully, my teen was sitting nearby when it started making a weird noise and then noticed a burning smell. Guess the fan/motor were not made to last. So, heads up for those who have purchased or thinking or purchasing, they overheat and could, if gone unnoticed, cause a fire."
I bought this 8 months ago and loved it. Only ever used the cool mode. Last night the mirror light started flickering light a strobe light in a night club. I unplugged it and waited a full minute for it to stop strobing. This morning I plugged it back in and it began SPARKING. Buy this if you want you house to catch fire in less than a year. Was great while it lasted. I‚Äôm very disappointed but I‚Äôm glad I was home when this happened.
"it was decent, but after sitting on the counter for 9 months it suddenly stopped working and everything inside went bad :/"
"I got this for my daughter in May for her birthday in June. She used it for a little over a month and it stopped working. I‚Äôve tried everything to get it to cool. It doesn‚Äôt work. It turns on to warm, but then shuts off. And won‚Äôt turn onto cool at all.The return window has closed. And the only options are to troubleshoot on my own, which i did. And to go to the Paris Hilton website. Which I did and there‚Äôs no option to contact anyone about this.I‚Äôm really irritated."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I have to that it is cute and that it's just I need it for, but ... The noise level is quite horrible and I have to see if the power consumption rises,  only time will tell. ü§î"
I opened this a month too late. I bought a early for my daughter‚Äòs birthday and never took it out of the box. We opened today and the mirror was shattered. Too late to return :-( what a disappointment.
Had to return it because it was so loud.
it took a week longer then it said it would and when it came in the mirror is busted
It‚Äôs a good fridge it‚Äôs quiet but way to big it‚Äôs bulky and little space for products. Even worse the mirror came broken!!!
The fridge was a Christmas gift for my daughter. It was cute and she loved storing her beautiful items in it. However after only 3-4 months of use it stopped working.
UPDATE: she hasn‚Äôt even had a year and it stopped working in June 2024 after purchasing in Nov 2023.My daughter loved getting this for her Birthday in November. She turned 13 and of course beauty routines are all the rage for that age group. We have not had any problems with it and she loves that the mirror lights up.
Exactly what my daughter wanted. Worked great until it just stopped. No longer cools after using it for 9 months.
Stopped working after 4 months.  No longer turns on.
Bought this Dec 20 2023 and it died Nov 30 2024. Didn‚Äôt even last a year.
Bought this for my daughter on July for her birthday‚Ä¶ it stopped working last week. Lasted 3 1/2 / 4 months. The lights on the front started flashing and when we opened the fridge there was water and nothing was cold. Not sure what happened. It was super great while it lasted. But super sad and disappointed that it didn‚Äôt last very long at all!
I bought this fridge just for small snacks and drinks.. It molded my food. I definitely don't recommend.
Had less than a year and already doesn‚Äôt work. No warranty.
This only lasted a year. It just died.
"My daughter used for her skin care products.  After 5 months it started to smell like it was burning and it no longer works.  Do not waste your money on this fridge, it is junk! Zero starts!"
Missing power cord. Cant use
"Purchased November 2023‚Ä¶.warranty expired January 31, 2024‚Ä¶stopped working March 30, 2024‚Ä¶how disappointing."
My daughter was so excited to have this.  Worked for about half a year then just died.  I get this is not an expensive item but I‚Äôve had less expensive hair dryers last years.  And there‚Äôs no way to get customer support or have it replaced.
"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. Sadly, it is February now and it just stopped working."
I got this for Christmas 2023. I had no issues with it and then one day it just stopped working. It wasn't even 1 year since I got it and it's sad. I would not recommend.
This stopped working within 10 months of using it. Very disappointed.
"For the price you pay, you would think that it would be properly packaged . This came in a single box with absolute no protection! Not to mention when I received the package , the box looked like it went through hell. It looks really cute but when I opened it, as suspected, the mirror was broken. What a waste of $$"
Bought for a Christmas present. Didn't last 8 months.
I liked the way it look bc its cute and can store my beauty products but it's too noisy that I can't even sleep:((( seriously i can hear the noisy outside of my room...Update after over a monthWater keeps forming in the refrigerator.. used not even 3month....not worth the money :((((
"We loved this little fridge at first‚Ä¶It kept drinks icy cold and worked great but has died only a year later and won‚Äôt turn on at all. Glad I got it on sale, not worth the money."
I only had it for a year and suddenly it died. Not just the light but it won‚Äôt turn on at all.
Got this for my daughter in Feb 2023 and by April 2023 it no longer worked! It‚Äôs a cute fridge and perfect size! However less than 2 months and we have to replace it!
"The LED stopped working after 2 weeks. Was not kept on, lightly used it and it still crapped the bed. The fridge doesn‚Äôt keep cool after 5 minutes of unplugging. Do not recommend"
"We purchased this and have only had it open for two months and the light isn‚Äôt working already!I want a replacement, then will change my review if the replacement works!"
This thing buzzes and hummmmms like crazy. so LOUD!
"I‚Äôm disappointed because I thought I was buying a new product, it‚Äôs very dirty inside and has an odd odor once I opened it. It‚Äôs clear that the inner tray was used and the manufacturer taped it but didn‚Äôt bother to clean it before repackaging and selling it to someone else."
"This mini fridge was a gift from my husband.  It only lasted 7 months and it completely stopped working.  The mirror started blinking, I disconnected it, and plugged in back in to see if it worked but it didn‚Äôt.  I‚Äôm so sad because its so cute."
Item arrived with broken mirror and damaged box as many others described. It‚Äôs also a bit bulky. Probably would‚Äôve been great other than that.
Stopped working randomly and would make my products inside of it wet?? had it for less then 2 months
"Purchased in May 2023 and now in July 2023, unit does not refrirtae. It doesn't keep my skincare cold."
"Fridge stopped working after 3 months. Fan and light would not turn on, making it inoperable (could not cool products inside). Unplugged for a long period of time then attempted to plug back in, in a different location (incase it was my outlet), and it still would not work."
Worked great until one day it just turned off and wouldn‚Äôt turn back on. It was flashing so I turned it off and back on and nothing. I‚Äôve tried a different outlet and nothing. All I keep in there is face creams and face masks so it isn‚Äôt super packed. Very disappointed!!!
It no longer turns on after one full year of use on cold. Waste of a birthday present!
"Everyday I wake up to WATER all over my products! Not to mention, the ice builds up on the screws in the back of the fridge. It's also loud! üëé"
"Bought this for my daughter for Xmas, and she loved it.  Great gift.  She set it up on her room on December 26 and yesterday, April 2, it stopped working. Seems like this should have a longer life than 3 months."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I bought this little fridge for my daughter‚Äôs birthday & initially we all loved it‚Äînot to mention how stinking cute it is. However after barely using it, we went to plug it in today & now the electricity is shorting out making it unusable. Would not recommend or buy again."
I bought this as a Christmas gift and it stopped working after only a few months! I‚Äôm not sure if there is any warranty on this but not happy.
"I ordered this early for my daughter as a Christmas present and didn't open it till today, when I started wrapping gifts. The mirror on the front was cracked. So buyers, open your packages immediately. I missed the cut off date to return this."
After six months product no longer works
"Use it for face creams. Light never used. Noticed light on and flickering, heard humming noise and unit stopped working."
"The fridge was great and cute for my daughter but it stopped working after 3 months. Lights flickering, not cooling or heating or even turning on."
"We received the fridge on June 3, 2023 and it completely stopped working on October 2, 2023. This fridge is very pretty and was working fine until 2 days ago. I should have purchased the 3-year protection plan. Will not buy this brand again. We'll probably look for a major brand instead."
"I loved this little fridge until it broke. Unfortunately, it is past the return window. The motor started making a terrible loud noise until it went out completely. Very disappointed."
Broken less than a year later‚Ä¶.
It hasn‚Äôt been a year and I bought this in July and it‚Äôs now February and it stopped working. Won‚Äôt turn on at all and it stopped cooling for a while now. Disappointed that it didn‚Äôt last
"My daughter got this for Christmas and it only worked for a little over a month before it started making weird noises and the light would flicker on and off, mostly off. Unfortunate."
It stopped working in few months and I am very disappointed
Do NOT buy!  After 3.5 months it broke! The fridge only pushes out warm air even when the cold air setting is selected.  Very disappointing!
Purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. It is very noisy and after only 3 weeks I have had to replace it due to a smoky smell and the mirror cracked although nothing hit it. I would not purchase again.
This fridge didn‚Äôt even last a year!
The stickiest reinforced tape was used to seal the door and wrapped around to the inside. It destroyed the gasket seal! I have expensive skincare products to keep in here. Reimbursement or replacement would be appreciated.
We had gotten this as a Christmas gift for my daughter to use for her makeup. Three months later and it already stopped working.
Was so happy when I received it to find it exactly one month later not turning on at all‚Ä¶ Make sure it‚Äôs working if you end up buying would be great if it was working at all. Very disappointed and of course my return window is closed by one day wasted money
This mini fridge only worked for a day. This was on my daughter's wish list for Christmas. Super cute and she loved the LED light on the front but it's no longer working. ‚òπÔ∏è
I bought this Feb 9th 2023 by Aug 11th 2023 it has stopped working. It is super cute and the size was pretty.  The last it only last 6 months is a joke. Do not buy
Bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter and it already broke. Don‚Äôt waste your money
It was never really cold. Stopped working all together in a few weeks and the repair shop said the type of system it uses is not replaceable therefore it can‚Äôt be fixedü§¨
bought the end of May last year and gave as a birthday gift in June. It just died. Don‚Äôt waste your money
"4 months after purchasing, the refrigerator portion wouldn't cool.  When you call RCA support, you get the call center and are unable to speak to anyone from the company.  After 3 weeks, I received an email detailing everything I needed to submit, which I did...(this includes photos of the front and back of the unit, pictures of the model number and receipts, etc)I was told I would be emailed by the company within the next several days.  I called every three days for the next several weeks, and no one responded.  Finally I got another email with my case # on it asking for the same information, except the form they sent said they needed photos of the front and back of the television.  So not only am I starting from square 1, and they have the photos and description of what is wrong with the refrigerator, I will now have to start calling and start over since they now think it is a broken TV.  I have probably called 15 times over the past 2 months and still am not able to speak to a repair person or person from the company.  I WILL NEVER PURCHASE FROM RCA AGAIN AND AM CONCERNED ABOUT PURCHASING ANY ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS FROM AMAZON.  IN THE FUTURE, I WILL PURCHASE FROM A STORE WHERE I CAN SPEAK TO THE REPAIR DEPARTMENT.  (This is the first 1 star review I have ever written, and really would like to give them 0 stars)By the way, I also purchased assurance insurance for 2 years on this item, but because it malfunctioned within the first year, they said I had to deal with RCA."
"Reviews were generally great & I had high hopes. It's inexpensive, has separate doors for the fridge & freezer, was exactly the right size for my space. However, the veggie drawer was cracked when it arrived & it didn't seem cooling food that well. We bought a fridge thermometer & found that temps varied vastly (from 28 to 41).After consulting with Amazon, we unplugged it for 24 hrs & tried again. Were told this might help. Afterward, it was consistently on right next to red line (38-39 degrees) or on it. The lowest we saw was 35 (once). Fidgeted with the dial again, just a little upward. Then it froze the food.Troubles with return: Amazon said UPS would pick it up on one of two days. They didn't consult with us regarding when would work for us. UPS came the very next day (a workday, less than 24 hrs warning) & left a note saying because we weren't there, we'd now have to bring it to their store. No 2nd attempt would be made. They also left a return label.I called UPS. Got a run around. Were told we woul have to work with Amazon again & get an entirely new return order to schedule a pickup. Or we could leave it on the porch with the return label & UPS would pick it up & box it up for us. We would have to pay a fee, online, to arrange this. Or we could take it to the nearest UPS store & they'd box it up.Weekend was coming. We needed a replacement fridge. I didn't want to leave the thing out for porch pirates. We were told if we took it to the store, they'd box it up for us.Fortunately, I have a van & I'm in better physical shape than your average 62-yr-old woman, so I could pick up the 57 lb. thing & put it in my van. However, I was deeply disappointed with the customer service & irritated about having to take 45 minutes out of my day to do this.I had kept the box & styrofoam packaging. I put that in the van, with the return label, & took the whole thing to the UPS store, where I was told they would charge me $7.00 to box it up because ""we'd have to use our tape & that costs money."" SERIOUSLY?! I boxed it up myself & taped it shut with painter's tape I just happened to have in my van. That won't keep it together for shipment, but that's their problem. They gave me a receipt for the return & the refund was almost instantaneous.Now I'm shopping for a different model that will meet my needs & hoping I wont' have to go through this rigamarole if I can't find something that works, but I'm not taking another chance on this brand or model."
"This is a nice refrigerator with a convenient 2-door setup that seems to do a nice job at cooling and freezing, but it sustained quite a bit of damage during shipping.  There are multiple dents on the front, back, and bottom edges. Luckily for me it is placed in a cabinet which hides most of the damage, and the integrity of the interior is unharmed, so it still functions well.  That said, other customers receiving a fridge in this shape might not be so tolerant.  I contemplated returning, but am concerned I would simply receive a replacement in similar shape. In hindsight, I should have just tried to locate a refrigerator somewhere locally for pickup and not depended on Amazon shipping for this.  Lesson learned."
"Fridge works well as such. The space volume is pretty good for its size and the price at the time was good.The NOT so great.The side of the freezer is very small. It over freezes very quickly and so it must be defreeze about every 2 weeks, which is more often than I'd like.  A regular size ice cube does NOT fit so I use it for nothing. it is waste space, which sucks. in the original advertisement the actual size of it was not labeled. Conveniently.in addition, the side  door is very limiting. If you really consume a lot of can drinks, it might be a better fit for you. personally, I'd rather had the shelf were other types of items can be place including can drinks.So, over all I'll give it a 3 out 5"
"So to be fair, I‚Äôve had this fridge for 8 years but after about 4 years, it started freezing everything in the fridge that was in the back."
"Ordered this item and the delivery time was all over the place, it kept changing days on when it would arrive. It was also repaired on the bottom bracket to where I couldn‚Äôt reverse the door without causing damage. It didn‚Äôt have dents or damage on the front main panels but bottom was clearly repaired. Although it is keeping items cold and frozen. Be leary when ordering."
"Fridge does get cold (even makes your drinks incredibly cold depending on where they are in the fridge). The freezer ices up quickly (which is the main downside of the product). The fan for the condenser is also very noisy when starting the refrigerator after a period of being unplugged, or when accidentally bumping into it. It is as if the fan is constantly hitting the shrouding. For what the fridge is, there is an ample amount of space for my college dorm. Being in college, the price was right as well."
"The compact  fridge arrived on time and in good shape. Based on comments here, I let it alone for 24 hours. Then I moved it where I wanted it and plugged it in. It started and started getting cold. I waited a couple of hours, then put food in it.So far everything is working and I'm happy with my purchase.Just one comment: would it kill the manufacturer to actually put useful instructions in the manual? Like the most important part - what setting to put the temp control on. Since it wasn't in the manual - a simple 1 is warm and 7 is icy cold would have helped - I researched on the Internet. One place said to set the temp ot 3 or 4. Tried that and it was cooling so YAY! it was working. But I wanted it really cold. But do you go to 1 or 7? Being me, I chose 1. Wrong. Sigh. So now it's cool rather than icy cold and I've changed the setting to 7.Just FYI: RCA website is totally useless. At least regarding refrigerators. One line in the manual or even a little drawing showing warmest and coldest setting would have made my day go so much smoother.UPDATE: Almost 1 year to the day, it stopped working. When they say one year warranty, they aren't kidding. Information on line indicates mini fridges should last at least 4 years. Wouldn't buy RCA again. It was good while it lasted, but I did expect it to last longer and one year."
"I‚Äôve had this for a little over a year, when i purchased it an extended warranty wasn‚Äôt available for purchase. Well the freezer went out on me, i lost 5 gallons of breast milk which took me forever to pump since i did not produce a lot to begin with. Well because amazon didn‚Äôt offer an extended warranty RCA won‚Äôt help me ; and Amazon won‚Äôt help me either. I would have never purchased this if i knew that if something was to happen i would be SOL ! Disappointed in this purchase!"
Actually wanted to return it but missed the cut off window. Door does a thing where it springs open if the fridge is too full.  Freezer too.  Inside fridge freezes everything in the back if you put the dail above 4- putting it at 3 or below risks everything being luke warm.  Ice collects in the back of the fridge too.  Quite the performance! The shelves are good in the way they move a bit so you can fit more inside.Thats a plus.  Will do for now.
"I have had several RCA products and never had any real problems with any of them. And so I went for this fridge, as the value for money seemed very good.All looked very well at the start, there was no visible damage and both the fridge and freezer sections cooled fairly quickly, the water froze overnight solid and clean.Unfortunately I quickly realized that the compressor run almost non-stop, much longer and much louder than my old full size fridge. The noise level was a bit irritating from the beginning, but in a few days it started to be getting worse, when the ""regular"" sound got an accompaniment of something resembling gargling and growling. This is a manual defrost model, and the sound didn't resemble that of self-defrosting anyway. After some more days I lost all hope that things will settle down, or that I'll get used to the noise.Fortunately, the return was painless, except for the box, which by that time I already recycled - silly me. UPS does not carry boxes that big, but eventually I found one and was able to ship it out and receive full credit without any issues."
"It worked OK for about 18 months.  Wouldn't always freeze, sometimes the fridge froze better than the freezer.  It's OK to get you by but didn't last as long as I needed."
"The outer packaging was unblemished, but the outside of the fridge itself had four DEEP dents. The plastic drawer was badly broken because someone forced it in crooked. Even the plastic strip along the front of the glass shelf was split and falling off.Here's the worst. The rack for soda cans in the door has a horizontal bar at the bottom to keep the cans  from rolling out, BUT the bar is inexplicably two short pieces welded together--I mean really, two 2.5-inch pieces instead of a 5-inch rod?--and even though the bar is subsequently plastic coated, the weld is sloppy such that in my case a bump sticks out on the inner surface. When I pull out a can of--ahem--soda, the innocuous little bump pierces the can EVERY time, and it spurts everywhere. OK, not every unit will have this flaw (jeez, I hope not), but it's another reflection of just how crappy the manufacturing is, let alone any QA (OK, sorry, I have to stop laughing here in order to continue).Please please please do not buy from a crappy, indifferent manufacturer.Oh yeah, I got this as a replacement for a fridge that I STUPIDLY damaged myself (cue the violins--it was a great unit I had for 20 years) because it was the exact same outer dimensions and I needed it to fit in the same space in my workshop, BUT the interior space is tiny in comparison to old reliable. A friggin half gallon of milk can't stand upright--I have to lay it on it's side. Seriously?OMG, I wish I could give so many negative stars that it would drop the overall rating so low that no one would ever buy from this manufacturer again."
"This refrigerator advertises that it can hold many things, what it fail to advertise that it can hold many things, one at a time.The shelves have no slides to hold them in place, and are constantly rocking and making noise, the door drink holder will not allow the door to close if it has drinks in it of the standard size. You would have to disassemble and reassemble the interior in order to get, what you want in the refrigerator and even then only one or two items at a time. It is, however good for food storage, but the freezer barely holds a bottle of skinny liquor, and then only on a diagonal.Not a Recommended buy."
"This product is listed at 22"" wide. It isn't even 18"" wide. Now I have a nice big gap that the frig I replaced this with filled just fine. It isn't 34"" high either. Barely 32.5"".I don't know what the problem is with these being wrong, but if you are very tied to specific dimensions, don't go by the ones listed in the product description.Returning this would be too much of a PITA, but maybe someone else can be saved from inaccurate reporting."
"The refrigerator works great in all respects, except that it arrived with one of the feet not fully in its slot, resulting in the refrigerator being unlevel.  I was very frustrated with this, as returning it is a hassle.  I am a caregiver for my mom and limited in my time, often unable to leave.  Also, I can not lift it by myself in order to return it.  I expected it to arrive in ""new"" condition, especially for $200.00 price tag."
Too noisy for bedroom sleeping. Even under the cold level three this thing never shuts up! It's like a deep vibrating bass tank. Always running and making medium and low pitched noises. During the day it's ok and when it shuts off it's silent but sleeping is terrible.
"Had this unit around 6 months. It was working great, but the freezer has already gone out on it. So disappointing."
"This was advertised as being 25.75"" Wide and is only 18"" Wide. Only reason I bought the damn thing was the size."
"This seems to be a nice little refrigerator. It cools well (I‚Äôve had it 3 days)  and it‚Äôs spacious enough. The refrigerator did arrive damaged but I‚Äôm not willing to invest the time to package it and send it back. It‚Äôs bent, scratched, and dented in several places but it works."
I really love the the mini fridge but has an almost constant buzzing. It‚Äôs not quiet most of the time. Otherwise I am enjoying having it. Freezer works great. As does fridge part. It‚Äôs great to keep small amounts of food and a few drinks.
Product runs decently. Arrived within a week but arrived dented. More of a hassle to return so just stuck with a dented in mini fridge.
"Well I purchased this for my apartment as I didn't have a full size refrigerator. Had it for about a year now with no issue until this winter. Left it at a setting of 6 to keep the freezer going while I was out of down. Came back to find a weird smell inside the mini fridge when i returned, the freezer part had stopped working completely. All the meat had spoiled and was only kept cool from my apartment being cold from the winter.  Only thing that functions right now is the light inside, now i have this hunk of junk sitting there as a paperweight. Save yourself the time and money and get a real refrigerator, stay clear of those apartment sizes ones that work the same way as the mini fridge, you'll run into the same issue i did."
"Everything with the fridge was fine for a couple months. However, by month 4, the fridge would randomly stop working, AND the door would not stay closed. At first, I tried to keep door shut with a strap, thinking that is why my food kept spoiling. However, even with the door staying closed, it would still just stop working randomly. Sadly, I am past the return window. Very disappointing. Do NOT recommend!"
"If unit was transported or stored laying down, or tilted at all, you NEED to let it sit unplugged for several hours, the compressor oil seeps into the coolant lines and needs to sit unplugged and settle back into the compressor where it belongs,.. if you plug it in before this happens, the oil will circulate with the coolant and clog the lines, and will ruin the whole refrigerator, I let mine sit for 24 hrs to be extra safe because I didn't know how it was stored or transported, I would reccomend at least 4 hours minimum, I'm sure most of the low reviews that said their refrigerator stopped working after a day or a few days would have had No problem at all if they let the fluids settle for a few hours, be patient!...mine has worked perfectly for several years, Very Satisfied!, dont anticipate any problems at all! Let fridge settle unplugged Even when just moving or tilting the refrigerator...(better safe than sorry) !!! I got the 2 door model, That's the way to go!!!"
"I knew that unless I spent like 400 bucks these things are all hit or miss so this was the best one to get because it was the cheapest with the separate freezer. The freezer part is awesome, but and I‚Äôm not complaining because I know these are all like this, if you put things in the bag they get frozen in the fridge. You just have to be careful. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs the same issue with ones that are even $100 more. I think these are all hit or miss so may as well get the cheapest w the features you want.  If I had to I would buy this one again over a more expensive one"
"I wish the fridge had adjustable shelves because it is difficult to store bottles of juice or soda on the top shelf. The top of the inside of the fridge has a lot of condensation which sometimes will freeze or sometimes drip onto the items on the top shelf. I can't store a carton of eggs on the top shelf because they will freeze. Also, the distance between the middle shelf and top shelf does not provide a lot of space. Lastly, the crisper drawer does not align with the shelf above it to provide a sealed drawer. The freezer is nice sized and will hold several containers of ice cream. This fridge is ok but I wish the inside was designed to be adjustable so I could arrange more items inside."
The fridge makes a really high pitched whine when it cools. The frequency gives me a headache so we had to move the fridge outside to the garage. I called the number on all the documentation 3 times and each time they told me they would have a technician call me back. I've yet to hear back from anyone. Its a decent fridge except for the noise. If you are sensitive to high pitched sounds I would avoid this purchase.
"My fridge even at max coldness will only hit 45Fahrenheit. My big fridge chiils at 37F. Internet says You want 39-41. I'm a bit disappointed in that. Of course it came dented in two-3 places. The only debt that bothers me is the paint chipping debt on the front door.... They don't add enough padding, There's only padding on the corners so this thing gets dented.  Freezer is awesome. Freezer freezes like a champ 0F which is what you want. I'm scared to put meat/milk in it. I don't think 45 is acceptable."
Used in our bedroom for drinks and snacksWorks really wellOnly it arrived damaged on a corner and the white tray that goes under fridge had broken clips!
"Arrived on time. Looks good and works like a champ.Unboxed it and it was pretty beat up and dented, but it‚Äôs just for my office, so I‚Äôm not concerned about cosmetics. I‚Äôm sure reboxing it and returning it would be a nightmare. I‚ÄôM HAPPY ‚Ä¶."
"There were a bunch of reviews about this item that said that it came damaged. And I refused to believe that the manufacturer would continue to ship out damaged items. I am here to tell you that they are freely and openly sending crappy fridges to people! Case in point, my dinged and damaged refrigerator. The lining to protect the refrigerator edge is lifted (creased and since snapped off in less than a day) on the corner as depicted in the pictures. There's a huge dent at the top of my piece. And there's a smaller one on the opposite side near the bottom. I absolutely have to have this this week, so I'm unable to return it. I am furious. It's my own dang fault for not believing the rest of the reviews and taking my business elsewhere. Don't make my mistake!!!!Stay away!!!even the box it came in was ridiculous. It looked like somebody taking a box cutter all around the bottom so that it would lift off as soon as the straps were sniped. And those straps were loose so I had a ton of room in there to wiggle around. It's like the people at the Zero Farks to Give Department wrapped and shipped this terrible piece of equipment to me. No Farks Given, but bet your tush they have my money. Boooooo!!!!"
"I am letting it sit 24 hours (as others recommended) and will update review after I have plugged it in and run it.Update: I plugged it in and it runs quietly!  The freezer and fridge sections got cold quickly, too.  Lots of room in freezer for ice packs and full sized ice trays (it comes with a dinky ice try.)  I am happy with the purchase and do recommend this product."
"It arrived in an undamaged box but the top right rear corner was damaged. It is also making a noise I can only describe as light rain on a metal roof. It dies appear to be cooling, it's in my office so I will check it in the morning but nit really off to a good start."
"One month after purchasing and the canned drinks we have in the refrigerator are barely cold to the touch and the freezer hasn't frozen anything. We set the fridge to the coldest setting (7) from the start and it still hasn't operated as promised. If you're looking for an actually functioning mini-fridge - this one is only good for making sure canned drinks don't get ""warm"", beyond that I wouldn't trust this fridge with any perishable foods."
Product arrived dented.  The driver pretty much manhandled the fridge and dropped it on my driveway.  Luckily the dent is in the back of the unit.  The can dispenser on the door is difficult to retrieve cans from.  They get tilted and stuck trying to remove.  The bottom tray is pretty thin plastic material with sharp edges.  Not sure how long it will last.  But the unit keeps things cool and the freezer which is what I wanted it for is doing the job fine so far.
"There is a huge dent on the back, right, upper part of fridge, along with a couple other small dents.The WORST part is the metal tubing in the back. It is completely pinched off as if someone took a wrench of some sort and pinched it off. I'm just glad I was already trying to return the fridge due to the dent, and when I went to see if it even worked, I noticed the pinched off metal part.There's NO WAY this is safe. I have already purchased a mini fridge elsewhere, and it works great. DO NOT BUY this unless you plan on wasting money if it happens to be damaged and unusable.The warranty company also takes a day or more to get back to your emails, let alone the fact that I told them multiple times that I got it off of Amazon.com, yet they kept telling me to return it to the store."
"Ordered two, sent to two addresses.  One arrived just fine, but the other was damaged as illustrated in many customer photos.Also, the box says 3.1 cu ft., not 3.2 cu. ft., so the description is slightly off."
Seems to get cold alright. Out of the package with two large dings on it.
Works fine but was delivered with some damage. I read reviews before purchasing and was hoping I would get lucky. Unfortunately not the case.  A few dents on the front and the tray that catches the condensation was cracked. I used hot glue to glue it together and it works fine. If you can live with the fact that it will most likely be delivered damaged then it‚Äôs an ok purchase.
"Ok first of all... it works.  I suppose that's what you want in a mini-frig.  However, upon un boxing this I wondered immediately if it were a refurbished unit.  One of the leveling feet was half unscrewed, the top was badly scratched as if something had been sitting on if for years, and the power cord was just jammed into the compressor section.  I'd expect a new units cord to be wrapped and tied.  The inside did have the usual annoying blue tape holding things in place but still... I wonder."
"I read reviews on this mini fridge , I seen people say they received with dents and damage. I went ahead and ordered it anyways when I received my fridge it also had a dent on top and the hinge for the freezer portion was poorly put together so it did not close all the way so I have to use a screwdriver and manually fix the hinge on the freezer portion door to make it to where it can close so overall First impressions was really poor however with a few modifications I was able to get the product to work properly as far as the dent goes it wasn't that bad to where I felt like I needed to return it it's a good fridge however this is poorly put together your hand they are dented"
"Does what it‚Äôs supposed to but like others have said, it‚Äôs pretty dinged up."
it small on inside it freezes pretty good at the top and came with a dent on the side other wise it a good buy.
I wanted to love this fridge so much. It seemed like the most bang for your buck  but it does not cool that well and the door has no section so it pops open all the time. Between he two problems I see me throwing out a lot of food in the future
"So I purchased this refrigerator for my goddaughter who is frail and in a wheelchair. Worked very well, but in it's 11th month of existence, boom it simply failed. Unfortunately I failed to closely examine the warranty... it's only for 90 days AND you have to box and ship the damn thing back to them. Trying to get it serviced wojld cost well over 100 bucks and if it needed something like a compressor, it might hit 200 or better. So think of it as if it breaks anytime in the first year, toss it out (unless the first 3 months and you can deal with boxing and shipping it back)."
"I bought two if these...pros:‚Ä¢relatively inexpensive‚Ä¢runs quiet‚Ä¢technically workscons:‚Ä¢The temp settings seem to make no sense, I have two side by side on the exact same setting. one works fine, the other is completely overfrozen; ice has consumed the freezer to the point where the door won‚Äôt close and ice is forming at the back of the lower fridge. see photos.‚Ä¢like other reviewers, mine arrived with dents on the backside. NBD for me since it lives under my counter and is hidden, but still annoying.‚Äî‚ÄîI‚Äôm giving 2 stars because the overfrozen freezer really makes it inoperable and its super frustrating that the settings dial doesn't seem to make a difference or mean anything."
"Great fridge.  Love the dual doors and the ability to reverse opening the doors from either side.  Negative was the damage it came with.  The box looked fine but no foam on the top or sides to protect it during shipping.  One large twisted corner on the left rear and two dents ""one large"" on the left side."
"I‚Äôm DONE with this company. First- I get sent one that was heavily damaged, but the box was fine. They obviously sent me one that way from the factory. I requested a replacement. Second one they sent, the interior light doesn‚Äôt even work. You kidding me? The light bulb is actually rolling around inside, not attached to anything. They won‚Äôt even replace it now. Just giving a refund. DO NOT buy from this company. Look through the reviews and see how many people got one that was damaged. Enough said. Lesson learned, RCA."
Refrigerator is not high enough for me.I should have paid more attention to the height
"Fridge works well enough, it can be loud at times. If you plan on having this in a room you expect quiet you should take that into consideration.More importantly there is a high chance this will arrive damaged in some way. So much so that it is less of a question of if it will be damaged, but how much damage. I was lucky enough that there is only a baseball sized dent in the top corner of the fridge. It ships with no packaging, besides the retail box. Because of this the fridge does not have enough protection for the delivery trip."
Received with a big ugly dent in the top corner of the door.  Problem was the box was not damaged at all!  Looks like this product got packaged up with the dent already there.  Poor quality control.  I would recommend buying from another company.
This fridge worked very well for a few months when I first got it. After that it started to go down hill. I kept it at 3-4 and things in the fridge would start to freeze. In an effort to not freeze my food I would turn it down to 2-3 and everything in the freezer would melt and everything in the fridge would spoil. I‚Äôve tried making it work but no matter what I do I can‚Äôt fix it. I tried to just deal with it for a little bit but then it just stopped working entirely. It‚Äôs plugged in and the light turns on so I know it‚Äôs attempting to do what it‚Äôs supposed to but it‚Äôs only a degree or 2 cooler than room temperature. I would not recommend this fridge if you‚Äôre looking for something long lasting.
The fridge seems to have been tossed around a bit before we got it. The inside tray was broken  and the box was damaged. Not sure if it left the  warehouse that way or if it happened in a truck but it was quite disappointing!
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Its for son's dorm room and its perfect size but the wobbling is a issue and there a broken piece inside shown in video. Everything else is great
"Did not realize when I purchased this item it is not returnable.  It is not noted anywhere I could see on the page.  Anyway Never opened the box,  I decided I did not need it and could not return it.Don't purchase from this group unless you know you want to keep it."
"Item arrived with scratches and dents. I was willing to overlook this but when I plugged it in there is a strong chemical smell and a louder than normal sound. I am having trouble returning the item now, waiting for the seller to contact me. Update, seller contacted me to offer 50% refund even though I got ZERO use from the refrigerator. So basically they are offering to charge 50% for opening the packaging and plugging in a defective item for 20 minutes... Lesson learned, no more Amazon purchases for me."
"The corner dent does not hinder the ‚Äúfrig‚Äù operation, which is critical at this time and we will overlook. Damage occurred in assembly or packing, there were no marks on the packing carton.  ‚ÄúFrig‚Äù works well,  pay more attention to quality control."
"Is there a rating less than one star?My husband opened the box and set up the refrigerator. It began to cool for about an hour, and then quit working entirely. My husband has had absolutely no luck in dealing with them for support. They did not return his phone call or email. To get any support, they require entirely too much unnecessary documentation, including a picture of the defect. How do you take a picture of a refrigerator not cooling?I have bought things from Amazon since Jeff Bezos began selling books online and never once have I received any product broken or inoperable. This is the first, and it is a total dud. Don't go there! Spend the $189.99 on something you would enjoy like a nice dinner. We are used to great customer service from Amazon and all its subsidiaries and this one does not belong in the Amazon marketplace."
"The refrigerator was received with two dents in it. It was needed for a college dorm, so returning it was not an option. It was also a gift for my niece. How embarrassing!It does operate fine though. It just appears to have been delivered carelessly."
"This item arrived in a good condition box however when I opened the box the top corner was smashed in pretty bad. I am not sure how this product works yet as it just arrived, but I would appreciate a credit on this due to the damage to the item."
I use it for a small refrigerator. It tends to freeze the food at the back of the shelves. I don't do can of drinks so the door configuration is not as useful as of I did.  The freezer works well.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I had to wait 2 weeks for it to come in just for it to have massive dents in multiple places, and when I opened it it was filthy, it says it‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmazon warehouse inspected‚Äù but obviously not. But that‚Äôs not it, when I finally plugged it in and tried to use it, it doesn‚Äôt even work. Then when I asked for a refund they would only give me my money back no compensation for that. Then when I tried to get a replacement they wouldn‚Äôt give me one."
My only complaint is the dent in the back right on the top. It's in the same place as shown in the picture from the other review. Maybe that's why it was cheaper than the rest.
We purchased this item for our college freshman. It is spacious! It‚Äôs also very light. It has a separate freezer door which was the major selling point.
Fridge works perfect BUT this is my second one I am returning. Both times the fridge was dented and ruined.  Both times on the back left corners.  Its as if ups just throws the package
BUYER BEWARE!!! I purchased this fridge and it died in 2 years and 2 months. It was located in an HVAC controlled office space the entire time and was rarely even half full. I have an dinosaur refridgerator at home that is over 20 years old and still going strong. Do modern consumer electronics manufacturers have no shame?
The fridge arrived at my sons dorm in a damaged box and the fridge was dented and scratched. He likes the fridge but it was cheaper elsewhere and not banged up. We ordered it since he had no room to take when moving to college several hours away
"I was so excited for this mini freezer/fridge! It shipped quickly and arrived on the first day of the delivery window.That was the end of my excitement. Once I opened up the package, I immediately noticed that the freezer door does not close properly‚Äîthe seal is open on one side. Why? Whoever first had this item misaligned the door hinge and forced the screw in incorrectly. Now, even if I could get the screw out (I can't, and shouldn't have to) the metal hinge is defective anyway.Now begins the painful process of repacking and returning this thing in NYC without a car. What a mess! Not pleased."
Pros- prefect fit my size- Refrigerator and freezer separate- The door comes to work Soda holder- lower noiseCons- little bit hot outside the the refrigerator- Easily to get Drity
"Had such a big dent on top. We were at my granddaughter dorm room when open, and it was badly dent"
"Updated review and downgraded to 3 stars.  While this is an excellent little fridge, the DOOR IS NOT REVERSIBLE.  Make sure you are okay with a left-hand justified (hinged on the right as you face the fridge).  There are no holes on the opposite side, and the manufacture will tell you attempting to modify this unit will void the warranty.  Bummer!"
I received my mini fridge and like everyone else says I noticed a pretty big dent on the top and down the side of the fridge. It still works great but still for the price it definitely shouldn't come damaged like this. It cannot be returned or replaced so Amazon says and there is no way to contact the seller for a partial refund. I like the fridge but am very disappointed about the dent. It was the first thing we noticed about it.
Cracks formed in the base after only 2 years. Water now pools on the floor or the fridge due to the intrusion of moist air through the cracks.
"This is perfect for me. I wanted a lot of freezer space and this has that. It's very quiet. I can't even hear it running. I like that you can set the temp which I  have at 3 1/2. I have a whole cake in the freezer, three TV dinners and a box of waffles and there's room for more. The shelves in the fridge aren't large but they fit my yogurts. I'm using this for fridge for snacks.Update 4 years later. The fridge stays at 50 degrees which is unsafe for food."
The dimensions given for this product are of the box it comes in and not the fridge itself. Had to return it since it wasn‚Äôt right for where I purchased it for.
"Bought this fridge for my office. It works, but it arrived pretty beaten up - even without the top part of the box. Sharing here and will report to Amazon."
"The fridge is nice, for the exception of the damage that the product had when it arrived at my door.  I a bit disappointed at the damage."
Don't like the setup inside but works well. Would be good as a beverage fridge. But a gallon of milk has to go sideways.
"Seem's like a great product, but it was shipped to me with a pretty big ding, and damage to one corner of the device. If I was not using this as my primary refrigerator (i'm a college student) i would send it back in a heartbeat, but I feel like I'm stuck in a rock and a hard place"
"So I ordered 6 for a project at work. They sat unopened for 6 months. Get them in and unpacked and serious damage on all but one. Boxes looked perfect. Very disappointed, can't even return them because had them sitting for too long"
"After reading other reviews, I wasn't surprised to receive a damaged product. I bought this as a gift for my mother and so I left it up to her whether to return it or not. The refrigerator functions properly, but arrived with a very large dent on the top. She decided to just cover the area rather than deal with the hassle of returning such a large object. One of the screws for adjusting the freezer door was stripped out also, but it doesn't seem to affect the function of the door."
"The product came in looking great but the hinge would not stay in place to keep the doors on. I tried adjusting the doors but then the freezer would not shut. I contacted rca and was given a case number to email a contact. I was asked to send pictures and give a detailed explanation of the problem, which I did. I waited a week for a response to see if it was an easy fix but a response never came. I emailed again and nothing. I then contacted Amazon customer service who worked quickly trying to resolve the issue which ended in a refund of money. RCA is not a brand I will be buying again, I understand things happen but to not even responding to emails is totally unacceptable."
"Great refrigerator with separate spacious freezer. Only bummer is that it is really hard to find the replacement part that was damaged during shipping. (See picture of what was broken - Condiment tray/holder). If it arrived all in tact, then I would give it 5 stars. It operates quietly and works well."
Top of fridge constantly freezes and causes inside of the Refrigerator but the freezer is fine
"We bought this fridge to go in our office inside a ""mother's room"". The fridge itself seems ok but the packaging is horrible. There's a protective film on the doors to protect the stainless steel doors in shipping. That would be fine if there was a way to easily remove it. It appears as if the film was applied prior to the top and bottom door caps being installed. I can't seem to find a way to remove the film without traces of it remaining making it look sloppy. I've tried picking at it with tiny needle nose pliers, my fingernails and even tried a razor blade. If you don't care what the fridge looks like, I'm sure it will be fine. If it is going in an area where you are concerned about how it looks, pick something else. We'll be moving this one to a back warehouse and choosing something else."
"Due to where I have to locate the refrigerator, I had to reverse the door to open from the right, instead of the other side. I discovered that the screw hole on the reverse side made it impossible to put in the second screw to align and stabilize. Now, it doesn‚Äôt close easily and the door shelf inside rubs and catches when I push the door shut. I bought this new and it is clearly refurbished, and not successfully refurbished. Very annoyed that I will have to return this for a replacement."
unit worked well for 4 months then quit
Good temp control but arrived with a huge dent in the back right corner
"While the refrigerator works, it has a huge dent on the top and back! I did read the reviews and saw this this seems to be a reoccurring issue. I went ahead and risked it...lesson learned. You would think that with that many complaints regarding damaged products, that someone would come up with a solution....more padding in the box...something!! We are going to keep it because returning it is more of a hassle. This issue needs resolved!"
The refrigerator works fine and is all in one piece however when I opened the package I noticed some damage to the right side of it. I am not sure if this is due to shipping or from the delivery but paying this much for a refrigerator would make me think there is some better handling of the package.
Has a dent on top of unit.
"The shipping container showed no signs of the damage inside. Fortunately, the unit seems to work fine so far. The unit was shipped out with obvious damage.  There is a long crease along the back side on the top of the freezer. The back right corner is crushed. If it were not such and hassle, I would send it back."
It gets really cold but it came with three dents in it nobuddy responded to my last review so I‚Äôm doing it again
i bought two as prizes for Senior All Night party for our school. Gave them out in raffles and neither worked. I had parents messaging me all summer to fix them because and RCA would not help them.
I received my fridge yesterday and when I opened it I was very excited. It looks great and when I turned it on it worked well. The only problem is the freezer door is already broken. I have to keep it because I have no other way to store my food and I guess you get what you pay for but this company should really pay more attention to how there product is made. I'm very sure if the freezer door is already broken after less then 24 hours of use this fridge will not last more then a few months and with someone with hardly any money that makes me very upset. All in all I would not buy again. Update: the freezer door has almost completely come off and I am very unhappy with this purchase and will never buy anything like this from amazon ever again!
Fridge was damaged when delivered. Huge dent in the side. My husband plugged it up and works fine. Just wish it wasn‚Äôt dented.
"First time it came with a big dent on the door and I sent it back. Second time it came with the attached pictures, dents and scratches on three sides. Good value for the money and it works fine but very disappointed with the quality when shipped from Amazon"
The fridge is great but it came with the top corner severely dented.
Looks great but made poor and did not work out of the box . just short circuit and fail constantly ..A+ seller refund as soon as ups pick up box so @ least there was good service
"Let me start off by say it looks like the perfect mini fridge. You can use it as a bedside night stand and pop out a drink or snack without leaving your bedü•∞ I want this to be my new baby but it won‚Äôt get cold, my drinks are still room temperature and I had it on since last night. I heard customer service for this brand is amazing so there has to be something we can do. I carried that thing from a pickup location like I was 11 months pregnant"
It is nice and clean. Modern.  Plenty of room.  Door does not automatically swing shut.  Wish door would swing the other way.  Plastic heated to the outside is a pain to remove.
The specifications say this has a temperature range of 29-44 via a dial. Not true. The temperature adjustment is digital and bottoms out at 40 Fahrenheit.The shelves are not adjustable. This product represents end state capitalism. 100 dollar junk direct from China made by people making 40 cents an hour.If it lasts more than a year I will be shocked. Unfortunately there are zero options to buy a quality product at this size anywhere because the race to the bottom has left us here‚Ä¶. Disposable junk.
"Like the refrigerator, love the blue LED.  But they say low temperature will reach 29 degrees.  Mine, which is in an air conditioned room, on a tile floor only goes down to 40 degrees.  Contacted Euhomy and got quick response.  They sent another unit and I returned the first one by UPS.  But this second one is the same, I have dial on 7, do hear compressor turn on but my digital thermometer says 40.  I have even tried an anolog thermometer.  This will be fine because only for drinks and no dairy.  But maybe specs should be revised."
"WIDE temperature difference inside this small unit.  Keeps things cool up top and cold at the bottom.  I almost want to out a battery fan in there to see if it helps.  Also, expect moisture on the door at the bottom on the outside.  A bit noisy, runs quite a bit.  Looks great."
"Packaged very well. Price was good, but I ordered it for keeping baked goods in a cooler at a booth. The description did not say the bottom was only half a shelf. I thought I would have plenty of room, the full depth on the whole inside. I will make do, but not thrilled it's not 2 full shelves."
The product was damaged on the bottom of the unit before being shipped and placed into shipping box. Internal material had leaked out onto the unit.
Cool refrigerator‚Äînot cold. Doesn‚Äôt keep my sodas ice cold just cool.
Annoyingly loud for a bedroom.  It makes a humming sound which is fine but it also makes another type of sound that is irregular.  Mine also came with a big dent on the side.Edit.Still super loud when it turns on and the blue light is kind of useless.  Don't buy this one if sound is an issue.
Save your money and time. Do not buy this! I just received. The box was totally fine. But inside this hot mess. Totally disappointed
This is a perfect size refrigerator but I bought this August 21st and it quit working September 24th. The compressor went out and since it‚Äôs barely over 30 days it can‚Äôt be returned. I would not recommend buying this.
Received the product less than two months ago and now it‚Äôs not cooling. Very disappointed.
It will only go down to 40 degrees F. Advertised 29 degrees F. Very disappointing!
Definitely cannot fit 48 cans in this thing.  Not even 48 of the mini cans will fit.
"Refrigerator is extremely loud, there is sounds other than the compressor, most likely the refrigerant, making periodic wooshing noises wish is painful to listen to. Would not recommend."
Could only fit 7 bottles of water in this. Just to small. Returned it and got a larger size
This cooler DOES NOT HOLD 55 cans.  You can squeeze 24 cans in the cooler.  Take a look at their AI generated pics.  Those pics are phony.
This can only hold a maximum of 35 cans
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            My glass pannel is literally shattered
I still can not get the plastic odor out . I've tried vinegar wash and baking soda for 2 weeks
Nothing stays put....there is no support to hold cans/bottles into place in the door except for a small wire bar that moves all over the place. I can't open the door without everything flying out. Would not purchase again.
"I have this mini fridge in my room  to hold my bottled water and face cream, I would give it 5 stars for storage capacity, but motor is quite loud especially at night when you‚Äôre trying to sleep."
"Bought this to replace a Hisense 1.6 Energy Star refrigerator which was cheaper, hoping this would have better insulation for the money, and not run as often to keep watts usage down. It's actually louder and uses a little more power than the cheaper unit.  It did have a lower surge/startup voltage (just under 750w) which was better, but surge/lifting power is not an issue for us. Returning."
"I use this brand for A/C unit, which are wonderful. However, I cannot recommend this refrigerator. Here's why:First. The hardware is shared across brands including cheaper options.Second (most important). Temperature control is unstable because it varies according to external temperature. The refrigerator also periodically FREEZES at a low setting (2 - 3).I bought this as a medication refrigerator and carefully tested it by placing multiple glasses of water throughout the interior testing them. Some FROZE at a low setting especially at low ambient temperature. I ended up rigging and external thermostat and internal temp diode connected to it's power in order to shut the fridge OFF if it dropped below 34 degrees.I cannot recommend this one. Plenty of options exist that are worth trying. That said, is this doesn't matter to you, I suggest simply buying the cheapest option you can. What you'll get is likely equivalent."
"It stays cold just fine and doesn't have any major issues. I haven't had any leaking issues. I only use it to store soda, so I don't know how good it is for actual food. The temperature is a little iffy, the top freezes over."
"This refrigerator certainly keeps things cold, however I do not recommend using it for dairy products which will freeze more quickly. I have it set on the lowest setting and dairy still freezes. Additionally I must tape the bars inside the door so items do not fly out when I open the refrigerator door.Won't recommend this frig which is more like a freezer."
My items were getting frozen so I adjusted the setting from 4 to 2 and they are still freezing in this refrigerator
Back electrical is exposed with no cover for it. The inside depth is very shallow. I can not put a sandwich Tupperware container laying flat  because the door won‚Äôt close. I had to place a wad of paper under the front leg to make it sit steady on the table.
"Worked fine while it lasted. In a quiet environment like a bedroom you can definitely hear the compressor as it runs every 10-15 min, but I got used to it knowing almost all are like this. Other background noise such as AC, road noise, or Television drowns it out."
"***UPDATE***The return of the first one went smooth. I took it to kohls, they scanned the code in my email and that was that. I received the replacement a day early. Again it arrived without any damage! This one is much quieter than the first one and has been working consistently for over a week now. I'm so glad I gave it another chance. It fits perfectly under my office desk and no one even knows it's there. If is wasn't for the first incident, this would have definitely received 5 stars from me.It arrived yesterday and I was excited because it arrived in perfect condition, no dents, scratches etc. I'm using this at work and it fits perfectly under my desk. I love the size. Read and followed the instructions and thought it was up and running. Once it got cold I put my lunch for the next day inside. Came into work this morning and it was NOT cold!  Not even cool! I don't know what happened but it's not working. It has the nerve to hum as if it's doing something but sad to say I'm returning.  I'm going with a replacement of the same model because I like the size. So I'll give it one more try. I'll update after the new one arrives. Oh yeah, now I have to lug this thing to a Kohl's or UPS store.  If I wanted to lug a fridge I'd have gone to a store to buy one. But at least I don't have to pay for the shipping.Signed... Disappointed but hopeful!"
"I've never owned a mini fridge so I freaked out when I first installed it and it wasn't getting cold. I waited 24 hrs before opening and storing items after I plugged it and had the temperature on the medium setting. Keep in mind this was summer so it was like 85-90 degrees outside. I honestly don't know how that affects it considering my house was 70-80 degrees. Was going to return it but my mom suggested cranking the temperature to max. Worked like a charm. Keeps my drinks cold. I did notice it got louder in the span of a month but personally, I only notice it when I sleep and its not distracting enough for it to interrupt my sleep.Alot of people asked about the freezer space. It definitely does not get cold enough even on max temperature to keep frozen items, assuming that the items would fit. I can probably fit like 8 firecracker popsicles in the section and it would keep it cold for an hour. I think the temperature control isn't very good because I tested with a single popsicle and it melted and refroze over a day's worth of storage. I usually put a single ice cream cone or bar in there if I know I'm going to eat it within an hour so I don't have to go down to the kitchen. If you're trying to store actually freezer items, I suggest getting a two door fridge."
"This is not a heavy item for its size and should be able to be packaged to withstand the rigors of shipping .  Arrived with the bottom of the box loose, some Styrofoam padding and the cord hanging out.  This maybe be going back after closer inspection."
This unit is way too loud! Making loud hissing noises every time the compressor turns on. I had it next to my night stand in a room and it's impossible to sleep next to it. Would not recommend
"I purchased this refrigerator in July and in December it started making alarm clock beeps after it stops running.  It took me awhile to get used to the running noise as it is quite loud.  It is in my bedroom as I have my meds that need refrigeration that I don't want my roommates to have access to.  It wakes me up during the middle of the night when it beeps.  It doesn't do it every time the refrigerator stops running, but it is really annoying and I hope it doesn't mean that the refrigerator is not going to last."
"The small freezer on this product is terrible - I have had to defrost this three times already and we've only had it for a few months.  Once it frosts over we have take everything out and store it then unplug the machine and wait and then I have to chip away at the ice until it's all gone a nd then clean up - a very tedious process.I would Not recommend this product, whether you need/use the freezer or not, because after a short amount of time (2-3 weeks) the freezer needs defrosting and the main door will not close and your items will spoil!  Do Not buy!!!"
"I opened it and plugged it in and it does not work. I contacted manufacturer. It took them three days to respond to my request. Then, they had not even read what I wrote -- which is simply that it does not work. The motor runs. But it isn't cooling. If the manufacturer makes this right, albeit soooooo slowly at this point, I can amend my review."
It quit working on the second day. Now I have to find a box to ship it back in because of course I threw away the box it came in after it had been running for a day and seemed to be okay.
(Current rating: 3 star) So it turns out that it's working so far. It really is quiet and cools extremely well. It's cold enough to freeze my drinks that I had to turn down the throb to 3. If only if the fridge came in without the compartment as in the picture. Some reviews say that it broke after a few months of use. Will see about that.(Previous rating: 1 star) Product arrived as such. The compartment where the temperature knob is dangling as such. I don't know if it even works or not. I will update it after checking it.
"We're having very hot weather lately so got a mini-fridge for the craft room.  Keeps things cool easily but it is so noisy.  The condenser noise is fine, it is the constant gurgling and fluid whooshing noise that is extremely irritating.  My unit may have be bad or had minor damage during transport but this may be ""donated"" in the near future.  Consider paying a little more for a better brand next time."
"It arrived on time and no dents!  Just plugged it in and that's it.  It got cold quickly.  It does make a noise but you can live with it.  It's not loud, just a humming and then a click when it does on.  So far so good.UPDATE:  it gets louder by the day, really!  OH OH not sure what to do.  Do I have a faulty one?  should I exchange/return it?  How much louder can it get?  not sure what to do..."
"The fridge works great however I feel like I have a used fridge. Whenever I open my fridge to set it up it was too late to bring back. I‚Äôm guessing the last person to bring it back dropped it because there is a good size hole on the side of the fridge. I plugged it in to see if it still worked and it does. However I do not appreciate the scratches and the hole on the side of my brand new fridge. If I wanted a used fridge I would‚Äôve hit the used button. I guess it was a return and they didn‚Äôt fully observe it with its fingerprints, hole on the side, scratches on the door. Pictures added..because I recently hooked it up the past few days I hope that it lasts and doesn‚Äôt go out on me due to the slight damages before I opened my box.It‚Äôs quiet, gets pretty cold, even for a small ice cream. Fingers crossed."
"I received my first one dented  but plugged it in while i waited for them to send me a second one.  Once plugged in the sides get really hot to the touch while it's cooling down.  It is the perfect size for my bed room and the inside temperature to keep things cold works great.  However, as far as noise level, do not believe what they say about it being quiet.  Both fridges that I've received sounds like a pot of boiling water, bubbling and gurgling as the compressor kicks in.  It is not constant, but for at least 5 to 10 mins per hour it will be loud enough to notice especially if the TV is not on.  Bottom line is... works great, Not Quiet but tolerable for the price."
"I give this fridge a 3/5. It does work very well, I‚Äôve had it for over a year and it works great! The only two downsides I would mention are the freezer which results in a smaller usable area. The freezer has a tendency to over freeze and the crystals/ice just grow out of control. I can‚Äôt turn the temp down without jeopardizing the food in the fridge. So I never use the freezer which gives me a waste of space. If you do use the freezer you need to make sure it‚Äôs a single layer directly on the ice. Not anything in a box or layered, also, don‚Äôt put it to close to the freezer door because it will thaw. Overall great fridge, terrible freezer"
"The door is NOT truly reversible, as there is no hole or thread for moving the leveling foot to the right side. It also takes up yo 24 hours to get cold enough to store food in. On the plus side, it is very quiet. I gave it only 3 stars because I can't effectively reverse the door without losing leveling and resorting to a block of wood, or re-drilling and tapping a hole to preserve the leveling."
"I bought the black version and it arrived scratched and dented. I returned it and bought it again and it arrived scratched up again. I would avoid this product so as not to be in the position of returning a heavy, bulky item multiple times."
I bought this mini fridge for my mom in a nursing facility. It's durable and quiet and holds quite a bit but the tape that was used to keep the door shut while being shipped was so strong that it lifted the paint right off on 2 different places and both places are larger than a fifty cent piece. So disappointing to get an expensive new item and it not be perfect. I'm keeping the item because it's such a hassle to send something heavy like this back.
"The mini fridge itself seems fine overall, but the entire unboxing experience felt like an angry 3rd grader shipped this out.  Was it the sliding shelves that had Exposed sharp metal staples that actually cut me?  Was it the tape and plastic and sticker residue that took forever to remove?  All part of it, but the chef's kiss of stupid was that there was NO BOTTOM to the box.  Yes that's right, it was shipped with an entire side missing just scrapped up.  If I wasn't too lazy to have it all shipped back, I would in a heartbeat, but someone needs to be fired over this amateur hour packaging."
"Well, if ""initial quality"" or ""first impressions"" were the only thing that counted, this would be 2 stars or less. One of the screws holding the freezer compartment to the top of the unit had fallen out. The clip that holds the freezer compartment door wasn't attached, nor was there any mention of it in the directions. Both were easily fixed, but still, they shouldn't have been necessary on a brand new unit, regardless of the price. I don't think ""all screws secured"" is asking too much at any price point.The instruction manual is very poorly translated. Thankfully, you don't need it since it's, you know, a refrigerator. The part about when (and how) to defrost the unit was the only part I cared to read, and I could figure it out."
"I bought this 4 years ago and still works. It is taller than I expected. The first thing to break tho was the freezer door. The freezer sometimes create a frozen block so you have to defrost it. The picture shows the top having soda cans but mine can't fit soda cans, it's too small.  Stuff slips out from the shelves also and the bottom compartment is small also. It's completely silent which is great bc I keep it in my room. Overall I like it but I'm going to upgrade to the taller one soon. Btw I bought this for $65 and now it's over $100 so I feel like I got a great deal."
"Midea customer service is horrible. Refused to honor warranty and instead blamed transit shipping and handling. Didn't want to send a new plastic swing door cover which probably costs a few dollars and instead wanted me to return the whole fridge and ask Amazon for a refund, never have I had such a bad experience with customer service. Never again midea."
"Just received it in the mail 10 minutes ago. 2 complaints right out of the gate:Showed up damaged.  Back corner on the top was bashed in to be exact.  I don't think it has anything to do with the seller, probably happened during shipping and cant fault the seller for that.It's wobbly.  I don't know how else to describe it.  The 2 legs on the bottom are uneven and can't be re positioned so if any pressure is applied on top it wobbles, noticeably.  This might not be a problem for some but i intended to place my coffee maker on top of it (I'll be using it at work and lack the desk space) so this could get messy/burny real quick."
Unfortunately it came damaged (hence my rating) and as I saw in other comments it is not unusual so if you are ok with those terms then it‚Äôs a good fridge overall. It refrigerates well
This mini fridge certainly keeps my food cold which is something that cannot be said for many of the products for which I read reviews.  However it is VERY loud.  It literally makes the sound of a very windy day.  The fridge is in my office and workers half way down the hallway were asking me what was making the noise.  At the end of the day I purchased a mini-fridge to keep my home-made juices cold and it does a great job at it so I plan to keep it but if I had to do it over again I'd look for a more quiet model
Loved how compact and noiseless it is. Keep the dial on 3 or less as all my food/drinks were frozen the first day I used it. The corner back was a bit damaged and there isn‚Äôt a cover for the back to cover we motor which is weird? Nothing in the box?
"I will add the pictures soon. This was sent to me exploded and patched up. I'm having to pay extra for disposal, more than I paid for the unit.  It had a light silver circle sticker where a deformation occurred. I decided to remove it, and it exposed a chemical known as TETRAETHYLENE GLYCOL DIACRYLATE. Go ahead and read up on this stuff, and know that this was a about a foot away from my head, with multiple pets, my spouse, and sometimes a candle in our bedroom, along with other electrical components near it. Then add that upon checking the whole unit, this thing was expanded and leaking around the ENTIRE edge underneath, out of the piping, and all had been doctored due to this, terrible I might add, as well as finding a bar code with a red triangle on it that looks like it says, no (something) UPC. I'm unsure what, but the feeling I got was "" cannot sell"" and ""legally dispose"". It was stamped over the area to scan the bar. This is a bad thing to experience, especially knowing it wasn't the delivery, because of finding all the stuff showing premeditated knowledge."
"I love the size of this fridge.  It's perfect for holding drinks, or dorm rooms or office workspaces.  However, it has been 13 months since I purchased it and it won't stay on.  And of course the warranty is expired.  Grrrrrr.  I will not buy this brand again.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!!  Should last longer than 12 months!"
"Everything is as advertised, will freeze a drink if you set it too cold.  However, it is noisy.  when compressor is on, it sounds like rushing water, or a turning fan, but it will be the loudest sound in the room.  I can hear it over the TV, or music playing, in the same room.  Good price if noise is not an issue in your installation.  If you're going to be anywhere close to it, or in a quiet room, I'd look elsewhere."
"I am a teacher and bought this fridge for my classroom to keep drinks/snacks/etc in. I ordered the fridge in May (end of school year) and did not get to plug it in to test it out until August (beginning of next school year). Upon plugging it in, I noticed the fridge barely kept anything cold enough to matter but I shrugged it off and dealt with it since I did not want to deal with having to return it. Any perishable items would go bad and spoil 100% of the time if put in this fridge. The freezer was not better or worse. Besides the performance, the fridge also made a terrible humming noise that was noticeable throughout the school day even with several loud children with special needs around.The straw that broke the camel's back came 3 days ago when I plugged the fridge back in after it being unplugged for 2 weeks over Christmas break. The fridge does not work whatsoever, nothing so much as a hum or thought of cooling. And guess when the product support window closed? Less than 1 month ago. Guess it is my fault for not doing something sooner but be warned - this fridge is awful. DO NOT BUY IT! There are larger ones at the same price that are way better."
"It's been powered on for 3 days with only 6 cans of La Croix, about a quart of milk in the door rack, and a couple small jars of prescription drugs - all well spaced. I have two Taylor Digital Thermometers  Taylor Digital Refrigerator Freezer Thermometer        : 1x hanging from the steel-wire rack, center fridge and the other in the 'freezer' compartment. These thermometers record lowest, highest and current temps. The thermometer in the refrigerator reads a low of 45f, with infrequent door openings (only about twice a day). The freezer, maybe a couple of degrees lower.Maybe it's because my (non-air-conditioned) apartment is bout 75-80 degrees? Or maybe my expectations were too high? Maybe smaller refrigerators generally don't perform as well as their larger brethren (however, the technology is the same, hasn't changed much since inception and you'd think a smaller container would be easier to chill than a larger).If you're just planning on using it to chill drinks, it should be fine. Perishables? I wouldn't chance it.On the plus side, it is relatively quiet and ground shipping from Atlanta to Chicago (non-Prime) only took 2-days,"
We received this product and the box was not damaged at all. But the refrigerator has 2 really big dents in the front of the door!! It has been set up already but we r not really sure why it was like this. Which meant it had to be damaged when it was put in the box! Hopefully it will keep working over the next month or so or we will be sending it back!
"The wire racks have the wires spaced to far apart and items keep falling over, also they are weak and bowed after placing items on them.I am surprised that it works after shipping with up information missing from the outer shipping box.Freezer section will not freeze ice cubes unless directly on the bottom of the freezer box.  Box is not wide enough for two ice cube trays side by side."
"Well....it was great for three months.  Now, its hardly working and getting worse day by day.  When it arrived after a couple of weeks I noticed when the compressor would shut off it would make a loud POINK noise (if you can food, its that noise when the lids finally seal only 10 times louder) so I wondered if it was laboring too hard. It now collects moisture around the coils rapidly like it doesn't have enough freon or coolant in it. The freezer quit, but so far I've still got some cooling in the main fridge.  Trying to find out what my options are since I've only had it 4 months."
The unit starting leaking 5 months in. I chatted with Midea on their website they said someone would be in contact. No one ever reach out. Now the unit has completely shut down and does not cool or work. I have called Midea again spent an hour going back and forth on asking me if the unit just isnt getting as cold as it was. NOOOO it doesn't cool period! After all that time they say just email them a video of the unit not cooling and I will get a refund. So of course I did ask how can they tell by the video that the unit is not getting cold... funny enough they couldn't he just kept repeating take the video and send it in and you will get a refund once we confirm that its not cooling. I guess we shall see when I send the video if they can tell its not cold and I get my money back lol.
"I wasn't impressed by how it was packaged, fortunately nothing was damaged. Right out of the box I put it in my room and it looked great and loved the option to set up door to open left or right side. Frig kept things cool and little freezer compartment worked well. My issue is the noise - when I was working in my room and the room is quiet the frig compressor would come on and hummed like i had some pigeons in my room. It wasn't real loud but very noticeable and this was a 10min duration then would stop then half hour would go by then do it again. After a couple weeks it got a little louder and to a point my frig would shake when compressor stopped. I returned item and they charged me $20 bucks for restocking fee, I'm pissed about that because I shouldn't have to pay for a defective item to be restocked."
"This refrigerator was delivered outside my door and appeared to be in ok shape but clearly not handled carefully.  The top tape was half slit. Only one packing strap was left.  I scooted inside my home and when I opened it, there was no bottom on the package, the styrofoam looked like it have been pulled out and put back in. There were scuff/handling marks on the top of the unit which had styrofoam replaced.  The product may be fine but it does not appear new‚ÄîI purchased new not refurbished or returned."
"Stopped working after 1 week. Have to figure out how to return. Hopefully the company is accommodating cause shipping back would be a PITA especially without original box and stuff. Be cautious. I‚Äôll follow up.EDIT: Just changing to 3 stars because they did offer a refund (a check that still has not arrived yet LOL) but hopefully it will. For the 1 week, it did work ok. Just letting you know."
It works well but is noisy.
"This is a decent little fridge. It keeps items cold/frozen but it isn't the best thing to sit next to your desk at work. Whenever it cools, it has this fairly loud gurgling sound as it pushed the liquid through the pipes. It is just frequent enough to be quite annoying in a quiet office environment. We will see what I think after a few weeks of using it."
Purchased because the reviews said it would be a quieter option. But it is very noisy. I can hear it running over my sound machine. Do not recommend for bedroom use.
It looked good from a distance. At first i didnt think much of when it was upside down from the box so i just flipped the box and took it out. However after looking at it closer i felt like i got a returned or used fridge. There were so dents around the friendge like its been dropped at the shipping center and also a steel wire bar is missing. So i had to return for a new one.
"After two weeks the first fridge arrived. It was really quiet just like advertised and got nice and cold. Sweet, happy customer. Two weeks in and it just died. Everything was warm and spoiled. I returned it for an exchange. Total hassle of re-boxing it up and sending it back. Two weeks later the second one arrived. It was kind of loud and made a clunking sound every time it shut off. The clunk got louder and louder each day. I contacted the company to see if there was any trouble shooting I could do. The only option the person at the call center could offer, in their very broken English, was to return it. Went through the hassle of re-boxing and returning AGAIN only to have them charge me a restocking fee of $45. There was no restocking this thing, it was broken. So for all my effort or unpacking, repackaging and returning these pieces of junk, I got charged $45. Lousy product, lousy company, unhappy customer!"
"Nice, compact size.  Keeps food cold, works as expected, but...it's as loud as a diesel truck.  This is in my basement and I can hear it two floors above.  If you put it in a place that's out of the way, you'll be ok.  If you buy this for a dorm room or bedroom, don't!"
It was a good frige it stop working the other day didn't have it for 2 years all kind of gas smell came out I thought I was going to pass out I thought I LEAST could of gotten 5 years especially for the price I paid now I have to order a better quality one for my bedroom.
It‚Äôs really loud when running. It cools down fast and temperature setting is good. But just too loud to be used in my office.
I only gave 3 stars due to damage to the refrigerator. Other than that it works fine and it is very quiet. So far it seems to keep the items cold and although there was damage it didn't seem to affect the operation. The damage was on one of the back corners and on the bottom side. I think packaging could be better. Maybe more styrofoam to keep it from getting banged up in transit. Overall seems like a good quality refrigerator.
"Unit is not noisy. Its not that cold even though its almost on the high end of temp control. However, I am very disappointed it has a hairline dent smack in the middle of the front door. My husband threw away the box."
"I woke up last night when I heard a little Noise like water boiling/leaking and the noise was from the Refrigerator in my bedroom with the Insulin's type M and A in it .That was making noise either after I turning it off/on.My question is: Should I do something ells to make it quite (normal) or I have to send it back, and replace that?Thank you for helping me to know.Also, by listening to my caregiver manager's opinion, and my caregiver's past experience about this size.  That is why I decided and returned it back, and did not accepted another new one,  and I want to get credit the same price that I paid for, back on my Store credit Card Balance if possible, and  please forget about the head aches.  Tous Sahba"
"It's not low noise as it's quite noisy in a quiet room and makes a spring noise pretty often (it sounds very funny and we joke about it all the time now). It also only has room for two 16 oz bottle sodas to stand up (or else you have to lay them down). It's good for small ice cream, small canned sodas, and small plates of food and other snacks/fruits. I hoped it would be more quite though."
"This fridge was great for a while but has started acting up (about a year after use). So much ice has built up around the freezer inside that the freezer cover has popped off. Even after clearing the ice, it's back within a couple days and a lot of condensation builds up at the top of the fridge, near the freezer area. I will probably be replacing it since I've gotten to the point where I need to defrost the freezer every week or so."
"I purchased this product in October 2016.  Its purpose was to cool bottled drinks to reduce clutter in the main refrigerator.  It was housed indoors at all times, was plugged into a surge protector, with nothing else sharing the surge protector or electrical outlet.  The item was not overtaxed or abused in any way, and the sole expectation of it was to chill bottled drinks and keep them cold.  Low and behold, on February 9, 2017 (approx. 16 months after purchase), the refrigerator stopped working.  After the usual checks for surge protector tripped or off, loose plug, tripped breaker, etc., I tried the old ""unplug and plug it back in"" approach.  Nothing. Dead. Dead. Dead.  My recommendation to you is that if you think 16 months of service is a good value after spending about $80 (thus averaging approx. $5 per month), then knock yourself out.  As for me,I'll never purchase this or any other Midea product again.  Midea WHS-65LB1 Compact Single Reversible Door Refrigerator, 1.6 Cubic Feet(0.045 Cubic Meter), Black"
"Measured sound output while it's running and it hovers around 70-72 DB, nearly double stated in the specs. Seems to keep food cold just fine but might have some qc issues. Will be interesting to try and return as the bottom of the box fell out as soon as I unstrapped it."
"It would be a great little fridge if it didn't make so much noise in the middle of the night! I am not normally disturbed by a little noise, but at 11 O'Clock at night it's making enough noise to wake up the devil, and that goes on for an hour or more! Would not suggest that you put it in your bedroom! Other than that, it works great and has enough space for anyone who doesn't need to store a lot in the fridge."
"Updated Review - 1 Star: I have now had this product for 11 months. It was working perfectly, and one day it just stopped out of the blue. We did not move it (it stays in my home office as normal); it was plugged into a surge protector as recommended, and we did not add anything extra or do anything different than normal. Going through the process will now be a hassle for something we had less than a year. I now would definitely NOT recommend this item.Original Review - 5 Stars: I have had this product a few months now.  I work from home, and use this in my home office (which was originally a bedroom) upstairs. It fits on a small table; so, it fits the space perfectly. Although we keep it pretty full, it chills everything super-fast, and keeps everything in it cold.  We keep water, drinks, condiments and sometimes snacks in it.  It is also super-quiet.  Shipping was fast, the price was good, and it works great. I would definitely recommend this item."
Fridge is nice and all but the exterior of it is a little beat up seen in the photo I included
"The good part about this fridge is it's small. Unfortunately, I had my staff take it out of the box while I was out of the office. When I got to my office, I realized the door hits something inside which makes it difficult to close the door without kind of slamming it to make certain it's closed. What stinks is my office cleaning crew had already taken our the box, so I would have to buy another box (sturdy) to return the fridge. Another thing I didn't like was it looks like it was already used by someone else. If I had the box I would probably have returned. Wouldn't by again."
When I got the fridge it had dents in the sides. I am very disappointed since I bought it new‚Ä¶
There are dirts seems used and not easily to clean.
Inconsistent temperature control.  Put 4 water bottles in and the next day they weren‚Äôt cold. Turned it up a notch. The next day they were chilled nicely.  Put 4 new bottles in and the next day they were frozen solid. Turned it down 1/2 a notch. The next day they were still warm. Turned it back up 1/2 a notch. More bottles. Next day perfect temp.  More bottles  warm the next day.  Didn‚Äôt change the temp. Frozen solid the next day. Would not recommend this unit.  More trouble than it‚Äôs worth to return.
"This refrigerator was a dream for the first few weeks I had it set up.  It looks nice and professional in my office.  It does a good job cooling the sodas I wanted to keep in there.  However, in the last few days it has started to make a ""grinding"" noise when it is working. It was silent / not noticeable before, and now it is making annoying noises...  Still a good price / deal, but it is driving me mental in my office"
"I was extremely frustrated with my experience purchasing this refrigerator.  My unit arrived dead on arrival. (While annoyed, I do realize that this can happen, so my poor review is not because of the non working refrigerator.)  Looking over the packing material, I called the 1-800 number and asked them to send me a replacement.  The agent took my name, address, contact info and Serial Number, then after all of that, the agent told me they were unable to provide me a working refrigerator  (against their policy), and that I needed to call Amazon.  So then I called Amazon and asked for a replacement.  They also told me this was not possible, and I had to send it back for credit, and then purchase a new refrigerator and try again.  So frustrated.  Not happy about lugging the darn thing to the UPS store either."
Puts out an impressive range and volume of sound for its compact size.
I want to share and prevent the same problem I had.1. Unit stop working Mar/11/2011 and purchased on May/30/2020.2. Contact customer service and it is voided warranty because I use extension cord. See image what extension cord I used. I used the same type of this applicant cord for a couple of refrigerators with no problem. This is only one refrigerator that cannot use. It is ok if it is last for a couple years with this price but not 8 month.3. Refrigerator cord is 5.5 feet. If you cannot have enough length to get away from  carpet you need a tray when defrost. It will melt all over to your carpet. That is the main reason I use applicant extension cord.I will pay extra for a new company which has auto defrost but it still cheaper to have electrician to install outlet for $200 refrigerator.
"This may be a refurbished fridge. When I took off the cardboard and styrofoam, I found the top was already scratched and dented and there were a bunch of dead gnats inside. The pegs that cover the screws are so flimsy that two out of three of them snapped rather than pulling up and out. Other than that, it's a fridge. I works and I was able to change the direction the door opened fairly easily."
Maybe I got a dud. Everything is fine as expected but noisy.
"Bought it for my kids' hang out room  it is a bit loud when the motor starts running.  Also, the top plastic plate which covers the screw/hinge for the door was cracked when I received it.  I contacted customer service and sent an email for a replacement part but never heard anything back.  The fridge itself works well and keeps drinks cold.  I haven't really used the freezer."
"I like the fridge, it‚Äôs a nice size. The only thing I do t like is that water leaks in the fridge but there is a tray included to collect the water.  I was a bit disappointed about that."
"'I bought this as a bar fridge in my home.  It fits on top of a small table behind the bar in the family room.  The freezer portion gets cold, but not freezing.  The wire bars used to hold food/condiments in the door broke the first week.  I live in SE Texas and on a daily basis have to clean out fruit flies that actually get inside the fridge.  I paid $170.00 for this, but feel that based on its quality, the price should be around $4900 to $59.00.Product update: July 30, 2017 (17 months old)The fridge barely keeps food cold, despite being kept full and indoors.  The seals that keep the cold air in, do not seem to work as there are literally hundreds of tiny black flies on the inside of the fridge.  I will be asking the company to either refund (hahaha as if....) or replace this unit."
"Bought this as a milk/beverage fridge for our nursery/bedroom area. This fridge is advertised as being ""whisper quiet"", and I guess if you really broaden your definition of that term to include what can only be described as whooshing, mechanical, spaceship-type noises when the compressor is running, then yes... it could technically be considered ""whisper-quiet"".In reality, it's actually louder than our big fridge downstairs, decibels-wise, so I'm not a fan. It woke me up constantly at night, and so it got returned.If you want a kinda-quiet mini-fridge, go with this. If you want an absolutely silent mini-fridge, go with the Smod brand absorption fridge. It's a little more work to set up, a little less interior space, but it's actually silent... not whooshy, spaceship-in-the-background ""quiet""."
"Working fine for a few months now.  Only problem is I have to defrost it manually each time.  After 4 months I accidentally bumped the freezer compartment door and broke the flimzy hinge pin.  Now I have to place a folded towel at the front of the freezer.  Still, kinda worth it.  I'd buy it again, but be a LOT more cautious of the poorly designed freezer compartment door hinge."
"Needed a fridge at work to keep food cool. Loved the size of the fridge. Is not as quiet as other people described. I feel like it runs pretty Loud, but does keep all items cooled. Wish it was a bit cheaper simply for the noise."
"Our fridge came in with factory defects on the compressor. If it wasn‚Äôt because it made a terrible noise ( it sounded like it was going to explode) it actually cooled well. Thankfully though the warranty worked, customer service was really easy to talk to and they sent us a new fridge within days."
"It only holds one quart of milk in the door and the ""freezer"" compartment door opens from the bottom so if even a little bit of ice builds up around the unit, the door does not open very far and pops off if i try to open it very wide. Not worth the money. I would have rather spent $50 more to get a better freezer compartment"
Had this product for about 6 months and it seemed fine the first 2 weeks until I realized it was making way too much ice around the freezer area. So I turned off the fridge until the ice melted and thought it would be fine and well I was wrong. I have to do this every other week and if I let the ice build up too long I wont be able to close the fridge door.
"Main thing to be warned about this fridge is that it does not easily accommodate a gallon of milk (if you have condiments in the door, the door won't close).  You have to lay the gallon of milk on its side on the shelf.  Should've noticed it.  The ad doesn't show anything the size of a gallon of milk on display."
Fridge seems to be working well so far. Unfortunately door is not reversible as the holes on the other side were drilled where they are supposed to be. Very disappointed that I am unable to reverse the door. It is in tight spot so now I have to shift it every time I need to open the door.
the door is too tight to open. the entire fridge moves forward when I try to open the door. its been few months since my purchase but still have same issue
This is just some piece of crap made in China. It's incredibly loud when it's cooling to the point where I thought it was broken. It doesn't even get that cold. The back is exposed and feels very sketchy. It also emitted a weird odor when I first plugged it in. Now I have to return the thing and it weights like 40 pounds. Do not buy this.
"I am still reeling with disgust over how this item was received. I could smell it before I could see it, even through my mask. There was rodent urine and feces ALL over the box and behind the fridge in every nook and cranny.I needed this item immediately, and had no choice but to clean it and make the best of a really horrifying situation. I've spent the better part of an hour disinfecting this item and then the space around it...and then myself and anything else I may have touched. I am incredibly disappointed and cannot imagine how someone would not have checked and or SMELLED this before shipping it."
It‚Äôs a nice fridge at a good price. Even though it was packaged well it was dented in three spots. Good thing they were in unnoticeable places and didn‚Äôt hinder its performance.
"This was an alright fridge for the past four years that I've had it until it started freezing everything that I've put in it. Even on the absolute lowest setting possible on it, it still freezes everything. Everything past that is great. It was a great value for a mini fridge. Even it's noise level is great to this day."
Back corner was crushed upon delivery.  Hassle to return so I just kept it. Works fine but looks like trash.
The condensor itself is quiet but when it turns on or off it's dang near startling. Just saying...
"I dislike that I paid for a new refrigerator, and I was sent a used one, checking to see if it works now, rather disappointed, hopefully all will be well, my account will be credited,100.00  for the mistake, checking to see if it works, no light insude"
"Seems to run a lot for a small fridge. But, I'm good with it."
The quality control misses a couple of items. The frezzer unit is supposed to be secured by  screws in the roof of the refrigerator and only one side (2) screws of two sides total of (4) screws were properly mounted.
"The owners manual is limited with pictures only.  Unable to download the video.  No infor regarding the freezer.  The freezer is a downer, no light in the refrigerator.  reversing the doors was challenge. I'm  going to look for a better one.  There is nothing wrong with this one I just don't like it.  I'll eat the loss"
It honestly sounds like a chainsaw in your room. Don't buy unless you're sleeping with headphones in. It ain't a white noise kind fridge either. Sounds like a gas chainsaw or a car constantly backfiring
"I suppose I'll add another report to a long line of existing ones: this fridge cannot keep the temperature below 40F consistently. It also seems to be getting worse. When I first got the fridge, it kept things plenty cold. Below 32F even. But it steadily got worse, and I cranked the setting all the way to the max to compensate. That helped for a while, but it's getting warmer and warmer.I can observe this happening three different ways. First, I have a thermometer in the fridge. For the past month or so, it regularly reads 40F. Second, my beer is noticeably NOT cold. Third, water drips from the ice tray above.My ""work around"" lately has been to put my drinks in the ice tray compartment about 30 minutes before I want to drink them. This makes them cold, but it's annoying, obviously.It now seems to be getting worse. I'm seeing temperatures of 42F regularly now. I'm way past the 30 day return window, so I'm going to have to eat the cost.My guess is that they are shipping these units with bad compressors or low quality compressors. Because this is exactly what it looks like when a compressor slowly dies: the temperature moves steadily upward over a long period of time.It's a shame because this is an otherwise REALLY NICE fridge. I love the space inside and the compartments. It's effectively perfect in every way except for the fact that it can't keep my beer cold. What a disappointment."
"I needed a new fridge to replace an older unit that fit in a very tight space. So I focused more on dimensions rather than details such as storage in the door, or how well the door sealed when closed. I assumes the many lookalike fridges had similar designs. They seem to have similar compressors and functions, so I didn‚Äôt spend any time examining how storage in the door was designed. But as other reviewers have noted, the design and fittings for in-door storage are awful! The fittings fall off easily, and even when they don‚Äôt the items stored in the door fall out onto the floor when the door is opened. I used silicone adhesive to hopefully secure the loose fitting parts, but only time will tell if this will hold up. But fixing this problem would cost nothing for the manufacturer. I‚Äôm amazed this poor design and execution didn‚Äôt go unnoticed by the manufacturer.Another problem with the door is a very weak seal when closed. The gasket doesn‚Äôt seem to be oriented to match the frame of the fridge. The actual contact area is very small despite the wide gasket that might be installed in reverse of what would work better. The door does not close snugly, and doesn‚Äôt seem to form a good seal. This results in damp air getting into the inside and forming condensation that results in pools of water. I added a tight latch to firmly compress the door into the frame. Only time will tell if this works to solve the condensation problem.So I can‚Äôt recommend this fridge. It‚Äôs could be much better with a few tweaks. But for now it‚Äôs a loser."
I was really disappointed on the number of scratches it has. One three inch scratch on the door is annoyingly obvious.
"The door, at the top middle and to the right, does not seal completely, and lets out cooled air from inside. I have to turn it up to full cold to get the right temperature, which means it runs a lot. Wish I had chosen another, better made cube refrigerator. Nothing of quality is made anymore, only crap being pawned off to foolish, desperate consumers. Yet we still pay prices as if it was all the highest quality. Nothing but disappointments in the business world, unless you are the evil owner, a greedy corporate executive, a corrupt investigator, or politician, which needs no explanation as to their purpose."
"This little refrigerator is great super quiet plenty of room. Only downfall is it had a couple of scratches on it and the bottom plate was bent.  Also, it had two different bottom, adjusting feet, which is causing it to be slightly off balance."
"So far, the fridge is working fine and the size is great, too. I'm just disappointed that it came with this dent on the back left corner. It's too much for me to return it, so I'm keeping it, but I couldn't let this go."
Nice refrigerator but the freezer does not freeze. You get a small ice cube tray with the refrigerator but when filled with water the water never freezes it only gets real cold but no ice cube and the temp control is set to the coldest setting.
"I‚Äôve been looking for some type of mini fridge for a while now for my sons nursery for breast milk because walking up and down the stairs in the middle of the night to store the breast milk in the kitchen fridge is exhausting.With that being said, it‚Äôs a great little mini fridge, however the freezer part up too thaws VERY fast. It‚Äôs really only big enough for like maybe 1 ice tray. I don‚Äôt ever use the freezer part, just the fridge.But when you open the fridge door if it‚Äôs open for more than a few seconds then the freezer part will start dripping so the bottom of the fridge is always wet and I always have to dry it.The most annoying part of this fridge for me is that the bars on the door of the fridge are not secure, and they are constantly falling off the door. I still need to find a way to secure them. Could be better but best I‚Äôve found so far. Before this one I‚Äôve tried those super small mini fridges that only hold like 4-6 bottles (desk size fridge) and they did NOT cook to proper temps, so I guess atleast this one cools properly."
"Bought this for my brother in his assisted living room and the freezer leaks into the tray below it. The try is to hold food, but he can't put anything in it. I have to keep emptying it when I visit him. So he only use the door storage and the bottom shelf."
"My apartment has a large refrigerator and it makes noise as loudly as its size. But I wanted much less noise even though I sacrificed the capacity. So, I bought this mini one.It is working fine as I wanted, but inside, it is smaller than I expected and the metal wire/bar thing which pushes the bottles in their place against the door often fall off.And I unboxed, one bold and a mysterious short plastic pipe thing fell off the box. At first, I thought I should return this one because they were broken off the one. So, I searched the fridge for the broken parts which match the fallen-out bolt and the thing, but I couldn't. And I see the electric cord is not clean having red stain on it and more... And something like residue or a very short human hair was found inside the fridge. All of these seem to say that it is not a new one or uncleanly assembled.Anyway, overall, the fridge is not that badly looking so I tried and it seems to be working well functionally so far."
"Returned the item, color was more of a grey than stainless steel"
"Seems I have bad luck with mini fridges.I originally bought a 2.7cf mini fridge from my local supercenter.  Didn‚Äôt work so I drove back to supercenter without the original box and I returned it.  Got my money back in less than 20 minutes including drive, not much hassle.  I figured I shouldn‚Äôt buy a generic not-well-known brand again.So I went browsing here on Amazon and found Black and Decker.  There is a brand I can trust!  This model fridge is smaller, 1.7cf and more expensive.  I figured I am paying a name-brand tax.  Must be better made!So after a few days on Friday, I got my BD mini fridge.  Excitingly, I unpack the unit.  It is covered in this hard to remove protective plastic film.  I removed the tape securing the door and shelves.The manual states to turn the thermostat to ‚Äú7‚Äù for 10-15 minutes.  Okay...  waited 30 minutes.  I heard some clicking every now and then.  I check inside and there is no cooling.  No audible hum or noise except for occasional click.I‚Äôve read from others that got a defective mini fridge.  Apparently, it will make a clicking sound and not cool.  The large black compressor does get warm...  but not much else going on.Tried a different outlet.  Same result.  Nothing is obstructing the compressor area from cooling.  And others with working units have reported the fridge starts cooling almost immediately.  I am getting nothing but a warm compressor and occasional clicking.I don‚Äôt feel safe keeping this plugged in!Black and Decker / Westinghouse support are only available weekends 10:30 to 6:30 eastern.  So on this Friday night, no help from manufacturer.Tried Amazon return process.  Amazon support called me to help troubleshoot the unit.  Then Amazon rep tried calling manufacturer.  No answer from manufacturer again.  So Amazon rep is going to do a callback for Saturday.  I already know nobody at Black and Decker / Westinghouse will be there to answer the call.  So yeah...Amazon support is great - but had I bought this at the supercenter 5 minutes away from me, I could have had my money back quick - no hassle.This is a hassle!  Now I‚Äôm stuck with a more expensive name brand nonfunctional mini fridge that I cannot simply return and get my money back.The only reason I ordered a mini fridge through Amazon was because I believed returns were super easy.  No smooth Amazon returns with this item.  Now I know better.No choice but to wait and see what happens.  Not happy waiting!Update :  I waited a day and I did not get a callback as promised.  So I went back to the email from Amazon on the rep‚Äôs response.  I selected ‚Äúnot resolved‚Äù and I got another option for Amazon to call my phone.  Alright, so I spoke to another rep and explained.  The new rep said he wasn‚Äôt sure why the first rep went through the manufacturer - since the fridge was sold by Amazon, the manufacturer does not get involved.  The fridge is ‚Äúnonreturnable‚Äù meaning it would be way too expensive to ship back - so they refunded my money.  Great!I got my money back but the only negative is that now I have to dispose of this large object myself.  I don‚Äôt think I could get this defective fridge professionally repaired without spending the same amount of money or more of original price."
"Doesn't seem to get really cold no matter what I set it to. And the temp instructions in the manual don't make any sense! ""The settings of the temperature control are ""0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7."" Adjust thetemperature control to the setting that best suits your needs. The setting of ""3""should be appropriate for home or office use."" Soooo, which is the coldest, 0 or 7?!Also the freezer part seems to get icy but then always drips/melts a little too so I'm constantly wiping a little water out of there. Most little fridges have a drip tray right underneath the freezer for this, but this on has a giant tray that sits on the shelf. Really poor design."
"I'm reasonably satisfied with this compact refrigerator.  Very quiet and easy to use.  However, the ideal temperature for refrigerated items is 40 degrees F and I've never had this unit get below 46 on the highest setting.  So, if you are just storing beverages, it is fine, but if you plan to store perishables like meat, fish or dairy, you had better plan on eating them quickly, because they won't keep as long at the temperature this unit is able to maintain."
"The description states that this unit will cool to 32 degrees and includes an icetray for the freezer unit leading you to believe it can make ice.  This simply is not the case.  I followed all the instructions and the troubleshooting guides to no avail.  This unit will not cool any lower than 39 degrees (obviously not cold enough to freeze water).  Also, the unit is not very efficient at cooling so when you open the door, you must remove your food/drink quickly and close the door immediately if you want the temperature to remain cool inside (even so, expect the temp to rise several degrees just opening and closing the door).  I understand this is a small unit and keeping the door open is never good for any refrigerator, but to have the temperature rise so quickly and take so long to drop the few degrees it went up makes this unit something you would not want to get into more than once or twice a day, and then, your food/drinks are chilled, but not really cold.Downgraded this rating to a single star.  Unable to acquire any adequate help and refrigerator will not cool below 39 degrees (maybe 38 after all 'help' instructions followed).  This is ridiculous.  STRONGLY suggest - do NOT buy.After months of use and many attempts at getting help, will throw away this unit and purchase something else.  It is useless as a refrigerator.  Best you can hope for is a non-portable cooler which is not what I bought.  Can not stress enough the importance for folks to NOT buy this unit.  It simply does not work and there is no support."
"The freezer does not work.  We bought this for our school, we need to keep ice packs frozen.  Water drips all over. We have done the trouble shooting with same result.  Called customer service.  The frig is under warranty, B&D will send another frig out, but only after we cut the cord from the current one.  The frig is keeping meds that need to be kept in frig.  We cannot put the meds in the kitchen cooler as we do not mix food and meds.  We are a school, we need a replacement but we cannot cut and send cord in as we need to have a frig.  I have asked to talk to manager.  Unable to transfer me.  There has to be a resolution to this situation.  We are willing to send the cord and serial tag once the new frig arrives.  Also we have to pay postage and tracking to return."
"After reading customer reviews and answers to questions, I was a bit concerned that the unit might be damaged in transit or might not work since there is no option to return this Black and Decker BCRK!&W compact refrigerator.  Yes, I took a chance and was dismayed to see the box arrive with a small hole in the cardboard box, but fortunately, the fridge was well packed and suffered no damage. ... I took the fridge out of the box, set it on the counter and plugged it in. Worked!  Instructions said to set it on 3, which I did, and later had to change it to 4.  The adorable tiny ice tray (included) easily fits in the tiny freezer - at setting 3, only half of the ice tray turned into ice, then at setting 4, ice formed in whole ice tray.  ...  I haven't yet used the holders inside the door but have noticed that it doesn't take much bumping into them that they will fall down. Sitting on the counter, the fridge slid around too easily so I placed 4 small pieces of slip resistant shelf liner  underneath so now it sits where it sits.  ... I have had the refrigerator for only 2 weeks.  I don't expect it to last for years, but hopefully will get a year or more out of it.  Not perfect, but bottom line, I do like this little fridge and it fits my purposes.  I would give it the full 5 stars if not for the not being able to return it if something is wrong with it.  I was lucky, so far.Edit: forgot to say, VERY QUIET.  Silent when not running, then when running, makes a very small refrigerator noise."
Condensation forms quickly and constantly so food is always wet!
"I purchased this and when the first one arrived it would get down to 35 degrees. Within a month, it would not go below 45 degrees. I initiated a return with BD and it took 8 months to complete it. They fought me the entire way.When I received the replacement, it functioned the same way. But now, about 4 months on the new one, it won't get colder than 54 degrees no matter how many times I follow the directions and defrost, etc. Just not a well made product which is surprising since I've had good experiences with Black and Decker in other products."
"Cooling is good. Packaging was great. Looks nice and is appropriately sized. It is less noisy than my old fridge; however, it is noisier than I expected. I don't know how the 45 dBA rating was obtained but that might just be a best case scenario with the average being slightly higher. This is despite me trying everything I could to level it on a flat surface. Also, it turns on quite often. I wish allowed for a bit more fluctuation in temperature and turned on less often.Whether it feels quiet or not depends on the noise floor of your environment. In noisier environments, it will seem quiet. In quieter environments like a bedroom, the noise is fairly audible. The dominant frequency is at 60 Hz. Not too many peaks at higher frequencies. While the latter point is the positive, the former can mean that the corners of your room have  a lot of bass resonance. This is important for you if the fridge is going to been in your bedroom and you sleep with your head within about 1 meter of a room corner.Overall I don't think its a bad product and its manageable. I hope in the future TEK cooler tech improves to the point where can use it in larger fridges for quieter operation."
"The fridge looks great and is the perfect size! However, it did not get cold after 24 hours of being plugged in. It was also pretty loud, which wouldn‚Äôt work for us as we were going to use it in our school room. I‚Äôm assuming it may have been dropped or something during shipping. The product did not looked damaged though. Sending the fridge back for a refund. When packing it up to send back the product was leaking some type of oil."
"Bought this for use in my office. Overall, it keeps cold the stuff I need to keep cold and is quiet about it. The two annoyances I experience with it are:1. The restraining bar on the door shelf always pops out if I open the door two quickly or close it a bit too hard. As a result, anything on the full width door shelf falls out so I have to replace the restraining bar and the items and then close/open the door very gently.2. The underside of the freezer ices up and then drips so I have the use the white tray to catch the water and be ready to wipe off anything that had been there. This despite my having the cold setting very high."
Great refrigerator. Fits perfectly in my space. I feel that it does not get as cold as it should.It is turned all the way up to 7 and the items in the refrigerator don't seem to be as cold as I think they should be. Too late to return it.
Quit working after 9 months.  Asurian protection plan won‚Äôt accept claim because they say it‚Äôs still under manufacture warranty.  Trying to figure out how to fike claim with Black & Decker.
"I got this for my barn. Nothing like a cold bottle of beer but you have to lay them on their side. Same thing for a sports drink, or bottled water or seltzer water. Bottles just don‚Äôt fit. The ice cube tray is tiny, you almost have enough ice to make a daiquiri for a Barbie doll. Bottles hold cold longer. Cans need insulators or your last sips are warm. Yuck. Check out the door in the manufacturer‚Äôs own video of the listing. With the two cartons of whatever that is on the top right, you can‚Äôt shut the door. I guess the accountants and lawyers designed this rig. It‚Äôs quiet and it works fine and is probably fine for an office or dorm. But if want to pack it with drinks, looks for something more accommodating."
"While removing the cord from the lower rear compartment, my hand brushed against the back cover bottom, resulting in a serious cut resulting in bleeding (I take blood thinners) and necessary cleaning, disinfecting, and bandaging. Very bad design to have such sharp edges in an exposed region. The doorinside is badly designed also: It will only hold 1 half gallon milk container (molding blocks a second) and the door guard rails fall off if touched, there seems no way to make them fast other than glue. It performs its cooling functions well, but the design is dangerous and inefficient."
"Have had for a year. Keeps everything very very cold almost freezing which I adore. Not sure why they advertise and charge for stainless steel though (even as far as showing every picture in the ads, the refrigerator with superior material stainless steel as the top door handle) to then replace and send it with basic low end plastic. The sellers may think not a big deal may not even notice a difference. Buyers with higher standards do. Ehem."
"Bought this for my son for his birthday. Arrived in no time flat. Plugged it in, everything seemed fine, so threw out all the packaging after a couple days because who has room for a giant box? A couple days later, and I have a warm fridge. Of course.Rather than figure out how to send something of this size back without packaging, submitted a warranty claim to W. Appliance Co. A week later, and still had heard nothing. Contacted Amazon for assistance dealing with them, and they got the company on the phone with a promise of having a replacement delivered within 10 days.Two weeks later, still no fridge. More unanswered emails. Another call to Amazon, who again gets them on the phone, apologies and tells me they've called the warehouse and a new fridge will be delivered by the end of the week.End of the following week, still no fridge. Emailed expecting no reply but - shock of shock - receive a reply. My ordered color is out of order, would I take a different color? (Wait, I thought you talked to the warehouse last time?) But whatever, just send a fridge. Several weeks later, still no fridge. Along with more unanswered emails. I never did hear back from them on this. I've given up on them entirely.But, I did call Amazon up again. 'Would I like to talk to the company again?' No, I would not, what would be the point? Any chance for a refund despite being WAY outside the return window at this point? Afraid not. But I can't blame Amazon for that. After a little back and forth with support, Amazon did send me out a new fridge and I sent the original dead one back in the new one's packaging.The replacement seems to be working fine so far a couple weeks in. But I don't trust that it will last based on my dealing with this company. And when/if it does fail, I'm certainly not wasting any more time with this issue and will just consider it a relatively expensive lesson to avoid Black & Decker products as well as anything warranted by W. Appliance Co."
"This fridge is fine for keeping non-perishable foods (i.e. soft drinks) and I've kept milk fresh in it with no real problems, though it doesn't last as long as it would a better fridge. But, you can absolutely forget about keeping anything frozen in the freezer compartment, and making I've cubes is 100% out of the question, even when it's turned up to the maximum setting."
"I‚Äôm not sure if any of these issues were my fault, but i‚Äôm severely disappointed. With the freezer compartment it would freeze under the compartment, it would melt and drip onto everything below. There is a strange smell that comes with it that I haven‚Äôt smelt before, that affects the taste of everything kept in the fridge. I‚Äôm not sure if the smell is from the cooling contraption used or what. It does its purpose which is keep things cool and refrigerated, but it ruins products kept inside with the freezer issue. When trying to reach out to the website for support, I was told the ‚Äúproduct does not exist.‚Äù Very disappointed because the fridge is a cute great size."
"Refrigeration works good until too much is put in around the corner freezer, then it doesn't cool adequately."
This refrigerator has an issue of the small freezer causing water dripping inside the refrigerator everyday.
It‚Äôs wet on the inside and freaking loud all of a sudden
"We bought this for a nursing home resident to have in her room, so we can't keep close track of its performance.But at the full-cold setting (IIRC 7) the fridge gets no colder than 42 degF, which is cold enough for a lot of things, but not a container of milk that you expect to last more than 2-3 days. The freezer doesn't freeze basically at all.We'll probably end up trashing it and replacing it with something we can buy locally, where a return/exchange or warranty service will be much easier to work out."
"I needed to store breast milk & this saved me from having to go downstairs 3 or so times a night. It gets pretty cold - i used a temp gun and it was low 20's on setting 3 - works well. It's super quiet like 95% of the time; the times it isn't is when the compressor is kicking on/triggering, then you hear a slight hum/buzz - not enough to annoy you really even sleeping with it 10 feet away or so (almost sounds like your central unit is kicking on).My main complaint  for mine was that the door was scratched (1inch by 3inches) when i received it, even though almost everywhere else they had a plastic wrap/corner protectors to protect it, they didn't protect the main surface of the door frame. This isn't a fault to the mechanics of the machine, just the overall experience of the item. It is slightly larger than i thought, but the space inside is sufficient for most needs. Also, without reading the instructions, it's unclear what setting is cold and what setting is less cold... or even the degrees that each setting (1-7) is adjusted to... you have to kind of trial & error and see if it's cold enough."
"less than (2) years it doesn't freeze anymore,"
The product was damaged- had scratches on it and a big dent in the side. Still works but not what I was expecting and not worth the trouble to return but very disappointing that it wasn't in really good condition. If it was used then that is my fault for not seeing that in the description but I didn't purchase it thinking it was so I was very surprised by the way it came out of the box.
"I wanted a mini-fridge to avoid the disgusting shared fridge where I live. The thing works and that's nice but I do music production in my room and every time the fridge compressor kicks on or off, my audio equipment fails. It causes a keyboard to freeze, speakers to pop, and audio interface to briefly disconnect. I've read that this can be helped with a power condition or UPS, or whatever it's called, so that's an option but I haven't tried it yet. The fridge itself feels pretty cheaply made and the cooling is very uneven throughout it. If you put something on the shelf below the freezer, the food will freeze, but if you put it below that shelf it's a little under temp. Also, the rail to hold things to the door has too wide of a gap so your things will slide around and even fall out when you open and close the door. All that said, the fridge works and is small. I'm not sure you'd find anything better for the price but I still would have trouble recommending this."
"For about a month, it cooled to just under 40 degrees, but made loud popping noises.  That stopped after about a month.  Now it won't cool below 45 degrees (I have a thermometer in it).  I can only keep things cool for my lunch at work, but have to make sure to leave nothing in overnight.  Tried to register with Black and Decker to submit a claim under the warranty, but the site tells me I have the wrong model number and I late a date on the prong of the electric plug.  What?  The model is all over the website and NOTHING is printed on the metal prong for the plug.  I managed to send an email.  If I ever get a response, I'll update this review.  Very frustrating and I'd say do not buy.UPDATE: 3 weeks later.  For warranty, its not Black and Decker but Equity Brands.  I've written and included photos and warranty info to EquityBrands.com and received absolutely no reply.  I cannot revise my review and I am sorry for that.  It's a cold world...except inside my Black and Decker mini fridge!"
"It leaks inside. From tiny freezer area I think. I had nothing in the freezer (not that you could fit anything in it, but that is not what I bought it for) No matter what I did with the temp setting; it continued to leak. Everything got dripped on and was wet. I had to put things in containers or cover with plastic. GROSS. I bought it to use while my reg fridge was being repaired and then awaiting a new fridge. I was desperate so I ordered this. I never got it delivered even though it said delivered; perhaps it was stolen from my locked apt lobby. At any rate, Amazon was amazing and sent another. I dragged it up my 6 flight walk up. It worked well for a week then everything was wet. I tried unplugging and waiting...I put it back on same wetness. It is relatively quiet but I DO NOT recommend. I could not get the drip to stop no matter how low or high I changed temp. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
"The size and color are perfect. My first order had to be cancelled due to some shipping problem. I re ordered and it came promptly however there is a long dent in the lower front door. I decided not to return it, but I felt that other shoppers might appreciate  this information."
"Is super cute!! Bought it for bedroom, hid in my closet fur no show so is perfect. However, it gets super hot and is making a watery noise. Thought it just needed to adjust but is been 24 hrs and same. So scheduled  return for another one. So let‚Äôs see what happens."
"Nice little refrigerator, good temperature control.  Not much room for beverages if you use all 3 shelves, but with just two shelves installed you can fit taller drinks on top and shorter drinks on bottom (those are small, 12oz gatorade and diet coke on bottom and 16.9oz diet pepsi on top).  I haven't used the freezer but it does seem like it is cold enough inside to keep a couple frozen meals solid.  I'd have given it 5 stars because it fulfills my needs and seems like a good product, but it was delivered without one of the adjustable leveling feet (see 2nd photo), so I have to shim it up to keep it from wobbling.  I wrote to Black and Decker customer service about that, so we'll see if they send the part."
This is good for keeping refrigerated items cold but the freezer section does not keep things frozen. I put this in my office at work and I had to throw out the two little ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù meals I had in there because they were not frozen.
"I love the color it looks very sharp.  It is quiet and fits right under my counter.  BUT the freezer does not freeze.  I put an ice cream bar in there and it is super soft and fell apart, not fully melted like liquid, but I am now scared to put real food in there and have it be ok to eat..  Other than that it works well for keeping things cool, almost too cold  as I had to turn it up to the max temp to keep things in the freezer ""almost"" frozen"
"The fridge arrived well packaged on June 9,2024. I unboxed it a couple days later and set up was a breeze after reading the manual. The fridge worked very well until July 21st - 6 weeks pst the time to return date. I came home after running errands only to find a wet smell like a damp towel. I checked the refrigerator only to find it had defrosted and ruined everything in it except water bottles.I read the manual again after cleaning out the fridge, continued defrosting overnight and plugged it according to instructions in the manual, reset it and stored a few more foods to see if it would work properly. Nope! Two days later it iced up with condensation. So now I‚Äôm stuck with having to defrost this thing every few days.I do not recommend purchasing this mini fridge. Nice to see others have a good experience with this particular fridge. Wish I did as I‚Äôm out of $100+ !"
"Unfortunately this fridge leaks, water gets all over the food, it's completely useless. And a waste of money. I wondered if the problem was the drip pan but when I turned the fridge around to check, there is NO DRIP PAN. As well any hole that water could come out of is sealed up with some kind of expanding foam. And inside the fridge, there's no hole for the water to drain out of.Why did you do this, Black and Decker? Aren't you supposed to be a trusted household name? I should have returned it but I thought it was something I was doing wrong. Well, now I'm out 200 bucks. Don't make the same mistake as me unless you want water dripping all over your food. Worthless.  And while I'm here, don't ever get a Dustbuster, absolutely terrible, no sucking power. I don't hate Black & Decker, they're just bad. And if the QA person ever reads this, can I have my money back? Sheesh!UPDATE: Instead of Freon this fridge contains a substance called R600a which means NYC will not pick up on garbage day. Nowhere in the city will accept it, I will have to spend 200 additional dollars hauling it away so it can be recycled appropriately. I will never buy another Black & Decker product again because of this nightmare, and I will also tell all my other friends (I have a lot) to avoid it as well. Worst product I ever bought. Thanks for wasting my time and money Black & Decker. If you're still reading this, don't think it won't happen to you. Save yourself and don't buy this fridge!!!!"
"So I bought this mini fridge for my office.  I like that the freezer is a decent size (holds about 4 frozen dinners) and the fridge itself is also plenty big - for what I wanted for my office.  (bottled water, sodas, snacks, etc.)  However, when my unit arrived, box intact and no visible signs of damage, once it was unpacked the corner of my unit was damaged.  It looks like it was either dropped or pinched on the corner.  You can see from the photos I've attached...  I don't understand how the unit can be damaged (dropped or poked, or other) without the box and shipping materials being damaged, too - unless it was packaged and shipped off from the factory damaged - which is what I suspect happened.  The unit itself is fine size-wise, it seems to be cooling fine, but it does seem to be a little more noisy that I had intended and or planned.  It seems as if the motor is rattling or vibrating, which I assume may/may not be caused from the unit being damaged somehow and then shipped to me.  Normally, I'd just return this unit and ask that a new one be shipped out but 1) it's rather large and not easily just dropped back off with UPS, and 2) we're not supposed to getting any more mini fridges at our office, so I had it delivered when when my boss was out of the office and placed under my desk, so I can't have a replacement one shipped out.  With that, I'm stuck with a damaged unit, that makes a louder than normal rattling/vibration (caused by what I can only assume was the unit being dropped) and can't really replace it without it being obvious.  Bottom line - it cools fine (so far), size is acceptable, but appears to be a gamble if the unit is shipped out damaged or not."
Within a month it started dripping water inside of the refrigerator and making clicking noises
"I bought this refrigerator for my Daughter as a gift.  She intended to use it to store breast milk at work after having our second grandson.  After two weeks it stopped cooling and spoiled about four days of breast milk.I first contacted Black and Decker via email to have it repaired under the one year warranty.  It took Black and Decker a week to respond to my inquiry.  When they did respond to my email I was told I needed to contact their licensed partner, W Appliance.  I contacted W Appliance and was on hold 20 minutes.  After 20 minutes I was told to leave a voicemail and they would contact me.  A week went by and I did not receive a call back.  So, this morning I called Amazon to see if I could return the product.  I was told the return period had passed.  Amazon was good enough to help me contact Black and Decker.  However, Black and Decker told me I needed to call a different third party named Encompass.  I was on hold for 56 minutes but finally reached an agent.  The problem is, the agent told me they do not handle returns or warranty work on these refrigerators.  Instead, they are a third party that contract manufactures these refrigerators for Black and Decker from Haire.  So this is where I am today.  I still don't have a refrigerator that works and I don't know how to get it returned or repaired.  I guess I could give up and call the $119 tuition.  Lesson learned is I will never purchase another appliance on-line.  If I had purchased this product at Best Buy or Costco, I  know I could have physically returned to product to the store and either received a replacement or a refund no questions asked."
"The most annoying thing about this refrigerator (aside from the frequent need to defrost) is the wire restraint in the door. The wire came out at least 50% of the time when I opened the door. A bit of glue probably would have solved the problem. The second most annoying thing is the ""freezer"" space. Not only is it too small to be functional, the flap covering the opening to the space becomes unusable with even the slightest build up of ice. The good thing is that the refrigerator held just enough to make temporary living in a small space tolerable."
"As other reviewers stated, it comes in dented but I did not have the time to either return it or ask for a credit. Dented in five places. Also, it is a really ugly military gray color but it blends in with the wall in the corner of the room. One more issue. Be very careful with the temperature settings. I cranked it way up the first day I got it and seltzer cans froze and exploded pushing the door open for an entire hot weekend (it is in my office, no A/C on weekends). So then I reduced the temp to 5 and it was okay but I wanted my seltzer to be real cold. So I carefully cranked it up one-half to 5 1/2. Well that was a disaster! 5 cans froze and exploded over the weekend but remarkably, the door of the fridge closed itself and it all stayed frozen mitigating the mess. Also lucky for me that I don't drink sugary soda which would have been a sticky disaster. The long and short of it is that if you can live with the dents and manage the temp below freezing as well as not being overly concerned about appearance. it will be fine. Serves its purpose.Sounds like three strikes but it is totally livable for the price despite the shortcomings."
"This fridge was great until it suddenly only started getting cold half the time about 3 months in. While trying to figure out why it wouldn't freeze anything anymore, I turned the dial down and now it won't turn back up past setting 2 of 7. As a fridge, it's functionally useless now."
"**Update 5 November 2021 -- ~18 months of ownership** The thermostat has croaked. I used this as a work refrigerator for my office. I kept lunch meat and cheese and some vegetables for snacking in it. I returned after a weekend to find it all warm inside. I tested the outlet and cord. No problem. I tested the thermostat by turning it off and on. It would work for 10 minutes then shut off. This product is garbage. I'm taking the 2 star down to to 1.**I had a Frigidaire mini fridge in college the same cubic feet size as this Black & Decker. It was a marvel of efficient use of space. I could fit a 30 pack of ""beverages"" in it, my compact Brita filter and several miscellaneous snacks all with no problem.The opposite is true of this product. The compact Brita filter cannot fit without taking out the upper shelf, thus effectively halving your usable space. I finally ""solved"" this issue by keeping the shelf and storing the Brita filter itself outside of the refrigerator and pouring the filtered water into bottles that I lay horizontal to cool them. It's a hassle and quite frankly, the result of stupid design on the part of the engineers at Black & Decker. There's only one slot in the door that allows items taller than a standard 12 oz. aluminum can to be stored upright.If it was not such a bother, I would return this mini-fridge and get one that used its limited space much more efficiently.Other than that MAJOR issue, it does cool well and there have been no other problems.Also, I will note that generally I have had great experience with Black & Decker products. I have almost their entire line of 20v lithium power and yard tools that I consistently use and love. This mini-fridge has been the only stinker I've purchased from the brand."
"Perfectly fine for cooling stuff but the freezer compartment is useless. For some reason can make the tray of water frozen but cannot keep my small icecream frozen, becomes liquid."
"I finally got this today after a few days of delay, delay. It has a very loud hum. When I plugged up , i began hearing the hum. It was so loud, I thought it was my outside AC/heat unit. This is not white noise. I  must return it. I will never have rest with it on and most certainly no sleep. I would never recommend this for any one."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            If you'd rather watch a video than read the below, the video covers it all, and then some.Functionality:It comes with molded plastic door compartments with wire retainers, an interior shelf, a white plastic tray, and a small freezer on top.Door compartments: For the most part, the compartments themselves are fine. There's a large one on bottom and a smaller one for a few cans on top.Wire retainers on door compartments: Most of my complaint lies with these guys. First, the small compartment's retainer is out of alignment (pictured) so when it's put in the holes to hold it in place, it only rests there. The slightest bit of pressure from behind makes it pop up out of the holes and the cans fall out (pictured). The bottom retainer is a) very high up from the bottom - anything short will just fall out and b) very wide - the space of nothing between the retainer and the edge of the bottom shelf is enormous, and stuff just slips right through (pictured).The biggest frustration is opening this fridge and EVERYTHING in the door slams to the ground because it slips through this space (pictured).Interior shelf: The shelf is too deep (or is it a problem with the retainer?) and therefore if the door compartment is full, the door won't close because the stuff in the door compartment hits the edge of the shelf (pictured)White plastic tray: I have no idea what this is for. The tray isn't the right size for the top shelf (tray is too small) and isn't the right size for the bottom shelf (tray is too big). Useless.Noise: Despite several other reports that it is quiet, I find it to be quite loud. It is loud enough that when I'm doing work in my office, and the compressor kicks on/off, I actually notice it."

"This refrigerator never has kept food cold enough, even on the coldest setting, but it was ok for about 2 months, it would hold at about 40 degrees. It has slowly gotten warmer and warmer. Even after not being open, the temperature is 45 degrees on the coldest setting, so milk and similar things are going bad in 2 days.  It has occasionally built up frost, but before I could defrost it myself, it seemed to defrost itself, with water on the bottom shelf that needed to be cleaned up. Now there is no frost on the freezer compartment because the whole inside is too warm. None of this is due to the door being left open. I have had other similar compact refrigerators over the years and they were never like this; they kept food as cold, or almost as cold as a regular refrigerator. I will have to replace this one. I will not buy this brand again."
So I purchased this fridge to store medication which has to stay below 30 degrees. I purchased a fridge thermometer and this mini fridge worked fine for the first month but 6 weeks and it isn‚Äôt cooling below 40. So due to this $800 of my medication is no longer any good.
"I don't suggest to purchase this, it works fine in the first few weeks but starting to stop cooling very soon."
"Great compact size. Keeps items cold. Bottom door rack doesn't move with size of item so things fall out.  Freezer doesn't freeze anything...water, food, ice packs. Haven't needed to defrost yet so can't talk about that function."
"Its quiet, looks good and keeps beverages cold but freezer leaks water into the refrigerator section all the time and always has to be wiped up because it thaws out the ice cubes.  I think the freezer is a waste of money, cubic inches and time cleaning it without ice freezing properly.  I only put the ice cube tray in there so I don't know how it would work with food."
"Don't waste your money, it spoiled all my items and leaked water from the freezer.  Piece of garbage and it lasted less than 5 months.  Very disappointed I want a replacement or money back."
"There is a tray on the inside that has no drawer compartment it just sits there on the 1 shelf you have. I'm assuming this is so your food doesn't get wet. Well, where am I supposed to put the food? on the wet tray? under it? I'm just not using the tray because I feel like it's a waste of time. My food is nice and cold and I guess that's the only thing that really matters."
"It keeps the items cold but definitely the freezer part doesn‚Äôt do well. I even put my mini tiny ice cubes tray (smaller that the one the fridge came with) and still hasn‚Äôt froze. Even on the coldest setting still doesn‚Äôt freeze.  Not really great but other than that it great for keeping drinks and snacks really cold! The noise level is okay, I always have background noises so it doesn‚Äôt bother me but if you like it super quiet this ain‚Äôt the one for you."
"The first order: Fridge smelled bad when plugged in, like burning petroleum and never cooled.  Returned and replaced.Replacement fridge:  It cools but not cold enough to be food safe. And the freezer drips constantly. It used to work for a little bit, but now doesn't get below 50F.  Because it doesn't get cold enough any longer, the freezer compartment constantly drips.  I used the defrost tray to collect the water so it doesn't get all over my lunch.  Now there's mold in the tray and it smells bad.Of course now it is past the return date and neither the manufacturer nor Amazon will refund.My last mini fridge lasted 33 years through 3 dorms, 3 states and 3 offices!Now, planned obsolescence?"
Bought this for a family member who is in a memory care facility so the Ensure could be kept available for his needs. It does not freeze ice in the mini tray that came with the unit. Very disappointed
"While the fridge is functional, the dripping from the freezer was so much that it rendered the top shelf unusable upom initial setup. The fridge comes with a drip tray but for the life of me, I don't understand why they didn't make it so it could slide in right under the freezer. Instead, I had to improvise a way (got some PVC pipe pieces from Home Depot) to prop up the drip tray so I could use most of that shelf's surface (see pic). Seems like a very basic design flaw that could have been easily fixed by the manufacturer."
"Update:  It is now early July.  I made the warranty claim mid-October.  In mid-June, someone at warranty support apologized for the delay and said they would send out the replacement fridge.  I don't have it, nor has the company communicated with me.Update:  Changing to one star.  The fridge stopped cooling properly.  Contacted warranty support and was told to cut the plug end off the power cord and send some other product information so that I could get a warranty replacement.  It has been more than two months.  I have sent a status request twice, and no one writes back.Update:  This fridge seems to have problems anytime the freezer is used.  A bunch of water drips from just below the freezer all over the stuff below it.  When the tray below the freezer gets water in it, good luck dumping the water somewhere before you spill it.  I wish I had just bought a mini-fridge with no freezer.  I‚Äôll either be avoiding use of the freezer or replacing this mini-fridge.Original review‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-Perfect size.  Holds a lot but is manageable to move.  I have had it for a week, and it maintains temperature perfectly in the fridge and freezer compartments."
Freezer is a joke. Not cold enough to make ice or keep things even close to frozen. Drip pan beneath is always filled with water.  Compressor always runs and makes a popping nose when it shuts off.  Exterior finish is cheap.  Look elsewhere.
The mini fridge never got very cold.  I had it in the highest setting.  I used it in my office.  It was okay just for drinks.  I wouldn't trust it for perishable items!  It is not even a year old.  It's dead. It just stopped working.I have tried customer service for over a week.  No return calls. I have texted.  No response.  I called today.I stayed on hold. I was going to wait until someone picked up.  They disconnected me after11 minutes.  They just hung up on me.  I will NEVER buy another Black and Decker product.  Their warranty is useles
"Seems to work ok as a small fridge, but the outside gets so hot you can't put your hand against it. Not sure if this is a defect or if that's the way it normally works.  I wouldn't use it near any flammable material."
I love the refrigerator as a whole. Very disappointed in the door storage. The bar doesn‚Äôt stay on rendering the door storage useless. Was going to return the refrigerator but I like the configuration of it better than any compact fridges I've seen. I love the shallow freezer allowing me to store small thing in it without taking away too much fridge room like the fridges with the square freezer. I have opted in the past to get fridges without freezers because the cube freezers took up too much space.Would‚Äôve been nice though it the door storage didn‚Äôt have the issue it has because this would‚Äôve been the best mini fridge of this size I had ever seen.I plan to figure out a way of resurrecting the door storage but I shouldn‚Äôt have too...
"For the size and capacity, it's not worth paying up for the brand name. The fridge doesn't get very cold, even at the highest setting and the ""freezer"" couldn't even make ice cubes out of half of the tiny cubes in the mini ice tray provided."
"I purchased this item for my office. Since the freezer is inside the same space, there are times that it drips water because then there is a puddle of water on top of my drinks/food. Disappointed, I expected better from this brand."
"I bought this little fridge for a senior in a rehab facility. Overall it seems good but the freezer door does not close properly. I called Amazon and Black & Decker. Amazon had no tech help, even though on the listing page it reads there is ""Free Amazon Tech Support for 90 days"". This was not true. Black & Decker said this problem isn't is their service manual, so thanks and have a nice day.Not a good experience with Amazon or Black & Decker today. I would have returned this right away but I was in the hospital and missed the return window. I'm a regular Prime buyer but was very disappointed in the service I received today."
"Purchased in March of 2023, after a little over a year, this fridge has totally crapped out on me. It has gradually lost its ability to cool. It only took about 9 months to stop being able to reach the mid-30s and now it hovers around 45 degrees. This is my second fridge to do the same thing. The support website for the company is not a working site. Disappointing."
"This frig worked for one week and took two days to make ice.NOW, it hardly cools at all on the highest setting.This frig is a ""lemon.""Don't take a chance; buy something else."
"Stuff on the lower shelf or on the doors take ages to cool, even on higher settings. And yet, stuff on the back/higher shelf freeze. I'm not talking about the little freezing compartment. I'm talking about the shelf underneath it. I've put bottles there to find the contents frozen solid two days later. Lowering the settings doesn't help, aside from making the subpar cooling in the rest of the fridge worse.Giving it two stars instead of one cuz at least it's quiet. I'll give it that much."
"Aside from the low level white noise this fridge produces, every now and then it makes high pitched noises; literally noises that you're more likely to hear in a cartoon. A high pitched ""Boop"" when the cooler turns on and an upward pitch bending ""Boing!"" when it clicks off. Not kidding. Boop. Boing. This is a real review.If you're going to have this fridge anywhere that you spend a significant amount of time, it will drive you crazy with these sounds. I couldn't help myself. I had to make Boop and Boing noises every time I heard them. My cat looked at me curiously.Beyond that, be very careful with the temperature setting. I ended up with an exploded soda or three on the top shelf of the fridge and even some drinks on the bottom shelf had started to freeze. I wouldn't leave the setting any higher than a 3 at this point. But I suppose that's irrelevant, because I'm going to have to return the fridge for the noise issues. Oh well.Edit #1: I did try a replacement fridge. It doesn't ""Boop"" or ""Boing"" but it does ""BOINK!""Edit #2: I returned the replacement. The replacement replacement also goes ""BOINK!"" I'm convinced it's a design flaw for this model."
"This mini-fridge has several flaws..  First, the temperature is only so-so.  I tend to like things ice cold, but this fridge‚Äîeven at its highest setting‚Äîonly gets down to high-40 degrees Fahrenheit.  The ice box never gets cold enough to freeze ice.  Second, it includes a drip tray for a reason: constant dripping from ‚Äúice box‚Äù section into that tray.  I have to empty it every two weeks.  Third, the wire bracket meant to hold items on the door constantly comes detached.Simply put?  I wish I‚Äôd gotten something else."
"Fridge leaks water from the freezer portion for no reason even when set to the coldest temperature. Do not buy this just because its a brand name, the quality of this is very low."
"Very disappointing, Black and Decker I thought was once a good name in quality, but this has changed my view completely, bought this I think back in June to have something to keep food in my office, worked as expected for maybe 2 weeks or so then started to not cool, in fact it started to get hot from the pump. Now at this point, I understand that stuff like this does happen, got in touch with amazon support who then contacted the manufacturer, I was instructed to send in the cord, receipt, the ship to, and the Sticker that contains the S/N. sent it in to some office in NY, confirmed they received it [I had tracking on this]. Waited a week, nothing, was given a number to call, couldn't get anyone on the phone unless I wanted to wait for hours to talk to someone, had the opportunity to leave a message which I did [I don't have the time to wait on hold forever]. Fast forward to September, I still don't have a new fridge, the only thing amazon told me when I spoke to them a mouth ago after weeks after sending stuff in was that I've had this for a mouth and thus nothing could be done. I've pretty much accepted that I'm out $130. Very frustrating, seems that they only care about making a buck off there cheap crappy products and not customer service, if only they replaced the unit, we wouldn't be here! Would I recommend this to other people? NO, never buy anything from Black and Decker, their glory days have long since passed!"
"The fridge part functions fine, but the freezer does not stay cold enough.  I keep one thing in it, not overcrowded, but sometimes when I take it out, it's soft, not 100% frozen.  This could be dangerous for some foods if you expect to store them a while.  Makes me wish I had just gotten a minifridge without a freezer."
"We literally only use this mini fridge to store a few breastmilk bottles at night for our baby‚Äôs night feedings. We have a temperature sensor (with a phone app) in the fridge to make sure it maintains any temperature colder than the necessary and safe 39 degrees. Even set to the coldest setting, this fridge now is only 40 degrees at its coldest fluctuation, average of 43 degrees. Too late to return now. Would give zero stars if we could. Purchase elsewhere!"
"This fridge is fine and it looks fine. The noise is a bit inconsistent, but not too bad even though it's in our bedroom. However, there's a rack attachment in the inside of the door that keeps collapsing and it's really frustrating. It collapses for no apparent reason and the stuff it's holding just falls off the door shelf. We also frequently notice that the fridge door isn't totally closed. For some reason it wants to stay partially open. For these reasons, we have mixed feelings about this purchase."
Had to set at the highest set #7 to get the tinny ice tray to freeze and can't put anything else in the freezer. Temp stays around 38 to 40 depending on what I have in there. Which is not much. And the door shelf doesn't hold items well and stuff falls out when I open the door. The bar is already starting to break. Wouldn't buy again.
"I gave this fridge 3 stars because although it‚Äôs not great, it was very affordable so it gets bonus points. My major complaint is that when you put the temp up whatever is in the fridge section freezes, but if you lower the temperature everything in the freezer melts. A can on the bottom of the fridge actually froze and exploded (huge mess) when the fridge wasn‚Äôt even on the coldest setting. I‚Äôve only had it for a few weeks. Also, I get that it is a small fridge and it won‚Äôt fit TOO much stuff, but it has a lot of wasted space on the inside (shelves are set up weird) making it less roomy than it could be.Overall, for the price its the best you‚Äôre probably gonna get.... but if price isn‚Äôt the biggest issue i‚Äôd definitely get something better if I were you."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Advertisement says its 45db but it is more like 75. Its very noisy. Its possible i have a defective unit. I took a video so you can see just how noisy it is at startup, which happens every 5 or so minutes. 30 seconds after it starts it reduces to a loud hum but my crappy mini-fridge from best buy thats over 2 years old is way quieterUPDATE: They sent me a replacement and its significantly quieter. Still pretty noisy in my opinion but i made a new recording and compared sound levels and its quite a difference. My guess is delivery knocks it around and youre at the mercy of the supply chain. I updated to 3 stars."
"I put a thermometer inside my unit and the average temperature runs 42.8¬∞ on the lowest setting, while cycling to as high as 47¬∞. I bought this unit to hold breast milk because it could get to 37¬∞. Unfortunately has not lived up to the standards I was hoping for"
"Hunk of junk.  It keeps turning off and ruining all my food.  Bought it Sept 2020, one month later  I had to turn it around and jiggle the back area to get it to work.  Then it shuts off when nobody is around and all the food is ruined.  Oct 2020 Company said cut the plug and mail it back we will send a new one.  I have contacted them since then and they keep putting me off and still have not sent new fridge.  The company is a scam!  I have emailed them and called them.  I wrote down all dates and kept emails.  So now I have a fridge I cant even get fixed because I cut the plug and mailed it to them like they asked.  So to clarify:  i bought sept 2020, it was broken by oct 2020, they said they would replace oct 2020, i have called them 7 times with someone saying oh yes we will get it to you, and i have emailed them approximately 7 times with each time them telling me to call the number where they tell me they are mailing the unit or having a manager call me and no manager calls nor have i received the unit!  I even finally said just refund me and they said we will have a manager call you.  That was 4 days ago.  So for 4 months they have been lying and putting me off.  Do not buy the company is a scam!"
"This refrigerator will not go below 45 degrees even at the coldest temp setting.  This is an unsafe temperature for food, but may be fine if you like lukewarm beverages.  If you fall and hit your head and still order one after reading this review make sure to check the temperature with a thermometer soon after receiving, Amazon will only accept a return in the first 30 days leaving you to deal with the manufacturer's warranty."
"It keeps leaking and won‚Äôt stay frozen in the freezer, everything is soaking wet all the time. Piece of crap."
"Pros: Compact, perfect for underneath the desk. Fits several soda cans, salad dressing, creamer bottles, etc.Cons: Side rail has too much of a gap that every time you open the door, the side items, like salad dressing or a small soda bottle slides right through. Temperature control - can't quite seem to figure this out. If I put it on 4 or 5, my items that are placed on the fridge trays  are frozen, but if I drop it any lower than that, the door items don't get chilled.Knocked off a couple of stars for the design (side rail) and temperature control."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                My mini refrigerator came in today...looked used and battered. I think ima send it backUPDATED: I Was sent a new refrigerator.
"Bought this Christmas. Has been plugged in since then and it‚Äôs now march. Drinks inside are cool at best. Even with temp setting turned all way to seven which is coldest, drinks cool, not cold. Bought same type fridge but different name and this think will freeze drinks. Won‚Äôt buy black and decker again."
"As far as functionality, the unit is adequate. You get what pay for. The truly disappointing thing, is the damaged unit. The top is covered in scuffs, and scratches. I need a unit NOW, or I would return it. Way to go Black&Decker"
"I purchased this refrigerator specifically because it had a full shelf freezer unit. I keep it at the high end of the settings so I can still keep drinks cold and not stress the compressor which is somewhat noisy. Drinks are cool, but not frozen at a setting of 6/7. The freezer though does not work properly. I needed to be able to store ice packs to use on rotation. The thinner the pack the better. It will freeze, only if it is touching the bottom of the metal of the freezer. If it sits on top of another pack, no matter how long it is in the freezer, it will never freeze. I would not buy this unit again and if I could have returned it during the return window, I would have. Very disappointed."
Had it 6.5 months already not staying cold.Don't buy
"I will return to update the review once I have actually used the system.My product arrived yesterday. This is my first purchase with a microwave air combo. I previously owned a Foodi and loved it. I decided to give it away to a family, as it was too large for my needs.Please be aware to adhere to warning label on box as it is very heavy. I am glad I did! The item is well packaged and undamaged after removing from the box. Its a great size for my kitchen. The size is perfect if you want to store it on a kitchen cart. The actual item once out of the box was easy to lift and place on the kitchen counter.I used to own a Toshiba stand alone microwave oven and it never failed me.I have not  used the new item yet. I did clean it with mild soap and damp cloth. It looks amazing!The only disappointment so far( I'm old school) I know its saving a lot of trees, I wish it came with a paper owners/operation manual. As I stated before this is the first type of kitchen appliance for me.I will return to update the review once I have actually used the system."
"The poblems that I have with this microwave:1. Door is kind of loud but not as loud as some microwaves. The metal panel on the top and sides shakes loudly after you open / close the door unless you put weight on it.2. You can't just twist the dial to set the microwave timer; first you have to press the Power button, select the power level, then dial in the time. Alternatively, you can spam +30 seconds until you get to your desired time. Twisting the dial without pressing anything instead shows preset menu options that you are unlikely to use very much. Update: I discovered that if you start by spinning the dial counter-clockwise, it lets you put in the microwave time immediately.3. You can't add / subtract time while it is running with the dial, you can only press +30 seconds.4. You can't adjust the power level while it is running. This is normal, but there are some microwaves that let you do this. This should be a common feature. The microwave does not have an inverter, which is kind of a gimmick anyway.5. When you are preheating the oven, it doesn't show the current temperature, it just shows the target temperature and the progress to that temperature.5. It beeps 5 times when it is done. This is too many beeps. The only saving grace here is that the beeps stop after you open the door. You can also mute all beeps, which is what we have done. I wish there was an option to reduce the number of beeps (I believe Kitchen Aid Microwaves let you do this.)6. No option for reminder beeps for after the food is done, and the screen doesn't let you know the food is done for more than a few seconds.7. Dial button is not reliable, it won't always register presses. You also can't spam +30 seconds really fast. I read that the dial button can get gunked up over time leading to the microwave starting on its own, or randomly adding more time. The dial itself doesn't feel very satisfying. It kind of ratchets instead of spinning smoothly, and it makes loud clicking noises because of this.8. A 12"" pizza won't fit on the included tray, so you would need to buy a separate pizza tray that is under 13"". Make sure its not the flimsy kind with holes."
"I've used this Toshiba microwave for just over 1 year. I cannot recommend it. It never heats evenly.  I can use the same glass bowl, same ingredients, same heating time & setting & the heating is always inconsistent. One time the food is heated throughout, next time it's cold. I've even had the bowl come out with one side of the bowl warm & other side still cold to the touch. Control panel buttons are too close together. I don't have large hands but have to use my knuckles to make sure I get the correct setting. The turntable is now beginning to grind. Not sure how much longer this one will last."
The microwave has been used for less than two years without any problem. It stated vausingj a very dangerous malfunction lately: it turns on by itself with the timer at various time settings. We have to unplug it after each use to prevent possible fire hazards.I would appreciate any owner who has experienced similar problem to either direct me to a solution or how to reach the manufacturer.I couldn‚Äôt find any information to contact Amazon.Thank you.
"The glass dish that rotates comes out of the tracks easily, and it's hard to get back in, especially if it's hot. They are frying gear that comes with this is terrible and cheap. And the setup for the dial and different cooking modes is difficult to use and overly complicated.One last thought is that it doesn't do anything particularly well. It doesn't bake well, doesn't air fry well, doesn't broil well, but it does microwave okay.Overall, it is a disappointing and overly expensive¬†product."
"I've had this microwave for about a week so I haven't put it through all its paces. I used to have a Sharp microwave with sensor reheat that I loved and lasted 17 years. My last microwave did not have that feature and lasted 5 years, although that was probably my fault becauseI accidentally ran it for 10 minutes with nothing in it. Anyway, sensory reheat was a priority for me this time. I haven't used it on too many things yet so if I have an update I will post it. I tried it with pizza and it ran way too long, exploding the pizza all over. What I like about it is that it doesn't run at full power during sensor reheat. I tried heating the pizza just using the 30 second quick button and it was a little more than it needed. I tried 30 seconds on sensor reheat and it was barely warm so I think warming it up at a lower power probably will yield a better result. However, the piece of pizza was in there for a minute and 10 seconds before it started a countdown of 33 seconds. I took it out after the minute and 10 seconds and that was the case where it was exploding and popping all over the inside of the microwave. Maybe if I tried a full dinner, I would have better results and that's why I am reserving my judgment but so far I am disappointed because with my old microwave it worked perfectly.I wanted a white microwave since my others things are white but the choices are very limited. I must say the black stainless steel is very handsome, but it does show fingerprints and greasy smudges very easily on the outside. (See photo).Another feature I like about this microwave is the favorites button. Every morning I have oatmeal and I cook it for 5 minutes at 50% power. Setting that as a favorite, all I have to do is hit favorite and start and it remembers my settings. I think you can do up to three favorites.It has a soften/melt feature which I have not tried yet.I don't know if I want the hassle of returning it but I want to keep trying. Considering the fact that the sensor reheat was my priority and so far I'm not too thrilled with it, I'm considering trying a different one.The other thing I don't like about it which some people might like is that the beep is very quiet. I am hard of hearing and with my old microwave I could only hear it beep when I was in the kitchen. With this microwave I can barely hear the beeps when I'm standing right in front of it pressing the buttons. However I rely on hearing the microwave motor turn off to know when it's done as I did with my old microwave when I was in the next room. Also, the display clock is not very bright. Again for some people this is probably a positive. I am working from home from my dining room and I use it to check the time and sometimes it's too hard to see because it's not very bright."
"I read all the reviews and despite my concern over the negative ones (about the door not lining up) I went with the crowd and ordered one, against my better judgement. Every time I've ordered anything other than a Sharp Carousel microwave I have been disappointed and gone back to one. I had just given away my going-strong 15 year-old 1.4cf 1100w Sharp Carousel to a friend who just bought a home, thinking to upgrade. The only thing wrong with it were a few spots of rust on the inside top (because I never wiped moisture out after using it). I had never used all the fancy functions, just selected time and hit start. I even kept it plugged in to a power strip, turning it off after every use so it wouldn't continue using electricity. It will last her many years longer, especially if she touches up the minor rust spots. The Toshiba looked cheap out of the box. The ad says ""Stainless Steel"" (which is what the entire outside cabinet of my Sharp was), but what that means here is a plastic-like brushed stainless steel FRONT FACE, but the rest of the casing is painted black. The ad photos DON'T show this. So much for a countertop 'stainless steel' model, if you want it to look stainless all around. Also, as reported by other reviewers, the door was crooked (see photo). It couldn't be adjusted. This bothered me a lot, and added to the feeling of cheapness, because it made me question the door seal. The cord is grey, when IMO it should be black to match the casing. In addition, it made a variety of noises before starting to work. It didn't FEEL like a quality product, both inside and out. It also didn't match my entirely stainless steel large Oster toaster oven. Maybe others will read the instructions to use the sensor cooking etc., but after receiving it, I realized I just wanted a simple quality-made (Sharp) microwave. The no-beep function I thought would be great was pointless, because I would have to re-set that every time I turned it on and off with the power strip (duh!). So I returned the Toshiba and purchased a Sharp R-21LCFS medium-duty commercial microwave, all stainless steel INSIDE and out, no turntable, with single-dial operation (zero buttons). All it does is 6 minutes max at 100% power, but I can add time as long as needed. It's beautiful (to me), quality-made, functional, easy to clean, spacious, and, with less electronic bells and whistles should last longer, since it's made for commercial use (truck stops, convenience stores, restaurants, etc.). It cost a lot more ($285 on Amazon, but I paid $325 locally). Let that be a lesson (to me) for following the crowd against my better judgment, lol. The Sharp Carousel I just gave away, still going strong after 15 years, is still sold for the same price as this Toshiba. I'm sure this one has and will suit many people just fine. It's a matter of taste and prior experience. I should have stuck with what has always worked for me. I wish you all the best with your purchase."
"For us, this microwave does what we need. The size is perfect for the space we have, has good power (1250w) for basic warming/reheating and matches our other appliances well enough. Some may not like the ""limited"" functionality but we really don't cook with a microwave.Now, the not so good & why the 3 stars... one of the reasons I wanted to review this after such a short period of ownership was that after plugging the microwave in, I was lifting it onto the shelf & bumped the back right side leg on the right side on the shelf. There were some sparks and the breaker kicked out.  I'm guessing the bump caused a flex in the electrical path and a brief short. We reset the breaker and the microwave worked as expected. Rather than hassle with a return right away, I decided to wait until the last possible moment to return it, if that is our decision. This review is really just an effort to document what happened should we need to return.This review will be updated in about 30 days."
"This is the number one best seller on Amazon's list so I thought I made a good choice.This is also the office's second purchase of this microwave. The first one lasted a couple years.The second one (this purchase) lasted a year then the turntable stopped rotating, even though you could still hear it's motor. Then 3 months later the microwave stopped working all together. It does get a lot of use (approx. 15-20x a day), but I would still think it would last longer than 16 months.Sorry Toshiba.....we may try another manufacturer on our 3rd purchase."
"Purchased November 2022. Loved the microwave up until October 2024. After not even two years, it became very noisy and less powerful. My next microwave will be purchased from Costco with a warranty."
"Overall I‚Äôve been happy, but about year into owning it, it spontaneously turns on and microwaves. If you stored your metal air fryer parts in there, you get spark fest like crazy."
"Sadly, this only lasted two years and then it just died one day while using the air fryer function."
"Pros:Roomy, heats wellCons:Heavy, malfunctioned half a year ago where it also starts microwaving when you open the door, and now after 2.5 years it stopped working completely. Wish it lasts longer, not worth the money if it doesn't last this long.For comparison, I also bought a mini-microwave that I personally use and it still works perfectly."
"Power cycle come on  & off without notice, reducing power. Have to unplug & replug in constantly ."
I purchased this oven February 2024 and it will only cook on high maybe 50% of the time.
"The carousel makes a grinding noise no matter how clean it is. More often than not, it will cook at 80% rather than full power and resetting it or setting it at its highest level doesn't have any effect. I should've kept my 10-year-old off-brand microwave, it worked better."
"Been using for couple of years now. I have to view the book dam near every time. Does it work yes, but I have to check the book. Setting the dam clock is a chore, that‚Äôs after following all the instructions.I had a sharp microwave that what far easier to use, and never had to review the book after the first few times. This is a purchase I regret."
"To start, for the most part I use my microwave to steam frozen vegetables. Probably 3-5 bags a week, and they're always the same brand and size so that is not a factor. I had another 1100W unit that I used many times a week for years and years and it finally died on me. I went and got this one because a black unit with a handle is a must. It looks sharps and it started out working great, but I began to notice that every now and then my food would come out undercooked randomly. I wrote it off at a fluke but then it began to happen more and more frequently. I then noticed that the power level was dropping while heating food. I looked online and people were saying that during time cook, the humidity sensor automatically drops the power level while cooking if it senses enough moisture. This is a huge issue if you're steaming vegetables or heating up any other food with a lot of moisture. I wish it was as easy as just adding more time but the same food takes different times depending on whatever the microwave feels like in that moment. For example if I was cooking 3 of the same bags of veggies, the first would come out under cooked at 6 minutes, so I'd give it another minute, the second would be perfect at 6 minutes, and the third would be undercooked after 6, and 7 minutes and ends up needing 8. There is no rhyme or reason and it's driving me crazy after just 3 weeks of ownership! It is an nice looking unit and is even quieter while running than my last one but unfortunately for me I have to send it back and get something different"
This Toshiba microwave I thought served me well for over four years and then the paint started peeling up on the inside. Maybe foolishly I‚Äôve been continuing to use it but now I‚Äôm worried. I will never buy any microwave that has paint on the inside after this experience
"Awesome microwave listed as having a backlit panel which was my ONLY request for a new countertop microwave. Well, ordered, paid for it, waited for it, got it, tried it and OH NO! No light to see the number pad, extremely hard to see it......My search specifically read countertop microwave with backlit pad....Question: There are LED lights just about anywhere now. Why a microwave does not have some?"
Worked well for almost exactly two years. Then failed. Open the door and the microwave turns ON. I'm an engineer. It's obviously a door/interlock issue. But it's not safe. I don't trust it around my other family members.These things are basically becoming disposable anyway.
"We had this for almost 3 full years and it was working great I really loved it but it gave out on us out of nowhere on Monday and idk if it‚Äôs worth the fix. Hoping there‚Äôs a wire issue as the thing is it wasn‚Äôt heating in any mode. I loved it up until this day it really saved us a lot of time, money, and space that we didn‚Äôt have for an air fryer, toaster, and microwave"
"I purchased this microwave to replace a GE unit that was manufactured in 2005.  That old unit consumed 1550W of power, but only delivered about 1100W to the food.  The Toshiba unit uses 1350W, but delivers 1250W, so it is able to cook faster using less electricity than the old GE unit.  The new microwave also uses inverter technology, so it heats more consistently, with fewer hot spots.  I noticed that when I partially defrosted a bag of frozen peas that had turned into a big block of ice.  It was able to break up the ice without cooking any of the peas.  Other good points about the Toshiba microwave: when you place the turntable platter into the microwave, it aligns extremely easily, unlike the old GE unit.  Also, the new microwave is much lighter in weight.  However, since there is less steel in the structure, my horseshoe magnet is not strong enough to hold up my oven mitts anymore.  Fortunately, I have another, stronger, magnet.With all that said, I am very disappointed with the Toshiba microwave, because it so much less usable than my old GE unit.  It is really just a matter of the programming of the internal processor, so I find it inexplicable.  Here are some of the things I found:1. It has a timer, but you can't cook and use the timer at the same time.  This is a big deal for me!2. From the initial state, if you press either ""1"", ""2"", or ""3"", the machine turns on instantly for that number of minutes.  But why didn't they offer the feature for ""4"", ""5"", and ""6"", too?3. There is a button labeled ""Frz. Veg"".  I would assume that it stands for ""Frozen Vegetables"".  However, if you press the button, the display says ""FRESH VEGGIES"".  There is no setting for frozen vegetables.4. When cooking is complete the alarm beeps five times.  Even if you open the door immediately, it still beeps five times.  (There is a way to completely turn off all beeps, however.)  My preference would be for alarm beeps that stop if I open the door.5. When you set the clock (which is 12 hours, with no AM or PM indication, which doesn't bother me) and the time is earlier than 10:00, you have to enter an initial zero.  For ""5:12 PM"", you have to enter ""0512"".  Sure, it's just one extra button press, but why?6. The manual comes in English/Spanish, but the English is not a good translation.  The back cover of the paper manual has the printing ""#DetailsMatter"" on it, which I find somewhat ironic."
"I decided to pay $40 more for the 1100 watt sensor microwave instead of the $99 900 watt. Sorry I did. I knew it would be bigger, but I thought it would be worth taking up the space. It came the same day I ordered it, a good surprise. I was able to unpack and get it on the counter even though I'm in my 70s. Good so far. I put an Amy's frozen meal in, set it to Sensor frozen entree and was disappointed that it wasn't cooked through. With my old Amazon Alexa 700 microwave, I added a minute or two to the cook time, and that generally worked. I loved the Alexa voice control, but it seemed to be taking longer and longer to cook. I was also a little tired of having to calculate everything, so that's why I decided to buy this bigger and supposedly better one. I didn't buy the voice control with Alexa on this Toshiba after reading all the complaints. I guess I just won't use the Sensor buttons, which is the real reason I bought this. Maybe I'll figure it out, but my first impression is disappointment. If I had it to do over again, I'd buy the $99 one that my son has. I'm sure this a perfectly good microwave, but I really just paid extra for the wattage and not the sensor cook. I hope I figure out what I'm doing wrong, but it's too much trouble to return something this big."
"Microwave lasted about 3.5 years. Like another customer stated, the turntable continues to rotate when the door is open..."
Though it's working it doesn't seem to run smoothly and is average made like grade C.
"I‚Äôm 73 and my husband is 86 so it‚Äôs a big deal to pull out the fridge, unplug the old heavy microwave and then put the new one in.I should have known there would be problems when ups delivered it yesterday.  The box was upside down because the original bottom was torn open and banged up.  The styrofoam on top and bottom was broken up too.  The microwave itself looked ok so we continued on.  There was no manual with it either but I can find that online so it wasn‚Äôt a big deal.After getting it placed, I tried to set the clock but it didn‚Äôt want to set.  It was then that I found that the bottom half of the control panel was loose and had come away from the unit and was just hanging.I finally got the clock set after a half hour.  I was determined.  So I went to heat a cup of tea and I could hear the timer switch on but the turntable wouldn‚Äôt move.I called Toshiba and was immediately connected to a pleasant person.  I explained the situation and she said to send it back to Amazon.TG the return system is seamless.  I opted to have ups pick it up for free but they only give you one chance to have it ready and it‚Äôs next day pickup so we had to get it done today.  We used gorilla tape to put the box back together.On the plus side, the microwave looked nice in my kitchen for the hour it lived there.We are both exhausted and I had to listen to the husband, wah wah wah.At least our old one still works.  It‚Äôs a sharp carousel, twenty years old and still going.I will never order something this big online again.  If I can‚Äôt carry it out myself from a nearby big box store, I won‚Äôt buy it.That‚Äôs my tale of woe."
"I bought this microwave because of the great reviews. Well I got it today, the box was so huge it took 2 people to get it opened.It was finally in the kitchen.  I can say the handle is razor sharp and you need to be careful not to cut yourself.  The LED lights are not very bright at all. The legs are not adjustable so something needs to be put under so it doesn‚Äôt wobble. I haven‚Äôt gotten as far as using it. I‚Äôm just debating on returning it solely because of the lights not bright enough. I‚Äôll have to arrange for a pickup."
"We‚Äôve had this nearly 18 months and still can‚Äôt put it to full use because the manual explains so little about how to use it. The sparse instructions provided were apparently written by an ESL student. What‚Äôs worse is it now suddenly fires up without any human input. It just starts cooking nothing for no reason. Wondering how often this happens when we‚Äôre asleep or not at home. Strangest thing, considering how many microwave ovens we‚Äôve owned since the 1970s. None that we know of just start up at random like this one does. And the only way to stop it is to unplug it and leave it unplugged. So now it‚Äôs just a bulky box taking up a lot of space on the kitchen counter until we can find a way to fix the issue. Way it is now seems like we might need an exorcist. (I mean, I'm fine with poltergeists in the kitchen as long as they don't present a fire hazard.) Brief online search revealed that other owners of this device are having similar issues and have yet to find a solution."
Nice microwave for all areas. You can use it like a giant microwave. It has all the qualities of the larger microwaves.I would recommend this item.
"The microwave works fine so far for heating, making popcorn, and cooking. My complaint is the noise that it makes. The turntable makes a lot of noise when microwaving. I took off the plate and the round ring with the wheels, thinking that they were misaligned. When I put them back, it made no difference at all. The noise was still there. Sometimes the noise is very loud and sounds like the turntable has difficulty moving. But when I look in, it looks like it is freely moving. I am not sure what to do about it, so I gave it a rating of three."
"I don‚Äôt understand the ‚Äúbest seller‚Äù badge and great reviews. The 35-year-old GE microwave that this one replaced worked better than this one. Where do I start?1) For routine cooking or reheating, 1100 watts of power is just too much. Everything I cook spits and spatters and explodes, regardless of the ‚Äúpower level‚Äù setting (which of course doesn‚Äôt change the true power level at all, only the duty cycle). Yes, even on low (PL1).2) Then there‚Äôs the firmware on this thing. Some button functions respond to presses, some to releases, make for inconsistent and confusing program input.3) You can‚Äôt change the power level while cooking, not even if you pause it. You have to cancel, losing your current program, and start over!4) The LED lighting is mediocre at best and has an awful cool-white color temperature. Where‚Äôs the hatch to replace the light bulb with a brighter warm-white one? ‚Äî There isn‚Äôt one.5) The power plug is not flat, but sticks straight out from the wall, forcing you to cobble up a right-angle adapter or waste at least two inches of valuable countertop space at the rear if your outlet is directly behind the unit.6) The control panel is laid out with least-used functions at the top and most-often-used functions at the bottom (where they are harder to see). The numeric buttons are cramped, making it easy to hit the wrong one. Only two buttons are color-coded.7) The four feet are ridiculously tiny. Small surface area means the unit will slide around on your counter with only minimal force.8) The kitchen timer function can‚Äôt be used as one part of a multi-part program. So if you want to delay start by 15 minutes then cook for 5, well you can‚Äôt.Mine arrived with the shipping label on the BOTTOM of the box (thanks Amazon), so the box was likely upside down most of the time in transit. This explains why the turntable parts were rolling around loose inside the cooking cavity and all of the styrofoam cushioning was crushed.But hey, it *looks* nice."
Like pull handle. Seems a bit slower to heat up at full power than similar wattage units.
"Overall this microwave does the trick and looks nice.  However it is in an office setting and the door is very loud, sounds hollow and is distracting."
"the handle came with a tiny dent that cracked further.  While waiting for a replacement ,I tried the`Air Fry option.  I followed directions EXACTLY for different distance to heat.  It is not TWO PIECES as shown. The bake dish does not  fit between the prongs of the one piece in the low position.  I did not want to bend the prongs outward for it to fit.  OK, so got it cooking for about 5 minutes and all of a sudden there was a flash of blue light across the bottom like an electric arc.  WOW time to turn this off.  Re-ordered and received it but am hesitant as that may be a problem with all of them.  It just seems to need more time to correct language,. photo and maybe electrical problems.  But it could be so great.  Do I give the new one a second chance but ""what if'?"
"This was a decent microwave that was easy to use. However it stopped working ... kept going even when door was open- after only two years. We liked it, so we had bought a second one for another house just before this one conked out. Hope that one gives us our moneys worth!  Disappointing."
"This is our second Toshiba microwave. It's very similar in looks, size and shape as our previous model. I'm unhappy with the key pad. To set the power level you must first set the cook time. The power level button does not work with the one touch start buttons. So, to manually use this press the cook time then the power level non-buttons. With the one touch button pressed, the microwave running. Push the power non-button and PL10 (power level 10) shows on the screen. Baffling...can't figure out why.It's more like a break room or dorm microwave than a kitchen microwave. I liked our old Toshiba, but not this one. I wouldn't buy it again."
Works OKAY ... Directions really not clear ... just an Average Microwave. Guess it's worth the  $$$
"Considering the cost of this oven, I‚Äôm not impressed overall.  I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt buy an oven with a push button door opener.  You have to almost jerk it to open.  The door is slightly misaligned with the doorframe which is surprising considering the cost and brand.  And, I‚Äôm still getting some cold spots in heated frozen food.  I‚Äôm concerned that the wattage is overstated.  Also, the keypad doesn‚Äôt always respond easily, which I find annoying.  Overall, I don‚Äôt recommend this oven.  I think there are better ones available at a lesser price.  I should have shopped at Walmart."
I bought this based on the high ratings in reviews. My last microwave was a GE 950 watts. This Toshiba is noticeably noisy and doesn't heat as well as my GE. Maybe my opinion will change with further use but it's a disappointment.
"I love this microwave...that is, until now. Purchased in Dec. 2017 so it's not quite  2 1/2 yrs old. It's always been easy to use. 1100 watts is more than enough for my uses. Love the defrost features & Love the black stainless. However, in the last month or so I've noticed some weird malfunctions happening. I guess maybe I sometimes press the buttons too fast, which has caused the unit to just stop. Display goes out...everything stops. Have to unplug & plug in again & I guess the machine resets. Last week, I set the unit for 30 sec. When it beeped, I opened the door to remove the cup of tea & it started up again, turntable spinning and all...WITH THE DOOR OPEN!  I closed the door & reopened it...machine started up again!! So I unplugged it..waited a few minutes & plugged it back in. Problem solved. Today, I used it again to warm up some tea. After the beeping stopped, I opened the door, and again, the unit went on, turntable spinning around again! I don't think a running microwave with the door open is a very safe thing (ya think?). So one last time, I unplugged the unit, waited & plugged it in again. Problem still exists. A running microwave with an open door. So it runs, stops at the appropriate time, (30 sec., 1 min, etc.) But starts up again when I open the door. NOT GOOD!I think the machine should have lasted much longer than 2 1/2 yrs! I would love to reorder it, but am afraid to do so for obvious reasons. NEVER HEARD OF THIS HAPPENING BEFORE!! Will see if Toshiba has an upgraded model. Just be on the look-out, 'cause it's very dangerous to be exposed to microwaves!!UPDATE: Microwave was not actually working when the door was open. Only the turntable spun. So that's good. It's now April 2021 and it finally just stopped working. Call me stupid, but I bought another unit. (2nd in 3+ years) I'm hoping that perhaps the first one was a lemon. The Electrical was malfunctioning constantly. Like others' complaints, the Power would change to 8 when in regular mode all by itself; the turntable spun around when the door was open. Then it worked one day & not the next - one hour...not the next. It finally died. But prior to all those troubles, I loved the microwave. It worked well for 2 years & I loved it's features. This new one has the ""beep"" silencing feature, which i great!Now, I, for one believe a microwave isn't a ""throw away"" item. It should definitely last more than 3 years. This unit seems to be more cheaply made than the last. The sound the doors makes when opening & closing is like a cheaper model car...sounds tinny. But I can say that in the last 24 hours, it's worked perfectly. That's not saying much! Will update a 3rd time when & if problems arise. And if they do, rest assured, Toshiba will be hearing from me & will have lost another customer. Fingers crossed!!"
Works as advertised
This is a really nice microwave but the door handle arrived dented. The box was in perfect shape so it had to have been sent out like that from the factory. It also takes while to preheat for the air fry option.
"My first microwave (MW) was an Amana Radarange with powershift and touch panel.  I bought it in 1974 and it ran for 30 years.My second MW was a top-rated Sears Kenmore which ran for 17 years, until the light burned out.  Turns out you can't just replace a bulb.  You have to take the whole thing apart and use a special bulb with an attached bracket.  I tried to keep using it, but you really need to see what's going on inside.  It was a good run anyway.My third MW was a ""top-rated"" Panasonic.  It ran for 6 months until its light burned out.  Same bulb issue.Then, a bit more than 2 months ago, I bought this one, also ""top-rated"" according to several reviews.  Right out of the box, the first issue was an insensitive touch panel.  If you're accustomed to going tap-tap-tap-start, with this one, you must go taaaap-taaaap-taaaap-start.  And yes, I removed the protective covering.The second problem started when I tried the beeper mute function.  Turns out, it also mutes the timer beeps, so I turned the mute off.  The cooking beeps returned, but the timer beeps did not.  So now I have a MW oven with a useless, silent timer.  On a hunch, I tried turning mute on again, then off.  The timer beeps worked one time, then silent again from then on.And guess what, this one has that same kind of light bulb.I'm not sure how to characterize the latest issue.  Two or three times a week, I'll set it up as usual, but when I hit 'Start,"" the screen goes blank, no cooking happens, and I get a continuous beep tone that lasts a good 30 seconds.  Now the clock will have been reset to zeroes.  I don't know what I'm doing to make this happen, if anything.  What this is telling me, however, is this oven is probably not long for this world.Finally, this MW has a feature that I have found to be more of a hassle than useful.  My muscle memory is enter cook time, enter power level, hit start.  With this one, if you start with any number from 1 to 6, you automatically get that many full minutes at 100% power.  After two months, I'm still trying to get used to that.  It would be nice if that feature could be ""muted.""On the plus side, this Toshiba is, by far, the quietest MW oven I've used.  While it's cooking, I can still hear the TV in the next room.Not long ago, Japanese products set the world standard for quality, design and especially, reliability.  It turns out this Toshiba microwave was actually made in China,  Apparently, they too, have just become another Chinese emporium.UPDATE September, 2023:The latest failure is the power level.  it no longer delivers the 100% power level.  No matter how I set it or what I dial in, the most I can get is 80%.  I can hear it modulating and the display indicates 80%, even after dialing in 10.  Still no tones with the timer, and I have completely given up on setting the clock.  At least the light is still working, but I just cannot give it more than one star now.  Sorry Toshiba, but the one I got is a complete failure."
"Lasted 5 years, 6 months, and began making a grinding noise 2 years ago. Not bad when you divide the price by years, but would have been nice if it lasted longer."
"Update June 12 2022.  It seems i was right to be concerned about engineering issues. I've used the microwave for around a month now, and the door has become a bit loose.  I've been using micro's for 40 years and this is the first one where the door does not close tightly (anymore). The door, when closed, rattles and is not tight to the body.  I assume its still safe to use it and i will continue to do so but eventually its going into one of my furnished rentals and i will look for a different brand.  Also, this is the first microwave that causes garlic to catch on fire even if using a very low power level.  I sometimes heat garlic for 11 seconds on very low. Here is the original review: I hope the door being off kilter is not a sign of other engineering problems (see photo) but i have to say this Toshiba microwave is just okay.  I was waffling between 3 stars and 4 and would give 3.5 if that was an option.  I have had furnished rentals for decades and have experience with many microwaves that are around half the cost of this one and this time i was buying one for myself so i went with an upgrade.  It has some features not found in the cheaper tier of nukes but some things don't even work as well as in the cheaper models. For example, if i use the sensor-cook to cook potato or potatoes, i have to add extra time at the end and even still, the taters seem to come out undercooked.  (is this due to altitude of over 6,000 ft?) Also, the pre-programmed defrost options seems excessive with a small item, the sensor decides to do 3 minutes when in fact only 30 to 60 seconds would be required. With additional features compared to what i'm used to, i've had to consult the instruction book but the book clearly explains how and what to do for each feature i've looked at.  All in all, its okay for the price and i'm keeping it but the cheaper microwaves are simpler and might be easier for simple things like potatoes, small defrost items, reheating small portions, etc"
"I don't mean to sound like a jerk but, in all seriousness, this is the worst microwave I have ever owned. And that's coming from someone who bought his first microwave in the mid-1970's.It's an attractive unit and seems well-built, but the first thing I noticed is that it's loud... really loud. And it's slow ‚Äî as in it takes twice as long as my previous microwave. My previous unit might have been 1100 watts, but this one is more than 10% slower. And even with the extra time it takes, the food heats unevenly, so there are some hot spots and cold spots in the same dish.I blame myself for thinking it made sense to buy a microwave/convection combo. When a manual has to include a 9-row, 5-column matrix to show which items can be used inside the oven at which times, you know it's a bad idea. Obviously, someone will learn over time or maybe even intuit it at the outset, but how about color-coding the accessories? Blue dot for microwave, red for oven, etc. Multiple dots for accessories that can  survive more than one cooking mode.The controls are needlessly confusing to understand. I like the ability to turn off the beeps, but I don't like having 30-seconds as the shortest cooking time. Perhaps there's some technique I don't know about. You might think you could turn the big dial to set the precise number of seconds or minutes, but you'd be wrong, as was I. Turning the dial goes through automatic time presets for various foods, but I can't understand how anyone would find that convenient because you can't see what items it's talking about. Instead, you see the letter ""A"" followed by a number. Perhaps it's easier to dial let's say ""A5"" for a particular item, but whatever time you save doing that is more than offset by having to look up what ""A5"" is in the manual. If turning the dial caused the readout to display the name of the food shortcuts, that would make sense. Or if Toshiba had included a plastic-coated card or a sticker listing the foods, that would even help. ""Honey, what's for dinner?"" ""Oh, I'm just going to heat up some A5 and maybe a little A2."" I wanted to make a joke about using ""A1"" for steak, but that's not one of the foods listed.Lack of common sense isn't unique to Toshiba. A while back, one of my microwaves displayed ""Enjoy your meal"" when the time was up. That same microwave had a dedicated ""Popcorn"" button which I suppose Toshiba would have labeled A-something. When the popcorn was ready, the microwave displayed ""Enjoy your meal,"" and I would consistently marvel at the manufacturer taking the time to add a Popcorn button but not bothering to change ""meal"" to ""snack"".There are some logical niceties. For instance, when a cycle is complete, the turntable will return to its starting location so any handle is easily reachable where you had left it. The exceptionally annoying beep can be permanently silenced. And when the door is left open, which I often do to let food odors dissipate, the light automatically goes off after a reasonable delay instead of remaining on.Originally, I purchased the microwave for an AirBnb, but once I realized the hassle of switching between microwave and convection setups, and imagined my guests needing to study the manual before arriving, I decided to buy a new Sharp microwave (which requires substantially less clearance around the oven) and a Zojirushi toaster oven for my rental. I then bit the bullet and tried using the Toshiba in my kitchen, but now I'm looking to give it away.Obviously there are some people who really like this microwave, but I am certainly not one of them. One star for what appears to be good build quality (if we omit the noisy operation), and another star for it not catching on fire."
"Our old microwave/convection oven was a Daewoo. About 20 years old. It was promoted as a 1.0 cu ft 1,000 watt microwave. After two decades, we figured it would give up the ghost, but it just kept working. We finally decided to give the old one to my brother and buy a new one for ourselves.We wanted something a bit more powerful, and with a larger interior. That led us to this microwave, which boasted 1,100 watts and a 1.2 cu ft interior. I paid close attention to the dimensions that were supplied, as we definitely didn't want one with a larger footprint than our old one, but a larger interior.My surprise came when I opened the door of the microwave for the first time, and I could see that the interior didn't seem as large as I thought it would be in comparison to our old one, which we had sitting right next to the new Toshiba. I measured the interior of the Toshiba, and compared those measurements with those in the product listing here on Amazon. They all matched.But here's the thing: If you do the math using the interior dimensions, it doesn't equal 1.2 cu ft.  Rather, it ends up being 1.078 cu ft. Seriously. Give it a go:13.07 x 15 x 9.5 inchesI spent several hours spread across a few days trying to figure out what I was missing. I asked the question in several places. I called Toshiba. I messaged them on Facebook and chatted with them on their website. It was crazy. No one could explain to me why a microwave with these interior dimensions could be sold as a 1.2 cu ft microwave. But the worst thing was that they obviously didn't care one little bit.It's irksome, but even more irksome that the company was evasive and dismissive about it.So... Putting THAT aside, I've had a while to get to know this unit. I love the way it looks. It's definitely more powerful/faster than our old one. The presets are overkill, so far; ""Soften Butter"" was in the process of flat out melting the stick when I turned away just for a second. We'll figure it out, I'm sure. It takes a while to adapt to a new version of anything.On the downside, it doesn't feel nearly as robust as our other microwave, and it makes grinding and rattling noises when it's running. It feels and sounds ""tinny"" or flimsy when you open and close the door. That said, it is one of few remaining makes/models with a handle you pull -- yay! -- and not a button you press to open the door. And that is a plus, in our book.I guess the bottom line is ""They just don't make 'em like they used to"". It will get the job done, I think, but I seriously doubt it will last 20 years.UPDATE 10/21/2022: The grinding and squealing from the turntable is unbearable and frankly it sounds dangerous to operate. I'm still within the return window, but we have had this for 8 months, and the box is long gone."
"I would love to write a positive review, but Toshiba made that impossible. I like to use something awhile before giving it a review, and I'm glad I waited with this item, because wow. After only two years of regular use, after my food was warmed up and the unit stopped, I opened the door to retrieve my food, and the unit turned back on, the turntable turning - with the door open (!!!) This is both alarming and dangerous. I tried unplugging to reset, to no avail.I called Toshiba, hoping that they would offer some sort of support after such an experience. Yes I know, silly me for expecting integrity and pride in manufacturing - and a desire to keep their customers. The CS person I initially spoke with admitted that it should not be doing that, explaining that it was a defective model, but out of warranty, so I'm SOL. This is unacceptable to me at these prices, so I asked to speak to a supervisor, who just repeated the same words. I asked her to recommend a trusted repair shop, as I am not someone with a disposable mentality and she wouldn't help, stating that it's a throw-away and, again, that I'm SOL! ""Sorry for your inconvenience,"" was all I got.Okay, so Toshiba isn't interested in supporting and maintaining their customer base. Got it. Moving forward, they no longer have me as one. I'm sure it matters little to them, since we're all so used to the ease of simply adding things to a landfill and replacing instead of repairing, that we rarely complain to manufacturers for shoddy products.  I'm just not content with that anymore and not entirely sure why anyone else would be, either.So, if you're still reading, I'll give you my take on the unit's performance prior to its demise. In a word, meh. The sensor feature never really worked right. I found some work-arounds, such as when baking a potato using the sensor cook feature: once the sensor has finally figured things out and has switched to displaying the remaining cooking time, pausing it and flipping the potato over helped it to cook more evenly. Otherwise, the bottom remains uncooked. That worked a majority of the time, but too often, I would end up with a still-undercooked potato that I had to pop back in for a minute or two after cutting it open. On other occasions, what emerged was a sad, shriveled prune-looking & overcooked former potato that would never reach its full potential. Very sad. Not even sure if by that point it would make useful compost, but I tried anyway. I also found that I had to add time to nearly everything I cooked, as it just didn't seem to work well otherwise.I should have returned the unit from the outset, but something usually has to misbehave far worse than that before I reject it entirely. Upon introspection, this is unfortunately true in other areas of my life...which tells me it's time for some deep rumination..."
"This is my second one.  The first lasted 4 years.  I gave one star for same day delivery. One star because it isworking somewhat. I took away the other stars because (1) the smell.  Don't know what it is but I took out of the box and wiped down, but the smell permeates the kitchen still (2) the  instruction manual looks as though it has been wet at one time. It smells like the microwave, which makes me worry about mold (3) performance. The turntable is very slow when it turns. Hope it's not on its last legs.  Finally, it was $129 when I bought it on Wed. but was reduced to $109 when I looked it up today, 2 days later."
"The microwave worked well for three years before becoming defective. I had some cheap Chinese-brand microwave for around ten years. Because we didn't take care of it, the interior was deteriorated. With new habits, we got this Toshiba microwave because it was highly recommended. With new habits, we took care of this microwave like a member of the family.Just three years later, the microwave began running automatically upon opening the door. Simply opening the door causes the plate to spin with the fans running on its own, suggesting that the microwave is running and shooting out radiation. We don't feel safe using the microwave anymore. We contacted Toshiba, and they refused to do anything about it because it is past warranty. It's insane that a cheap-brand microwave lasted 10 years (and was still functional), but a Toshiba microwave that costs $120 only lasts 3 years before becoming defective. We'll be sticking with cheap $50-$80 microwaves instead of expensive ones from named brands after this."
"I was quite happy with this microwave at first, because it heats food quickly and is easy to use. After a couple years I started having an intermittent problem where sometimes the microwave would not turn off after the timer went off. It would keep emitting microwaves (only when the door is closed, thankfully) until I unplugged it. This is concerning so I'm going to buy a different one."
"The microwave worked fine for the first two years, and the quality seemed reasonable. However, it started to self-start after that time, turning on by itself without anyone near it. This is likely due to an issue with either the dome buttons on the front panel or a problem with the AC power line filtering. I believe a home appliance should not fail in a way that creates a safety hazard within just two years.Unfortunately, since the device is out of warranty, Toshiba will do nothing to fix it. They offered to repair it out of pocket, but the cost would likely be more than buying a new microwave. It's ridiculous that this failure mode is treated the same as other issues that might be expected after two years. This problem makes the entire device unsafe to use and forces me to discard it.It's also important to note that Toshiba microwaves, and other Toshiba home appliances, are not actually made by Toshiba. They are manufactured by Midea, a Chinese company that owns the brand name. Midea's quality standards and customer care may not match the expectations typically associated with the Toshiba name. Consider this a warning."
"When my last microwave broke, I suddenly became aware of how many things I used it for!I needed to replace it‚Ä¶ and fast.So I bought this lil guy with visions of returning to my glory days of delicious instant oatmeal, freshly popped popcorn, and appropriately reheated leftovers.What I didn‚Äôt realize is that this microwave comes with something more‚Ä¶ADVENTURE!Gone are the days where I simply put the food in, select the appropriate time and return to find my food ready to eat. Now I‚Äôm greeted with a mystery every time I use it. Will my popcorn be inexplicably scorched and make my entire kitchen smell or will it be half popped, leaving me lots of kernels for my favorite arts and crafts? Who knows!! Not me.What. A. Rush.It‚Äôs been 2 minutes and my instant oatmeal is supposed to be done. I excitedly check it‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs lukewarm water with little gross oats at the bottom‚Ä¶Next time I try the same thing and come back after 2 minutes‚Ä¶ great news! The oatmeal has boiled over and become great friends with the little glass plate inside‚Ä¶ oozing down the sides of the bowl. Fantastic! Hate when I don‚Äôt have to worry about my hands getting covered in scorching hot oat globs just to pull my breakfast out.Simply put, this microwave has reintroduced the magic of the unknown into my life. I truly never know what‚Äôs going to happen when I cook something inside of it.It‚Äôs incredible they were able to keep the price down considering the fact that they have to employ tiny little elves inside of it to decide, randomly, which leftovers they‚Äôre going to leave cold and which they‚Äôre going to turn into the hottest things this side of the sun.Spend the extra 50 bucks and get a different one."
So so. Doesn‚Äôt work great. Have to cook higher temps and longer than suggested time. Decided to sell.
"I really wanted to give this Toshiba microwave oven an excellent review, however I cannot. There are too many steps such as having to press kitchen timer, then the time with a zero on front of it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶THEN you have to press the power level‚Ä¶.again with a zero in front of it. If you choose to use the preset numbered levels, they only cook the outside of the food, the inside stays cold. The buttons are hard to read except for the white on one and the red power off one. It takes waaaaayyyy to long to cook dishes that I used to make in my previous microwave oven of a different brand. I‚Äôm extremely unimpressed with this one."
"I'm often confused by Amazon reviews, because it seems that the items that get the most positive reviews get them because they were the cheapest item available, not necessarily the best. And so it goes with this Toshiba microwave. My previous, 10 yr old Panasonic died suddenly and I needed a replacement. The Toshiba got rave reviews and it was the cheapest Black Friday offering.It's really just a mediocre microwave with a terrible user experience. How did reviewers miss this? ""Buttons"" aren't very touch sensitive, they're laid out in a seemingly random manner, and buttons like ""Cook Time"" are tiny and squeezed in above the Stop/Cancel button and I need to put on my glasses to even read the type. I get the feeling that this was designed for the Asian market and the English text was crammed into a space where it doesn't really fit, or else this was ""designed"" by engineers who don't care about the user at all.Still deciding whether or not to return/exchange this for something better. So, far, I'm not impressed with either the performance or the button placement. The only thing positive I can say about it is it is quiet."
"I loved this microwave.  It had features other brands didn't and was economical.  I have used it at least five days each week and until recently was pleased with the cooking power.  Now it has been two years and 2 months and the performance is failing.  It seems to have ""burned out"" in the center of the laser array.  My bacon is cooked on each end, but raw in the middle.  I was accustomed to even cooking for frozen meals, now the center of them is barely warm,  but the edges are too done to keep trying.  Of course it is way out of warranty.  I dread the expense of a new unit,  but needs must."
"REVISED: QUIT TURNING, of course, right after the warranty expired. It's never been great about turning properly, but was fine, until it started groaning, like metal scraping on metal, & died. We've always taken good care of it. I can't express how sick we are of cheap junk. We had each of the past two microwaves for more than 10 years, each.The amount of steam the microwave function produces...apparently on purpose...is making me INSANER!! I'm trying to cook the food, not give it, the interior of the microwave, & the countertop a bath! It drips all over the place when you open the door. SERIOUSLY, it's like it's pulling every ounce of moisture it can get from the air. Not that I don't clean my microwave regularly, but it's way too much to let it air dry, so I have to wipe everything down...every time I use it...including removing the tray & go-around thingy...or the moisture would just sit in there fermenting in extremely unsanitary puddles.The directions are, in part, in very broken English. The timer has been the hardest to figure out...that, & the combo cooking. I guess I'll be investing in some oven safe plastic cookware, because metal {necessary for using the convection function} sparks when the microwave is in use during combo cooking...if I can figure out the directions to get past C1 & on to C2...The broiler appears to be combo, only. I'm unsure what cookware will work, as even oven safe plastic may melt. Although, it's a bit frustrating that the broiler element never seems to heat up enough to quickly broil. I've yet to see it glowing red like a conventional broiler, so it seemingly takes forever. Plus, microwaving can ruin some foods, especially fish & chicken. Bread can get very tough, very quickly. I really don't understand the wisdom in not making it strictly broiling.I'm really looking forward to learning to dehydrate peppers, etc.Some things bake too fast, others take FOREVER! Especially, when air frying. It may be partly my fault for not grasping times for the smaller quantity this oven can handle, vs a full size oven. Sometimes preheat takes forever, others, it doesn't seem to need it or it's far quicker than a conventional oven. Preheating can be MASSIVELY annoying! As soon as you open the door to put the food in, it loses all the heat, starting the preheating process all over again, necessitating opening the door, again, to be able to set the timer. Arrgghh!Sometimes, air fry seems a better choice over baking because it circulates better.Regardless, there's a VERY steep learning curve, made that much worse by the horrendous instructions.I recommend lots of YouTube videos to avoid wasting food.All of the other brands seem prone to shorts & literal fires, so I'm constantly on guard with this one, although it's not mentioned in any of the reviews. It's not fair to judge this one based on those, but I am a little hesitant to leave it dehydrating overnight, unsupervised. It does get VERY hot, so I recommend a silicone mat underneath to protect countertops.To me, heated food always tastes better than microwaved. It's large enough for most casseroles, etc, for a family of four. I like that I don't have to heat up my expensive propane oven. I don't pay for electricity, so it may not be as savvy an investment for others, since it seems to need so much extra time for some things. Again, that may be misconception on my part.Overall, if you don't mind needing a PhD in combo/convection/air fryer/baking/broiler ovens...or your hair in piles on the floor trying to understand these instructions...or purchasing some extra cookware, it's a good investment.SIDE NOTE: This is NOT 1000 watts, as claimed. If you live in an RV, like I do, check the usage for all cooking modes, carefully, to make sure you're not overloading your circuits, potentially causing a fire. Keep in mind, other things, like the refrigerator, are always using some of the total available. This uses 1800, more than 1/2 the 3000 total available in a 30 amp RV {2000 to 2500 max, to be on the safe side}."
"Updated 1/13/23Stopped working after 15 months with an E5 code which means the inverter went out. Have done some checking and this is a common ailment for this unit.Update 1/14/21There is a software design flaw that causes the unit to stop cooking with time left on the timer with longer cook times. It seems to peak at 30 seconds for cook times of 7 minutes or more. Some suggest is stops when the temperature is reached. But not temp is specified, this is a timed cook. For the container I am using 4 cups of water will boil at about 6.5 minutes, varies with tap water temp. If I set the timer to 10 minutes it will start boiling and keep boiling until the timer gets down to 30 seconds. I found out because each day I would add more time and when it was done I would open the door and it was not boiling. Then I looked through the door and saw that it would start boiling at 6.5 minutes. Some suggest it is the cooling function. Fine but cooling is running the fan after the cooking power is shut off. So why stop my cook cycle with 30 seconds left?Previous review:First I give points to any uwave that has a pull to open door vs those funky feeling push button door open models.The variable power level is a great leap in performance vs the older method of switching full power off and on. No more exploding butter here. It is especially evident when defrosting. There may be a bit of corners over browning but nothing like non-inverters.My wife is thrilled that the beeper can be silenced.I really had no expectations for sensor cooking so the fact that it works at all is a surprise. I suspect it to fail in less than a year when cooking fumes leave an accumulation on it. Reheat overcooks a bit. A large potato had to be cooked another 3 minutes. Fresh vegetable way undercooks corn on the cob.Manual says defrost default PL is 3 but it does not seem adjustable.Sometimes COOLING will be displayed after a long hard run but it is inconsistent and I did not see it mentioned in the manual. If it is run on high power for a good while and then the door is opened or the cooking time is cleared the fan will be running but COOLING is not displayed. That will scare you the first time it happens because the unit is rather quiet but then you open the door and the fan is running. Your first thought may be ""Is the magnetron running with the door open?"" At least it would be non-ionizing radiation. So there is some poor software design here.More evidence of poor software is that the kitchen timer cannot be used while cooking. Even cheap uwaves allow this.If you want to change the PL back to 10, be sure to enter 10, not zero like many other uwave ovens. Apparently PL 0really is zero as I ""cooked"" a cup of water for 90 seconds and the temperature did not rise. I suppose it could be used for delayed cooking if it is. Another software bug here. If you open the door before termination PAUSE is displayed. If you push Power it will display the level correctly but it cannot be changed. Don't go half way, either allow it to be changed or refuse to display it while paused. They need to read Miro Samek's book: ""Practical UML Statecharts in C/C++, Second Edition: Event-Driven Programming for Embedded Systems"".( I think it is a lousy title as the discussion of hierarchical state machines is excellent, to heck with UML.)Manual is typical Chinese written by someone who only thinks he knows English. Funny thing is that is uses pounds and ounces for weight but ML for liquid volume.However, despite all my criticisms it is the best uwave I ever bought. There is a higher rated brand but I cannot tolerate push button door opening."
"Seems to be decent except that it seems that if I heat something then open the door minutes later (instead of right after the initial beeps), the unit makes a long, continuous, loud, annoying beeeeeeeeeeeep sound for 3 - 5 seconds.  I've yet to figure out what ""infraction"" it thinks I'm making.  The manual shows no reason for this.  Very frustrating since I bought this and ended up putting it in air conditioned storage for a while and it's, therefore, not returnable or under warranty.  When we buy a simple appliance, wouldn't we rather just use it than write negative reviews and be on the phone with the manufacturer?  What a time vampire this is seeming to be."
Seems a little under powered and takes longer to heat food than other microwaves
The dimensions of actual item are approximately 2 inches shorter than what is stated. We were looking for something to replace one that burned up and this one fit according to description for the 1.2 cubic feet microwave but actual micro is smaller.Keeping it because of price point but disappointed with accuracy of listing.
