I bought two of these with promised stereo connectivity. Sometimes it works most of the time does not. Spent hours online and with India tech support to no avail. Returning them for refund.
This speaker delivered had bluetooth connectivity issues. It is doesn't easily pair with a Macboook and the connection gets lost frequently. I bought the same speaker from another major retailer. That one has no issues.
"Honestly Bose, the fact that you made the 1st version of the Soundlink flex with the 2nd version, so you have to get another one of the new version is the worse, returning this right now. Obsolecense by design to the max"
"Sound was good, but volume was too low"
"Wanted to connect to my TV. Unable to find instructions. Also, no ac adapter included."
Worked perfectly well until the warranty ended.Used it for small parties. Definitely was useful for the beach.But once warranty ended it was a struggle to get it to charge. Once it just cut off like it had died completely. Charging took forever. It would be on 30% for five hours.
"The speaker is good quality but every time I connect to it, a booming chime plays indicating that it's on and connected. This sound is loud, disturbing, and uncontrollable. There's no way to turn it off and I hate it. It makes me regret my purchase. If I could turn it down or off then it'd be tolerable but this obnoxious sound cannot be avoided. I will not be buying any more products from bose like this due to this issue."
"Even if I keep the eq at the lowest setting for bass, mid & treble it’s way too boomy. I was hoping I was avoiding this kind of sound profile by not buying a beats, but this Bose is no better. Sure, this is not exactly an audiophile speaker , but does it have to be so boomy? I’d rather just listen to music on my iphone that sounds much better."
"This product has a USB charging port that stopped working correctly 4 months I to owning. Now, the volume does not get  loud, only reaching approx 30 percent of previous levels. Wrote to Bose, product is out of warranty. Customer service is poor, quality is also poor.Should be a better product or customer service. This is neither."
Don't buy!!! The most frustrating Bluetooth device I've ever owned. Randomly stops. Forgets everything.
I have an old Bose Bluetooth speaker and I've always wanted to get rid of it because the connection drops frequently and is hard to establish in the first place. When I read the reviews about how it is still a problem with new Bose speakers I think it is better to stay away even though the sound quality is pretty decent. I am simply trying to connect to a new iPhone. It should be the simplest of all connections but Bose struggles with it for some reason.
Instructions in 40 languages but doesn’t tell you how to shut this crap off. Your chat is a joke. Remove it.
If you plan to connect this to bluetooth DONT BUY!!All BOSE porducts are terrible at connecting to bluetooth and it will drive you crazy to the point you just throw their trash speakers out of a moving car.
"I’ve had this for a year and suddenly, the volume doesn’t turn up and even if my device is at 100, this POS doesn’t do its job.I hate it and would never recommend this to anyone."
Bought at Costco. Won't pair with anything. Make sure you google first. It sucks.
"ended up returning it.all it does is blast bass, and the app offers little control despite having like 20 settings.i just want my old tribit back but it stopped holding a charge after several years."
Worked fine for a few days. flawlessly but not working anymore and I am travelling for a few days and Bose has not been any help. it has stopped working in 15 days. Amazon sold this product although it has been so good buy anything and everything from Amazon biut not this time.
Sure it can be made to work but not for me at present. Probably need the grandchildren to set it up for me.
"Supposed to be 2nd Gen but no where near an upgrade of the previous, muffled sound, almost like it's under water, a real shame given the massive price tag."
"Update 3: I am not doing ""never ending updates"" but just typing this to say that the issue STILL hasn't come back.  The one thing I have noticed is that i am getting NO WHERE NEAR the ""30 hour playtime"" ... even 20 maybe pushing it.  I am disappointed in that but overall ... I dont mind the speaker.  Something in my reviews I thought of mentioning is that while this speaker doesn't sound as dynamic as others ... a ""more even sound ... even if that means it lacks a 'thump' in the bass""... IS NOT always a bad thing ... say my Tribit XSound Surf ... listening to smooth jazz at night at low volumes ... it has ""too much"" of a thump ... this speaker not having that in my view ... makes this one better in some cases .... same way with my DOSS Soundbox Touch having a similar sound (but better mids/highs i think)Update 2:  been a few days and ""constant use"" since the last update.  The issue with no sound has NOT come up again yet ... and while i forgot what i have rated the Oontz Angle 3 Ultra (3.5?) i may have to bump that up to 3.75 (not to get crazy with decimals) when i say this ... but i'd give this a 3.5... yeah with certain genres it seems ""flat"" and lacking bass i'd like (I like a clean bass at best ... not overly done, so i am no ""bass head"") but other times my new favorites the Tribit XSound Gos have a ""subwoofer like sound"" (WHICH IS WHY it is my favorite ... at times) but late at night at low volumes i wish i could turn that extra bass off ... I BRING THAT UP due to the fact that THIS SPEAKER sort of has THAT type of sound.  So with say easy listening, instrumental, and some jazz stuff in that exact situation ... i DONT DISLIKE the Tribit ... I just like the ""lack of bass"" (so to speak) more.I cant remember if i recommended or didn't recommend this in my original review.. to me now i'd say this is ""ok"" (even if that sound issue comes up where i have to play sound in a different app to get it back again, issue comes up) ... you can do better ""bang for buck"" but ... this is not terrible either.Update 1:  Ok after trying what another reviewer said and trying to reset the speaker (pressing power button and holding for at least 8 seconds) I got things to work again.  I also couldn’t get any sound in Kodi with my local media but after opening up another app and playing audio fine in that, (same device), then going back to Kodi sound in there worked again.  I cant explain what happened but as I said others are having this issue too, but someone mentioned this and it worked for me.  Now I plan on sort of doing part of what I planned to in the original review,I have a few other BT speaker, which include an Oontz Angle 3 Ultra, two Tribit Xsound Surfs, two Tribit Xsound Gos, a DOSS Soundbox Touch and a Braven BRV1BCB BRV-1.Versus the Tribits:- to me while I wish the Xsound Surf had better battery life (ONLY ADVERTISED at 10hr) … I would still say either the Xsound Surf or the XSound GO are the better option.  They are my favorites and just overall in the same price range … they are just a better value and MUCH better sound.Versus the DOSS Soundbox Touch:- This is where it is interesting.  I have not done an “A-vs-B” comparision head to head but out of all my speakers, this speaker sounds closest to this one.  If I remember, the bass on the DOSS seems lower at lower volumes but while not like other speakers I have or a “Sub woofer” type sound.  It gets more “present” as the volume goes up.  It sounds clear and balanced but not for “bass heads”.  I think the DOSS may sound better than this one, however its close … I think this speaker’s tuning in the mids are a little off but like the DOSS I’d say both of these speakers are a more “balanced” sound without a subwoofer like “thump”.Versus the Oontz Angle 3 Ultra:- note: I can only compare this to the Ultra model … I hear that if you go down in Oontz models they don’t sound as good.- This is where I wish I could take the extra bass in the Ultra and put it in the X10.  The bass is there in the Ultra but while not muddy in MY VIEW.  It CAN “linger” a bit.  Where it slightly effects the low mids and mid-mids depending on the track.  This I feel is exactly what the X10 here is MISSING, EVEN ON Bass Boost mode in the built in EQ.- Build quality – even if the Ultra is NOT my favorite speaker, I still totally recommend it and like it… the build quality alone  (not the only thing) blew me away, for the sub $40 price I paid for it.Versus the Braven:- I admit that I do not use this as much as I should.  This was gifted to me by someone who had no use for it and .. .well I love this one.  It has a decent thump in the bass but not overdone.  From what I remember this sort of reminds me of a Tribit tuning … a Good V-shaped sound but clean and not “forced” or overdone.  (sound wise) “Everything is where it should be”Summary:I still cant say I recommend this due to the problems I had BUT if its a “ok this is a dumb fix to a problem that shouldn’t exist in the first place” (almost a James May quote) thing if I have the no sound issue again… Ok … I am ok with keeping this and I am not as “upset” (I don’t want to ham that up) about it.The bottom line is (say the “360 sound” that is just fake marketing … If it was “this looks like a JBL Flip but this is not 360 sound .. it just LOOKS the same” … ok then) … I just cant “trust” this speaker… not until I have more time with it and it behaves fine … I will be GLAD to do a second update to report the good news, if that happens.----------------------------------------Original ReviewI was going to write a more in detail review, comparing this speaker to various others I have but unfortunately things are not looking great.  I am not 100% saying I am returning this already, but it looks like it may go in that direction.I will list some Cons but .. .things are not all bad when it was working correctly… Hopefully I can not some things as I go.Cons:- Sound quality – ok this is not all bad … but I knew this would lack bass … I get it but even with a V shaped EQ on top of the speaker (same I have set in the same app for ALL others I have) ..and even in this speaker’s third EQ setting “Bass Boost” there is a lack of bass in most genres, people would typically listen to.  HOWEVER one of my use cases is late at night listening to say intrumental, Jazz, or Classical music.  The lack of a big “Thump” in the bass (which CAN be overdone in other speakers I have heard) … wasn’t too bad and with those genres at lower volumes … the sound quality wasn’t bad. Really I’d never call it “muddy” but even bass boost (built in EQ) sounded like there was a lack of “average bass”. ALSO THIS IS NOT 360 sound.  Sure you hear sounds from all sides but the two speakers are only facing one way (the exact opposite side of where the buttons are) … that is the direction things sound “clearest” … the sound is different on any other side and with the lack of bass … including the “bass” radiators on the side as part of the “360” is laughable in itself.- Voice pompt – this wouldn’t be too bad if it wasn’t SO LOUD … late at night it a bit loud compared to say where the volume is set … “BLUETOOTH MODE”  “BLUETOOTH CONNECTED” … again I’d like just a beep or something like a ton but even the voice wouldn’t be that bad IF it was a “few clicks” lower in volume.Unsure (Pro? Con?)- Build quality – I WILL SAY this doesn’t feel super cheap, but others like my Oontz Angle 3 Ultra, or any of my Tribit speakers, just feel better.  I also have to say I have never had a JBL Flip or any other speakers with an “all over” grill … and I knew I was getting this so maybe versus other speakers, this “style” makes it feel less solid … I could get a JBL Flip and think “oh … they ‘feel’ the same” build quality wise.-------------------------My main issue – I was thinking of MAYBE returning this, having my sights on a Tribit speaker I have not experienced yet, but with the other Tribit speakers I DO have, blowing me away overall, I have kept my eye on a sale for that one.  Not even a week into owning this speaker, while all devices connect to the speaker, the speaker outputs ZERO audio from any COMFIRMED CONNECTED device in bluetooth mode.I do admit PART (but just half at best) use-case is the microsd card slot and one reason I wanted this speaker.  In addition to Rain and Ocean waves (“sound machine style”) I wanted to load a microsd card up with that sort of stuff and say maybe smooth jazz and sort of use it as a “custom” sound machine.  Right now the microsd card slot function STILL outputs audio and it doesn’t sound bad … but with no sound no matter what I do (including a speaker reset) working … in under 7 days of having this…. I cant even trust this will last.I do note that many of the negative reviews also mention this exact problem.I can live with the sound quality being “meh” at best for typical genres and this only being a good speaker in specific use-cases but now there is no audio for any bluetooth … that is a deal breaker. I just CANT recommend this speaker.  While my Tribit speakers are my favorite, I will say I have an Oontz Angle 3 Ultra and sound wise it has the opposite problem (bass tends to … not make things muddy… but it’s bass “lingers a bit too long” at times) … I still LOVE and recommend that speaker."
"The sound itself soungs good on this speaker and it works for the most part. The ONLY issue I have with this speaker is that EVERY time i’m listening to music, the sound will go out towards the very beginning of the song or maybe about 10 seconds into the song. I keep having to press pause on my phone and then play again for the sound to come back. Idk if this has happened to anyone else but this is the only issue I have with it and it’s very annoying. I can never walk away from this speaker and let the next song play because the sound WILL stop."
"I enjoy the sound from this speaker, I’ve had it about 2 months but now the charging port won’t work, mind you this is my first time charging it and I’ve been tryna charge it for about 2 weeks. The light comes on for 5 mins then turns off, then when I check to see if it’s charged it gives a stupid noise then says low battery, like WTF, you been on the charger for 4 hrs. I won’t buy it again. I’ll just go back to JBL."
"The compact size, battery life, simplicity for features, the style, and tf card support all make this much better than the old g-grip that I had.I had another one of these that I was given by someone else, after finding out that it had dual pairing compatibility, I got another one.The dual pairing is where one problem is, there's no separate button to dual pair it only the power button & specific instructions. It's a minor nuisance, nothing to write home about.The other problem is the bass quality of the one I got, this one cannot compete with the first one I have."
"I ordered a pink X10 and a black X10 a few days apart, both as Christmas gifts and they arrived showing they're both the black X10. The other thing that was confusing is that one speaker had a transparency code for authentication and the other did not. Very disappointed!!! Will be sending both back as the items can't be trusted as legit."
"**** so the person who represented the company said they were going to refund the price of the speaker. It's been quite a while now, and I still have not seen any credit coming through to my credit card account or to my Amazon account.***I heard from the company, and they offered a full refund due to the problems. Very stand up. I am more than satisfied with the results. Excellent company, for the customer service alone.***Originally a one star, but the company stepped up to resolve the issue.I bought this product less than 2 months ago, and now I can't use it because the sound keeps cutting out and you have to reset your program or music to get it to play again. But once it starts doing that, it's going to keep doing it. What a pain. I would not recommend it"
"I was hoping for a little more bass than it offered, but overall not a bad speaker for by the pool. Easy to connect to Bluetooth."
"it just right in size but its not loud at all, my phone is louder ."
It was a great speaker until the power button failed to turn the speaker on.
Sound quality isn't the best. But it was cheap.
"Update: The seller saw my review and reached out and offered a full refund. Exceptional service all around. Friendly and quick acting.. I would not hesitate to purchase from them again. They also reiterated their 30-day no questions asked return policy. Buy with confidence friendsEasy to connect, sounds pretty good, range is good. ....everything seems A-OK until we took it out to the pool, set it down on the deck and it got splashed. Now..it wont charge, only turns on for a second then turns right back off. Have tried different plugs, cords, dried out the charging port....but no luck. Bummer. I guess ""Waterproof"" means it may hold up to a couple of beads of sweat falling delicately in the right place. 🤣"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            My device was defective straight from the box. Not to mention the seller is using false information in the description. They state that this is a 24w, when in truth they use 2 12w, which will max it at the power level. I am not sure if they didn’t realize that is usually stated in regards to each speaker used and not a device total, though I doubt this was the case since they knew to print it properly with in their directions. It is still a just 12w speaker, it is just panoramic, meaning they have one on each side of the device. In what world do you get 24w sound from 12w speakers? Oh yeah, you can’t because it doesn’t have the correct power to reach the hertz that would be expected from genuine 24w speakers. I mean we all know a round speaker has multiple speakers, unless you buy a sound bar. So why lie and say you used 24w, rather than being direct and stating you merely used 2 12w. It honestly seems like they hoped people wouldn’t know or notice. Most electric pieces have at least enough charge to be tested so when it wouldn’t turn on I was a bit worried. Opted to plug it in for a few hours and try again, at this point, it would turn on, but only for about 5 seconds before powering down. The ONLY WAY it produces sound is via the AUX cord.Now for the sound.....there was little no base at all despite utilizing the equalizer.  There also seemed to be static if you attempted to turn it above 70%. I can’t say if this is actually how it sounds since my unit didn’t function correctly. I can’t tell you it didn’t produce the sound I expected from their description.As for the look and feel of the device, I have no complaints. In fact, I loved the way it looked. It felt high quality and had extra features you would want. I mean, it genuinely felt like a premium product, which is why I wanted to love it. In the end it it just didn’t work. When I read the instruction manual and saw that it was half of the advertised power strength, I decided it just wasn’t for me. I do not like dishonesty being used to facilitate sales, and I am far too knowledgeable in sound equipment to let this slide. Had the advertisement been more accurate and true, I would have exchanged it to try again. The fact that I got a defective unit, in addition to the fact that I saw the true power levels caused me to process a return instead. I truly though I was getting a great deal with all of these features. I now realize I could just go to $5 and below to get a speaker of comparable sound quality (if you do their nicer one). Otherwise, this has similar sound quality to $5 devices with the higher pitch sounds and limited base. So the great deal I thought I found, was more of a deal on the looks of the device, rather than the function.Again this is a review of the device I had that is defective. However, it doesn’t change the fact that it was advertised as having 24w output but when delivered stated it actually have a 12w max but times 2 which in no way will come close to producing the same power. I have only left one negative review in the years o have had my Amazon account, so that should say something."
"Overall, these make decent sound for the price, but they have some annoying drawbacks. Will look for different speakers in the future.Pros:- I got 2, hooking them up together is by far the best feature. I can put them in different locations for better sound, I like the stereo. Plays in sync and across a living room.- Sound quality, notably the base for it's price and size. (At least at first, see cons for more)- Bluetooth connection is pretty good, decent range.- Decent waterproofing- Good for outdoorsCons:- battery is not good, lasts for maybe 1 day with infrequent use. What's worse is that it becomes unusable after it starts giving you a warning that it's about to die, making the effective battery life even shorter. It makes a noise every 15 seconds that's annoying so I just turn it off. Might as well just let it die, it's a dumb feature.- Sound quality seems to deteriorate slightly after use. I had to replace one of them (admittedly, I'm not sure if the speaker blew because of use or something else like water damage or something got inside) but I can hear it slightly in the ones I have currently 😓-Limited control over music from speaker. Play/Pause button is shared with a phone feature. I've accidently made some butt dials just trying to pause my music. Also I still don't know how to skip a song properly lol so I mostly use my phone.- very slight durability concerns. Speakers tend to be that way though for me."
Not as loud as I hoped but works for the shower.
"Is good for the price,  it JB’s but good!!!!"
I don’t listen to my music real loud but sometimes I need the volume up to hear it from another room. (When cleaning the house I’m all over the place) The clarity is not adequate at any higher volume level. I will keep it because the price was better than others. Just don’t expect to use it at a party.
"Sound quality was amazing and I loved it.  Sleek style fast shipping great but sadly first one I ordered was defective as it would stop outputting sound just randomly.returned and ordered another one and it did the same.What it did exactly is thisWould play than it just without warning the sound would stop, checked my phone the song is still clearly playing but no sound out of speaker, still connected to Bluetooth as well and speaker at 100% and phone is sitting right next to speaker.  So not sure what was going on it would play if I pressed pause then play again but it would just do it again.It's unfortunate cause the sound was amazing and I loved it but I don't have the patience for the glitching. and constant return to just try to get one that doesn't glitch.So if you have the patience to on occasion have to press play again it is a good speaker to own."
do not understand WHY- but this speaker keeps shutting off without warning- & I have only had it for 3 days- and I keep it on the charger so the battery is not dead. Do not get it. Sound is good for the price but it is annoying that the sound keeps shutting off!
"Sound is ok.  Pressing the equalizer button does not seem to change the sound or improve the bass.  Would have been upset if I paid full price for it, as opposed to the prime day price."
"Pros:+ good soundCons:- confusing EQ settings (no indication of what setting you are on or when you are back to normal EQ)- to turn off the lights (which can get distracting at times) it is nearly impossible to not accidentally change the EQ (it’s with the same button, just pressed twice instead of once) and then you have no idea how to get back to normal EQ except by listening VERY closely and quickly cycling through the 4 EQ settings to try and tell when it goes back to normal- the POWER button takes 3 SECONDS of CONSTANT PRESSING to turn on and off!  Who thought that was a good idea?  Why would you want making turning it on and off so challenging?  It’s not like it’s a gun 😂But seriously, those seconds add up and just make it so annoying to turn on and off (and especially when you accidentally just hold for 2 seconds and find that it wasn’t long enough to actually turn it on)So— I’ll just say that I’m willing to trade mine if anyone wants it 😂Edit: just found out that when you max out the volume, it plays an annoying sound and PAUSES the music for two seconds while playing the annoying sound.  This is highly disruptive for any event you might be using the speaker for.  Docking one more star off the product for this horrible UX decision"
It's good...but I ordered the pink one and I got the black one . Had to use it cause it was for a gift .
a little bigger than the JBL I really wanted but I was looking for a cheaper option and I found it.  It is fine.
"The mids and treble are way too high.There's too little bass all across the range.I bought this instead of MusiBaby, but it seems to me they got the same internals; despite the Ortizan claiming twice the power levels, they are exactly as loud as one another.Edit: Despite the sound being a bit poor, this speaker has an EQ setting, where you can increase the bass, so it will sound acceptable (and slightly better even than the Woozik Rockit Go, or even the Pyle PBMSPG1BK, even if it's not as loud).The Ortizan has at least 2 speakers for stereo, however, they are aimed in the same direction. So your stereo spectum is basically nihil.The only thing I can praise it for, is possibly a bit longer battery life than the MusiBaby.What's kind of neat, is that this speaker has a reset button hidden in the Aux jack. You can apparently reset this device with a toothpick.The aux jack works as a microphone, or stereo line in.My only other CON is that this device isn't loud enough for in the car.It's good for a small pool, and 2 of these can replace your TV sound bar.A hint, speakers like these sound really nice about 1 ft away from the walls, and even better 1-2 ft away from the walls of a corner ceiling.The extra bass you get from this is amazing, and having them float in the air is also pretty neat!They just need a way to charge."
"Got this for my Echo Show 10. It turns off when it hasn't been used for a few hours, even though it's plugged into an electrical socket. I'm also having problems with the Echo Show 10 that it's connected to, where it puts the Echo into a screen read only when asked a question, instead of hearing a verbal from the Echo Show even after this speaker is turned off, along with the blue tooth, and the Echo Speaker should be working. I did not have this issue before I started using this speaker.I'd rather try another brand speaker for my Echo Show. It just could be that it's not compatible with my particular Echo.Sorry for the negative review"
My stock IPhone speaker may be louder.  Useless
It works fine but sometimes just randomly powers off. I can verify this is not a battery issue because I have it plugged in while listening. I can also verify it’s not a connectivity issue because my phone is right beside the speaker when it happens…
"These are nice little speakers, but if you use both for stereo, If the one you’re connected to loses its charge first, the other speaker will not power down without doing a hard power off (holding power button for 10 seconds) they freeze up a lot actually"
"Amazing sound quality! The sound is super clear, rich and so well balanced! I feel like I can hear every frequency with equal clarity.Battery life is great. BUT when the battery is low, it makes a really loud, repeating warning sound that makes the speaker not worth using anymore. The sound can’t be turned off or made quieter. It would be SO much more functional if the speaker just died without warning, because the blaring low-battery sound makes it unusable before it’s dead anyways.The speaker also makes loud announcements including “POWER ON!” “BLUETOOTH!” “BLUETOOTH IS CONNECTED!” And “POWER OFF!” You can’t disable this or change the announcement volume – it’s as loud as someone trying to talk to you from across the room. And most of the time, it’s louder than the volume I want to play music. The multidirectional sound also means you can’t use your hands to mute the sound effects."
Small Bluetooth speaker approximately 7 inches long. Functions well but the sound is just not there for my taste. When volumed up sounds cheap And distorted and lacks clarity
"I enjoy the sound quality even without the equalizer. Since the speaker is waterproof, I keep it in my bathroom to listen while showering, but I have never tested it in the water.It started making a beeping noise a few months after I received the speaker, while playing a streaming station. I thought it was the streaming causing the problem (poor WiFi signal). I realized that it needed to be charged. Now the beeping sound has returned & it won't charge (the picture shows the speaker plugged in).The instruction manual is not very detailed, so it doesn't provide a problem solving list.I would have given the speaker 5-stars if it wasn't for this issue."
"I would give this speaker a 4/5 if not for several very annoying features, which I detail below.The sound quality of this speaker is good. It's not great, but for the price you're paying, it is pretty good; definitely better than other speakers at similar price points. It's convenient, portable, and the waterproof rating is more than sufficient for bringing into the shower or the pool.That being said, there are several aspects about this speaker that range from slightly annoying to infuriating. In order from least annoying to most: First, this speaker has two light settings — on and off. While the lighting can be cool sometimes, it's nothing fantastic and I prefer it off. The default is on, and it does not remember its last setting; every time I turn the speaker on, I have to remember to turn the lights off. Just slightly annoying.Second, I dislike how obnoxious the startup of this speaker is. Many speakers simply have a short audio cue when the speaker turns on and when it is paired. This speaker, however, verbally says ""Power on. Bluetooth. Bluetooth connected. Power off."" There is no way to reduce the volume of this, and there is no way to change it to sounds instead of words.Third, maybe around a third of the time when using Spotify, the first 2-3 seconds of a song is silent. As I don't have this problem on any other device, I am assuming it is an issue with the speaker.Finally, the most frustrating part about this speaker is its battery. The battery life is decent; I use it a lot since I have music on in the background when I work, and generally have to charge it every other night. However, the battery life is essentially only 3/4 of its potential. At what seems to be 25% battery (as shown on my phone at least), the speaker interrupts whatever is playing with a loud ""Low battery. Please charge."" Again, this volume cannot be reduced, this warning cannot be disabled, the threshold for which it comes on cannot be changed, and the frequency between the alerts (which seems obnoxiously short; like a minute) cannot be changed. In other words, the speaker is unusable at less than 25% battery. This has gotten more and more aggravating for me, and I am considering looking for a new speaker simply because of this."
"I normally don't leave reviews for products and I'm pretty reasonable with my expectations of things, but I was SO disappointed with this product, I felt that it warranted documenting.I purchased this speaker for use in my car because my car's speakers had blown out and I had an upcoming drive from San Diego to Kansas City. I received the product about 3 days before my trip and started using it around the house to start getting familiar with it. For one thing, the battery-life is vastly over-inflated in the description/marketing vs real-life application. Even running this without the lights, I was really only able to get about 2-3hrs of continuous play on a single, full-charge. Definitely FAR short of the 26hrs advertised. One of the reasons I bought this was because I was facing a 23hr drive and didn't want to charge it on the road. It also has this annoying feature that most of these Bluetooth speakers seem to have where it starts alerting you to a low battery every 2 minutes at around 30% and interrupts your listening. In my opinion, if it's going to interrupt/disturb your use of the product, that means it's at 0%, NOT 30%...But, whatever, no big deal, at least I'd have a speaker, even if I have to charge it, right?...Wrong... When I used it at home, it was great but, about 6hrs into my big drive, the speaker just gave out. I'll admit that I had the volum all the way up, but the song I was listening to wasn't particularly punchy or strenuous for a speaker. Full disclosure: it was a pretty light musical theatre song. But, it just blew out the speaker in the middle of the song. And, from then on, the sound would cut in & out and became completely useless for the rest of my trip. What a MASSIVE disappointment for something I had such high-hopes for. When it worked, it provided really decent sound, but for it to completely give out after only 4 days of use and at the beginning of the trip I bought it for, I was more than a little annoyed, especially for the price I paid for it. I ended up just throwing it in the trunk for the rest of the trip and instantly regretted not forking out the extra $10 it would have cost for the JBL I was looking at instead.I would NOT recommend this speaker but, if you do end up purchasing it, be aware that the battery life is GROSSLY misadvertised and do NOT play it at the maximum volume or you'll risk blowing it out, even on a gentle song."
Sound isn’t as good of quality as I would have expected for that price range
"I would give this speaker 5 stars. It's loud and clear, I like the pink color, and I enjoy the lights. Except... At 20% battery charge it starts making this annoying 5 beep chime, every 30 seconds. As far as I can tell, there is no way to disable this. I understand the need for a low battery alert, but it doesn't need to start at 20% and it doesn't need to be so aggravatingly persistent. It essentially renders the last 20% of charge useless, since I can't keep listening with that freakin tone going off. In case it isn't clear, I feel very strongly about this. Company should fix this going forward."
"Purchased this Speaker as a package deal. With another Speaker of the same,for the Surround Sound effect. Each Speaker works good, and they sound wonderfulindividually. But having all kinds of issues syncing the two Speakers for the SurroundSound. I believe it is more than likely my error. But I am not sure? Still having quite atime getting them to work together!"
Okay speaker for the price. But the bass is weak.
"I used to have no problem with the speaker. I’ve already purchased one before so I thought getting a new color wouldn’t matter. The speaker I received is terrible. It doesn’t stay connected to Bluetooth, it randomly pauses the music playback and won’t start playing until you stop and restart it.The speakers aren’t bad in quality but that definitely turned me off from buying the colored speaker rather than the normal black. Also there should be a better manual especially for stuff like this that won’t work even with it being “reset”. ( reset button doesn’t really seem to work either)."
"I used this for my TV so as not to blast out the rest of the house. The speakers worked Fantastic, great sound, great bass, great tones... the best ever for my TV.... but.... now they don't work, don't turn off, don't turn up or down, lights (which I don't care for anyway) don't turn off or on.I had high hopes..."
"I am happy with the quality, but extremely unhappy with the instructions.  It would be nice if companies would spend an extra 3 cents and print instructions on something bigger than a postage stamp.  I needed a magnifying glass to even come close to reading the instructions."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Speaker is ok. Not bad but not as high quality I would expect. The price is fair but I got another speaker from a different brand for the same price and a large difference was noticed even after trying to change the equalizer setting.What I liked:- Volume is good. It can get decently loud.- Connection to bluetooth took about 5 secondsButtons are easy to press- Color is the same as advertised and lights are cool- Waterproof feature is a nice upgradeWhat I didnt like:- No speaker professional here but I felt like it lacked depth. I compared it to an older Doss speaker I got years back since I’m looking for an upgrade without spending much more for JBL.- Sound is not 360. If the side with the buttons are facing me, there is lack of sound.- Rolls around and doesn't stay in place without shoelace lanyard. Lanyard if removed is a pain to put back. I just kept the speaker standing upright.If you’re looking for just a basic speaker, this does the job however if you’re wanting better quality for the money, I’d go with a different brand."
I am very disappointed. The volume is very low. You pretty much have to be standing next to it to be able to hear itThe lights on the speaker looked pretty coolThe company reached out to me and solved the problem I had with the speaker. Wonderful company to work with.
After looking over the reviews I was pretty excited to try this one out.  It paired pretty quickly and the lights were cool.  But when I played a few songs and compared it to another speaker I have I was really disappointed.  The bass is pretty thin and vocals weren't as crisp as my other one.  It's too bad because it had a lot of what I wanted but sound just not cutting it.  I'll be returning this one and looking for something else.
"The speaker looks cool but the sound quality isn’t great. It’s all bass, which is fun, but not what I want in a quality speaker."
So far the speaker is OK.  But connecting to calls is awful.  You sound far away and muffled can't really hear you while talking.  And you echo a lot and the other person can hear it as well.  With the music on its still kinda muffled little bit.  I know to spend the extra money and get a good speaker.  I wanted to see how this was I would say this would be good for the beach but that's about it.  At home it's not a loud as my jbl. Also it comes with a string on it.  Pictures don't show that.  But it's good for a beginner or kids.  If you want something loud and good spend the money on the other
"Great sound , worked great for the first week then stopped working. It turns off after a few minutes even when fully charged. I’m hoping I can exchange it . We’ll see, I contacted the company to no avail. But it is a holiday"
"it’s a nice speaker. good sound for its size. however i had this speaker since christmas and it plays fine when it wants to but sometimes it makes a weird noise, the sound skips and then the audio just goes out. you have to restart the song or rewind and let it play again which is really annoying. but overall it’s a pretty decent speaker. for the price it’s good but there are better quality options! the lights are cute also so that’s a plus."
"I purchased a pair of these for my covered patio and the 1st year was amazing.  Last fall they were playing and suddenly, while charging,  they said goodbye and shut off.  Since then I've tried to leave them off for 4 monthes to completely discharge and got them out to charge them.  Now they turn on for about 15 seconds and shut off again.  I know they weren't the most expensive, but to have them obviously work but hold no charge- while on the charger - is frustrating."
Says it pairs with 2nd speaker for stereo sound but it's not working!
"It just arrived - so it's too early to comment on some features. But at first glance; it connected to Bluetooth instantly. And the volume is NOT very loud, which is a little disappointing. The way I would describe it is: If you want music in the bathroom while you're taking a shower - it'll work. But, if you want this to be your main entertainment outside while picnicking with friends - it's DEFINETLY NOT loud enough. It connected to my HP Laptop, which is great as I can use it while making/receiving calls or watching Netflix/Cable, etc. Not sure about the battery life - it paled immediately, but I'm charging it just incase it's only partially charged. Other than that looks just as advertised."
The base is not too good. It sounds a little tinny.
"The sound is clear, but it does not have a lot of bass. Returned it and found another product that’s similar that actually have bass. Also, the volume is not as loud as I thought it would be."
"The speaker looks great but it's not very loud. I would definitely give more stars as it was louder. I tried using while snowboarding and i couldn't hear a thing. I checked it out when i got home and it turns out there's only one speaker in the back of it.The seller read my review and messaged me asking if I wanted a refund. I gratefully accepted the refund, very good service and would recommend this seller!"
This is an ok speaker. I expected the base to be heavier but it was just okay. I have bought other speakers and I think I'm returning this one for one I like better but its not bad if you just like to listen music not expecting a booming sound.
"I was excited to use this speaker because it looked good, but for some reason when I got it, it was almost as if the sound was muffled on the speaker and my music would randomly stop playing, even though it was still connected, so I’m not sure why, but I have only had it for two days"
"Worked good but its be more accurate to say water resistant than waterproof. Also isnt near as loud as I expected, basically same volume as a cheap shower speaker. None of the “settings” (lights/equalizer) on it stay locked in, everytime power on and off basically resets"
"Average speaker, sound quality not great but it’s loud enough and good ENOUGH for just having music playing in our home at all times. We like an environment with some sound and comfort or Lofi or jazz or just something ON, I don’t advise for like parties or large groups or pool parties bc it’s not enough and the louder it goes the worse the quality is sadly."
Not the best
"My JBL Flip 4 died. The speaker quality is not as good. When I use mic from the speaker, people can barely hear me during a phone conversation. Poor quality. Would not recommend."
So it sounds pretty good for it being so cheap. The only thing is 5 seconds into playing a song via Bluetooth it stops playing. Doesn’t turn off… just stops and you have to press play on the speaker to resume.
"If you’re an audiophile you’ll know the bass is not good in this. The sound quality for the most part is ok, it only has one speaker on one side and not a full 360 degree range of sound."
"I have been trying hard to replace an old 10w Oontz Angle speaker for my outdoor enjoyment. Yet another fail. I don't know if the Oontz is just so much better, or if the descriptions/reviews of other speakers are a bit misleading.If I was using this speaker indoors, it would be slightly better than the 10w Oontz, but not much. If this is 24 watts, then my Oontz is 23w. Neither statement is true, in my opinion.The Oontz just didn't project loudly enough across my backyard (obviously!) and I thought I could at least use something a bit louder with more bass oomph. This product was not much louder, and the bass was mostly non-existent. To be clear, I wasn't expecting massive DJ quality boom to share with the neighborhood, but I wanted it to have at least a soothing bass hum nearby. There simply was no more bass than the tiny 10w Oontz.All that said, it may be the right speaker for you. The price point is nice, the lights are cool, and it does have a crisp sound if you are near it. I like the rope loop to hang it somewhere. It is an attractive speaker and has a solid heft to it. It's just not loud enough and has minimal bass quality for my desires. I may have to spend a bit more to get a JBL or UE to suit my patio needs. I'm returning this, and continuing my quest for another speaker.UPDATE: On Prime Day, I bought several more speakers. I ultimately went with the JBL Flip 5, though the JBL Charge 4 was a close second place."
"The sound quality is adequate for being a cheaper speaker. However, I believe that because of the unnecessary light effects that the battery dies much more quickly. I think that their claimed 30 hours comes with it just sitting there powered on but not playing music. With the lighting effects you sacrifice music time. I couldn't even make it about 5 hours into a 8 hour shift at work and it begins cutting out and then dying and it was fully charged at the beginning of my shift. Actually plan on returning due to this."
The sound quality is ok at best. It has some neat features but doesn't have the full sound I'm looking for. Guess I should have spent the extra money on a higher quality speaker.
Didn’t like the fact music sound kept shutting on and off.
"Overall this is 3 star speaker which is appropriate for the cost, ~$30 at time of review. As long as your expectations are reasonable, it will be fine."
"The speaker has decent pace and mids, but I find the highs to be very quiet and difficult to hear clearly. Also, has the most annoying voice announcer when you switch input mode or turn it on and off it announces in a very loud voice what it's doing. As far as I've seen there's no way to disable this built-in voice, which makes it hard to use when you're trying to use it in a quiet location like a bedroom."
"The product works, however the manual states jt was supposed to come with a charging cable and audio cable."
Not so loud. Sound quality is off putting.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            First off sound quality and volume are ok.The battery only lasts about 5 hours. When the battery gets down to 20% it starts making a low battery alert as heard at the end of tge video. It makes that noise every 60 secomds. While sounding it cuts off all other . Media coming out of the device get cut off while it alerts making listening tmusic really annoying. And it doesn't pause while alerting soif youre listening to  a podcast be prepared to miss parts of it. That's what you need to know.  👎
It's sound is not as good as others I have had. Sounds distorted.
Unit volume level is low. I was hoping for a higher volume setting
"I bought these to use in our basement and by our pool. Was hoping to have one at either end (about 40 feet apart). I CANT get them farther than 20 feet or they lose signal with eachother. My phone can not be more than 20-30 feet or they start to break up and struggle (was trying to listen to music and clean the pool with my phone in my pocket but kept losing signal).They are on the more quiet side compared to another speaker I have bought off Amazon.... but honestly I liked it..inside I could have the speaker close to me and not feel overpowered by the lowest setting.Sadly, the nicer range in volumn was not enough to keep these. They are going back for something that I can actually use all around my pool and not just one end."
"Spend a few more $, this product was a disappointment."
I thought the price and sound were ok not great just ok. I like to fall asleep to a meditation recording and two things go against that. One - no way to turn off the lights and two the speakers make an announcement that they are shutting off which wakes me up. I wish there was a way to shut the lights and announcements off
"Sound is great for the price , comparable to higher end products but keeps losing Bluetooth connection . Sound stops without warning with phone nearby and not moving .Kind of a bummer . But sounds good .Would have gotten 5 stars if it didn’t malfunction . Hope your works well ."
It has a short battery life.
"Its not very loud, per the manuel only one speaker of the dual speakers work when connected to bluetooth. Its easy to connect to and the sound is clear but if you're looking for something that is loud and will be louder than a leafblower, this speaker will disappoint you. At least if you are connecting to it via bluetooth"
"Bought this because of the claim of long battery life.  I was disappointed.  Have fully charged it and used it many times now.  The speaker volume is quiet.  Does not get loud at all.  I have a different speaker purchased about same price and size and it is twice as loud.  I knew this did not last as it claimed so I timed it.  Fully charged and played at half volume or less it lasted just less than 8 hours.  Then it continues to play but clicks off and on and makes noise every minute or so once battery get low.  This is very annoying.  It's a bad design in that if you stand it up it is sitting on a speaker covering it, but yet it rolls if laid down.  In all the speaker works and is ok.  The lights are cool.  But there are many better speakers out there for similair price."
"This unit works as advertised although you need two of them for stereo. I only ordered the one and tried it out. I was hoping for a bit better range but then I also rebuild speaker cabinets as a hobby. If you are expecting home stereo quality then this isn't for you. If you want something you can grab and take with you on a picnic, or while you're working on something then you probably won't care or notice the difference in quality. I ended up returning it."
Looks good but the volume quality isn't very good. It kind of skips its volume in the middle. It's either quiet or loud and not in the middle. I haven't used it for that long but the battery dies pretty fast.
"If you're like me, you're considering this for a mix of relatively low cost (you can find cheaper for sure) with a decent average customer review and supposedly great sound. Well, if you're into mega-bass, it's definitely a great option. For me, I would prefer something with a big more accuracy and while I don't expect a lot out of a speaker this size and at this price point, this is definitely heavy on the bass side for me.  The EQ mode is difficult to figure out, so it may have a correction that I'm missing, but that just highlights an issue I have with it in general - I find the controls to be non-intuitive. I also struggle with ""Which side is up?"". some port of speaker surface has to be on the ground/table/etc.. If you put it on end, then that's going to be the bass side of things (no pun intended). If you put it on the side where it might role, you block less sound, but also don't give it a stable perch.That said, it worked out of the box, puts out decent sound volume, connected relatively easily once you figure out how to get into pairing mode (not that hard), and doesn't cost a lot. It is not a purchase I regret, but definitely isn't a purchase I would make again."
"I previously owned a UE Boom which was getting old and starting to act up. My sister-in-law had this and I decided to get one for my next BT speaker.  Compared to the sounds of my UE Boom it wasn't as good but OK.  Family met over the holidays and we put our 2 speakers together using the TWS feature.  It was awesome having stereo so I bought a second speaker.  She did the same.  Here are the issues we ran into.Me: My new speaker battery would not last as long as my original speaker. A few hours playing time different.  When the battery goes it repeats every 30 seconds ""Lower Power - Please Charge"".  Annoying. I had a few times where Bluetooth would disconnect and reconnect usually due to a solid object blocking but not always. I could walk between devices with no issue.Her:  Anytime anyone would walk between devices, they would cut out which gets super annoying when you have people over.Pros: TWS feature makes it worth to have 2Cons: Bluetooth is weak and battery life is inconsistent between each.Once you do 2 speakers in stereo, you don't want to go back to a single."
"The main reason I bought this was that it was supposed to be 24 Watts when it’s actually 2x12W (Two speakers, each with 12W output). There’s a HUGE difference. Build quality does seem solid, I’ll give it that. Sound quality is what you would expect with a cheap speaker. Very tinny, not a lot of low end. There’s also a really annoyingly long lag time when cycling through the EQ presets that don’t seem to do much. I’ll be returning mine and looking for something else."
The speaker sounds really good! Its very waterproof.  The ligts go with the beat. It has good Bluetooth range but every time I insert a tf card it freezes :P I tried multiple cards but still freezes... That defeats the underwater music...It makes a low battery noise at 30% and it has a looonngg battery life so it continues for a few hours...Maybe it will work for you. But everything else works!I feel like you should get the on-brand speaker and not take any chances.
"This speaker quit connecting, via bluetooth, to any of our iPhones or my iPad about 25 days after I rcvd it.  Luckily I was still w/in the 30 day return window.  Earlier I had purchased a JBL speaker and returned it due to defect.  The one good thing about doing business w/ Amazon is that they have a tremendous hassle free return system in place"
Item looks smaller then the picture
It says it has 30 hours of play time when in reality it’s maybe 8 after 8 hours it starts cutting out really bad and skips around what ever you’re listening to. Besides that it sounds great and it overall is a great product. Just very disappointed about how long it plays.
"The voice prompts are absolutely obnoxious and there's no way to turn them off.  I'm returning it because of that alone.It's round with no feet or flat spot to keep it from rolling. The lanyard is the only thing that stops it from rolling in one direction, but if you change direction, it has to roll a full 360 degrees before the lanyard catches it again."
Was great until I got 13 days out of the return period and now is blown and crackles at all volumes.Never took this in the water or dirt. Very sadBluetooth is maybe 30ft diameter. Unless you have your phone in your pocket.
"Debated returning this but it’s ok for the price. Sound quality is ok, sound also stops working if you switch to another app. Example: listening to Spotify and switch to YouTube you have to disconnect and reconnect for the sound to reconnect to work"
"I've had this speaker for a few years now.  It has great sound and I've had no problems with it until I accidentally knocked it into my hot tub.  I bought it specifically for use around my hot tub because it was advertised as ""water proof"".  IT IS NOT!"
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The sound is low and it stops working automatically every few moments until I press + or -. I don't know why.
"I liked the speaker, but when I used it the second time, there was a funny intermittent tone.  After reading online, I learned that it was a low battery signal.  I then discovered  that the charging cord that came with the unit was defective.  The charging light would not come on with that cord.  When I tried another cord that I owned, the light came on, and it appears to be charging now.  I will update this review if the speaker does not completely charge with the cord that I had."
"These speakers provide satisfactory audio quality, however, the Bluetooth connectivity is unreliable. The connection intermittently drops for approximately one second every ten seconds, causing significant annoyance. Despite a replacement unit being provided, the issue persists after six months of usage. Consequently, I recommend considering the slightly more expensive Onn Medium Rugged speakers (from Walmart) as a superior alternative, despite their less appealing design."
there’s no problem with it other than it muting my music.
"This speaker is not that loud unless you are in a area that is quiet.... You literally have to put it against something Thing like a corner or box to even hear it From A Distance. I grew up in the 90s where speakers were loud. Even my ihome speaker was louder And I paid around the same price A long time ago. This speaker was smaller. Even my 808can was louder than the speaker Again, it was much smaller. I give the x10 speaker 3 stars for sound but The battery charged last 30 hours."
"I love that it is waterproof and it is functional for all the reasons I have. Except it does not pulse to the beat of the music, only a set of synchronized light pulses adjustable by clicking the power button. Other than that, the audio does not work well if I make calls off of it, but I usually only use the speaker for listening to music. I can hear them but they cannot hear me, and if I turn the speaker off it ends the call completely, even if I have disconnected from the speaker before I took the call. Great speaker though."
"Love this , this is the third one I’m buying I gave to my friend in Nigeria for his birthday and gave to my brother for his Christmas gift they both love it"
"I love(d) it!! So much better than my phone for  listening to music, while I'm writing or exercising at home. Today, it stopped working, so I charged it for several hours. When I started it up again, the silly lights turned on but NO SOUND!!! Grrrrrr. I will search for instructions to remedy the problem, but since I have a writing deadline tonight, I am pretty annoyed."
It would pair with my phone but not my TV
"the sound is decent for such a small speaker, the biggest issue is that because it pulses it vibrates itself off the table,  I like my music loud that is why I bought the speaker, but it always vibrates off the table, so I can not use this, I will return it"
Good speaker with great sound. Battery life is good too. Only problem I have is the speaker fell off my 42” tall toolbox and broke the carry clip. It still works but now I cant clip it to my belt loop or tool bag.
I got this bluetooth speakers to use with my phone so I can bring my music to any room in the house or outside when I'm working. Works well but the sound leaves a lot to be desired.
"I used it for - when I visit my mother in a memory care unit.  She loves music , it is good to use."
poor sound
"Its a very good sounding Bluetooth speaker for the price and size. My only issue that I have with it is the power cord is very very short, and it does not come with a power cube. So I had to search my house to see if I had a spare from a old phone to plug it in. Sadly this is becoming the norm. When you buy something you should get all the things needed to operate it. Who would buy a car without tires to drive it away?"
"If you are indoors, and no more than 10 ft away, it could be a decent speaker. Outdoors, it's useless!Edited to add:I bumped it up to two stars because the seller was very helpful.  If the issues get resolved, I will bump it up accordingly.I will bump this to three stars because the seller took great care of me.The speaker has no app.It has no charge indication, charging or nothing.Limited distance from your cell phone, maybe 30 feet?It can't really be used for outdoors unless you are real close."
Speaker works great. Good sound but the lights have stopped working after a week.
It doesn't get really loud
The speaker sounds just fine it connects really easy as said but I did not receive any kind of instructions supposably the lights go with music so I don't know how to do that. And I did not receive any adapter cord all there was it's just the speaker in the Box thank you hopefully the seller ceases
easy to use - but you can only use one speaker per phone - blue tooth set up in seconds  and good sound quality for small unit
Connects easily and sounds ok but would be better to have adjustment of bass vs battery draining childish lights.
"Don’t play music loud, distortion rattles. No bass. You get what you pay for"
Not loud nought
"It cuts out about every 5 to 8 seconds.  Even plugged in and fully charged, it just sucks.UPDATEThe seller offered me a full refund!  That was not my intention, as it wasn’t a big spend, but I do appreciate their voluntary offer and added a star for their commitment to good customer service."
"I bought this speaker as a gift for a difficult to buy for teenager and I got it on prime day. It was listed as originally being somewhere around $40 and it was “on sale” for $20. There’s no way I would believe this speaker was originally worth $40 so I feel cheated. It’s way too small to be a decent Christmas gift. So unless you’re looking for something that fits in a 5 foot tall lady’s palm size, keep looking."
For the money it's fine.  Not amazing.  Fine
"I have bought many Bluetooth speakers in the past, I am rough on them, I listen to music all around my house. I have a super range of Bluetooth coverage. In the past all of the other speakers have connected with no problems, I have used two particular brands they usually last me a year to a year and a half. This time I thought I would try a different brand and bought two to keep one as a spare.  I have connected it to my no problem but in the past I hooked up to my tv's Bluetooth with no problem, this speaker will not hook up, I have tried both, my back up too. Back to the speakers that have worked in the past. I know better than to try a unproven one."
It's ok
I purchased this speaker because in the description it states WATERPROOF package states resist.
Size was misrepresented
It would be nicer if you could turn the lights off.
"Worked perfectly fine for about a month and then it just randomly stopped working. Before it stopped working the sound was amazing, battery life pretty good, easy to connect. Never dropped it or anything but it just stopped working today"
"Loved it at first then it stopped working, only got 2 months use"
Honestly it’s ok quality but not worth the $30 they charge for it. Def not going to be a water resistant design. Easy enough to use of course but the sound is fuzzy and not crisp as described by other reviews. There were scratches and smudges on the top as shown in the photo upon opening.
This product is not loud and not worth the money. I expected better quality.
"If you just want to use this to make your computer or phone audio better or louder, this works fine. And it won't roll downhill like the speakers that are shaped like hotdogs. But there are 2 fatal flaws for me:1. If you connect the speaker to your computer and your computer is linked with your phone and someone calls you, it doesn't matter if your phone is on silent mode. The speaker will SHOUT at you, ""Incoming call. Incoming call. Incoming call,"" in an awful, robotic voice until you answer or decline the call. Sometimes, it will keep shouting long after you missed the call until you turn the whole thing off. There you might be, listening to music and rocking your baby to sleep, and then just when you're almost ready to put them down, ""INCOMING CALL. INCOMING CALL. INCOMING CALL,"" followed by ""WAAAAHHHHHHH"" from baby and a string of expletives from you.2. As enthusiastic it is about incoming calls, it is utterly useless if you accept one. The microphone is totally ineffective. Nobody can hear me at all."
Cool little Bluetooth speaker with nice sound but the TF card slot is not working.
"I was excited when I received this cute little Bluetooth speaker and anxious to try it out.  When I did, it had really good sound quality BUT it would not stay connected to Bluetooth.  I have returned it and will be looking for a different one."
This speaker worked fine for 4 months then just stopped working
"Honestly, I don't hate it other than the fact that mine sometimes just cuts off in the middle of playing music, whether it's charged or not"
"I followed the instructions, repeatedly, and these speakers won’t pair together. This is why I bought 2 in the first place."
"It’s been in the house 48 hours.  The lights no longer work, and the sound has started crackling and cutting out.  On the other hand, it’s still playing on the first charge, about 6 hours later.  We’re using it to help settle the kids, so it doesn’t have to be perfect."
My son took it in the pool and it never worked right again
Was very disappointed in volume on speaker. Returned both that i ordered
Bought this for river tubing and it couldn't handle the water
"We bought one of these speakers and the sound was okay, so we decided to buy another to pair them together. When we pair them together you can control the songs and volume with either speaker, but you can only hear sound on one speaker at a time. The sound switches from one speaker to another every time you press the play/pause button on either one."
I bought this as cheap option for listening to podcasts. It is barely acceptable for that. Music? Forget it. For $20 it does the job.. just.
Small size with below par sound.Will return.
I bought these speakers for a surround sound set up.It only jumps from one to another. One at a time.Cannot link them together.No support on the internet.After an hour of trying I am going to return them.Bad experience.If someone contacts me fast and solves this I will recant. But I do not see it.
"as stated above..  can't ""defeat bluetooth"".. zombie pairings mess up direct cable play...  i will change review if the company helps me get past this."
"I don't understand instructions, there's only one cord??? Is that good?Sorry but just don't know what to do with itMay be I need large instructions for Dummies please yhanks"
"I was looking for a good speaker to gift my mother. Thought this could be it, but I was wrong. I really didn't like it, but I am a busy lady and do not have time to send it back, so it just sitting in my house"
Stopped working after about two weeks. Can't get it to work even though fully charged!Any suggestions?Dave Eckel
"Tried for a month to connect this item. Finally got someone else to try, their phone and speaker connected to my phone easily and quickly. PulseSound never did. Bad purchase."
"Cute lights , sounds great , connects to Bluetooth easily ( instructions are extremely tiny ) . Charges just fine ( until )Purchased less than a month ago. After 2 weeks it started to get a ding noise every 20 minutes. Won’t stay charged . It finally just up and died . This is my second review bc the first was flagged . Not a great purchase. Don’t even want a replacement.1 star"
Does not work with phone anymoreYou hear the start up jingle but that's all.
Sound quality is great. Great deal for the price.  Definitely recommend.
Only lasted a month and it went out
"Works well enough. However, the edges around the top are like razor sharp. It cut my kids finger very badly. Unfortunately, we're throwing it away because we can't return it."
The voice muffed
The Tf card reader doesn’t work correctly. Pairing to the phone worked as expected.
"If you are looking for something that has a deeper sound quality in a small package keep looking.. It's definitely nice and small but the quality of sound isn't what I expected! The material was already beat up along the ""subwoofer"" and wasn't too durable.."
"Worked great. Until it didn’t. Battery died and I charged it for a couple hours. Red light went off, so I unplugged it and then it would not turn back on. Tried re plugging it in the next day. Red light came on, the. A couple hours later red light went off and still it will not turn out! Super upset bought for the playground at the school I teach at."
Held a charge once. Never would charge again. I think the way it pressed down to turn on must have been faulty. Unfortunately I got so mad I threw it away. I could have gotten a refund it looks like. Oh well. Total disappointment cry
"Speaker never worked …it simply will not power up. Unfortunately, I missed the return window so please learn from my mistake and pay close attention to your options or just save yourself the trouble and buy another product… one that actually works"
"I think I lost the short-charger Cable Yesterday, but it sounds great multifunctional buttons Automatic shut off volume control buttons timing feature On and off alert colors. Three months later this item stopped working and was a waste of money!! The auto shut off stopped first then the lights stopped working and I could not reconnect through Bluetooth so the speaker is useless."
Lights stopped working the first week.
"Started off fine, but within a month the speaker was emitting a high pitched metallic squeal noise anytime a device was connected. We tried many different devices. Will not buy another."
Poor sound quality
The sound quality and base sucks and there are way better speakers out there for the same price.
Obviously cheap and won't hold a charge. Can't get it to charge more than 10%.
"This is one of the worst speakers I have ever bought, it hardly has any volume my phone is legit louder than the speaker, and it doesn’t turn up. It’s also has sooo much static it’s not worth it, I threw it in the trash it was worthless, guess you get what you pay for though!"
I bought these for a kayaking trip this past weekend and they barely got wet and started shorting out. The play button was skipping songs and the volume button just kept turning it off. They would only pair for about 5 minutes before they would mess up again
"the minute water hit the speaker it started making a loud piercing sound, it was not submerged under water either,  it was on top of a cooler and got splashed. It will not turn back on or do anything. BIG WASTE of money"
"The volume buttons started changing the station and not working the volume. It won’t turn off unless you disconnect it from your phone, etc."
It worked fine for about a month. I've been trying to connect to the Bluetooth and it won't connect. Tried to send it back to get another one and it is saying that I am unable to send it back. Don't purchase this.
"I just received it, I am unable to charge it. I have to buy a USB CHARGER."
Says it’s waterproof but I took it on a boat. It got splashed with water and it stopped working and is completely broken. Definitely not waterproof or water resistant
I can’t get the lights to stop blinking.  It’s maddening.
The speaker doesn’t turn on after one time usage.
This worked great until it got wet. It’s advertised as waterproof but as soon as it got wet it stopped working.
It sounds awful. It's 2024 and it sounds like a cheap speaker from the 90s. I do not recommend buying this.
Did not produce quality sound or volume
I bought this for when we go swimming and there was absolutely no sound. Returned and bought something entirely different!
"While plugged in for charging and playing music, the charging port caught FIRE!! AVOID AT ALL COST!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
"Terrible product. Shuts off after 5 minutes or left. Even tried it plugged in, same thing. One to two songs, then it shut off."
This product was suppose to b waterproof but fell in the wTer one time and no longer works. Waste of my money
I accidentally dropped it into the pool and grabbed it immediately.  It no longer works.
Got a replacement
The pulsating lights stopped working the 2nd time I used it.  Very disappointing.
Portable BT speaker while riding my mobility scooter. Battery life was awesome whenever it lit up.last a good 8-10 hrs. The pulse effect was cute while it lasted
Drop it in the pool for a second and didn't work after that.
The speaker would show the different colors but never popped up as Bluetooth available. I was excited to get the item only for it not to work.
Keeps turning off.  I have been using for a few fats at the beach and keeps turning.  I missed the window to return.
Speaker quit when it got water on it.
It broke after a month of use
"I purchased two of these to work as a stereo pair in my apartment to obtain a nice full sound without having to really crank the volume to have an enjoyable experience and bother the neighbors.Well it all started out great, the white look clean and are small enough to not take up too much visual space.  They also sound fantastic for a battery powered speaker, relatively full low end and crisp highs without needing to be EQed. They are setup roughly 15’ feet from one another in opposing corners of my studio space.  They add presence and a fullness that I was missing from my Notabrick Bluetooth speakers.Now for THE PROBLEMS:I synced the speakers together and switched them to “stereo” mode from the app with no problem using my iPhone 13 Pro running Bluetooth 5.1.  When it was time to connect it to my stationary media hub it was intended for (a 2020 iPad 8th gen) it would only connect one speaker and not allow for a party link or stereo link between the two Charge 5’s anymore.  It took my some time of testing and no help from the internet to find out that the Bluetooth 4.2 that the iPad uses means the JBLs could no longer connect in a pair.  I figured they had their own connection protocol (perhaps wifi 2.4ghz) for party mode.  This shared audio functionality will ONLY work if your device that is sending audio is Bluetooth 5.1.SECOND ISSUE:So I put the iPad aside and would only be using my iPhone for music since that’s the only way I could get the Stereo mode to function.  But after 15-30 minutes of music playback the speakers will disconnect themselves from one another requiring you to manually go to them and reconnect themselves.  Every third time or so they will also drop the Bluetooth connection requiring you to “forget device” on your phone and resync Bluetooth to your host Charge 5 and then relink the speakers.This is all to say that if you want to use more than one speaker, even using a compatible Bluetooth 5.1 device that they are extremely finicky.  Using a single Charge 5 has proved to be very reliable, sound great and look great.  I am an audiophile and have many thousands of dollars in pro audio.The current tested Firmware version is 0.8.6.0 and has not been updated for over a year so this is unlikely to be fixed.UPDATE:  I purchased two Charge 4 speakers to run through all the same testing and scenarios as the newer Charge 5 Models and found that with the exception of the occasional dropout and auto reconnection (perhaps once every two hours or so) these have solved all my issues.  In fact, having the Aux plug on this model has also meant I can plugin my DJ decks to them when we are at the park and the primary speaker that is being plugged into will duplicate the signal and send it to the second speaker wirelessly with no issues.  There is about one second of lag with this setup so the use of my DJ headphones is a requirement, but I love the added functionality.  I also find the battery meters to be much more easy to read on the Charge 4.  Finally, I do not know if it's because the transmission power of the Bluetooth 4.2 in the Charge 4 over the Bluetooth 5.1 in the Charge 5, but I find that I get a longer transmission range with no dropouts with the older Charge 4 model.  On paper this should be backwards but testing 4 independent units in different scenarios have shown this to be recurring findings for me.  I have used the 2020 iPad, iPhone 13 pro and Macbook M1 pro and a HD Firestick as my test subjects.I do notice that the Charge 5 has a slight edge in real world testing for maximum volume and clearly has a crisper high end to it where the Charge 4 sounds a little more round but is still very pleasing to the ear.  I suggest to save a ton of money and pickup the Charge 4 if you are planning on using them in a multi speaker setup like me."
"I'll be as honest as I can be in this one. I've had this speaker for a year now and let me tell you, it sounds great. Bass is good, sound is clear, max volume is great. But. There's a but of course. Connectivity is the worst I've seen in any speaker. If your phone gets like 6feet away from the speaker, it starts bugging. I've had numerous issues where it wouldn't play any sound, or start or whatever. Then I had to reset. Still no good. Then you go through this process every now and then. I would say like 2-3 weeks it happens on regular basis. I would trade bass, sound, volume any day of the week for my speaker to work when I need it to work and stay connected to Bluetooth when I need it to. 3 stars."
"The charge 5 came very close to the perfect speaker to me. It sounds awesome, but it has 5 flaws that could make it a killer for you.1- It doesn't have a carrying handle or mounting points. I wanted to mount these speakers to my ceiling, in either a 1 or 2 pair (2 or 4 speakers), however it has no mounting points to do so, other than getting a silicone cover. It's not very heavy, but you don't want to throw this in a backpack either like that, because of point 2.2 The passive radiators are pretty exposed, and although most of the visible and touchable area is hard plastic, there's no say if a ballpoint pen or other won't puncture the softer silicone ring.3 This is just a mono speaker. Not stereo. That in itself isn't a killer deal, as these speakers sound amazing, and I wouldn't mind buying 2 of them, if it wasn't for the fact that apparently party mode (connecting more than 1 speaker together, either in multi-mono or in stereo configuration) is only possible on a cellphone or laptop.I could not get these speakers to pair together for my TV! Sure, 1 speaker works, but I wanted to use 2 of them for stereo sound... not possible on a TV.4 If you're planning on using this speaker in your car, the bass won't be loud enough.While JBL has the utmost best sound quality per size, trumping even Bose or Soundcore, and initially I found the speaker to be too bass heavy; at least in my living room. I did quickly adapt to the extra low end, and found ways to add even more, by placing it about a foot off the floor (+3dB bass), floor and wall (+6dB bass) or 1³ft off of a corner (either floor and 2 walls, or ceiling and 2 walls), and this tiny little guy could really face my larger Bic speakers, in both sound quality and bass volume!However, when taking it into a car, it's as if the low end volume disappears, even in a super quiet hybrid car. Perhaps due to the small cabin size, but definitely also because of the rumbling road noise, drowning out some of that sub 80Hz low end bass, making me wish I could increase the volume from 75 to 100%, without the loss of bass.5- the charge 5 doesn't like low volumes. Each click is a noticeable increase in low volume situations. But the charge really shines from 20 to 75% of volume. Anything over 75%, and the bass does not get louder, and the brights become shrieking, sharp or harsher treble noises.That being said, the charge 5 is loads better than any competitor below, and even some above.Side by side, I found that the charge 5 had punchier bass, nicer mids and brights than the xtreme 3, even if both the charge 5 and xtreme 3 are released about the same year.Up to 75% of volume, the charge 5 is my favorite speaker bar none, save for in the car.The lacking mounting points, difficulty or impossibility of pairing a stereo pair to my TV, or even put my charge 5 and Extreme 3 in stereo mode (as opposed to party mono mode), make this product short of a 5 star rating.I won't hold drowning out the bass in a car against it, for it is quite difficult to compete with even basic 4 speaker car radios these days.Though, the extreme 3,or even boombox 3 is a much better choice for hearing the low bass notes in a car."
Doesn’t last I want to say more than 4 1/2 hours it’s been less than a month it’s a bit lower than when I first opened it November 11th it’s December 6th and today it started this glitching noise like as if I was far away from the speaker and the Bluetooth was disconnecting
"I purchased this to replace an ancient Bose Soundlink Color which someone gave me second-hand because it would not hold a charge any longer. This JBL sounds hollow and cheap comparatively. No mids. Need to turn it up to get any sound definition and it’s just all bass and treble. The mids sound like they’re coming from another room. It also is very directional, you need to be straight in front of it for the best sound quality. For the price, I’m  returning this."
I had a charge 4 then it decided not to hold a charge anymore. So I got the charge 5 it’s decent but I wasn’t super thrilled with the price and the sound quality I received. I’m a die hard JBL guy I put sound systems in trucks with their products and they are awesome. This model was kind of a let down so I purchased a jbl flip 6 same day in person it’s pretty good and compares to the charge 5 so then I purchased soundcore boom 2 all received with in 24 hours tested all three and I think the boom 2 is better for sound but the charge 5 is better for taking places . I like music when I’m working so sound quality is important to me. I’d say skip the charge 5 get a more expensive model or save money get the flip 6 which is like the charge 5 or get good quality in this speaker bracket by getting the boom 2 for 100 bucks. Ps the jbl app to mess with EQ is lacking in customization and barely changes the sounds. Honest opinion I spent a lot of money in 24 hours and I choose the boom 2 this go around. Maybe JBL will do the charge 5 better next time
"Overall, I like the two speakers that I purchased. The sound is great, especially the bass. But connecting just two speckers for stereo is an excessively cumbersome process. It shouldn't be. My old OontZ speakers were much easier. If you want to connect 50 speakers, then the Charge 5 is for you. You Tube suggestions help some. Still exploring options."
"In less than two months, the speaker periodically loses connection to the phone.  The sound quality is great when it maintains connection."
"This thing is great sounding and everyone around is surprised how well it works and sounds. Great base and clear music, BUT I bought this Nov 2022 and it’s almost 2 years and the battery now doesn’t last more than 30min. I know it’s 2 years old but for the price I thought battery would outlast it, just makes think again before buying name brand when the generic lasts just as long.  Keep that in mind"
"This speaker sounds absolutely incredible! I was blown away by the bass! Highs and lows are balanced and the bass is heart throbbing even at the default equalizer setting. Also very loud even at low volumes. It’s great. Way better than the Megaboom 3 I returned immediately. USB-C is great though I wish the charger output also was USB-C instead of USB so I could charge my iPhone 15 pro without needing yet another cable, but I honestly won’t use it as a power bank probably. Buttons are responsive and quick to interact with iPhone via Bluetooth. Only 4 stars because I wish I could interact with Siri from the speaker and have the ability to go back track wise. I can only play/pause and skip forward on the speaker. My Bose Soundlink flex does this and I use that as my day to day speaker. I will use this JBL speaker for pickleball outdoors which is the reason I bought it. If JBL adds voice assistant support and a back button, this will be 5 stars for me and replace my Bose.Update: 12/29/23I ended up returning this product. It didn’t perform well outside. Could barely hear it even turned up without it sounding distorted. Also the lack of a back button and voice assistant support got to be annoying.I ended up purchasing the soundcore motion boom plus Bluetooth speaker and it is incredible. It has earth shattering bass and great sound even outside. It also has Bluetooth version 5.3 and supports back button as well as voice assistant integration with Siri from the speaker. The battery also shows up in the iOS battery widget which is great. I got it for $40 off the price so it’s about the same as the speaker I look forward to using it outside."
"(I want to give 3.5 stars but I can't do that) At first the JBL Charge 5 was awesome.  Now it's just a good speaker with a weak battery and no rubber strips on the bottom anymore.  When I bought this speaker, the battery did actually last about 20 hours as advertised at first.  Well, don't get used to it because with frequent use and charge, your battery life will become shorter and shorter over time.  After about a year, I noticed my speaker wad dying quicker and quicker, until it was dying fast enough that it was a problem.I use my speaker to listen to brown noise or rain sounds at night while I sleep, so I pick a 10 or 12 hour youtube video to sleep to.  Nowadays, my speaker will die in the morning after 7 ½ hours of playtime on medium volume, so I'm forced to leave it plugged in charging, otherwise it will die in the middle of my sleep and I'll wake up.The sound quality of the speaker itself is pretty good all around.  I've always been satisfied about how good the bass is.  With the price of this being $30 cheaper than what I paid for it back then, I suppose it still might be worth the purchase.Edit: a month after posting this review, now the battery lasts less than 6 hours.  Who knows how much shorter the battery life will get?"
"This JBL Charge 5 sounds great and looks amazing, I've got dozens of compliments at work.  Set up is easy and plays loud and clear.  The charging bank is a huge perk and tested the party boost with my son's while at the beach and worked perfectly.  Honestly it's almost perfect for my needs.  My one complaint would be the play time.  As advertised it says 20 hours playtime, which I can say with conviction, is definitely false.  I work 10 hour shifts and I am not capable of paying music consistently thought out each shift.  Day one and all is good, come day two barely 2 hours into my shift and the battery is already dying.  Could this be a one off? Possible, I won't write off JBL product as I have always had great interactions with their products.  But do your due diligence in reviewing which product will suit your needs best."
It will not connect to any previous Bluetooth speaker technology.  It party boost or nothing. Disappointing that they force tech upgrades through new models. That's why I gave it 3 stars.
"So as far as sound and battery life goes for music, it’s 5/5. I use it for bike rides and it brings awareness to pedestrians in front of me. Great.But I bought this thing and paid a premium specifically because of the power bank. Otherwise would have gotten a cheaper speaker. It is not called the Charge Beta. It is not called the Charge Alpha. It is not called the Charge 0. It is not called the Charge 1, 2, 3, or 4 either!!!! It’s called the all capital letters CHARGE 5!!!!!!!!! And the first time I go to use it to charge my phone…do you know what it does? It does NUH-THING!!!!! NOTHING!!! NO CHARGE!!!! And yes I tested the USB cable, and I tried other USB cables to no avail. It’s so frustrating that I now have to waste time going through a stupid warranty claim process. They better ship me one before I send this one back because I can’t ride my bike without my speaker. It’s too boring otherwise."
"Product is fine ... Amazon's poor customer service, not so much. Ordered the JBL Charge 5 on a Black Friday special ... then the price drops by $10 for Cyber Monday. Rather than return the item and order a new one, I contacted Amazon customer support asking for a $10 credit. The request was denied. I guess Amazon would rather issue a charge back to the JBL store (Seller), then collect more fees to accept the return and repackage, rather than just re-issue a credit. Extremely poor customer service. Won't order another JBL product - especially from Amazon - due to the pricing games and lack of customer support. Enjoy your chargeback JBL - I'm buying my replacement from Best Buy."
Bose has better sound quality for the same price
"I have a Bose Soundlink and tried to order another on sale in Dec.  They were sold out so I bought the JBL instead.  I wish I had not.  Bose has a better overall sound.  To compare;  JBL does not have as rich of a sound, and the Bluetooth connection is not as solid.  One of the most annoying things about the JBL is the sound control.  There is no fine adjustment.  It is blasting or soft.  I cannot recommend this speaker.Oh I almost forgot the Biggest reason not to buy this speaker -  the packaging.  It is huge & extremely wasteful.  A box inside of a box inside of a sleeve & on&on.  If they had spent some of that $ on r&d they may have produced something approaching the superior Bose product.  Send corporations a ""green"" message. Do not buy."
"this speaker is great sound quality wise. but functioning wise , it never turns off. most times i have to force power it off and that still doesn’t work sometimes. this causes it to be dead all the time and worst part is , i can’t even listen to music while it’s charging cuz it just turns on and turns right back off til it’s fully done. then dies as soon as i turn it on cuz im not able to turn it off."
Has good sound but my older charge four sounds a little better it’s got deeper bass than this one. I also didn’t like that the 3.5 mm phone jack was eliminated from the new one. It’s just not worth the $180 price tag
"I either had a Charge 2 or 3 before and it lasted me about a decade before the battery started swelling. It really was a great speaker. The Charge 5 is comparable in terms of sound quality and battery life, plus has the updated USB-C. The issue I have is that when I use my microwave it causes really bad interference. Sometimes (when my microwave is off) it'll pop and lag a tiny bit. I thought maybe I had a lemon so I submitted a warranty claim. They sent me a new one and it has the same issues, which is unfortunate. Just be forewarned if you have a microwave you may want to consider an older model, which don't seem to have this issue."
"The good; this speaker has really good sound for its size. The bad; the battery life! I'm getting 5, maybe 5 and a half hours from a charge, nowhere near the 20 hours claimed. And that's really disappointing, as I only bought it because I was tired of only getting 3 hours from the speaker I wanted to replace. And I've never even tried charging anything with it, can only assume that would kill the battery even faster, be lucky if you got a couple hours of play time then. I would not recommend this speaker to a friend."
"I had an issue with this charge 5 - the sound was good, but there was a delay on the beeps for microsoft teams messages, it would not beep and I'd miss teams calls all the time. Was good for music though. I reverted and got the charge 4 which has an aux port for my computer."
"Quite a few months ago I got this speaker because I figured, newer version, better speaker. I replaced my Charge 3 because the battery would not hold a charge any more when not on the charger.  I most often use my JBL charge 3 at work where there's a lot of noise coming off of machines, so the sound needs to carry while not being TOO loud. I feel like the sound for the Charge 4 just doesn't carry as much as the 3 does. I had read as well before buying that it only has speaker/s on one side of the device in comparison to there being speakers on both sides in the Charge 3 and the difference is very noticeable (to me) as I would put this speaker in the middle of the workspace. Now I only can hear the music on one side of the room and almost not at all 4 ft away on the backside of it. That being said the battery life lasts for quite a while just as the charge 3 did, I can use it for 2 hours at a time every day for about a week and a half which is what I expected from it.I haven't had to use it for charging other devices yet, nor have I exposed it to water but I feel like having the charging port not covered by a rubber seal may interfere with charging if there were ever 'water in the port' as my phone often does when there's even a hint of moisture in it. Feels like they could have put that charging port in with the usb charging location.Overall of course it's a good speaker, just a little underwhelmed by the output in comparison to the last model I had."
"I bought this speaker last month to replace a Braven 855S.  In June, I paid $139.95, now it's $179.95.  The sound is ok, not much bass or range.  I would expect better quality from JBL, but I guess not."
"My only complaint about the ""Charge 5"" is that it won't connect with older JBL portable speakers in ""Group Play.""  This was a big reason I bought one, but alas, JBL had to make them noncompatable with older speakers."
"First off this speaker sounds great. It’s a little tinny at the top but that may mellow out. The bass is rich and overall the speaker does a great job of occupying sonic space for its size. What is not great is the miserable Bluetooth functionality. I bought a pair of these after having owned several Cambridge Soundworks ‘OontZ’ speakers. Stereo pairing is relatively straightforward with those. And while the pairing via PartyBoost on the JBLs works ok from my iPhone, apparently the firmware update ruins the stereo pairing functionality for the iPad. You simply cannot link two speakers as a stereo pair via Bluetooth with these. This is utterly ridiculous considering how expensive they are and how much better other companies pull this off. I recommend buying one, but be forewarned that, at the moment, you will be hobbled if you’re trying to stream music to a pair with an iPad. PartyBoost? More like party bust."
"How is it 2022 and JBL devices can't replay songs/go to the previous track?It's absolutely baffling to me. It's a thing with all of their speakers, I've tried the Flip 6, the Charge 5, and the Clip 3. None of them have the ability to even press the play button 3 times quickly to replay a song or go to the previous track. It's incomprehensible tbh. That alone is why I took off a star. If that's not important to you (it likely is moreso than you realize), then it's probably 5 stars.I compared this to the Bose Soundlink Flex. Compared to that, it's got a louder max volume (I tested both outside on my rooftop on the same songs, right next to each other), plus I think the 5.1 bluetooth vs. the 4.2 leads to fewer cut-outs than the Bose did (my rooftop is pretty windy). From online/YouTube reviews, it seems like the audiophile can hear a slight decrease in JBL's in sound quality compared to the Bose's. I heard it a bit too, but realistically that's probably not the primary use case for a speaker like this.To me at least, volume, battery life, & durability are most important since I bought this speaker to play outdoors at a park/rooftop. I think this passes the test in all 3, but the last of a ""last/previous song"" button frustrates me to no end. Every other speaker in the world (including Bose) can replay a track. JBL, get your stuff together, I don't understand how this isn't as simple as a firmware update."
"UPDATING REVIEW: 04.12.2023: I bought a 2nd speaker for surround sound for my TV. Partyboost is not supported for TVs - only IOS or Android. JBL Advertises that you can connect ""100 speakers"" which is true for Phones, but is not supported for TVs or computers. They should be more clear and upfront about this because that's a pretty bid deal. The speaker is still nice, but I'm returning the 2nd one because my intended use was surround sound.I bought a new TV for my bedroom but didn't really want another soundbar, I have 2 of them already for other TVs so I thought I'd give this a shot. And wow, it exceeded my expectations big time. In fact, I'd argue the sound quality is more impressive than my soundbars. It's sturdy too - heavy so the quality feels right.The other plus is I can take it with me when I travel. Really happy about this purchase, If you're on the fence and looking for a quick sound fix, maybe even for multiple rooms, this is a great option. I can't speak the the battery life as of yet because I just put the darn thing in. Where I have it now it's plugged in."
"I thought it would be cool to order 2 flip 6 speakers and a flip 5. Boy was I disappointed to find that they are incompatible and only 2 work at a time. Come on, JBL, you can do better than that. Now I have an extra speaker that is incompatible with the other two. I am very disappointed not to mention out 140.00. Gordon Pearson"
"I got this speaker for my boyfriend as a gift, I am a very big fan of JBL growing up my household had JBL speakers, so i decided to get him this one. It only lasts a couple of hours after usage on a full charge which is really disappointing."
I think it’s a great Bluetooth speaker but you def don’t get 20 hours out of it maybe somewhere between 12 to 14 and that’s with turning it off when not using it other than that it’s loud enough to hear over my lift at work
"This speaker lasted for 6 hours after charging fully unfortunately kinda disappointed, was excited to have something that didn’t lose power at a party but alas, nothing is as good as it says. Has incredible sound though."
"I don't even know whether I like this or not,  It seems ok, I certainly wasn't blown away.  The irritating thing about it is when I went to register it, it asked me for several things I couldn't find.  It wanted a SKU.  I looked all over everything and couldn't find it.  I did the chat feature on the JBK website.  Marginally helpful and they never told me where to find it.  If they want you to supply them the SKU, you'd thing they'd make it a little EASIER TO FIND!  MAYBE IN BIG LETTERS ON THE BOX.  Then they wanted me to select a model.  CHARGE5GRY or CHARGE5GRYAM.  Again, no where could I locate what the difference was.  Again the chat feature on their website.  Again, marginally helpful.  Then they want a copy of the receipt.  I bought it on Amazon so there is only an order page.  I tried to copy and paste to a document and they will only let you upload a picture.  Again, chat feature no help.  I got it registered but have no idea whether I registered the right product and there is no receipt uploaded.  So registering (or not) this product took almost an hour.  Any and all JBL goodwill was totally destructed by this farce."
"I use this speaker while working in a warehouse. It had decent sound and an okay battery life. as I worked around  a lot of machinery It was often needed to play my music louder with definitely made the batteries life seem short.After about 3 months of using it probably about 5 days a week 5 hours a day It no longer seems to accept a charge. I've tried numerous different outlets plugs and even a high dollar outlet that would tell me how many amps / volts a product can accept and is accepting.I can't say whether it's the battery that's not accepting the charge or the port that's not working, but it's not working anymore.I don't know if there's any return repair or warranty available for me. I'm definitely disappointed after the money spent on this thing that it didn't last but three months"
Manufacturers claims that the battery lasts for 20 hours but it doesn’t lasts for more than 4-5 hours at 80 percent volume.
I've been with JBL for 15 years; before that it was Bose.I'm disappointed with my purchase. Next time I'm buying Bose!!!
"Holds a charge like a toilet paper diaper! How is it possible to have a brand new product, charge it fully before use and only be able to use it twice for a few hours before it starts blinking red? It states after full charge it will play 20 hours. Nope. Also, it takes literally 4 to 10 or MORE hours minimum to get a full charge. Sounds like old school house speakers but completely unreliable. Used JBL most of my life and thought I'd found a winner. Guess not. Will charge after every use from now on. In all the many languages provided for instruction, it does NOT state what the recommended jack should be. Phone, dollar store, etc. Tried using highest quality jack/USB plug; fast charging, normal and everyday and no difference. Very disappointed I can't jam more than once w/o having to top off and I've only used it 2 times having to charge both times using less than 6 hours. Even turned off the battery  drains in a temperature controlled atmosphere? Dude. Sad. AI apparently will take over my review from here as it does with ALL aspects of Amazon products. Starting to dump my lists and shop elsewhere more reliable and with customer service that actually makes sense especially when speaking in person. Size, nice. Charge, sucks. Durability, tbd."
"For the size the bass is ok, overall the unit left me “meh”.  A bit pricey.  Upped register is crisp and clean.  Better than the unit I eventually kept.  Lower register is lacking.  If size is critical then give this unit a try.  I was tempted to try one of the large JBL unit(s) but not at 4-6 hundred $."
I bought this to replace my JBL charge 3 that finally took a crap.  I like that it's now USBC instead of micro usb to charge it. That's the only improvement over the 3. I've noticed the sound quality is slightly worse. The highs are slightly crisper but it's not as smooth or loud sounding as the charge 3 was.
"As an owner of a couple Charge 4s I was curious what possible improvements could be made to a near flawless design...well they actually have made a few great improvements.... but with a major caveat!! :( 😡 - it doesn't pair with a Charge 4!!! Only 'party mode' type JBL speakers and Charge 4 is a ""Connect+"" design. FAWK!Unfortunately I had to buy two to also realize the graphic eq which I thought was so wonderful doesn't work with more than one speaker. - FAILMy issue with the 4 was not being able to make it waterproof without first removing the magnetic port system I use with all my devices. The 5 keeps the charge port exposed and accessible and still waterproof (only tethering /charging out the USB output you'll need to open the rubber hatch), so for me this was a much needed alteration. I have always found the Charge 4 and now the 5 to have the longest battery life of any of the dozens of speakers I've used. So took away 2 stars for not being able to use all my JBLs to play from the same device, and not being able to use the new eq with them as a pair."
Battery does not last for more than 10hrs. Idk how bad it would be if it was actually charging something.
It came with NO instructions. And did not have phones it would pair with.
"Sound quality is great, part boost is a nice feature, but it only works with phone (maybe tablet, but i did not check). I needed the feature for my computer in my classroom. Since it doesn’t work, I will be returning the 2 that I purchased. Apparently this has been a problem for almost 3 years.  Unfortunately I counted on the JBL reputation and did not look this up until I was having trouble with the set up. Really sad as I wanted this to be the solution to my volume problem."
After 3 months the power switch doesn’t work
Thought it would be louder for the price
"Big name JBL claiming 20 hour battery life. Didn't last eight hours. It might make 20 hours if you have it so low you got hold it against your ear maybe 20 hours , but at normal volume never will it make 20 hours"
Wish I would have ordered on the JBL website for the warranty isn’t available when buying it from here apparently and I needed a shipping number that was from jbl. So if you want lifetime warranty- don’t purchase from here.
"JBL makes the best blue tooth speaker for your money.Sound is super clear (up to the max) and very long lasting battery.  Great look made with premium material and construction.  The best.UPDATE : I have been using it for a couple of weeks and since a week ago, I have realized that this speaker has some bluetooth connection problem.  The connection drops just too often and in order to get it established again, I had to disconnect & reconnect the speaker.  This issue has been happening more frequently as days go by, so I have returned the unit a day ago.  Not sure it is an isolated case, but I think that JBL needs to look into this issue."
Good sound and good bass. That price though. You can find better in that price range.
Is ok not as loud as advertised
"The little rubber grips on the bottom of the speaker are coming loose and hanging off. I've had it for just over a year, so that means it's out of warranty according to JBL. If you don't care about the looks of it, then this speaker's great. But I take this speaker on the set, and it shouldn't look raggedy when people find the source of the music. Disappointing."
"Bought to replace an older version, so it sat in the box for most of the warranty year. Charged it up and played it for a couple of hours one day. Several months later and only a couple of weeks past replacement, topped off the charge 5 for a cruise. Fired it up and the distortion was so bad, couldn't play at any level. Snap, crackle pop junk. JBL offered send in for repair at my cost or a coupon code for a 30 pct of new. When I tried to redeem that they jacked the order up so bad, they still don’t what happened to it. I ordered two day delivery on their site and it took them five days to tell me they couldn’t locate the order. I needed it for a trip, so fail. Have never had such a failure ecommerce experience ever in 25 years. Ridiculous.Have several other jbl/HK bluetooth speakers. Hell, bought them plenty as prize giveaways and for our company’s tradeshow booths. Between junk product and rotten purchasing process/experience, I’m done."
"The battery saving feature on these speakers to shut them off after 15-20 min almost makes me want to return them.  If you pause your music to take a 20 min phone call, you have to walk over and turn the speakers back on when you're done.  Everything else about the speakers is great."
"We had to return this one. It sounded broken like the speaker was damaged. The sample one at target sounds pretty good though! Good bass, loud and vocals were clear but not crisp. We opted to try the Xtreme 3 for more money and we'll see how it goes!"
Honestly the speaker sounds amazing but I'm pretty disappointed with the battery like 20hoirs is just a straight up lie .. I got about 6 the first day of use at 100% Volume I feel like JBL definitely could put a better battery in it for the price they're charging....
The left side of the speaker does not make sound though it still has the bass vibration. I’ve been using it anyway and still a solid speaker but putting it next to another one of the same speaker it’s a lot quieter
"Bluetooth connects well and easily amazingly. It charges, type C port. The sound is the issue. All midrange, just poor quality sound, sound like a cheap portable radio from the 70s or one of those compact stereos you bought in 1979 sadly."
"Product is great. Did not receive by the time stated when ordered, had to return."
It's a great speaker! It sounds amazing but the reason I got this particular one is because they advertised that it holds a charge for 20 hrs....it does not...I would've given 5 stars if it had
"The sound on ONE Charge 5 is great. I got two bc I wanted stereo. But when the two speakers are connected for stereo, they cut out/stutter CONSTANTLY. This is such a disappointment. I've tried every solution I can find online. But it's a constant battle. Also: They can play stereo only through the app; so I haven't been able to find a way for them to play stereo on my laptop. The last frustration is that the app does have an equalizer -- but not when the speakers are connected for stereo. I guess I'll return one of them."
"It is probably a good, but it came without usb-c cable and instructions. Could not pair with iPad, only with iPhone. Amazon’s product support was not helpful. Just told me to send it back."
At first it was good untilThe update happened then the speakers started to skip and not sound right I returned both charge 5s it was nice but the crackling sound terrible
"Flip product has a better sound. This product, after 40% volume, the sound is not the best and the sound is strident. I suggest to look a better product."
"I can't even go 28 feet without this thing cutting out. I hate that it has different connectivity depending on the jbl speakers you have - you can connect the Flip 5 to a Charge 5, but if you had a Charge 4, no luck. So don't buy this thinking all JBLs connect together because they've made it as stupid as possible. I bought two Flip 5s to connect to an existing Charge 4, that didn't work, so I had to pony up for this Charge 5, now they can connect together BUT you have to be super close together. Forget thinking you can have one speaker in your kitchen, one on your garage, and one in your bedroom so you can listen to podcasts as you work around the house. The only thing these are good for is having one speaker in one corner of the room and one speaker in the other corner. Hopefully you have small rooms."
20 hrs run time is not even close maybe 10 hrs if that it fails in 1 night i had an old off brand speaker that would last a whole weekend and yes i charged it this morning and started it around 2ish pm it is now 12:45 am and the speaker is dead dont expect a long run time sound is great tho
"Those who don’t have high requirements can consider buying it, but those who have a little bit of requirements are not recommended."
Battery 4 hrs if your lucky not worth the $
"Just to be 100% clear, I was JBL's biggest brand ambassador for portable speakers until just yesterday. Many people bought JBL flips and charges because of my suggestions. I purchased my Charge  November 9, 2021, and yesterday, right in the middle of teaching a dance class, the bluetooth button died and my speaker became useless. I've probably only used that button a total of 50 to 100 times since I bought the speaker, and I've definitely babied that speaker.My last JBL Charge lasted so long I ended up passing it off to my teenage kid. He still uses it. That's a huge difference.I'm in a hurry so I already ordered another one. This particular model still has the best sound per size, best bang for the buck, it's mostly waterproof, all that. all that. On paper and to the ear, it's a brilliant speaker. But that's the last time I recommend this speaker or this brand to my dancing friends. And I got an extended warranty, and will likely pick up a spare speaker just in case this JBL breaks.Good brands don't engage in planned obsolesce."
So I’ve just got figured I could use for work to charge my phone while I listen to music. It said 20hr play time but it went from 100% 20% in less than five hours after it charged all night. Will have to see what it does after I recharge it again
"I have had several of the smaller JBL bluetooth speakers and liked their sturdiness and sound quality, I splurged and purchased the Charge 5 as I listen to audio from most of my work day. From day one, I had problems the the Charge 5:--It would frequently turn itself off within 30 seconds of no sound coming thru—this would happen easily 8-10 times a day. (I know that it shuts itself off after a certain period of silence, but 30 seconds? C'mon.)--It also couldn't seem to handle sound coming from more than one source on my laptop--if I had been playing iTunes (yes, I still use it occasionally) via the Charge and then switched a YouTube video, the sound would come from my laptop speakers until I disconnected and reconnected the bluetooth connection. The same thing would happen in I went from YouTube to Spotify, etc.The following things would also happen but with less frequency:--Occasionally, the Charge would refuse to turn off--no amount of pressing the power button would cause it to turn off and the only workaround was to plug the Charge into a power source and then turn it off and on again;--Finally, on a related note, the Charge would occasionally drop audio altogether and make this horrendous high pitched buzz and, again, you couldn't turn it off via the power button—it had to be plugged into a power source to turn off/on and get the buzz to stop.Overall, an expensive disappointment."
"Initially bought this for a road trip while the stereo was out in my suburban. Even on the front seat no one could really hear it. It was more noise than it was worth. Arriving at a job site, my Buddy just picked up a $29 Black Friday deal at Home Depot. Not as impressive to look at but had USB port and a 5” speaker AND spanked the JBL in overall output.Final straw- winter ice storm- no power for several days…You’d think this might charge my phone? Nope. Dead in the water.The build quality is nice. It’s probably cute if you work in an office cube. It’s not not up to my expectations - sorry"
"JBL saying they dont sell the battery, you need to take to a repair shop. My only repair shop in Denver is way up north and his answering machine message sounds like he repairs them in his garage, buying a non OEM battery on ebay showing bad reviews."
"I would love to give it at least 4 stars but it hasn't been much of a great product. For the first few times of use it was great, sound was good, connection was good. But after a few times of use I notice I would not get any sound while I was connected to bluetooth. Didn't really bother me I would just reconnect and it was fine. Soon it was almost everytime. I would like to reach out to the seller if I could and see if I could possibly replace it since I'm a month passed the return mark. Could be just a bad speaker that I got lucky with. I'm sure they were built to last more then two months. Then maybe I'd change my mind if being a bad product."
Didnt last long for as much as i paid for it … super disappointing
I have a JEBL boombox 3 and wanted something to pair it with but there was no comparison it is just not worth the money
I purchased this speaker since my UE finally died after 5 yrs. I work 6 hr shifts on Saturdays and this is when I can blast my music since no one else is at my shop. I been using this JBL charge 5 for two weeks now and I and really unsatisfied with the battery life. At full volume it sounds really good not a lot of bass but it’s nice and clear. At full volume It only lasted for 3-1/2 hrs. At 80 % of the volume it last for 4 hrs. At 50 % of the volume I got around 5 to 6 hrs. I kinda paused it a couple of times to answer my phone. I was never able to get close to at lest 10 hrs. I would have been satisfied with at lest 10 hrs at full volume.
"Connects seamlessly, great battery, lows sound pretty good. However mids and highs sound totally washed out, even at modest volume, like they are being played inside a tin can. I've had a Bose soundlink bluetooth speaker for nearly 15 years. That speaker was a pain to connect, the battery wasn't great. But the sound quality was wonderful. My Bose finally bit the dust. Internet said this JBL was the best speaker at any price point, it just isn't.  If you halfway care about sound quality I'd give this one a pass. It really does sound like a $20-$30 speaker."
"Not as good of quality as my friend’s speaker, so I returned it and upgraded to the JBL extreme 3."
"I use an equalizer app on my phone. I previously had an Aomais Life (good looking speaker) I thought and still think it's a pretty good speaker, but ... this JBL Charge 5 is definitely a step up. You can definitely tell the difference with the JBL Charge 5 as it sounds fuller and has a more refined sound.UPDATE:  Unfortunately I have decided to return this .. I feel like I should be getting more in a speaker for the amount I paid. The battery life sucks and other reviewers are correct that it doesn't handle any overdrive on the volume all that well. Now the speaker itself sounds fantastic, but at this price and those 2 cons I mentioned .. it's not justifiable keeping this past the return date."
Party function doesn’t connect to the charge 4.  So I can’t use them in stereo
Sounds good. Not as loud as expected but good sound good bass.  Worked about 2 months and now isn't charging. Tried different chargers and moving it around. Seems like somthings loose inside that won't let it charge. Overall very disappointing. Also the battery when it was fully charged only lasted about 3 to 4 hours. Not the long life that was promised
I bought two of these over the past few years from Amazon and after about a year or two it will no longer take a charge.  I wouldn’t mind so much but paid a lot of money for each one and now the second one is done. Buy the insurance.  Disappointed.
"I purchased the JBL Charge 5 in July 2022. Despite constant use, I had zero issues with the speaker until the last week of December 2022 in which the audio completely went out. Resetting the device alongside updating the firmware/software in the JBL Portable app did not resolve the issue.When I reached out to JBL support, they were claiming that I was already out of the warranty period because I purchased the product from Amazon. This is contrary to the fact that their website says: ""Unless a different warranty period is stated in the Warranty Card provided with your JBL product, JBL warrants for a period of 1 year (5 years for any non-powered speakers) from the date of retail purchase by the original end-use purchaser, that this product, when delivered to you in new condition, in original packaging, from a JBL authorized reseller and used in normal conditions, is free from any defects in manufacturing, materials and workmanship. Refer to the Warranty Card provided with your JBL product for specific details including what is not covered along with other terms and conditions.""JBL offered to give me 35% off a new speaker directly from their website as a courtesy.I don't grasp how this speaker has a near-perfect rating on Amazon. I'll be purchasing a new bluetooth speaker from a different manufacturer instead. Preferably one who will actually provide support in their warranty period."
I must’ve been one of those lucky people that it arrived defective for . The reviews were great I was so excited for this purchase even more since Amazon takes payments on it and my kids broke my first jbl charge 3. I bought the red one and the box came perfectly in tact . I turned it on it played for about 20 seconds then turned off . I tried charging it and turning it back on and it turned on and connected to my phone but just made a little weird sound here and there I turned it off and turned it on again and it then made no sound at all not even the turning on and off sound . So my guess is its not going to work at all . Returning the one I received and getting a replacement one . Hopefully it works 🥲UPDATE: since using the first one i received my phone has been Messing up so bad it doesn’t send messages anymore and my Bluetooth connects and disconnects and my messages dissapear. I think the first one I got had some kind of virus like maybe someone returned it like that and I got a bad one . That being said the new one I received today as a replacement has been working so far . Could sound a little better for the price though my old speaker I felt like was louder at the highest volume but I still like it. Gonna keep the box incase it messes up before the month return period ends .
Disappointed after 3 Charge4’s that I loved.Returning.
"UPDATE: I listen to it every day, I calculated, I use 30% volume, the battery is only ten hours of power!  deduct one more star! The sound quality is very good, but I found that if you use wifi to play with your phone or put a baby monitor next to the Charge 5, the music will become a bit choppy!  So remind not to put the baby monitoring machine next to it!  Or use wifi to play mobile phone!  Stay away!  Or sit far away."
I loved this speaker and the sound while it worked. It won’t reset or charge. I only used it like 10 times. Disappointed because this is supposed to be a good brand. Guess I’ll go back to Bose
"I retired my 2016 JBL Flip 4 and ordered both the Charge 6 and Flip 6. The flip 6 has underwent some big driver changes and really packs a bass punch now while delivering the same great sound, throw it on the ground durability, and waterproofing.But this is a charge, and I couldn't see the value here compared to the 6. It was bigger, but hardly sounded bigger. It was bulky, so the battery lasted longer, but the flip already lasts a full day hike.If this is just gonna sit in your garage, maybe it's for you, but I'm not totally sure if it has a great seat in the market."
I really like the portability and sound of this speaker. Only problem I'm having is the speaker won't take a full charge so dies way faster now.
"Nothing new compared to previous JBL speakers. I have had 3 before this. I bought this one expecting it to be louder and last longer based on the price. I wanted to like it, but I must admit the sound was disappointing and the battery life is actually comical. '12 hours' is such a joke, when playing at max volume the battery not only dies in less than an hour, but it will die WHILE you're charging it. Yes, I double checked that it wasn't an issue with my charging cable. You can charge this thing for 3 hours while it's off and play it for MAYBE 40 minutes at max volume before it shuts off. At this price I think I could have bought a big box speaker and just kept it plugged in. This'll be my last JBL.Edit: I'm actually amazed at this point at how bad it is. You can't use this while mobile (so don't bring it on a bus, RV, boat). I was being generous initially, but wow, I can't believe how much money I spent on this. I actually gave it away to my sister. I've bought another speaker for my 4th of July party. It's incredibly bad. Seriously, DON'T BUY THIS."
The JBL charge 5 worked great for about 3 months (great sound and plenty loud) but won't shut off now. So I have to disconnect the bluetooth each time. Then every time I want to listen again I have to pair them up again. Very annoying. Makes me wonder when it will stop working all together.UPDATE--I looked on the product website and found out how to reset the JBL and it is working fine now!
"Although the JBL Charge 5 is larger and more expensive, it’s not much of an upgrade from my charge 3.  The 5 cannot be connected to phones / players that need to be connected via cable.  It also evidently cannot be used as a speaker/phone.  No charge included either.  That’s not progress in my view.It does sound very good and is “adjustable” using the JBL app. Sound is as good as the 3 and may have a tad more bass response."
"I really enjoy the sound of the speaker. However, the rubbber Gray/grips at the bottom of the speaker are already starting to come off after four months of ownership. This is unacceptable from JBL. Try using glue that’s not from China. For the amount of money that I paid for this, they should have somebody come over here from JBL and personally glue this piece of crap back together. Now I have to send it back in for replacement just for that nonsense.Get your act together JBL, there’s a lot of competition out there, this is not 1980 anymore ."
"The battery burns out in a rather short time. I have 4 different bluetooth speakers over the years and this one is by far the shortest life, perhaps 5 hours before it starts that annoying beep. The documentation is in several languages and as far as I can tell there's no way to turn the beeping off.Here's the bad thing: I plugged it into the USB ports on my monitor overnight to charge. Not playing any sound. I know that my stupid monitor doesn't send power to its USB when the monitor is off, but plugged it in when I was still using the monitor.  So apparently even if it isn't picking up anything via bluetooth, if it isn't deliberately turned off on the speaker it burns battery.  It woke me up with it's '20% power left' beeper at 5 AM.It's a good speaker, but if you want to use it consider leaving it plugged into power all the time. Oh, also must be 'linked' each time on the computer. Meaning about 5 clicks on the computer and then a looooong wait for it to do that. Sigh. My older ones would link as soon as I pressed a button on the speaker."
"I was shopping for a replacement for my old DKight Magicbox II that has seen better days. I bought both this and the Anker Soundcore Select 2S because they were both highly rated and a similar price. I found this speaker to have better quality and volume of sound than the old Magicbox, but was much more shrill (particularly at loud volumes) than the Anker. This speaker did have better top end volume, but the shrillness factor was just too much for me. Ultimately I returned this speaker and kept the Anker"
"May be 10$ is what it woth.No good sounds,  no bass, no tremble at any volumes. Bad bad bad thing. Returned."
Not as convenient as expected. Need to adjust the volume each time turn on the speaker.
Forget trying to read the controls on the top without some light because they're black in color and so is the rest of it making it difficult to view the controls. Wish it came with a protective case. I'd pay a bit more to have one included.
Too small to read. Stereo okay
"Although there's nothing particularly wrong with these speakers, there's also not enough particularly right to get more than three stars from me.First, the right.They're certainly affordable.  And I say ""they"" because, as I always do, I bought two.  I can never expect or demand serious sound from a single speaker, so I make sure that any new acquisitions I make have the TWS feature so I can pair them to provide stereo sound and allow them to prove what they can do.These NOTABRICK 15(?!) Watt speakers charge quickly thanks to the USB-C cables, don't shout ""BLUETOOTH"" or ""POWER ON"" or any other unnecessary and obnoxious things, which is a huge relief.  One star.They also pair together per instructions seamlessly, and link to the source device (phone, in my case) without any hiccups or glitches.  Two stars.They appear to bee solidly constructed,  claim to be waterproof, and there is no obvious reason to dispute that, since the charging ports are securely sealed with rubber flaps that should do what they're intended to do, i.e., keep the water out (although I haven't tested that and don't have any good reason to at this point).  Three stars.It's the sound itself that keeps the stars at three for me.  Nothing about it is noteworthy. Average best describes it.  Three stars average.  Average bass, average mids, average depth.  I knew when I purchased these (based on the price and my unfamiliarity with the NOTABRICK brand) that I shouldn't expect too much, so in that way I can't say I'm greatly disappointed.  Pleasantly surprised would have been better, however.  Blown away was unrealistic, and I certainly am not.The strap that's attached to each speaker is nice.  I like that.  Makes it easier to grab them or hang them from something.  There's a woofer on the bottom that doesn't bark very loud, but is functional.Overall, these are serviceable, at best.  They power on, they link, the batteries stay charged for hours at moderate volume levels.  But you won't have any heads turning (including your own) or people asking what brand they are or where you got them because they sound so amazing.  Guess the name says it all: they're not a brick.  Just average speakers. Out..."
Sounds ok but no bass. Returning
Overall it's ok for what I use it for.  Just not loud enough.  I'm keeping it. Ok for the price.
Low volume it's tinny but at high volume it sounds better but the price was right.
"It's definitely loud enough and doesn't blister out at high decibels, but, it's very tinny. Almost no bass."
"Occasionally randomly cuts, battery doesn't last long, but very convenient and sounds good"
"When you can connect, this speaker has great sound for its size. I bought it for work and I travel a lot so it's a great size. The problem: it disconnects from my computer when Zooming and it doesn't always want to pair with my cell phone. I JUST missed the return window. Disappointed."
"There was so much about this bluetooth speaker that I liked:*  No obnoxious logos with nonsensical Chinese-invented English words; just beautifully plain.*  Solid-feeling; seems high-quality construction*  Bluetooth connects almost instantly, and instead of some loud beep or word caed out, just the sound of a gentle throat-clearing.  I really liked how they took the time to have a low volume, inoffensive connect sound; ditto with disconnect/power off.*  the sound is great considering the size.  You will never have booming bass in such a little package, but this delivers a good mix of treble, midrange, and bass - and if you place the unit on some surface that resonates, the bass improves considerably.*  Battery lasts a long time*  That said, I recommend you stay away from this item!  Why?  For 30 days it worked perfectly.  Then, it started beeping - a two-tone beep - every 60 seconds, silencing what I was listening to during the beep, and then it would resume for another 60 seconds.  The broken-English instructions gave no clue about what to do, but I tried everything to reset it, and yes, I fully charged the battery.  Instead of the white light showing it was on and connected, it constantly flashed a multi-colored disco light show, as if it was trying to connect (it already was) or maybe was just somehow possessed by the devil.  So frustrating, because I really liked it, but don't say I didn't warn you:  If and when it starts that loud 60 second beeping with no way tofix it, it will drive you batty!"
Didn't have the loundness
Could not get them to sync for a surround sound experience. Also one would emit a buzzing sound periodically
"They should remove the active extra bass in the description, the bass is weak on this.  Love the size but had to return because the bass is not there."
I got strange radio stuff on it.
my daughter loved it and it was easy to connect
It isn’t loud by any means. You turn it up and sound gets distorted.  Not loud. Bass isn’t even existent returned.
"This speaker is literally sounds horrible. Assume that people giving reviews of them have never owned a good bluetooth speaker. I opened this up and immediately could hear how bad the bass was and how tinny sounding it was. I immediately took out my old JBL3, which has spec wise has less watts then this one. The JBL is head and shoulders above this thing. This is a sub $20 speaker, anyone with a good ear would agree. Cheap internals on this, the outside looks good. Another dead giveaway is it very light. If you know much about sound, a light speaker isn't a good thing as sound is vibration based."
"Each time we have to go through selecting the source, adjusting the volume. It doesn't remember any settings."
I'm disappointed in the sound quality and the lack of a USB port.
"Brought this on December 5 2022, the return date is January 31st and it stop working today in February 8, 2023! I turn it on the blue light came but won't connect to my phone bluetooth. I tried turning it off and the blue light is coming off. I pressed and hold and nothing. Just a waste of money I only got two months of play time!.UPDATE ON SPEAKERafter trying different troubleshooting methods it started working again. I am pleased because I really like the quality of this speaker. My phone picks up from a good distance and it is loud for a small speaker. I will keep updating.UPDATING THE UPDATE!The company reached out to me! And they offered to send a replacement! Which they did, the delivery was expedited. VERY GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!! I really do love the quality of their speaker. I appreciate it Notabrick! Thank you 😊"
"This little speaker has ZERO bass output! It's nice and lightweight so I was looking forward to taking it on my upcoming trip, but I literally get better sound out of my s24, which doesn't even put out that much sound.Returned it expeditiously!"
"It worked great, then one day it quit.  I called Amazon-the lady said,”Sorry your 30 days are up!”  Before it quit I wouldn’t have thought of returning it!!"
The speaker works great sounds amazing but I purchased it for it's 15 hour battery life. I took it to work and it was dead within 4 hours. Very disappointed 😞
I have only had this product for less than three months.  First time I charged it charged fine worked well.  Just went to charge it again and it will not charge. Tried to reach out to the company and email comes back undeliverable.  Stuck with a brick.
"I don’t understand where all of these 5 star reviews are coming from but ahhh, no. Don’t get me wrong the price is right and it works but it sounds like it’s under water mostly fuzzy bass. I’ll be returning this and investing in a more expensive one. Just saying. ✌🏼🇺🇸"
"If you are buying this for the ability to play music from the microSD card, look elsewhere.  I have another speaker that plays the microSD card when you turn on the speaker.  This one does not work that way.  If the microSD card is present when you turn the device, no music is played.  You must eject the microSD card and reinsert, then the music will play.  This adds wear to the waterproof tab that covers the microSD card and the charging port.  What a terrible design!"
"unreliable connection to laptop 6"" away - dead now. Decent sound when it worked"
I LOVED this and didn't even use it that much. But it began to not hold a charge well and now all it does is turn on and automatically turn back off. I have tried everything and nothing works to fix this issue.
"Good speaker and can go very loud, but absolutely zero bass so the music quality is not good."
"I use this as a noise machine (paired with my phone) at night, plugged into USB power on a bedside table. It sounds decent for its size and configuration. However, when plugged into a USB power source, the process to power the unit on requires a weird sequence of two different buttons with a long press. I figured this out through trial and error. After a month or so, it's not even doing that consistently. When not plugged in, the power button just works as is indicated it should in the instructions. So I now have to unplug it from USB charger, turn it on, and then plug it back every night. Kind of a pain. Also, the SD card is no size I've ever seen - not sure what standard it is but doesn't accept the micro SD typically used in cell phones. These two aspects make the purchase a bit of a disappointment, thus the 2 star rating."
Good sound quality. Easy to connect. Bass is not that great but I’m not complaining for the price you get these speakers for.
Poor instructions. It won't work most of the time with my bluetooth on my pc. I am not happy
I bought four of these and gave one set to my girlfriend. They are very loud! Sound quality is poor. I also own a set of the Sony SRS-XB13s. The Sony SRS-XB13s are not as loud as these but they have a much better sound quality by far. These would be great for TV or a podcast. If you want your music to sound good invest a little more money in the Sony SRS-XB13s.
"This speaker is the same look as wonderboom. The bass is not as rich and loud. For the price , it’s a decent speaker."
"Pro: It's only good if you have those heavy, loud base music.Con: Not so much for those regular music. When you listen to it with those regular light base music, you can hear the singer's voice loud and clear. But the background music gets drown out by the booming sound from the base. Not your typical regular speaker."
"I had this speaker for less than a week and was initially impressed with its size, sound quality,and portability. It was advertised as IPX6 waterproof meaning its capable of withstanding some water (more like water resistant, not waterproof), so I felt confident taking it on our paddle board. It got minimally wet and now the buttons do not work properly and it keeps skipping to the next song randomly.I wasn't expecting much for the price but that's pretty disappointing."
The product works but I have not figured out how to keep it from echoing on the other end when the person talks to me. Fast shipping. Probably wish I had looked for something better. I guess the seller doesn't care because I haven't gotten a response yet
Doesn’t allow another Bluetooth connection onto the speaker unless the primary connection disconnect. Considering returning the speaker
"If you listen to a podcast, for example, the speaker remains on after the podcast is over. So unless you turn off the speaker it will stay on and lose its charge.Also, the buttons on top of the speaker are almost un-detectable. They blend in with the background."
It doesn't stay charged.  It is difficult to pair.  It's a horrible speaker.
I never received this item. The delivery person lied and said it was delivery when the picture showed it still in his delivery bin. The manufacturer keeps asking me to return in order to get a refund but I can't return something I never received. I will not order from this manufacturer again.
"This thing is small, hefty, and looks nice. Problem is that the rope on it for portability is always getting loose so maybe change it out of use glue to keep it tight."
"this was a gift, but it was not the best quality or sound"
"If you are only concerned with how loud it gets, you’ll be fine. However, the sound quality is unbalanced and harsh. There are better options at $25, and much better options at $50."
This is a light weight speaker but it doesn’t always connect to the TV upon turning it on.  The battery also doesn’t seem to charge all the time.
It was discounted from nearly $80 to $20 - but is worth less than a $20 speaker!The bass and treble quality is poorer than the $10 speaker I have - though this has a battery and USB-C charging included.I would spending a little more and getting better quality sound.
This speaker will not charge after being exposed to water once. Now it's useless since I'm past my return date.
Wont pair. Supposed to give blue light and only gives red light when plugged in and there instructions are spelled wrong and do not mention anything about a red light. Save your frustration.
The speaker is already starting to sound scratchy after a coupleOf weeks. But it has decent sound a d a decent battery life (2-3 hours).
"Loud enough, quick pairing, microphone is not clearStopped working after 6 months"
"I just received the speaker. Very easy and fast to see it up. The sound volume is great. Missing the base. It’s ok for a pool party or kids' birthday party, but not for those who listen to music seriously. Made in China, cheap loud portable speaker is what it is."
Easy to use with long battery life. Don’t buy if you’re looking for good bass.
It’s small and it’s a bit loud. The quality of sound isn’t the greatest. It’s a bit crunchy sounding.
could not get to work my fault
Speaker looks nice in its minimalism but the sound quality is muffled. The speaker had one job…
"8 months after purchase it abruptly bricked-- the power button will not even work to turn it off. There is an LED light on top that apparently will stay lit forever now, because even the power button stopped responding.I really don't understand how electronics can abruptly fail like this after 8 months, but it is funny that the only device I've ever owned that I can say ""bricked"" was called Notabrick."
"Soubd is great , pairs well. Battery life poor, cannot use while charging either, if you do it won't charge. Disappointed.  The oonz was good also, but they die after 3 months,  won't charge, I've had 3 of them, same issue. A problem since the cell phone speakers aren't loud enough to hear all the pod casts I watch, or listen to."
It works like other wireless inexpensive speakers. Not Bose but good enough.
"I was expecting decent volume and bass. Maybe I got a bad one, but this speaker has very little bass and not much volume."
"The description says that it lasts 15 hours, it is not true just lasts 7 hours"
Button for + volume stopped working after a week. Warranty info does not seem to exist
Product is okay.
"Sounded great with solid fidelity, but then started messing up after six months with the audio staggering in and out. Now at nine months it’s basically worthless and I can easily understand why it’s no longer available."
It really isn't that loud like other speakers. I think also because the speaker is on the bottom of it then it makes it worse.
it works very good as a wireless speaker once i find some music to play.  but i hook up to my laptop it kills and the sound and locks up my laptop - it worked the first day has not ever since.  i guess i should send it back
"Looks like it would be kind of Basey but it's not. Poor sound quality in general not just lacking bass but midrange isn't good either. Poor connectivity, I wanted to use this in my room to listen to nature sounds on my computer. Once connected to computer I walked to my room maybe 12 feet away with the door open and it constantly cut out, and the quality of the sound was so bad you couldn't tell it was supposed to be rain falling sounds, sounded like plastic being crinkled ."
"My wife and I both use the speaker in our kitchen. If she last connected to it, I can't connect if her phone is within range. One I power up it up it will connect to her phone until, she is out of range or goes into her phone and manually disconnects. I am finding that is a common problem with these types of speakers. To prevent this, buy a speaker that has a Bluetooth button on it. If you have this button, once you push it will open it up for anyone to connect."
"I purchased this item on April 15, 2024 today is April 21, 2024 and this speaker suddenly turned off. IT DOES NOT WORK."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The sound is sometimes fuzzy
"Well made, relatively good sound quality, but do not play loud enough!"
Enough said.
"It's a $20 speaker, you get what you pay for. Not great."
lasted 4 months and now randomly cuts out then comes back on. or not. it really is pretty random about it. but happens every time. lame. its called notabrick but as of now it isabrick. or a paperweight. it is not a reliable speaker.
"Overall good speaker, but battery life is trash."
Cheap crappy speaker sounds like a cheap crappy speaker.
"Easy to set up, but sound cuts in and out so it's not usable.  Too late to return.  Suggest you pass on this one."
"I got one this week. I use it to help me sleep using sleep sounds all night. I am not getting 15. Hrs as stated. At 7 hours, it beebs indicating dying battery."
product not loud at all. most speakers i could hear from a room away. this one i could not. it also vibrated off the counter every time i turned it on.
"Could be a ok or great find, if dodnt have to push button on spaker every single time, also buttons are al black , low iq amateour hour design"
I wasn't able to use this product. could not get it to work on or with any of my devices.so disappointed because it had such great reviews.
They did not pair w each other as reported.
Is about 2 weeks old and already broken. NOT WATERPROOF!!!!! A little water got on it and now its broken.
Will lose connection after a few minutes every time it connects. It’s bad and directed.
Did nor work after one month.  Too late to get a refund
Don't waist your money. Worked about two weeks and died.
"The speaker lasted for almost 6-months, then it just went KAPOOT PLZZZZ!!!"
I bought three of these. If you plug it in using the external audio it will detach the connection from the main board inside and will eventually stop working. This thing was never $80
My speaker stopped working in less than a year of purchase!
It dies super quickly and stopped working after only a year.
"I wanted a little portable speaker but didn't want to pay crazy prices. I read the other reviews and figured I'd give this one a try. I'm a Bose fan so am always comparing and this is nowhere close, but that was to be expected. It's not bad and for the price I can say I'm satisfied with the purchase."
"I love everything about this speaker except the amount of time it takes to reach a full charge. I've owned several other JBL speakers, like Clip and Flip, that have all charged quickly but this one takes over 24 hours to reach a full charge. While I do like the speaker, I'm not sure I would buy it again because it takes so long to recharge."
Takes too long to charge. I have to plug it for 12h+ to fully charge it. Battery dies every quickly if playing at 50% or more volume.Good bass. Good sound. But battery needs improvement. Would have been a better experience if charging brick was included.
The spesker sound awesome but to charge it back takes me 4 days... :(
"So I purchased this in July and when it arrived it was perfect. I love the sound quality, the bass and the color. What I cannot stand is the charging on this speaker. It takes 12-24 hours and sometimes longer to charge this thing. I use the cord that came with it and had to provide my own charging block but this speaker chargers way too slow. It won’t even stay on while it’s charging. I wish the company would provide the charging block along with the speaker because it’s a pain trying to figure out what block will give it the most power while charging . Other than that I love it"
"I like the sound from these quite a lot.  I bought two of them for stereo.  I didn't find the instructions to be helpful, or its ap to be at the same standard as the sound quality - nowhere close actually.  You can accept that you will likely like the sound.  It's not high end, but it's definitely serviceable for just having on for general, casual use.  You'd not consider using these for watching a movie or as a substitute for good headphones or for a demanding listening environment.  But for their intended use, their sound is quite good.  It took me awhile to figure out that if I wanted stereo, I was going to have to try to figure out how to use the ap.  I found that requirement nowhere.  That said, the ap isn't intuitive and doesn't remember previous settings.  There are performance consequences associated with that inability in terms of what feels like the ap's cumbersome nature.  I find the ap annoying.Update: 05/11/2024.  Still like the sound; battery life is o.k. to good, but they can take awhile to recharge; the ap, which is needed for stereo, sucks.  It's unstable.  It does not hang onto your stereo / party mode setting...actually, it frequently defaults to party mode (mono) at the drop of a hat.  It's maddening.  Setting ap with the speakers is not intuitive, at least it wasn't for me.  Whether or not to buy them would really depend on your priorities.  If all you care about is sound quality, then sure buy one or two.  If what you want is stereo and / or intuitive set up, decide how much those things mean to you, then make your decision."
"They sound good. Pretty amazing bass for such small speakers. (Not a patch on my vintage L150s, of course.  😄 )However, they have a really weird gap in the volume. You can have medium loud to as high as they'll go, or pretty soft to very soft, but you cannot have medium. I will turn these down from a little too loud and hear it go to the volume that I want, and then hear it tick down to even softer. I can't believe this couldn't be fixed with a firmware update, and I sure hope it is. I'm a little tired of listening to them just a little louder than I really want.Getting them to stay in stereo mode is a little iffy, and it's really annoying that you have to do it with their app, which really isn't good for much except that. In the first place, you'd think that for two of them stereo mode would be the default, or that it would stay there when you set it, at the very least.  And besides that why the heck do I have to use an app?? My little Oontz Angle Pros that cost a third of what these cost, and sound nearly as good, frankly, go into stereo mode and stay in stereo mode all by themselves. I really fail to see why these can't do the same. Again, I bet this could be fixed with a firmware update and I hope it is.Uh-oh. Just found something that might be a deal killer. I was running the pair on batteries to see how long they lasted, and one of them cut off because it's battery had run down. Okay fine. So I plugged in the USB cable and it blinked to show it was charging, but it wouldn't play. Let me repeat that, it wouldn't play. What kind of device won't run off the input power while the battery is charging?? I'm going to see just how long it takes it to condescend to play again, but this issue may cause me to send back yet another pair of speakers. Who designs these things?? This issue is telling me that when the batteries go the speakers are also toast even if they are plugged in. Batteries don't last forever, so I am on the verge of considering that unacceptable, much as I want to keep these."
"It's an adequate speaker for this price point.  I'll cover the points addressed in other reviews but the short version is the speaker is fine.  I do not feel like I wasted money, but if/when I buy another of these types of speakers it won't be a JBL.  It's been at least 3 years since I've bought one of these BT speakers and my last speaker was just as loud/clear, cost less, had features that just worked, and even came with a lanyard for easy carry.  This thing would be hard to carry for someone with small hands.-Volume and Sound Quality:  It's loud in a room with no ambient noise. My music is mostly 90's rock like Metallica, Pantera, White Zombie.  I like loud music and for my private office it's perfect.I'll mostly listen at 1/3 volume so I can think, but it's nice to jam out sometimes. At middle volume level the sound is the best (lows vs highs) above half volume the bass tapers off and mostly just the highs are increased volume wise.  You could use this in an environment with ambient noise, like a warehouse or kitchen, but you would need to stay around 5' if you want to really enjoy what is playing.  After 10' it's probably going to sound more like noise than music.-Phone Connectivity is simple for music just push a top button, but not automatic for phone calls like it was with my other speaker I had in the price point.  There are some reviews that cover troubleshooting this, the manual certainly is no help, but it's not what I needed it for.  I just liked it as a nice side feature I used sometimes with my last speaker like this.-Battery Life is fine, I haven't done complete testing on this.  It does have a pretty significant battery in it for the ""charge your device"" option, but 20 hrs?  Maybe at the lowest volume playing nice simple music.  I won't need it for longer than 4hrs most of the time, so I doubt this will come up as an issue for me.-There's an app but it does very little for this speaker.  Most ""useful"" feature is a digital copy of the horrible instructions that come with the speaker.  Thankfully for it's main function of BT Connecting and playing music it's pretty basic and simple.  If you go the route of multiple speakers, reads the reviews for the app on how to make that work.  It is not intuitive, it's a series of linear steps which the instructions do not help with, and if you do it wrong all kinds of weird issues were reported in the reviews."
"Sounds great. 2 years in and the battery is toast. Won't take a charge. For the money, you'd think it would last longer. Eh well. It's the world we live in, I guess."
"I got the JBL Xtreme 8 years ago as a gift and it was a big upgrade from my boombox, but I didn’t think much of it. It’s since carried me through some of my favorite years in my 20s. Recently though, it disconnects as soon as I hit play on my phone. We can’t tell if it’s the charge or the Bluetooth but it won’t play, even plugged in. So I went to replace it only to see how expensive these bad boys are. I also didn’t love how heavy it is (I can’t pick it up one handed easily). I decided I do really like good sound, so I ruled out the lowest end of speakers and narrowed it down to the Charge and Xtreme models. I got a really good deal for Prime Day where they were similarly priced.This is purely subjective, but we played the same song on both of them at similar volumes and there was a noticeable difference in quality. The Xtreme2 sound hit me in the heart and the soul and the feels (lol I know). The Charge4 just sounded like noise when it was too loud. And I started with that one first. Also I was at the lower end of the volume scale with the Xtreme with much more room to grow but I was almost at the max end of the Charge when it sounded the same loudness. So if you’re throwing house parties or on a loud boat, you’ll want the Xtreme.Both were super easy to pair and I switched back and forth easily.It would be a much tougher call at full price, but I scoured reviews looking for cross-product-line reviews and found nothing so here’s my subjective test for ya. Xtreme all day.If you don’t care too much and are looking for something reasonably priced that’s easy to carry, Charge4 will be just fine. I just can’t go back"
"Really didn't sound as good as I thought it would, the flip 6 I think is a deeper sound than this,if you're thinking about getting the charge 4 keep looking.Really thought the sound would be deeper than what it is might send it back and get something different. Of course it sounds good just not what I was expecting.bluetooth worked good easy,not getting it wet, appearance is good just don't have the thump I'm looking for."
"I bought this speaker four months ago and it was working well until it stopped wanting to charge. It takes at least 24hrs for the speaker to be fully charge and it doesn’t let me use it, while being plugged. It just turns off. I’ve tried changing the chargers but I think it’s just the speaker. The speaker has always stayed in one spot and not once have I dropped it"
But I guess what you’re paying for is the name I would not purchase another one
"There is one middle speaker and it's not not in the center, so sound only comes from the right side.  Very little bass.  The woofers sounded every bit like their 2 inches, and no EQ so you can't modify the sound."
I have a JBl clip and what I loved about it is that IYou could have it plugged up to a charging box and it would never die while also keep it charged. This one doesn’t do that. I can have it plugged up and on and it will still die. It also takes wayyyyy to long to charge. Like 8 hours and it only lasts about 6 hours.. not happy at all with that… I haven’t tried to charge my phone from it but I’m sure if I did it would die in 6 hours. Battery is trash but the sounds is good… wish I would have gotten a different speaker
"from the beginning, this speaker sounded near clear with a little bit of noisy bass but it wasn’t too loud. months later, i’ve found that the bass is louder than normal and leads to me having to turn the speaker lower than desired. also, the speaker for some reason randomly glitches often for a few seconds and has been doing this for about 2-3 months now. the speaker isn’t damaged with water, dust or anything really. maybe a few light scratches but nothing that should be making the speaker have these problems. it’s not a terrible speaker but there are definitely more that end up less defective down the round than this one."
could be better bass is low
"The sound on this is great, and the bluetooth connection works fine.The only problem I have is when I try to turn the volume up or down. The volume will change enough to satisfy me, and then the volume will go up or down more on its own so I end up with too quiet or too loud. It does the same whether i use the volume button on the speaker or on my phone.It matters because I often use it in my office and don't want to blast my neighbors."
Got this to pair with my other JBL speaker which is a flip for. Connecting them is somewhat cumbersome and tedious. On top of that when they are connected sometimes sound only comes out of one then the other and then they match up. There's also a really big cracking sound that comes out of one if not both speakers when they are connected playing music loud. The point of the speakers and doubling them up obviously have loud music so the recommendations that you shouldn't have the music that loud is just kind of ridiculous. Might be better off with another brand or just stick with one speaker but the connection between the two is not great
"This little box is sounds ok if you’re within 20’The battery life on it is terrible though, that’s why 3 stars. Just leave it plugged up all the time. Bit disappointing."
"I got it at the beginning of the year for work. I have a flip 4 which has been amazing but wanted something that was a little louder to pair with since I’m in a machine shop. They paired effortlessly with connect +.The sound quality of the charge 4 is amazing, (when the battery has a charge). Since I got it, it has had issues charging. Would take days or even a weeks and would only be halfway or 3/4 charged. Luckily I’m able to send it back with the warranty and get a new one shipped out, will see if the new one actually charges and update my review."
Well I had a jbl for a few years previously and so I got another and not even a year later it took a crap. It stopped charging fully then charging all together. Other than that it sounded good battery life lasted for multiple days before dying.
"I choose the Charge 4 over the 5 for the aux input. I was satisfied over all with the one speaker, even if it sounds a bit muted and bassey. I was also disappointed that it is a mono speaker and misses out on some parts of music you'd expect to hear. So I decided to purchase a second one. Initial results were impressive but the party didn't last long ...The Connect + feature is terrible as both Partymode (mono) and Stereo crackle, drops out, swings back and forth between mono and stereo. I tried EVERYTHING from factory resets, to upgrading firmware, forgetting and re-pairing, switching to 5g wifi, turning off wifi and mobile data, only pairing one speaker, playing outside.... whatever I could think of. Nothing helps. These speaker communicate with each out directly and interference and connection seems to be a HUGE problem. These speakers don't even work properly sitting right next to each other. The app is barebones and has issues connecting when my Galaxy 20+ is right next to the Charge 4. Restart the app to get everything working again. You must keep the app open to keep stereo sound.SO, as a single mono speaker, yes its pretty good. Stereo mode would have been AMAZING if it worked as advertised, but alas it was a huge bummer. Will be returning one I guess."
"These sound great, and seem amazing at first, but after about 2 months the battery will stop charging properly. I bought 2 of these because you can link them, and both after about 2 months started to have issues with charging the battery, even when left charging overnight. I’ve tried different cords, outlets, etc and everything I Ty has the same result."
"Nice speaker, but the fullness of sound doesn’t impress me.  Was looking for something that rocked in my wood shop (about 600 sq ft), this wasn’t it.  The bass was weak, volume was mediocre.  Maybe my expectation were too high"
"I have had JBL speakers my whole life. I got a Charge 5 a couple years ago and wanted to get another due to my battery life getting shorter with time which is expected. I tried to save a couple bucks and get the Charge 4 but here is the huge issue, the battery only charges halfway. I charged it for a whole night and it’s still only halfway charged. Super annoying and doesn’t last nearly as long. The volume is also not as loud as the Charge 5. I really wish I spent the extra to get another Charge 5, this was a waste."
"Short version:a single Charge 4 would get 4 stars, but in JBL Connect+ Party/Stereo mode, audio crackles, drops out, speeds up / slows down, and overall just operates like crap.Long Version:I've had a single Charge 4 for a couple years and it sounds great alone. I recently bought another to pair it for stereo and wow am I disappointed. After seeing JBL's strong marketing for the JBL Connect+ feature, I almost can't believe that it works this poorly.These speakers can play dual sound in two ways: Party Mode and Stereo Mode. Party mode just plays your audio fully from each speaker, they have no connection to each other. Stereo mode uses your 2 speakers as Left and Right channels, and when it works it sounds great and fills the room. Sets a nice sound stage.I've followed JBL's recommended troubleshooting: Updated firmware, hard reset both speakers, only connect to one via Bluetooth (but then Stereo won't work at all, only Party mode), stay away from other wireless signals, bring speakers closer together, etc. etc. etc.  It doesn't matter. Even if the stars align for 5 minutes and everything synchronizes and sounds nice, it all falls apart in a matter of 2 minutes.This is extremely disappointing as each speaker sounds nice by itself. I bought a 2nd Charge 4 to replace two Amazon Echo's that are a NIGHTMARE to get working in Stereo Pair mode, and cannot be used over Bluetooth, but they are still better options than these two Charge 4's because the stereo falls apart after 20 minutes instead of 2.I'm going to give it a couple days and see if anything improves. I'm also disappointed you can't play music over either of the USB-A or USB-C ports to get around any Bluetooth signal issues. For a relatively expensive speaker, these setbacks are unacceptable."
"The actual speaker is great! Decent size, good sound, long lasting battery. The fact that for $115 it doesn’t even come with a charging cord is completely ridiculous. Luckily I already had another speaker and charging cord."
"Whilst functional as a speaker the volume and quality is not as good as my much smaller jbl flip 5. And the flip has much better base. But the charge 4 will serve a purpose on the back deck this summer. But as an honest review, buy the filp 5 over this all day long."
The sound is crisp and clear. I was very disappointed that I spent over $100 and the speaker didn’t come with a cord to charge it.
"Love this speaker, but about a month and a half after getting it mine either stopped charging, or significantly slowed down for some reason. Doesn’t seem to be holding a charge and the battery progression bar doesn’t move even after a whole night of being plugged."
"Sounds great when it’s charged. If battery dies while you’re listening, it won’t work plugged into a USB-C charger; you have to wait for it to recharge without music."
I believe my item to be returned and sent to me as “new”. There are 3 reasons why. 1.  The box has a “Kohl’s” sticker on it. 2. The original seal to the item was broken. Both stickers. And 3. The charging cord was not wound up in the box. The item I purchased was supposed to be new. This is false advertising. I really hope nothing ends up being wrong with the product.
"This used to be one of my favorite speakers. I had one for three years and the battery gave out one day so I ordered this new one. The battery on the new one doesn’t seem to hold well though. I find that after only an hour or two of casual use the battery is already at 1 where as my old one could go days without a charge. I was skeptical when the speaker first arrived, as the charging cord was different than the original one I had and it took a very long time to charge to the full amount. In the three months that I have had this speaker it seems to have an increasingly worse battery life and I am very disappointed."
This attractive speaker gives out wonderful sound. The battery does last as long as they claim but recharging on mine is a major problem. They claim four hours but mine takes four plus days. Internet postings show that this is a reoccurring problem with some speakers.
"This is a great speaker but it has a mind of its own.  It keeps turning on at random intervals then hijacks my Bluetooth.  When using, if we lower the volume, it turns off.  We tried all the online forums of reset, etc. to no avail.  Unfortunately just outside my one year warranty.  Too bad, I like JBL speakers."
"This is our fourth JBL portable speaker. I had the original Flip. Then I got my wife a Flip 2. Once we realized we needed more outdoor sound by the pool, we got a Charge 3. That had some years on it and I liked the waterproof feature of the Charge 4. Though we’ve never needed it. It’s never been caught in the rain or mistakenly bumped into the pool as I so often Feared might happen. It’s a great speaker for outdoor gatherings. Plenty of range. Anyone can connect to it and play their music. Sound isn’t that of a serious hi-fi but it’s really good for such a small package of convenience. And the charge holds really well. Most of the day and well into the evening. You can even charge your phone from it if that’s running low. And those are all the positives, which are great positives. My issue is the inconsistency. I play my music like most people. I have playlists and/or and algorithm that plays songs we like. But we’ll be listening on a full charged speaker and suddenly the thing just stops. Or it’ll start making this sort of skipping sound. Literally the one thing I want this device to do is play my music the way it’s supposed to. I paid the extra money for all the bells and whistles. And it isn’t just this device. It’s all the JBL’s. Now, I’ve done all the JBL recommended troubleshooting. I’ve reset the thing to factory. I even read that JBL recommends removing other possible plus tooth interferences from the area. Yeah, that’s helpful.This is my last JBL. I’m sick of this inconsistency and poor music quality. I’m sure it’ll take me a long time to find something weatherproof with such a good battery. I’ve been a JBL costumer for 20-some years. But like most devices these days, everything is junk. JBL has become just like everyone else."
Heavy bass. Doesn’t last very long. On my third one
i have this same speaker from 4 years ago and got another to run them at the same time so i can hear the sound when i go to the kitchen but they will hook up sooo now i have 2.
"BUYER BEWARE~~~~-------------------------TL;DR, this speaker is notoriously for bricking itself.My speaker, for the past year, i've been dealing with a slow charging issue where no matter the power source, no matter how many times I hard reset/factory reset, the speaker never charges til full. Even after DAYS of charging.If you google, ""jbl charge 4 slow charging reddit"", you'll see lots of threads of this speaker for not being able to charge fully and eventually bricking itself.There's no official solution to it. some ppl have had by opening up the speaker and physically disconnecting the battery and plugging it back in, but it's only a temporary solution."
"Ironic that the Charge takes forever to charge! Leaving it plugged in all night will net you a few dots, I haven't seen the thing fully charged in months! Otherwise it's a pretty good speaker overall"
"I spend a lot of time working with music, esp. mixing, mastering, composing.I wanted a speaker I could enjoy while I was at the skatepark w my friends, something that could get loud and sound really good. I heard JBL was pretty popular and had a good reputation, but I was dissappointed with the Charge 4.In terms of build quality, it's a nice speaker. It feels sturdy and looks good. But as soon as I turned on a song, I was shocked by the quality of audio. The mid frequencies were boosted and they made audio sound muddy and unpleasant. For a $114 speaker, that was a real letdown.I checked out their app hoping for some sort of software update/tune up, but it's very bare bones and didn't have anything to help. I also checked if ""bass mode"" was on, and it was from the start.I went into my phone's EQ settings and manually changed the spectrum to my liking. If you own this speaker, I recommend you (moderately) raise the lows, duck the mids, and raise the highs. That made the speaker a lot more pleasant. But as soon as I did that, it took a loss on its max volume.The skatepark I go to is pretty small, but has metal ramps that get loud. This speaker wasn't enough for the park. It's definitely okay if you're at a small picnic, in an apartment, etc. But it doesn't get as loud as I was hoping.Overall, this speaker isn't worth the price. For an allegedly reputable brand it's absurd the sound quality doesn't come good from the start. It felt like I paid $115 for a JBL logo.What I think I'll do is buy from a cheaper brand and do the EQ tuning myself.Hope this helps, have a good week!"
It only has 2 hours of battery life for playing music.  We are going to send it back for a replacement
"I dismissed the fact that this was a mono device (not stereo) because I was looking for a speaker with a 3.5mm aux port (which this has).  Mistake.  The mono nature of this device is apparent every time I use it: some songs have parts that are not heard on mono devices.  Also, this device has a rather flat sound to it.  I don't know if that is a result of it being mono or not. On the plus side, the sound remains clear at higher volumes with minimal (if any) distortion.  I was expecting a bit more bass though.  The overall design seems durable, except for the exposed speakers on both ends.  I would not buy another Charge 4.  I would have bought the Charge 5 (which is stereo) if it came with a 3.5mm auxiliary port. I ended up buying a generic speaker for about half of what I paid for the Charge 4.  It's not as cool looking as the JBL speaker, but it sounds as good or better (at least in my opinion).  The Charge 4 is a nice looking conversation piece."
"After almost 1 month with light use the battery wouldn't charge past the second dot. It would just continue to blink like it was charging on the third dot but never move past the third dot. I love JBL, as my last speaker lasted several years before it gave out. I have 3 other JBL speakers that are different models. Ordered another charge 4 hoping that JBL would redeem themselves by sending one that is not defective. Luckily I was within a couple of days of the return window."
I’ve only had this speaker 4 months almost and now it’s not holding a charge! Very aggravating to pay that much for it not to even last a year
"There is about a 0.2 second delay in the audio from this device. I have not experienced this with any of my other Bluetooth audio devices to this extent, and I could not find any setting to eliminate this.It works fine for music, but I additionally wanted to use it as a portable speaker for videos and the Nintendo Switch, but the delay makes this essentially impossible. Had to return for this reason.Edit: Upon more research, I found out this may be due to the specific codec that was used. This speaker apparently supports codecs with lower delay, but perhaps none of the devices I hooked the speaker to supported the faster codecs. I'm not sure."
"If you’re just using one speaker, I don’t see any issues. We bought 2 and linked them together. They constantly kept crackling and fading in and out when linked. I returned and bought Beats Pills speakers, and had zero issues. Do not recommend if you want to link multiple speakers."
"We have had a JBL Charge 4 for 4 years and it's been great until the last few months it started needing to be plugged in or it would turn off and on like it was resetting. We finally decided to buy a new one and since JBL has been great for us so far we started with the Charge 5..We got it right before going on vacation and it would die after about 6 hours when the Charge 4 we previously had would go like a full 24 hours, so basically days on end without needing to be charged.. This was the first disappointment. It only came with a charging cord, not a block and it took testing  4+ chargers to get it to charge so we returned it for this JBL Charge 4..Not much of a difference.. same issues with battery life and testing chargers to see what would actually make it charge.. From there we gave up and returned this one to go with a different brand. Definitely disappointing because we've always loved JBL.. Not sure if we just got some refurbished/faulty ones or it's a common issue. Just be aware that you might run into something like this.."
The battery only last about 6 hrs to a charge and the unit itself only lasted 13 months until it would not charge at all
"This was an amazing speaker but I had it for under a month and it was no longer charging.  I would leave it to charge for 2 days and it was still on the third one, but thankfully amazon was able to help me with a solution!"
"Doesn't stay on. Fully charged, will not stay on. Tried all sorts of button combinations to clear any paired devices and factory reset all to no avail. Also came with no charging brick. You know how long it would take to charge this size of battery from a typical 2.0A USB port? About two days. What a great way to save money, eh: Charge the customer a kings ransom for the speaker and give them no efficient way to charge it with the exception of a cord. No case, no cover, no charging brick and it doesn't work out the gate. Sent back. Will buy from another company. I would've sent back for no charging brick.If their goal was to remove JBL from my family household, indeed from memory: they have succeeded. No longer a customer."
This is a handy little speaker and nice to have the built in charging feature.  Problem is it sounds like a waterproof speaker from 2001.
Only has one speaker poor lows and highs just mid range . By charge 5 it has two speakers mid and tweeter speakers Amazon responded positive for return. Thank you
"This product has one main purpose : to make enjoyable sound, and this Charge 4 is a mono complete failure.I have JBL Studio Monitors at home that are truly epic, plus the older stereo portable water proof JBL Xtreme AND the stereo JBL Charge 3 that both sound amazing.  This doesn't compare at all to those other JBL products.I have always trusted JBL, until now..."
"I purchased this at the end of March, it worked great at first. For thr last month it won't turn off, or it randomly will turn on and off for minutes at a time. I have tried every way to power it down and nothing has worked. I'm disappointed in this as I got it as a gift for my boyfriend. Don't waste your money purchasing from here."
"the battery lasts about 6hrs full charge & the volume level is pretty basic, sounds rattling at high volumes"
I’ve used it on short periods at home by the pool but I recently took a trip to tulum and it barely lasted 5 hours at the full sound. Pretty disappointed since I was in the jungle in a camp with no power to recharge.
"I got the smaller JBL bluetooth speaker and it was amazing for its size. When I had to replace it, I wanted to see what was offered by this larger speaker. Ultimately, it's virtually identical. It's not any louder, there's no detectable superiority in low end, it's just bigger, heavier and more awkward to carry than the smaller JBL speaker.So ultimately it has absolutely nothing that makes it better than the smaller one. In short, buy the smaller one."
Discovered after a few weeks that tho it sounds good there something wrong with my unit. It turns off and on constantly and thus runs down the battery when I'm not using it. Basically I have to plug it in every time I use it and carrying it around is it if the question.
I’m a Amazon driver and the EV van speaker sucks. So I bought this. I’m out around 6-11 hours. It did not last that long. I had no problem with connectivity or it’s being easy to handle. It’s a reasonable size but it’s definitely not as loud as I’d like it to be. I know I could find a better product. So the battery life and the sound are the reasons I’m returning it.
absolutly loved this till after 2 months it stopped holding a charge....only used it about 10 times...sounds great...very sad it stopped working
Battery is aged or defective.
Not enough bass
I’ve always been a fan of JBL speakers. Go to gifts for the kids I work with. But this one has poor sound quality. I tried fully charging it. Attempted to see if there were setting I could change to control the bass and more. Unfortunately I’m returning it. It sounded terrible when turned up
This item was good but did not sound as good as my previous JBL flip 4 speaker that was actually smaller than this version.Also there were no places to hook onto so I could not fasten this one to anything. That was a take away for me.
Love the sound this speaker makes!  The battery on this one will literally take over two days to fully charge using the chord it came with and a sufficient charging block.
"Worked for awhile but my battery didnt last like it should have, for this price the batteries shouldnt completely stop charging all of a sudden like this. Looks nice, in fact mine still looks brand new, but doesnt work as well."
This was literally my all time favorite speaker until one day it decided to not charge. I tried everything from switching the cords try to rest it but nothing work.
Sound quality is meh at best. For the price tag it should be amazing.
"You better test out this product in a store first and make sure you REALLY love it and have zero doubts about returning it.Long story short, the speaker was so so. I feel like it was a little rattly at higher volumes, so I was not super sold on it and decided to return it as soon as I got it, same day, and followed Amazon’s return instructions. Well, after coughing up over $100 of my money for this speaker, Amazon/seller decides to not refund the money in a timely manner. I returned the item on 3/4/2024 and realized nearly two weeks later I still haven’t received my refund. I spoke with an Amazon customer service associate (as pointless because you will get 10 different answers) and they told me to wait until 4/4/2024 (a month later) for a refund even though they have the product back. If this was a couple bucks, no problem at all, but this is over $100. They sure are quick to take the money from you for the product, but be prepared to jump through flaming hoops to try to get it back for this product. Just a heads up!"
Based on reviews I was expecting more. Sound is good but I have Bluetooth speaks at half the price with decent sound.  The more I've used this speaker the more I'm convinced it's overrated.
"The discontinued JBL Charge 3 has much better sound than this.  This has one mono speaker as opposed to 2 channel for stereo.  They claim the speakers were too close together to tell, but the difference is clarity. This sounds muddy and bass heavy with a slight distortion on the high end.  Will get something else next time."
"I've tried other JBL bluetooth speakers in past years. To be clear, I've tried many dozens, listened for hours, tested, usually reviewed, and I've kept the ones that I think have something special, good sound. I thought after a few more generations JBL may have figured out how to nail together a decent thing. I was wrong.Buy a Bose Soundlink Mini. Listen to it. Figure out how to do better than that. It has half the volume of this thing and sounds indisputably bigger, better.JBL, don't cry. Bose also completely beefed it with their own new-generation ""Revolve"" speakers. They had spectacular speakers in the Soundlink III and especially, the brilliant and nonpareil Soundlink Mini, and decided to make the awful Revolve speakers. They may get a notch louder, and sound like muddy garbage. But it's round, and that makes it better for parties. Congratulations, we've discovered Idiocracy. Sony is even worse leading the charge into irrelevance, starting with the SRS-X5 and ""improving"" it by making the SRS-XB40. Great bass for a speaker its size, if only great sound was produced by bass alone. It doesn't produce any midranges or treble. Speakers by idiots, for idiots.Anyway, JBL has never made a great bluetooth speaker, so I suppose a 4th generation speaker that still sucks isn't really giving anything up. I just want the world to know that this speaker just ain't great. There's better, richer, more articulate deep and mid bass in the Bose Soundlink Mini, at half the size. It's not waterproof, and I suppose, people who need speakers with round cabinets probably also need to listen to music around pools most of the time, and can't figure out any effective way to prevent their speakers from falling in, so... maybe the JBL is great. For a certain type of person."
It has very good sound quality but the battery won’t charge
I'm just very disappointed in the battery life it last maybe 10hrs maybe 5 hrs I use it for a shower speaker I take like 20min-30min showers and by the end of the week I have to charge it. Since it took me a while to realize this problem due to me not frequently using it I have fallen out of the replacement/return period. So unfortunately I have defective device it works but like having a nice phone with a crappy battery very frustrating
"Good sound, but not nearly loud enough."
Clearly used. Charging cable missing.
"I have flip 4's and this charge 4. Ive played both and im a little disappointed with the charge 4, My flip 4 has stereo speakers and frankly sounds just as good if not even better then my charge 4. its weird. the flip 4 sounds amazing from low volume to almost highest volume. where the charge 4 doesn't sound as nice at low volume but will keep up at higher levels, almost pushing out about the same volume as its smaller sibling flip 4. the only thing i consider the charge 4 to have over the flip 4 is it doesn't get too distorted at max volume like the flip 4. but the flip 4 just sounds great almost at any level but at max, maybe a little less bass on the flip 4 too, but not by much. im beginning to regret my charge 4 purchase. i wish i just went with a new flip 5 and see how that works out.BTW i used the charge 4 for a hotel room Bluetooth soundbar. since i live in hotels while working each month. so good sound means a lot to me, especially when i get noise complaints from the host."
"I have to say that this speaker has great sound quality for its size.  The battery is decent, and the base is impressive for its size as well.  The main problem is the Bluetooth connectivity.  I fully charged the speaker and updated the firmware. For some reason, if the speaker is more than 3 or 4 feet from the source, it will connect but the sound keeps cutting on and off.  If I move the speaker closer to the source, it works great.  I can use other speakers further away and they do not have this issue, so I am assuming it is a design issue. I am using a Bluetooth extender so I should be able to move the speaker at least 50 feet without having any issues but unfortunately that is not the case with this speaker.  I am a bit disappointed. -- Mike P."
"I thought it might be the cord, so I replaced that, but it won’t charge. Huge bummer as we’ve been really careful with the speaker."
"Worked beautifully the first 7 months, then would charge 100% (it said) and go dead in an hour. Now it can be on the charger overnight and only charges to about 40% and goes dead in 20 minutes.Tested the charger with other units and it works fine.Tried the other troubleshooting tips but to no avail."
"Love the speaker, this is my third one but one i just ordered came with charging cord but no wall plug, serious? Is jbl that cheap that they need to not include this item for charging. Sad that big companies need to cheap out just to make a few extra bucks"
"I live in Florida and was searching for a loud speaker that my family & I can hear through all the wind & ocean noise. We are avid beach people and have ugobe through many beach speakers living previously in Hawai'i, Texas, South Carolina..etc.Pros:Sleek lookColor optionsLoud soundWaterproofHeavy enough to withstand steong beach windConsDoesn't show battery life in percentageWill not beep or alert you when the battery is about to die...the music will start to cut out. I guess that is your notice.Honestly, I still am not set on this speaker 100%. Might return it.My little H20 speaker beeped when it was going to die.For over $100, this speaker should show detailed battery life & beep when low.Otherwise a good little speaker."
"After owning the JBL charge 4 for a couple weeks, purchased on the 23rd of September, the battery stopped charging at the rate it should.  It does charge but it wasn't exceeding 12 hours between work shifts in the first couple weeks."
The battery life of this speaker is poor. If more than one persons Bluetooth has been connected at any point the speaker stops working because it can’t decide which Bluetooth to connect to. Wish I had returned this speaker. Waste of money
Battery lasts advertised 20 hours only if volume is at 40% or less. Does not include power brick. takes up to 8 hours on a charger that's less than 30 watts. 5 months after purchase a noticeable drop in battery performance
"I've had this since the end of June.  For the last two months, it just won't hold a charge.  I've tried changing cables, resetting the speaker, and trying new outlets. Nothing works.  And,  it doesn't even hold a charge when it's plugged in.  Need to try to send it back!"
"UPDATED REVIEW: My son has had this speaker for only 4 months and something is definitely wrong with the charging. It has now been charging for almost 30 hours and is only showing it has charged 2 of the 5 bubbles. Not happy.My beach bum son really wanted a speaker to take to the beach with him and this one is perfect! It has pretty good sound quality and has already definitely been put through its paces (as evidenced by the sand all over it). He said it charges phones really quickly (so nice for him to be able to charge off of it!) but be warned, charging the speaker itself if the battery is totally empty will take a few hours. It lasts forever though, he took it with him probably 7-8 times (he is usually at the beach for anywhere between 5-8 hours at a time) before the battery was on the last dot showing how charged it was."
I barely use my JBL and the battery won't last and charge all the way. Kinda sucks because I trusted JBL for years but the quality is going down.
Definitely not what you'd expect. The sound is terrible. Not bad if you want quiet music.
"I have been a die hard JBL fan for years because of the quality. The JBL Charge 4 battery life SUCKS! It doesn't charge properly and it dies quickly at mediocre volume level. My opinion, don't waste your time with the Charge 4."
"I loved myJBL when I first received it. Had it 2 weeks and then would cutout after a minute. Called support did factory reset. It worked for a few days then did it again. Called again, they told me I needed to send it to the factory and they would send me a new one. I asked if I needed an extra box to send it, they said no. The I went to UPS  they told me I needed to put in a box. I had to $8.50 for the box. I received my new speaker a couple of days ago. Now its doing the something. I called again they tell me I have to this replacement back and they would send me another one. I have purchased this speaker about 6 weeks ago and have nothing but frustration. How may times will I have to send it back before it's  right. I am out of a return through amazon cause I was so busy with JBL trying for a speaker to work right. I am the one that has to absorb the loss.  I do not recommend this speaker to anyone."
"This speaker is not loud for a party, this is more like a bathroom speaker, honestly my sons bugani speaker was just as loud as this for half the price, I just paid for the name."
"The sounds is perfect. Waterproof seems to work well too, but it it runs out of charge too quickly, and takes forever to charge back up fully. Some times even overnight it’s not fully charged in the morning. Also if it looses charge completely, it won’t play even while plugged in and takes like an hour of being plugged in before it will play again at all. I’ve had it less than a year now."
I was honestly expecting a little more for how much I spent on this speaker. I have two sound bot sb527's that are much louder and to me sound and look better as well. For around 45 dollars not 180 like this speaker. The only things that to me are good about this speaker are the battery capacity and JBL's almost unlimited connection of speakers with their new JBL connect. In my opinion you should save the money and buy yourself two of the sound bots and get way more speaker and have 100 dollars left in your pocket.
Never again...battery no good after a year and will not hold a charge.  Warranty is a joke you would think they would stand behind the product longer if its not malicious damage.
"This speaker was initially great for the price (compact with good sound and battery life), so I actually purchased a second when my first went missing. The second one is annoying. The sound quality is still good, but this thing will not turn off. Sometimes, I’m able to power it down if I first disconnect it from my phone. Other times, I have to disable Bluetooth on my phone altogether because I will disconnect from the speaker, but no matter what I do, the speaker won’t turn off and keeps reconnecting while I try to go about my day. I regret buying another one and wish I had the first version back."
"Great sound.  Took the SRS-XB100 with me on travel and loved listening to  the music app on my phone (Google Pixel 8) but after a year it would no longer charge.  The yellow charge light lit up, but soon went out and it was dead after that.  UPDATE: I took the unit and whacked is several times on a table.  Low and behold, it turned on!  And it charged up.  So, I'm back to liking it again, but not sure what will happen next."
Ehhhh...  Got to use with a Chromebook.  If it does not seem to be playing loud enough charge it back to 100%.  Keeping it plugged into a USB-C dock now to maintain charge.  Catch it on sale it is worth the cash to get by.
Price and size. Thought it could attach WITH USB but not as in place of Bluetooth.
"Sound boost for watching movies, etc. on the phone is only OK. I have the sound all the way up, but it's still not quite loud enough to hear if some other noise occurs or when stepping into the next room. Not worth the cost."
"I bought one of these on sale because it was too cheap to pass up. To my surprise, they seem to have ironed out the wireless connection grief so I was up and running almost imediately.  I compared this little Sony to a more expensive Bose and the sound, or rather the limitations, were about the same.  The Bose sounded slightly better because the dispersion of the higher mid and treble sound was helped by the speaker being horizontal.  After all, I'm not sitting on the ceiling.  So I tried turning the Sony on it's side and to my ear, It's much better.  The bass is not affected as It's produced by the ports (holes) around the bottom.As for the overall sound, voiume, etc. I doubt spending more will get you much more unless the speaker is much larger.Update.  I bought a second speaker because you're supposed to be able to run them in stereo.  This is possible, but what a time wasting visit to wireless land.  Since the speakers all have the same Bluetooth address, you have to get one to connect, then send the spilt signal to the the other speaker.  If you're somewhat lucky, you will swap the sound from speaker A to speaker B, which is better than nothing.  If things get really ""user friendly"" both speakers will get confused and disconnect.  If you hit the lottery, you'll have both speakers working, each carrying one channel of the stereo.  But be prepared to put some time into this process."
"As much as I wanted to keep this speaker, I returned it because it was just not loud enough. I wanted it for my golf cart - a Yamaha Quiet Tech which is quiet compared to most golf carts.  I used to have a Mpow Armor speaker which was plenty loud enough."
"I must use an enteral tube for feeding and anybody who knows what I'm talking about knows it's a boring process.  I used to wear headphones during the feeding, but I also wear hearing aids, so even with over the ear phones, they were still uncomfortable.  I bought this hoping it would make the headphones unnecessary.  I underestimated this little speaker.  When I took it out of the box, I thought, ""How cute.  Can it produce a loud enough sound?""  Again, genius dude, underestimated.  The first time I fired it up, I was very happily surprised.  This little bugger has very good fidelity.  The sound is crisp and fills a small room.  I also use it to listen to student's speeches.  It's that good.I heartily recommend this to anybody, with the proviso that it's not really for a large room, but if it's a small room, you will be happy with your purchase.Update 3/31/24 I can no longer recommend this product.  I bought it three months ago and I really loved the sound and portability.  Then my laptop Blue Tooth went bonkers and kept cutting out and dropping the music.  So, I bought a Blue Tooth adaptor with a 100 foot radius.  Happiness was mine.  Then I kept moving the antenna and I think I broke a wire in it because the music started cutting in and out again.  So, I bought a new adapter and plugged the antenna in.  I was able to connect everything I wanted to connect to Blue Tooth with no problem.  It has been impossible to connect the speaker to my Blue Tooth.  I have tried every trick I know to get connected and no joy.  So I contacted product support and there was nothing there I hadn't tried, although they have great and thorough ideas.  So, I went to SONY, and tried using their help web site listed on the manual for the speak r. No help at all!  So, I have a small boat anchor, but no boat.  That's why I reduced the rating and am writing this revised review.  Now, I'm h]going up on Amazon to purchase another speaker, but it sure won't be a SONY product.  You only burn me with crappy support once, never twice.4/1/24The support is irrelevant.  I have tried to connect this boat anchor to three different devices, two laptops with different Blue Tooth programs, and one desk top computer with the same Blue Tooth adaptor one of the laptops has.  No joy!  Even after repeated attempts to connect this speaker to each of them, it never connected or even showed up on the list of available devices under ""Add a Device.""  So, I bought a new speaker from a different brand.  I don't think Amazon will allow me to say which one.  I bought the same brand of headphones and have never been unhappy with them, so I figured their speaker might also be worth the price.  That's all I will say about the new speaker.  Bottom line is I can no longer recommend this SONY portable speaker."
"I like to use a small bluetooth speaker in the bathroom while showering. I like to listen to classical music and podcasts. This small speaker has a strong bass, which might appeal to some when listening to popular music.  However, the (overly) strong bass somewhat drowns out the higher frequencies needed for clear speech understanding. It takes an effort to understand podcasts because of the strong bass.  I returned this."
"PROBLEMS WITH BATTERY NOT DROP 16H , VOLUMEN GOT LOW AFTER 2 HOURS , I GOT OTHER ONE IN BLUE COLOR I HOPE WELL OTHER WISE I WILL RETURN IT AGAIN ,"
I always loved sony quality but i am disappointed. The sound quality is very nice. The volume is not loud. There is no extra bass. Any music with low frequency bass the bass is not produced.
Dislike: The volumn is less than I like. It can only be heard well in a room 10 by 10.Like: The tone is base…and the size of the player is small and fits in your average purse.
Review by N's wife: Hope it lasts. Arrived undamaged. Sound is a bit soft but okay. Design is flimsy but okay.
"This a mixed review.  They have good bass and treble. Good tone. The volume is for crap.  Bought two for a work room.  No loud machines.  Set them up, turned up the volume on both speakers and player.  Walked five feet away and could almost hear the music.  Tried two other devises and same result.  Returning.  If Sony considers this BIG sound they are sadly mistaken.  Have been a Sony customer since my first Walkman.  They missed it on this one."
"This speaker is ok nothing to brag about , works fine just not loud enough."
This is perfect for personal use it has base but not loud as I expected
It was not audible beyond a few feet. It would not get very loud
Sony products have typically been a favorite. This just disappoints on every level.
I found the volume doesn’t play high enough to hear in another room
"I wanted a nice travel size speaker for work but it's not louder than the vents we have in the kitchen. If you only plan on using this for just the house it's perfect for about 600 sq ft., or rooms."
The speaker looks bigger on the website he was very hard to pair and the charging cord they sent with it it's only 4 inches long not happy with it at all I will be buying a different one
Not loud enough
Ive tried a bunch of bluetoothe speakers always sending them back.This is the first Ive gotten that is actually louder than the iphone speakers themselvesGood bass.Decent volumeThe clip is great.The shape is a bit awkward when wearing it and lets say Biking
"This speaker is good at a few things.Pairs easily, connects easily, stays connected well.First charge took awhile, at least 4 hours.Price isn't bad, but when something is advertised as ""Extra Bass"", it needs to live up to that.This did not.Not only is the bass weak, it's almost non-existent.Songs I play every day actually sound different to me through this speaker, because there is literally no bass at all.It just sounds weird.  It's like they intentionally removed the bass so it wouldn't buzz when it was called upon.Remember the old car stereos that came with EQs?  This sounds like one of those with all the bass cut completely out."
"So first of all just pairing this thing for the first time was unclear. It's two clicks on the Bluetooth button. Holding the button activates the stereo pairing with another speaker. Annoying and that brings me to the biggest problem with this. While other single speaker setups still manage to sound reasonably good, this one sounds like the monaural can it is and let's face it, needing two speakers to sound good kinda defeats the purpose of a highly portable speaker. Also, the sound profile is all highs and bass with no mid and while you can use a graphic equalizer to greatly improve the sound, it still sounds tinny, despite a lot of detail. You can get a better speaker for less."
"It does good for sound, but it seems like Bluetooth takes a few tries to actually connect when you turn on."
I bought 2 speakers they are ok. I wish they were just a little louder. The battery life is good
Interesting design and seems to be well made but it is lacking in volume. Turned all the way up is still pretty low. You certainly aren't going to disturb your neighbors with this.
"The sound is not bad, but it does not get very loud. It barely reaches above the sound of the shower. Also, there are some channels missing from the sound patterns. Sometimes vocals, sometimes a guitar. Its anmoying but what do you expect for $50. Would not buy this again."
You can't use it outside. To use it in a room every one needs to be quiet
I like the little speaker very much. My only problem is is not really loud enough for my preference. But I do enjoy using it while I’m outside doing  yard work and on my walks. I enjoy listening to my music. It’s lightweight easy to Attached to anything. it was worth the money I paid for it
Good sound not very loud works good good battery life
"I was ok buying an open box product, but I paid for “like new” and received a clearly dirty and worn product. It seems to work fine but I can purchase a brand new one for $2 more, with a charging cable and the confidence that it will hold a charge. ( I am looking forward to using this speaker but I will be purchasing a new one.)"
"This is the second time purchasing this speaker. The sound is not as great on the second device. I maxed out the volume and it was still pretty low. Not sure if the product I got was defective, as the first one I bought was not this low which may speak to inconsistency with the quality of the model. I would not recommend this product."
I owned a previous version of this speaker and I loved it! So when that one finally needed replacing I didn’t hesitate to order newer version.  I am very dissatisfied with the sound quality.  It’s not loud enough.  And if you’re working outside with any kind of background noise you can’t hear it at all.  I can’t believe the difference in quality from the one I got 5 years ago to this model.  Very dissatisfied with this speaker especially for the price.  I wouldn’t recommend unless you don’t mind not being able to actually hear anything.
"I want something small, portable, can be easily hung up, and loud to replace 1.5 year old JBL Go 3 that has a battery that's quickly failing. Short on time, as I'm only in the US for a few weeks, I've been playing this Sony SRX-XB13 mainly in the car while I run errands. The mids and highs are good, but it's been my experience that the bass is almost non-existent. This is playing pop, hip-hop, alternative, and spiritual music.  Mids and highs are pretty good, however when I turn the volume all the way up, the sound distorts. This isn't excessively loud, but just almost loud enough.Maybe I received a dud, but I'd rather use the failing JBL or replace it with their newer model than use this Sony on my next trip."
I used this for about 1.5 months and it worked great for our small shop space during that time. Unfortunately it quit working one day and I can no longer get the bluetooth to show up on anything so it's a useless paper weight at this point. Products should last longer than 1 and a half months.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                It’s an awesome speaker, but I wish it just went a little louder because where we live at it’s quite noisy"
After awhile the volume dies out… i thought it was because it needed to be charged but even with full battery my speaker isn’t even louder than my iPhone… still works but best if used in quiet office.
I guess I thought it would be louder even though it’s small. It’s good enough for using in small areas though.
"It crackles more than other speakers I've had but the worst is that it appears that the volume might have been set by your neighbors. I have to be seated right be the speakers to hear it well, and carry it from room to room with me."
"I was expecting loud sound bc Sony  is a good brand, but is not loud for a party, good thing is that I bought 2 and i can connect it together that I like, so I kept them and use it for me not for parties"
I loved that this came in eco-friendly packaging. The speaker itself seemed like it was well made. The Bluetooth was easy to connect to my android phone. It charges quickly. I loved the color and style. I did end up returning this because the speaker was very quiet for it's size. I have a smaller cheaper speaker that sounded much better and louder than this. Usually I love Sony products but this isn't one of them.
"I figured it would be louder, but it’s OK"
Nice little heavy duty speaker. Good sound. My only complaint is it sometimes disconnects and you have to resume whatever you’re listening to after the speaker resets. It will usually disconnects twice.
The sound is excellent but the volume does not play as loud as previous models of this kind. I play it at the pool and if I’m not near the speaker I can barely hear it. Very disappointed. I’m trying to decide if I will return it. I had this model for years at this same location and the volume was much louder when needed.
"Sony really hurt this speaker by limiting the volume. Other reviews mentioned it but volume can be subjective. With that in mind and being a Sony product, I ordered the speaker. That was a mistake. A video review mentioned Sony may have tapped down the volume to increase how long the battery lasts before recharging. With much disappointment the Sony SRS-XB100 will be returned. For a few dollars *less* consider the Soundcore Anker Mini 3 Bluetooth Speaker. Better sound and volume as well as an app for customizable EQ."
"I bought the Sony SRS-XB100 (used, like new) as mostly a shower speaker. Hey, I like to belt out songs like a lead singer . . mostly just on clean up nights. Anyways this Sony sounds OK at low to mid volume. Past about 50% the bass just keeps disappearing the louder the volume gets. So now I have the choice of OK sounds that I can hardly hear in the shower or pretty much bass less for my cleaning sing alongs."
"Wanted this as a speaker for my laptop. However, it would not link/pair to my laptop or my phone. I returned it for credit. Bought another one the same thing locally and it worked perfect."
Sound quality is good but the you need to have the speaker very close to you or you won’t hear a thing. Max volume is very much at a medium level.
"This speaker looks good, has a nice texture, and feels pretty sturdy. It also connects well and its user friendly. But it does NOT GET LOUD ENOUGH. I am not trying to blow my ear drums out. I'm just a middle aged lady that wants to listen to podcasts or music while she gardens. The volume this speaker puts out is insufficient. More to the point, I'm pretty sensitive to sound (always sleep with earplugs and always have them on me just in case even just walking the Earth)... and this speaker's output is too puny for me. I love a Sony product. I have earbuds of theirs I like but this is getting returned. I had a Bose Bluetooth speaker years ago (until it died) and I may go back to that product even though I've been failed once."
"Nice speaker, quality sound, great connectivity, but just not loud enough."
"I bought this unit because I needed a device that had a good battery life.  Initially, all was well.  Five weeks later, I have to charge it more frequently."
"I wanted something with a good bass output, this gives out the bass but at full volume the speaker onMy iPhone is louder. I expected more from a Sony product. I have the JBL flip which is AWESOME. I didn’t want to spend another $110 for a speaker to travel with. but I guess you get what you pay for!!Next time I’ll pack my JBL!!"
I've bought a couple of different small speakers. This one is as loud as the one I purchased for $25. I will be returning it since it's not any louder.
"Probably the worst Bluetooth speakers I’ve ever had… and I’ve had a lot. Extremely flat sound, zero bass, anything low frequency makes the speaker shake violently and make an enormous amount of noise… without actually transmitting the sound. For this price point this sound quality is unacceptable. There are $10 speakers that sound better.Only redeeming quality and reason I purchased is this is one of the few BT speakers that allows you to disable auto shut off and just keep it on forever so you can pair easily. But that alone does not justify the extremely flat sound and loud shaking."
"Sony isn’t the quality it used to be, or maybe I’ve developed a desire for a more succinct, perfect quality. This speaker, for me, wasn’t it! Gave almost a muffled base sound, which I felt almost gave me a headache, and I don’t get headaches."
"I purchased this because the battery life said 16 hours which is fantastic. Unfortunately, this seems to reduce the maximum volume quite a bit. So much so I only used it for one day before realizing it was not going to work. Returned"
"Doesn't get as loud & has less bass than my srsbx10. Has some of the same glitches as my previous model, auto-turn when I unplug the usb cable etc. Newest glitch is volume resetting to 90% of the time when turned on."
"The speaker is fine if you are just looking for a little amplification, but I'm looking for a little more sound and volume. Nothing wrong with it, just not what I am looking for. You get what you pay for."
"after trying six different phones, I couldn’t get the Bluetooth to work, sending back"
The highest volume is somewhere around medium and it won’t connect to one of my iPhones. The only reason that I won’t return it is because I don’t like returning items. Too much of a hustle.
"I have 6 Bluetooth speakers here. This one was ordered to replace my nightstand speaker which is an IhomeB780 from 2018, which still uses the micro cable, which if you are familiar, tend to go bad due to how poorly these seat.My 1st thought was HOW will they get the tones I am used to with half of the canister size as REVERBERATION is how they create base in smaller speakers. It did not :) It's base is lackluster, to say the least.It's highs were much clearer though, but I am not buying a tweeter, I am buying the whole package. So to keep it because it has more 2500+ mhz clarity and sub-par 600- quality, is a bit silly.It sounds like a 1972 Honda hatchback door speaker when taken as a ""whole"".I was displeased as I ASSUMED I would be buying quality, I mean it's a sony,right? I have a pair of mxh1000 headphones that are hard to beat. Granted I got them NOT ON SALE and paid 300.00, still, quality is quality. A good canister speaker for 1 small room SHOULD be 30-40.00. A few more for what you ASSUME will be a better product is ok. But that is NOT present here.I am returning this and I would advise ANYONE who has not owned a canister speaker before to go to the big blue Box store that caters to electronics and view OTHER products 1st, including the off-brands, because this is less quality, over all, THAN those off-brands, and that was surprising and unexpected."
"I bought this speaker on prime day, so I got it for about $35.00.I was expecting this speaker to sound somewhat like the bose soundlink micro speaker, from reading all the positive reviews and all the praise.  The sound is not as full as the bose soundlink micro, and  the bass is non-existent.  Why advertise this speaker as ""Extra Bass""?  My Miatone Qbox has fuller sound with more bass than the sony SRSXB13 speaker.I'll just keep this speaker as back-up."
"We got an amazing deal on this product so I can't complain too much, but I wasn't expecting it to be so quiet. It's used mostly as a shower speaker and, even at it's highest volume, it is very difficult to hear the spoken word in an audiobook over the noise of the shower.  Maybe these speakers are designed to be used in stereo pairs, but we only bought one and it sits mostly unused because of its volume limitations."
Max volume isn't even loud enough for me to hear people speaking in a podcast. Very poor volume limit. Truly. Can't hear my music when I'm standing directly next to it... what a shame...
Not loud enough to use outside unless you are very close to it.
"I have used this for 10 minutes. I will be returning it. It’s not loud enough. I work in construction. It just doesn’t cut it for me. This would be great for a quiet space, office. It’s sounds great for sure. Just not loud enough for me."
"I bought two of these, the sound is great but almost impossible to pair together. They just swap back and forth operating separately. The Sony help was useless. I have had a couple other brands that paired easily. So far I have got them to operate together once out of two dozen attempts. So I would not recommend them. You can get cheaper speakers that sound great and pair with ease. The stress isn’t worth it."
"I really enjoyed using this speaker when I first got it, the sound quality was good albeit it didn't get really loud but that was fine by me as I always used it in small rooms in my house (kitchen, bathroom, outdoor deck). Also had a long lasting battery. Until now, all the sudden it decides it doesn't want to charge anymore which stinks since I've only owned it for at most 8 months. I plug the speaker in now and it will have the red charging light come on for a few minutes and then it goes off. Tried multiple charging cords and blocks but it still doesn't work. Pretty bummed out."
"This speaker sounds great. The bass is very high quality. The problem is it just isn't loud enough. I bought it to use as a shower speaker and I can barely hear it from 2 feet away with the shower on. Even the Chinese hockey puck size speakers are louder. My phone (OnePlus 10T) is also a little louder at full volume, but the sound quality on this obviously blows it away. I can recommend it if you normally listen in a quiet environment. But if you are looking for something loud I would look elsewhere."
Not as much volume as I would have liked.  I purchased two and synched them.  Did not seem to make much difference.  You can only synch one device to the speaker.
Just doesn't have the higher volume if you like to jam...
Volume range is not very high
"It doesn't compare to a JBL speaker, doesn't project the same volume or quality of sound. I am going back to JBL, thankfully my downside was 40 bucks."
"Was excited to try this little speaker out for the bass it supposedly had, only to find it had no more than a similar sized speaker.  There was no punch nor deep sound.  Sound was muddier but didn't provide any noticeable bass.  Probably fine if you want just a portable speaker, but it's missing its main selling point."
"I bought this dandy little speaker to pair up with the Sony SRS-XB12 that I've had for a few years and love. Both speakers have the ability to pair with other wireless speakers for stereo sound, BUT NOT WITH EACH OTHER, which is kind of silly since they are basically the same device. So, buyer beware, if you intend to pair the SRS-XB13 with another speaker, it has to be another XB-13. Although the speaker has deep bass and overall good sound, I had to give it a lower rating due to functional incompatibility and incomplete product description."
"I spent a bit more because it’s a Sony product….but this speaker has so, so, so much bass! It shakes the table it sits on. The base overpowers the music! I wish I could return it."
"First, the speaker sounds fine. As with most of this sort of speakers, the bass is way over done, leading me to look for an EQ out of the box. Unfortunately the associated app can only adjust volume and gives links to open installed music apps. Past that, it does nothing. Unless you count turning on and off LDAC as an extremely useful feature. On top of that, you can't disable the sounds the speakers makes when powering on/off or connecting/disconnecting. Other than those gripes, it's decent if a bit expensive when not discounted."
"I have bought Sony portable speakers before, this one simply does not have audio power;  A generic brand horn sounds louder than this one...unfortunate, poor manufacturing in this product I bought."
"Nice portable speaker. Wanted something small to bring camping; but also be heard while exercising in a swimming pool.  Unfortunately, it could not project enough volume to be adequately heard.  Thus, I will be returning it."
Came with wrong charging cable that did not fit product. Had to acquire cable separately.
"Speakers are amazing. Definitely buy a pair. Very spacious sound. Full. Beautiful bass. You can link these together for stereo sound and link the wrist bands together and hang them around you neck/shoulders for (headphone) like experience. I load trucks. The speaker grills might as well not be there. They get dented with ease. 3 days and the grill is annoyingly bent up. If you take extra special care of these though, they are worth every penny."
It is a newer version of one I had for years which went out so I got another one.  The newer one has lower volume than the older one.  I wish I could send it back but I threw away the packaging before I realized the problem.
I like the fact that it's a Sony I got my first Sony Walkman in 1979 and I've had every model going up along the way I currently have a Sony mw600 they were discontinued years ago but the sound is amazing all of my TVs and surround sound systems are from Sony I was a little disappointed in this it's not very loud it doesn't have the greatest sound or volume I actually bought a Sony micro for $24.99 that I like better than this this does not have a lot of sound for what it is I believe just my opinion that they should sell them in pairs for around $50 I still like Sony though don't get me wrong
"I had read reviews that mentioned the lack of volume, but since I don’t play my music loud I thought it would be okay for me. But it wasn’t.  Sitting at a picnic table with thison the table right near me (so maybe 2-3 feet away at the most) and I still couldn’t hear it well.  Don’t buy!  I had a JBL prior to this, and it was much better.  When the JBL  wore out I bought this Sony thinking it might have better bass, but the sound was so low I couldn’t really tell if the bass was better or not.  I will either buy the JBL again, or splurge and get a Bose."
"Not sure what I was thinking buying a single-driver speaker, but this thing sucks! The $15 no-name bluetooth speaker bar my buddy has is miles ahead of this thing in literally every single way.The moment there's any kind of sustained bass, the sound becomes entirely unpleasant from how muddy it gets. Will be returning this for the cheapest bar I can find. This is the second Sony device in a row for me that's been incredibly bad for the price, not making that mistake again."
"I bought this speaker in April, it's been inside the entire time, so there's no physical damage to the unit.  The problem is the volume, or lack thereof.  I did the troubleshoot through sony's website and it provided no help.  It was connected to multiple sources and that did no good.This speaker is so quiet it's really about useless.Going to return it to Sony."
Took for ever to figuire out how to pair. Sound is ok.
"This is a good speaker. Good audio quality and not heavy, but the cable for charging is way too short and the worst part is that is that it is not loud enough. In the car many times I can’t hear well my podcasts content. It is sad but I am returning it."
It is not surround sound and it does not set up with all products that are comfortable with surround should and it's tiny
After reading the reviews and watching the videos about this speaker with everyone talking good about it I was seriously disappointed when I actually connected it to my phone and even my laptop. I live in a small 1 bedroom and if I go behind any door I barely hear it. Outside is worse. It's a cute little speaker but if you want to be able to hear your music over someone talking then definitely don't get this speaker. Seriously I bought a BT speaker from the dollar tree and it is louder than this one. The last picture I posted is the speaker from the dollar tree that cost $5 it's built cheap but it is louder where you can hear it even outside. Yeah if it wasn't for the fact that I threw away the box it came in I would be getting my money back.
"I returned the product as when it did connect the sound would not work and then after the initial connection with one item it would not connect with another. I connected it with my laptop first as that was to be its main purpose and it connected quickly but no sound would come out of it. My laptop was playing sound then when connected I heard silence but I could see the audio was still going so I tried turning up the volume on the speaker and could see on my laptop that the volume was being turned up but still no sound. I figured maybe it just doesn’t work with laptops so I disconnected the speaker from my laptop and tried my phone and got no sign of connection about 10 times. Then I turned off every option for Bluetooth in the house including my Apple Watch as I read that might cause an issue and still nothing for the next 5 times I tried. I gave up for the day and then tried again the next day and still no sound on the laptop and no connect on the phone even after I had the laptop forget the speaker. While it might be a great speaker for some it is not for me and I no longer have the patience and time to keep trying. Overall, I’d say be weary as you might get a great speaker as the other reviews indicated or you might get a dud."
Also no battery. ( my fault)Perhaps I it was.the room acoustics but I heard the smaller bluetooth battery powered version and it blew me away.Not this one.
"I ordered this speaker, but when it arrived it had what appeared to be a cut on the lower-front/bottom of the speaker. I ordered a new speaker, but the second one has the same weird cut. Apparently they all look this way. My wife loves it, and we are keeping it, but it’s strange that a speaker that costs this much has what appears to be a manufacturing defect."
I don’t know what people are talking about when they say the sound is great. It’s slightly better than my other 25 dollar Bluetooth speaker but mostly just louder. Looks great though and like the old fashioned dials.
"A fried bought the smaller Marshal bluetooth speaker and I loved the sound quality, so I purchased this larger size.Well, the speaker sounded muffled and ther sound quality was real bad, so I retruned it.The speaker used AC power and does not have a battery pack (which is OK by me) - BUT, very disappointed otherwise.One thing to note:Do not install/use the App for these, or any bluetooth speaker for that matter. They bombard you with ads and actually I believe it may have contributed to the inferior sound quality. The adjustments (bass and trebele) on the App do not work either as you do not hear any difference in sound upon ""adjustment""."
"Unfortunately I don't think that Amazon has a way to review the seller separately from the product. The seller mis-advertised the condition of the speaker. It appears to have been in use for an extended period in a very dusty environment like a loading dock or workshop.The speaker itself seems to be pretty decent build quality but IMO sounds overly bass heavy and not super detailed, just like most bluetooth speakers. Unlike every other bluetooth device I use, it doesn't automatically reconnect to my iPhone 14 Pro, which is an annoyance.I'm trying to update the speaker firmware now to see if that fixes the connectivity issue. Another minor gripe that's typical is that you can't update firmware without downloading an app and creating an account with an email address."
When watching TV the music becomes the highlight. Everythings muffled except for music. And music sounds excellent if you are listening from certain sources otherwise it didnt do much for sound.Returned because it was not great for movies and maybe conversation.But if you have spotify or youtube music this would be great.
The seal was already cut and the box was a little messed up form whoever previously opened it. The speaker is in good condition and worksGreat.
Somewhat disappointed that it has not battery option. But great for a small college apartment
Poor sound. Should've stuck with jbl or bose.
"It is unfortunately fatally flawed. The Bluetooth connection automatically goes on standby after ten minutes of inactivity, i.e., the device disconnects itself from the audio source.... Yes, that means that one has to switch it on an off manually, as if it were a traditional radio. This automatic standby ""feature"" (read: flaw) cannot be disabled. To me (and a lot of other angry customers, as a search will show) this is a deal breaker, because it defeats the purpose of purchasing a device of this kind in the first place.The fact that sound quality is great, that it is aesthetically pleasing and all that, it all becomes a moot point. I do not recommend this product."
"First off, the speaker is great. No complaints there however my package arrived a little wet on the outside box. I’m not sure if this is a carrier issue but it needs to be fixed. It was lucky that it didn’t ruin the speaker but this shouldn’t be happening at all. Maybe at least add another outside box around the original box to help protect the product inside a little better."
"The Bluetooth connectivity was exceptionally simple to set up. This model produces a rich, melodious sound. Love the controls design."
This was a gift and was the only Amazon box I have ever received that didn’t come in another box. Gift was ruined and I was annoyed. Obviously product is totally fine
This product sounded good for the 40 day in worked. I paid $265.00 for it and it only worked for 40 days then the power kept going on and off at random. I spoke to an Amazon Rep and she told me that I was just screwed and that there was nothing she could do so I'm just out my $265.00.  Bed also aware that if you buy the warrintee then you need to ship back to China for repairs and that takes months.
I paired this speaker with my m1 imac and was not impressed. If I could have played both the speaker and built in audio I might have kept it but since there was a slight degradation compared to my iMac speakers I decided I needed to get my money back.
ACTON 2 has much better sound and range.  I don’t know why Marshall did that.  The ACTON 3 sounds very flat and has a Bluetooth design flaw.
Not able to use without power. I feel that because I bought a used like new they gave me a cheaper model
"I wanted the more expensive cream speaker, because aesthetically it looks better to me. However when I received it, I noticed this crack at the bottom. After inspected it further, I realized it’s not a crack but the lining of the wrapping. I emailed Marshalls support to get a replacement because after providing the reasoning for return via Amazon, it directed me to do so. I’m waiting to hear back. I don’t know if all of them look like this and it may not be a big deal to some. However I bought the cream one instead of the black one because of the look, and for the price it’s important to me to love it. The sound is amazing by the way. So no complaints regarding functionality"
"I was looking for a good speaker for the office.  Smaller, classy looking.Researched.  Got the Marshall.Only disappointment is this is just NOT as powerful as the JBL Boombox.  The JBL was close in price, sounds better, and pumps out sound on a greater level than the Marshall.For those reasons…my next one will be a 2nd Boombox."
The Bluetooth disconnects and connects to other phones in range randomly. Make sure you get the one with aux outlet so you can connect by cable.
"You cannot use this speaker and the 2nd generation until you download an app, have the app open and agree to god knows what to JUST listen to music on a speaker. They have the audacity to charge you this amount of money AND still steal your information to sell to third parties. Don't be a victim and return it"
Static sound both with blue tooth and direct connect. Marshall trouble shooting suggest move closer to turntable (defies purpose for bluetooth to put speaker where I like) also suggested turning the volume down! Led Zep on low volume... not for me.
"Sound is great for watching movies, listening to pop or RNB music, there is a strong bass and bright highs, but it is a huge disappointment for heavy rock music, which was quite unexpected considering the brand. Whenever, there is a wide sound picture with lots of instruments playing simultaneously - this can't produce them well and equalizer won't help at all. The sound picture is smudged and unnatural especially with such instruments as electric guitar, leading drum, tambourines and cymbals. I bet the problem is the small tweeter sizes, which can't produce mid ranges and high ranges simultaneously without adding some distortion to them. I guess to do it right separate mid-size and small size tweeters are needed inside the dynamic. I think only Woburn III has such setup.On a positive side I liked that it can keep bluetooth connection to multiple devices at the same time. You don't have to reconnect devices when you want to switch, just press play on the device that you want to use right now. That's convenient.Also it can play very loud, I was surprised. More than enough for 100m apartment."
"It was delivered on August 23 , and completely crashed on October 2!!!Only 34 days!!! No sound, no signal, no reaction at all now!!!I emailed the service department and followed them and did factory reset but still no use!Since then, I emailed them but get zero response!!No response till now!REALLY Disappointed!!"
"the unit is not charging at all. When you unplugged the charger, the unit will automatically turn off"
"I don't know what happened here, but the box came with a lot of damage as you can see in the photo."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I had it For 4 1/2 months. This portable speaker is a bit heavy for me to carry around but basically use it when I’m in the apt. It fills a room about 20’ x 20’ nicely for background music. I am happy with the full sound with the added Base with a touch of a button. Base speakers are on the two ends of the speaker box. I listen to all kinds of music from classical to popular music and they all sound nice. There’s plenty of sample sounds on other reviews. The equalizer can be changed on my iPhone. Go to settings - Apple music app- EQ and set it on the type of music and  it makes some difference. I recommend putting speakers at ear level or on the counter to hear it better.I do have some issues with it: I couldn’t find the charging light for a long time, and it kept saying “No power please recharge” really loud !! Used a different socket and I finally saw in the dark the tiny tiny red light in the back as you can see in the photo. ( I almost gave it one star and give up.) Tiny red light is how you know it’s being charged when battery is super low. The red light turns off within an hour. (Then it’ll play music on 20% volume for less than an hour)And the speaker doesn’t always charge on a particular socket, even though I tested other equipment and it works. I even got another power chord thinking that was the problem.  I charged it overnight, then played music on 30% volume w base on. It played for only 1 hour 50min ! So battery drains real quick. I have to keep it plugged in while it’s on.Another problem I have with it is the loud Noise it makes when I turn it on, “Bluetooth”!!! It needs an option to turn off the sound or set it quieter at factory.Well, if it didn’t have these issues it would be a decent small speaker for 50 bucks on sale."
"The device is a good size for portability, and the bass is good. There are colorful lights that go with beat of music. Having it on max volume quickly drains the battery and even plugged in will not last. A voice will begin to notify you that it’s dying and it can’t be used until fully charged again. It took some time to connect it Bluetooth."
"Decent product, pretty much just dies though without warning. I.e. there is no way to tell it's low battery and when it does tell you it's got about 30-60 seconds til it stops. No option to turn off lights."
"While it's hooked up to my firestick, the sound fluctuates. Hard to hear then voices get loud. Music from cell phone sounds good."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It was easy to connect and sounds really good. I needed something quick to use for Halloween outside our house so I picked this one because of the lights.Edit* I don't love it. You can't go very far from the source before it disconnects. I have smaller/cheaper bluetooth speakers that work better than this.
Dropped mine and it quit working -- composite material shows no damage but internals are jacked
Battery ony lasts 2 hrs max
"Well built and the light features are acceptable (much like any other portable speaker on the market today).  I was hoping for a loud 80w speaker to use on the farm, but this speaker came half short of what was advertised.  My BUGANI-M118 50W speaker is actually much louder than this YIER speaker.  I found using an App like Super Volume Booster seems to increase the YIER speaker by 10%, but would suffer from a bit of distortion when it comes to bass enhanced music.  I guess for a $53 dollar speaker it's worth buying for indoors, and if you will be satisfied with a much lower sound output than advertised."
"So, the sound on this is decent (although it's garbled at first), but the phone has to be right next to it for the player to work. If the phone is more than 4 feet from it, it will either disengage the Bluetooth, or be very garbled. I think I'm going to return it - I paid too much for it to not work perfectly."
"Update: Four months later and the battery is not holding up. It hardly holds a charge anymore.For a speaker of this size and price, it has a really great sound!! Have not yet tested battery life or water resistance, but I'm happy with it so far."
This is an ok speaker. It is much smaller than I thought from the photo's. The Bass boot does Nothing in my opinion. Treble is too much for low bass sound at high volume. Go for a JBL if you want good sound quality.battery life isn't that great either.
Speaker work separately just fine. Decent quality for the price. The speakers do not pair using TWS do not fall for it. I bought two hoping the pairing would be seamless. Buyer be aware!!
Not only does this sound amazing but this is literally the quickest Bluetooth speaker setup I have ever had and I had quite a bit Bluetooth speakers. Also the price was right and I liked it. I can buy another speaker from the exact same company and pair the two to get a even more booming sound! Sadly 4 months later it has stopped changing!
"I returned this after 3 days, and knew I was definitely going to return it after the first night. Right when you turn it on, there's a 50/50 chance that you'll be able to connect your phone over bluetooth. Half the time, you just get ""cannot connect"" error on your phone. Sound quality is poor, bass is overwhelming and it sounds like the music is playing from underneath a large cardboard box. Terrible equalization, and the BASS button does not help reduce this effect. As if all of this wasn't enough, Bluetooth devices disconnect or stutter even when phone is 5 feet away or less. I can't listen to a full 3 minute song without skips, stutters, and random acceleration/deceleration of parts of the music.Amazon tried to warn me when I clicked buy - ""This product is frequently refunded"" and I didn't listen. This is your warning to be smarter than me and save yourself the hassle."
"It is loud, it’s got  great bass.  I have zero issue with anything when it comes to the sound. But the battery life is horrific.  You may get 7 hours of straight runtime. I do construction, so it hasn’t lasted a full day for my hours  Could be defected for all I know when you plug it into charge it the red light comes on but after charging it all night the red light is still on. Normally it would turn blue or something.  If anybody can let me know about that."
"Product is ok! Battery life is not as long as other cheap speakers had in the past. If I’m 10 feet away with my phone in my hand, the connectivity starts cutting out. For the money, not worth it."
"This speaker sounds great and the bass can be turned up making it even better. However, the Bluetooth range is maybe 15 feet if you are lucky. My husband works in construction and I purchased this to replace the last speaker he had. His previous speaker would stay connected no matter the rage while he worked. If there is even a slight obstruction this speaker disconnects. On top of that, the battery life is terrible. It will last maybe 6 hours on a full charge which is nothing compared to what the speaker advertises."
This Bluetooth last about 3 hours and that’s it . It said 20 hours but it don’t . Very disappointed in it .
Battery life is terrible and it's not very loud.
Sound quality is very low and not clear
"I have to reset the Bluetooth connection every three songs due to the music going in and out. Read the manual for this issue and followed the instructions all work briefly and it’s back to the music pausing every three songs. Once it starts, unless you reset it’s constant. The anger that arises from this frustration costs me more than the elevated price I paid. Imagine putting on music to clean, your favorite song comes on followed by a pause in the song every twenty seconds. I’m to the point I don’t use it. It’s defective and I think this is a common issue. Will be returning."
Speaker sounds great with or without the bass up feature. The only thing really holding it back is the battery life. Even at 50% volume it doesn’t last more than 4 hours on a full charge. Keep in mind the advertised length is supposed to be way longer. The speaker tends to glitch out while trying to play when it’s charging.Would recommend if you need something that packs a punch but lacks in battery.
Lightweight and loud enough for me to hear over the machines at work!The battery does not last as long as it says.
I purchased this for an outdoor parade. The sound is amazing inside a building. Love the lights and it is what it says it is- but it doesn’t sound loud outside at all. It was cute but we couldn’t really hear it unless we were directly next to it. Just fyi. Not good for outdoors!
I bought this speaker to listen to at work… fully charged it for 5 hours and it only lasted about 6 hours 😠 I even tried a 2nd time with turning off the bass & lights and it still didn’t last my whole shift. What’s even worse is that you can’t listen to it while it’s charging.I was very disappointed because the sound & quality was great but it’s not so great if you can’t jam out for your 8 hour shift.
This is a $30 speaker at best. No manual to help you figure out equalizer setting. There is no way this speaker is putting out more than 20W. The bass boost is rattled and distorted. Finally this skips and skirts when music is playing...at least 2-3 times a song. Aomais speakers are better in each price category. Those speakers hit harder and no connectivity problems at all.
"First off, I really wanted to like the speaker as I was going to buy another one to pair with both for a more surround experience. Unfortunately the speaker fell short in almost every category. It does get kind of loud for a speaker this size but that's the only positive thing I can find. There is no battery indicator of any kind. The bass mode drowns out all other tones in sacrifice for more bass, turning your music into nothing you'd want to listen to. The outside case is of the cheapest plastic and I wouldn't want to drop this in fear of it cracking open. The lights are a nice, but useless feature other than to drain the battery which only last about 3 hours on low volume WITHOUT the lights on. Overall, this should only cost 30-40 bucks for what you get, not 80-100...  Sadly, I will not be buying another one."
"Read other reviews on this and it seemed ok. When I got it and played it, wasn't that great. The bass is ok but could be a lot better. The sound isn't even that loud, from what others were saying. I don't believe this is even worth a ""party speaker"". I'm actually going to be returning this speaker."
"Purchased two YEIR speakers because they are suppose to pair to each other.  Followed instructions on both speaker, but they won't pair.  This was the reason I purchased these speakers.  Disappointing.  I also wasn't able to fund support for this product or a way to contact seller."
"The sound is great. The battery life is terrible. Even as the battery dies, if you plug it in it won’t work. Returned it after one use. I even tried running it with the bass and lights off and it still dies way too fast. Look elsewhere."
"Nice for outside use but even with full charge, the battery does not last long, maybe six songs"
Said battery would last 20hrs at low volume but it barely makes 5. Wanted for long beach days. Tested at home by playing it around the house. Every time after a full charge speaker would die after little usage. Only had 2 weeks and I am returning.
Equalizer confusing don't know if it even works I get no sound difference regardless how many times you push it
The speaker had Bluetooth issues when I would try to connect my phone. I would have to power the speaker off & on to get it to connect.  The sound quality was very good. I returned it and for a replacement and the replacement didn't seem to have great connectivity as the music would skip. I returned it as well.
It will work a fews. Then it won’t connect. Then it will act as if the device it’s already paired with doesn’t exist. Or is super far away even though it’s right next to it.Don’t buy a waste of money
Pay more and buy a product made by a legitimate company.  Not a fake company that sells stuff on Amazon.Go with JBL. Definitely not this.  I can already see it won’t last.
"This speaker is not worth the money, it doesn’t hold a charge and it completely stopped working after 5 uses. Terrible, just buy a speaker from big lots because it is the same quality"
"Really puts out the sound for teaching at the pool. Waterproof.Update: I bought this in Feb 2024; it won’t turn on or off in September 2024. That means great for 7 months, then dead. Disappointed"
I have been having trouble with the speaker cutting itself off in the middle of playing. It has started to do it more frequently. Any idea on what could be wrong with it. And yes I have tried plugging it up. 🤣
Love this boom box but after 3x charging the input part of charger busted off in box 😢
I am disappointed! The battery doesn't last that long and it takes forever to charge!! Using out at camp and almost always have music playing. Can't listen to it well it's charging either. Using my Jackery to charge.
"I was actually disappointed. I thought this would be louder than the speaker I have Because it's only A 25W And this is a 80W But my 25W blew this one out of the park!!I will say the bass is better on this one, but it also interfered with the music. (Returned)I have the ""Groove onn Boombox"" & love it!"
"Not very loud, and when you use auxiliary it was to make a static noise.  Wouldn't pay full price for it."
Doesn't hold a charge longer than 5 hours
"Decent product but short battery life, even for the price point."
Simply not loud enough. We can barely hear it 10 feet away outside. My tiny portable Bluetooth speaker works just as well. It’s all show.
"Speaker randomly disconnects/has audio cutouts that can only be resolved by reconnecting. Audio quality is decent, bass boost setting sounds awful."
Update 7/26/24: this is a great speaker but unfortunately the charging port broke and feel inside the speaker. Now i cant charge it to use it. I haven't been able to find a way to contact the company about it either. Hopefully they will see this and contact me.This speaker surpassed my expectations. The sound is amazing and it's handled everything I've thrown at it and I listen to my music loud!
"If when the battery gets low, it will save low battery cut out the music and repeat every 2 seconds for about 30 seconds before it just shuts off. The battery life is just really bad.  Drives you crazy, sound quality is ok but there are other units that hold a charge 4 to 5 times longer. Keep it moving"
After 3 days the speakers didnt last on a charge for 3 hours...and seemed to charge fine...big let down.
"I read the reviews and still purchased. This is by far the worst I've ever had. Yes it has good.....great sound, WHEN IT WORKS, which is hardly ever. I MIGHT get through 1 full song with out it cutting off. This is a review I seen of others and thought can't possibly do that. IT DEFINITELY DOES. I really wish it worked correctly as I said when you are able to get it on it sounds great."
"Was originally going to give it 5 stars.Sounds great, decent battery life. After owning for a month or so it now has choppy connection and struggles to remain stable even when it's literally 4 inches away from my phone with nothing interfering.  Super choppy and terribly connection. Bluetooth connection sucks on this now. And I have no devices capable of hard connection so I cannot comment on that"
"This is a poorly made cheap speaker. It looses connectivity often, crackles and makes static noises. I would not recommend."
"Won't connect to any devices, basically requires aux. The peak and quality are lies a bunch of liiies"
"On those rare occasions that the speaker will connect to my phone or sounds great. Mostly, it sounds like nothing because it won't connect. I wish I hadn't missed the return window.I get the couldn't connect error. Turn it off and back on, turn Bluetooth off and back on, unpair, repair, you name it. Sometimes, since random thing will work and it'll connect. Often nothing works. It's a paper weight."
"Got this as a louder but still portable speaker. Sound is great and it is pretty loud, but 3 hours into using it, it died….product says it lasts for a long time, but I had it charging overnight and barely got over 3 hours of play time. Might be a defect?"
"I purchase this boom box and charger didn’t last one time.  When you unplug it, charger c end breaks off.  I’ve ordered 2 and both did the same thing."
No issues besides the terrible battery life.
"Gives you no warning of a low battery, it just shuts off. And even then, when you plug it in, it won’t work for at minimum an hour. You cannot use it when it is charging. Also, the bass is nonexistent.DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
"This product does not work. I’ve had it on charge since it was delivered and followed the instructions on power voltage, didn’t make a difference.Very disappointing since the weather is getting nice and I wanted an outdoor speaker that would sound good and last.Don’t buy this product!I was refunded!"
"Bought this due to high reviews. Charged it fully once arrived. First day using it and lasted maybe 5 hours total. Music was not on high, bass was turned off, color matching was off as well. I’m not sure if I just have a bad battery or just a bad product."
"I charged it fully, and played it for a few hours. Now it will not charge with the included cord, nor with any other cord I have. I’ve tried all combinations, but nothing works. I’ve already recycled the box so I cannot return. Bad purchase.Update - the sellers sent me a replacement but the same thing happened - it will not recharge. I will be returning the second one."
Even after charging overnight the battery only lasts five minutes. Very disappointing purchase. Worked ok for about 2 weeks then crapped out. Tried different cords and chargers just should have sent it back instead of trying to fix it. Do not recommend
"Sounds good, but Bluetooth randomly breaks up. I have other Bluetooth speakers and I can walk pretty far away, I cannot walk 15 feet away without this glitching and breaking up, or just losing connection."
This is not a very quality speaker especially for the price. It won’t play more than two hours no matter how long you charge it and the playback sounds distorted. Very disappointed in this purchase.
Won’t stay charge long smh like a hour long
This unit has good sound. I started using after the New Year and it is now March 18th and sounds quality is horrible. Sounds like the speakers and subs are blown. I don't even put this unit on max volume. It started sounding horrible a couple weeks ago and gets worse and worse. Would not recommend for someone using it daily.
This item is not good for use at its max volume. It looses charge quickly and will shut off. Not for parties or long use. Completely disappointed. Full battery at full volume lasts less than. 2 hours! Ridiculous. I have it plugged in and it still turns off! Wtf!
Worked for a month kept charge and everything. Its been charging all for 24hrs and nothing. It won't keep charge. Its a POS!!! Do not Buy!!!
Unfortunately the battery stopped accepting a charge after a could of months. Never had it near water and treated it gently.Poor quality components..
"Would not turn on and wouldn’t chargeThe instructions are a joke, telling you nothing about charging and the features———-Do not waste your money on a cheap speaker , spend the money on a name brand that you know will work——-афіша"
45 days later after using product battery life is 30 min after full charge .Walmart product last longet the. This
It takes 30 days for your money back. The product is not as loud as it claims for outdoors. This is a $64 dollar value that isn’t even worth the hassle to get your money back.
It is loud but battery doesn’t last more then an hour and I will charge it all night
"The sound is great, but makes the music, skips or jumps etc. I don't like !!!!"
I wouldn't turn up limited volume
The battery life is terrible!! It’s says 24 hours it’s less than 4 on a full charge!! Really disappointed!! The whole point of a cordless speaker is no cords and I have to plug in for over half my day at work. I’d never buy another one.
Do not buy this piece of junk!  Spend a few bucks more to purchase a speaker from a reputable manufacturer.  This unit was dead on arrivial. No amount of charging did anything.  Only the power on/off light illuminated.  You can not pair any device to this speaker.
Battery does not last as advertised. Battery life efficiency lasts only for the first week or so. After that charge will last less than an hour.
Speaker only lasts an hour and a half when fully charged.
"Fully charged it, used it the first day and it froze once for about a minute then started playing again. 2nd day used it for about 10 minutes and it froze again and won’t emit any sound and won’t even power off. Not impressed for the amount of money, had a speaker for half the price for two years and never had any issues."
Cheaply made. My charging port broke so I was only able to use this speaker maybe 2 weeks before it malfunctioned. What a waste.
Item won't charge.  Possibly defective
"The battery died so quick,I charge it for 6-7hrs use it after 1 1hr of using it battery is dead again not good."
"I've had this since August and used it a handful of times.  I really liked it, but it will no longer charge with the cables that came with it or with trusted working chargers."
Will not hold charge
I bought this to play my jams camping - but I couldn’t get it to charge or even turn on right from the box! I ordered a replacement to give it one more try!
Bluetooth stopped working after 2 days. Don't let these reviews fool you this thing only works with an aux after the Bluetooth goes out so have fun. They screwed me. Don't let them screw you
Don't waste your money!!! Returned after two days because of poor sound quality. Plus when I came to review the speaker there was already a glowing review..... that I did not write...
Speaker stopped charging a week longer than the return date.BUYER BEWARE
This is a complete waste of money. I have had it for 3 days and it already has spotty bluetooth connection. Will be returning.
Speaker sounds like it’s blown after 3 uses
"I received my two speakers today and they will not pair,waiting for a call back from yier how to correct this problem.UPDATE,volume level is barely louder than my old single Aomais speaker,will return and go to W-King"
"Music was distorted, almost like the speaker was blown.  EQ?  Never figured out how to get the EQ to work and I’m an A/V tech.  Buy the Anker Soundcore Motion Boom Or Select Pro."
knot holding the battery charge fir long
"Context:First Oontz Angle 3 speaker bought in 2023 and seeing in the manual you could do dual stereo connection, I decided to buy the speaker again in the following year as a gift. Come 2024, it was purchased but not opened and tested until past the 30 day return window. At this time, it was found that dual stereo connection does not work. After many back and forth of Oontz email customer support suggesting I purchase a different set of speakers outside my budget, they ended the email chain with ""The best we can advise you is to purchase the dual pair speaker(s)."" While requesting to exchange either the old or new speaker, CS replies with ""it won't be possible to exchange a specific speaker that matches any of your speakers since they're randomly rolled out."" While this whole situation is understandable to an extent, I definitely felt a bit ripped off since there was no real way to know I can't just buy a replacement speaker at any time of the same model when neither the amazon listing or the user manual mentions WHEN I purchase the speaker matters in terms of compatibility.Dislikes:- The Amazon listing does not mention the requirement of year model for dual stereo connectivity- Given the model of the speaker I was trying to troubleshoot, customer support gives me links suggesting firmware updates that this speaker model does not qualify for- ""The OontZ Angle 3 speakers you own should be able to dual pair if they are in the same year model.""- 4 of the 6 emails (first asking for pictures of the models, other email generic response email) was suggesting I purchase a different set of speakers- There is very limited bass- Using a generic 4 pole 3.5mm aux may not work, requiring a 3 pole 3.5mm audio only aux instead- When volume increased sufficiently on the speaker, there is a lot of noise that is amplified when audio is quiet- Lack of low latency mode for BT for video playback or gamingLikes:- Loud and reasonably clear- Easy to press buttons- There is a separate speaker volume disconnected from the source device- Can charge while in use- Has wired connection- CS team quick to respond"
I thought it’s made by Cambridge that sound would be awesome on first impression and also inspired by the number of reviews. Tested a few songs for only 5 minutes with several songs that sound is muffled and hi frequency is disappointing. I find the sound from my iPhone and iPad are much clearer and better than this unit. Very disappointed so I will return and spend a bit more money to try Soundcore 2S.
"Most reviewers ignore the testing of this device for TV listening, where the lack of synchronization between sound and picture is off.  It's very disturbing to see the mouth move and the sound come out later.It doesn't matter when listening to music, because the latency isn't an issue.  There's no picture there to notice the latency.I think the latency issue is inherent with consumer grade bluetooth devices.  Both the TV and the speaker are on the same system, so i think the whole idea of TV use for bluetooth is fundamentally flawed.With this unit, the control buttons cannot be seen easily because they blend in with the background of the side panels.  Also, the power switch is hidden in a covered compartment on the top of the unit along with the charging port and the auxiliary input jack.  Cannot easily see the controls and requires fumbling to access and choose the right button to press without picking up the item and turning it to see the markings.The triangular design is brilliant for placing speaker on desk top for optimum dispersion of directional high frequencies and can be placed horizontally and vertically on surface with non-skid rubberized case.Finally, this item is very small, about the size of a fist, so it's unobtrusive on a desk top or table.Sound is barely acceptable for music as no lower frequencies are reproduced, so music is tinny and thin.  OK for dialog."
"I have a smaller version of this speaker and it's great so I thought I would upgrade to a larger one, the issue is there is a delay in the audio from the phone to the speaker that I can't fix. I was going to buy another one for work, but forget it."
"Well, I can't really complain too much. You pretty much get what you pay for. The sound quality was average. It's range was quite disappointing actually. It gets a little glitchy at about 20 ft. Any slight obstruction will kill the signal."
"Have bought product before, although larger size.  I remember getting a charging cord with past ones ordered. I bought current one as a gift and had no charging cord."
"Before buying this speaker, I did my research and I watched a few videos from other reviewers as well. I made my choice and bought this Oontz speaker. Such a disappointment, to say the least. I bought it so that I could bluetooth it to my phone and be able to jam out while out on rides on my electric scooter. Let me get to the good first... the battery life. This sucker lasts! I charged it to 100% when I first got it in and haven't had to charge it since (I only use it for an hour or 2 per day... and only 3 days out of the week). However... The bad... I have it turned all the way up! I mean full volume. Then I turn my phone volume all the way up as well... and I still can't hear it like i should. Maybe I got a dud? Maybe those guys were lying just to continue getting free products? Who knows... but I know that with my phone and speaker volumes all the way up, It is still low. At first I thought it was just the song I was listening to, so I changed it... then again, then again... and finally realized... that this speaker isn't what I had hoped for. My electric scooter is quiet... I mean super quiet. On the trails where I ride... it is in the middle of nowhere. Literally. I live in a very small country town with nice scenic views and nice, smooth concrete trails where people can ride bikes & scooters and just relax and enjoy the view... I like to hear a little bit of music while i ride and this just ain't working. At all. Don't waste your time or money on this one. I am going to have to buy another brand and give them a try now."
"Maybe I'm being too critical, but this thing has been really over-hyped. It's a good speaker, don't get me wrong, but the wisdom of ""you get what you pay for"" holds true. Cambridge is very much a middle-of-the-road name in speaker quality and price, but have been known to impress on occasion.This one fell firmly in the ""eh, not bad"" category, which for me means it gets returned and that money goes into a slightly more pricey one.Sound is good and clear, even at higher volumes, but the bass response is not even remotely close to what you get from any JBL or a speaker in the next tier up, as some.reviewers claim.Good quality speaker, and worth every penny they charge for it. But if you're looking for the best at this price point, you can honestly skip over this one."
"I really wanted to love this speaker since it was purchased on prime day for a great deal. Sound was clear but really has no base. I ended up sending it back as the JBL speaker sounds just as clear and has aLOT of base. This speaker was very easy to pair, light weight and fits almost anywhere as it is pretty small. Battery life was very good, lasted about 3 days with about 2 hour playtime each day. Good weight and felt sturdy"
"This is an email I sent to Cambrige in regards to my concerns about device I am posting it because it is essentially a review***BEGINNING OF EMAIL***As you can see from [the order]  I ordered both the angle 2 and 3 [OA2 and OA3] . The OA2 i got for my neighbor.  I am having an issues with the angle 3 to give background information  I am a Dj, and audio producer so I am well versed in the many variables of sound quality .I am getting distortion from the angle 3. I first noticed when compare the sound quality between the OA2 and OA3.  The OA2 has a much more accurate [sound] which is also a very warm natural playback while the OA3 an exaggerated top end, its almost as if there is an internal hi freq boost from about 3.1k to 14k. to increase perceived loudness. I have compensated this by lowering the frequency in these bands in a custom eq i set on my phone which greatly improves the accuracy of the playback and lessens the harshness  but does not do anything for the distortion. Its almost as there is harmonic distortion being created by the amplifer.  I'm presuming its from the amp that is causing the distortion, as I noticed this under all conditions but more so when played louder and/or under certain conditions: 1] female vocals [Eryca Badu Jill Scot] this is very noticeable when comparing to the OA2. the OA2 is warm and smooth while the OA3 has a  raspy scratchy distortion over the vocals  this is noticeable even when the volume is relatively low.  The other time it is very noticeable is  A bass guitar playing around 100hz-300hz[including the guitar harmonics its probably about 300hz-900hz  [well with in range of this device] These notes creates a very noticeable buzzing overdrive distortion sound  when playing from a medium volume and up[The song was Flashing lights by BBNG] this song is the most noticeable because the bass guitar is a solo at the beginning of the track so you can pin point that this is not from any other instrument in the track . Its even more noticeable because on this track  the only variable is the volume : if your playing it medium low there relativity no distortion but when playing it medium to medium high the distortion increases rapidly. the distortion is defintily an issue. To rule some out variables all critical testing has been with high quality 320kbps tracks and have been tested on both the OA3 and OA2. . .  and this fault only occurs on the OA3 plus for reference I routinely play these same tracks from the same source  on my mains which are are set of Professional Mackie C300's which are of studio reference quality .  Im kind of torn between the OA2 and OA3,OA2 Pro:s super warm, accurate smooth flat sound response excellent [no eq needed], battery life  Cons Not as loud and its biggerOA3 Pro's: small and loud [extra head room for low tracks]  Con's Not  warm at all, has artificially boosted high end frequency[not a flat accurate response], further all the high end makes it sound very harsh ,plus horrible distortion as the volume gets louder.Of all these these comments I have made here, most of them seem to be by design for a superficial perceived increase in volume  except for this distortion which seems to an amplifier issue and/or potentially a driver issue.  Im looking forward to doing a youtube review on this itemNote when reading through the reviews there other people who report these same faults/issues [distortion/unnatural high end frequency]  which makes me wonder is this all units or just certain ones.Many ThanksMike RiveraAny assistance would be greatly  appreciated***END OF EMAIL***I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS A 5 if it weren't for the superficial exaggerated high end and the distortion, besides these 2 things I really really love it. Hopefully Cambridge will resolve this issue.  To every body considering this device if your not an audiophile you probably will not notice what i am talking about BUT if you have an ear for quality these defects are annoyingly noticeable! Especially when comparing it to the older cheaper  Oontz angle plus [2]. which is only 22 dollars and has a 15 hour battery lifeNOTE IF you want to EQ this for better sound , you want drop 3.1khz by-5db  8khz by -3db and 14k by -3db when you do this it sounds almost as warm as the OA2 except it still has the distortion on certain tracks . the Distortion may be a defect so I am awaiting cambridges response ,"
"This purchase was a great reminder that even with a huge amount of positive reviews, a product doesn’t necessarily meet the needs for each individual customer. I’m disappointed with the sound quality; it’s clear but it has a lot of treble — bordering on a tinny sound. There’s no option to increase the bass, so you’re left with what the speaker gives you. Don’t be lured by snazzy product images and thousands of star ratings!"
"I am conflicted writing this review. I bought one over 8 years ago and it's running stong. One drawback is the  unit no longer holds a full charge and the battery life isn't as long, which is totally expected for a product that I've been using for quite some time. It is durable and I absolutely love it and have recommended it to many of my friends.To our delight, one of our friends gave us one for a birthday gift about 13months ago. Until recently, the battery does not fully charge, and when connected to my PC via bluetooth, it says battery life is 40%. I've tried to do a factory reset, plugged directly into the wall, etc. I even contacted Oontz customer service. They were quick to respond which I truly appreciated. This is where I get conflicted, after multiple back and forth with pictures and videos being sent, additional trouble shooting efforts, they asked if I had a receipt. I advise I had receive it as a gift over a year ago and didn't have one. Their response, we will give you a 20% discount on the purchase of a new one.I get it, their policy for warranty is 1 year. If we are to look at it black and white, I missed the cutoff and I don't have a receipt nor does the gift giver have it still. But, when a company sells hundreds of thousands of product and consistenly has high reviews for their products, you would hope that they would view this one unit as being defective and fully stand behind the quality of their products. I said I wasn't looking for a replacement and asked for a 50% discount.  They said no and said they were sorry. On a $30 product, their intial offer was for a $6 discount. Not even worth the trouble. At a 50% discount, they would still be making a few dollars. On a difference of $9, they lost a customer for good."
I was disappointed at the tiny size and the weak bass that goes with that. When they call it a small speaker that's for sure. If portability and being able to fit in a coat pocket is your priority then maybe this is the item for you. Not for me. I sent it back to Amazon. Also found  out it's not stereo despite having 2 speakers. Want stereo? You have to buy a second copy.
"We were looking for a relatively inexpensive portable wireless Bluetooth speaker to replace a fun –looking Big Lots “boom box” style speaker that lasted for about a year.  Our primary use is for streaming music or internet radio services such as Pandora and Spotify, and listening by the pool and while having dinner.My wife and I decided to take a listen to 3 highly reviewed speakers that received mostly positive reviews on Amazon.  Here are the 3 speakers tested:1.  Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 (Cost: $27.99)2.  Anker SoundCore (Cost: $35.99)3.  JBL Flip 3 Splashproof ($81.30)We were really hoping that the less expensive speaker models would perform close to the JBL Flip 3 Splashproof, but that just wasn’t the case.  Upon the very first look, when opening up the box, you get a sense that Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 is a very no-frills, inexpensive speaker.  The packaging, the speaker, the extremely short, tiny USB charging cable.  Visually speaking, this speaker screamed no-frills.Conversely, the Anker SoundCore gave the impression that you were opening up a well-constructed, tiny speaker.  It was packaged nicely, easy instructions, it felt a lot more substantial than the Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3.  And finally, the USB charging cable looked like your average size charging cable for your portable devices.Lastly, was the JBL Flip 3 Splashproof.  At $81.30, it was a lot more money than we were hoping to spend on a portable pool speaker.  It was plain to see visually that this speaker just looked “ more expensive” than the other two models.  Great packaging, a super long and thick  USB charging cable that came in an eye-catching orange colored jacket.  The speaker itself looked awesome with its compact cylinder shape.Enough about the appearance… a speaker is all about ease of use and more importantly -- how it sounds.  How did all 3 sound and how easy were they to use?On all 3 speakers in our test, we used 3 separate Samsung Galaxy 7s phones.  We played the same identical songs on each speaker and set the volume identical on all 3 phones.  Here were our results-1.  Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3.  Unfortunately, this speaker was the least inspiring of the three speakers.  The sound was clear. However, it sounded tiny, none to very little bass to speak of, it projected a rather flat sound with the various music we played through it.  It was though extremely easy to use, and the Bluetooth worked flawlessly.  I would generously give it 3 Stars.  On sound alone, I’d say it’s more 2 Stars.2.  Anker SoundCore – This speaker was hands-down better than the Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 for just a few dollars more.  Lots of great features – all of which worked perfectly.  The only downside of the Anker SoundCore was that it lacked bass.  The sound coming out of the Anker SoundCore is very balanced and fairly loud for such a small speaker.  I would lean more towards the 4 Star mark on the Anker SoundCore simply  for delivering a very nice, balanced, sound quality and is capable of filling a small room.3.  JBL Flip 3 Splashproof – At $81.30, we were really hoping that this wouldn’t be a situation where “you get what you pay for”.  Unfortunately, it was in the end.  Regardless of the song, or the type of music we played through it, it was far superior to the other two speakers.  It worked flawlessly and the sound/projection of sound coming out blew away the other two speakers.  The Flip 3 Splashproof produced a rich, full sound that was extremely clear and thumped with just the right amount of bass. It easily fills space with great clarity.All-in-all,the JBL Flip 3 Splashproof blew away this competition.  5 Stars.  If you’re on a tight budget, you can’t go wrong with the Anker SoundCore.  If you can swing the extra bucks for the JBL Flip 3 Splashproof – go for it!  It sounds amazing!Update:  Even though the JBL Flip 3 Splashproof sounds very good, the Bluetooth range is awful.  As long as your phone is within a very short distance of this speaker you will be happy.  The Bluetooth range on the Anker is WAY better than the JBL."
"I use this connected to my PC all day. I may watch a video or a clip intermittently while actively browsing. If I haven't used audio in longer than 15 minutes the power off feature requires me to reboot the speaker and there's no way to disable that feature. I'll be returning this. Too bad, because I love the sound quality and form factor of this."
"Update 3/1/2017This is an update to my glowing review of two weeks ago. I have since found significant sonic defects in this speaker, and fortunately a workaround for them.My positive assessment still stands for use at medium to high volumes. In those situations, the sound is very good. The Angle 3's problems show up at low volumes, for example, listening to classical music with the speaker on a bedside table. Here there is an audible hiss, and static/distortion when connected by Bluetooth.There are two problems:1) A constant hiss that overlays all sound when using either Bluetooth or the audio cable. The hiss is loud enough to hear clearly over quiet passages and silences. It occurs even when the cable's inputs are shorted to ground, and is proportional to the speaker's own volume setting. Therefore it is generated by the audio amplifier section of the speaker itself, a design defect.2) When connected by Bluetooth, two more problems appear. First, when the BT source signal is low, either because the content is quiet or the source volume is set low, speaker sound gets distortion and static. I won't fault the speaker, since the root cause might be the BT protocol itself, but you should know that this happens.The second issue is more troublesome. Apparently there is some kind of silence detection that switches off the speaker's audio amplifier whenever the source becomes silent. Unfortunately, when listening to a quiet passage with silences, the effect is note…hiss…total silence…note…hiss…total silence. Even more unfortunately, the speaker's circuits make a little click when switching off and a little pffft when switching on. So you hear: note…hiss…tick…total silence…pffft…note, etc. The effect is a very annoying spoiler of the music itself.Here's the good news. After experimenting, I found a fix, one that's perhaps obvious in hindsight. To listen quietly, use the speaker's controls to turn down its volume to the lowest setting. Turn up the source volume to a high setting. The result is that the speaker's amp is turned down and with it the internal hiss. With Bluetooth, the high source volume eliminates the static and distortion. It also stops triggering the silence detection, so you no longer get the hiss…tick…pfft artifacts.Of course, to listen at  normal room or party volume you will need to increase the speaker's own volume setting. The simple takeaway is to keep the source at the highest volume practical, and instead use the speaker's controls to set overall volume, so that the speaker's own volume stays as low as possible.Star rating adjusted from 5 to 3 because…1) Audio amplifier section introduces audible hiss at low input volume.2) Silence detection/amp switch-off makes the sound worse. It would be much better to leave amp on allowing the hiss to be constant.3) Cambridge Soundworks failed to acknowledge these design defects and to publish the solution for them, causing a sub-par experience for some of their customers, and wasting my time.Original review (2/15/2017) follows...------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This has turned out to be one of the best gadgets I have ever bought. High volume, low distortion, perfect stereo sound and easy connection via Bluetooth or via audio cable. We place it in front of a large computer monitor for sound with movies, and use it as a portable speaker connected to a phone by Bluetooth.Some random observations:- I chose this model because it is advertised as water-resistant. A very humid summer in the Yucatan destroyed my previous speakers by rotting the speaker gasket. It remains to be seen whether this one will survive.- Small speaker design must have advanced the past few years - better Class-D amplifiers and enclosure design. This tiny speaker outperforms expensive ones I bought only three years ago. It is loud, emits bass, and is distortion-free except at the very highest volume.- Bluetooth connection to an Android phone is perfect sonically and happens automatically after one simple setup.- Speaker controls are simple, logical, and elegant.- It hits the sweet spot that balances performance, size, simplicity, and cost.- Cons: battery will eventually wear out and is not replaceable. Have used regularly for a month, and will update this review if problems show up.I am completely satisfied, and will happily buy more for gifts, and when this one breaks. Let's hope the company does not replace it with an ""improved"" model that is worse than its predecessor, creating an eBay market for the older model at huge markups. See Original JBL Duet, Sansa Clip+, 2012 MacBook Pro, among many other examples. Cambridge SoundWorks, please do not discontinue this speaker unless the next one is objectively better in the experience of actual customers. User testing and feedback is your greatest ally against profit squeezing, corporate momentum, and designers' egos."
NOT BAD. CAN BE PURCHASED.  I WOUMD RECOMMEND SAME.
"If you want to buy this speaker to use with Alexa, the reason I did it because is wireless, don’t do it. Don’t work like the Amazon ones, is almost the same have it without Alexa (always through the phone, no hands free, and says no compatible with Spotify) and the pairing is difficult. Otherwise, the sound is decent."
"If you wish to use this with Echo devices: it needs to pair with an Echo device in order to function BUT in doing so it renders that Echo device mute. Basically trading out one speaker for another. If the reason for your purchase is to add another speaker, as was mine, don’t bother."
"I had an older Oontz speaker for years and it had great sound. I loved it. It ended up in the donation box last year.  I decided to buy a new one to use with my Roku tv phone app. I let it charge for 4 hrs then paired it with my phone via Bluetooth. It took a few tries to get it to pair, which was unexpected since I had my phone within 2 ft of the speaker.Turned on Netflix using the Oontz speaker for sound. I am so very disappointed in the sound quality. It’s really bad - sound is muffled and difficult to understand the dialog.  It sounds like it’s in a tunnel. The sound quality has diminished significantly since my original Oontz speaker I had for years. The headphone jack doesn't work.I am being generous with 3 stars"
"These speakers really shouldn't have been made. Also, OontZ really needs to fix their Amazon listings (more on that later).These speakers are basically the Angle 3 with a better IPX rating (water proofing) but lack 1 major feature: surround sound pairing. Not to mention the app that is supposed to give you more control of the audio is pretty much unusable.As a little background to this review I purchased the original Angle 3 about 3 years ago and really enjoyed it and still do to this day. I was wanting to upgrade because the old one uses micro USB to charge and I wanted a USB C since many of my electronics are USB C. I also wanted a slightly bigger speaker for a richer bass experience. I immediately searched Oontz because of my positive experience with the original Angle 3.I came across their Angle 3 product page which also has a listing for the Angle 3 Solo, Angle 3 plus, Angle 3 Ultra, and Angle 3 Pro. I was researching the reviews and features for all 5 speakers and decided on the Ultra because of the slightly bigger size AND the capability of having 2-4 speakers synced together for a stereo listening experience. I was extremely disappointed in those because of a weird volume fluctuation at lower volume levels and specific Hz. When I turned the volume higher the issue wasn't present. Not a good product.I ultimately returned those and bought these speakers. I got 2 because of what I thought would be the same capability of pairing 2-4 speakers for a stereo experience. I also thought these were bigger than the regular Angle 3s, (they are the same size). All 4 of their other Angle 3 products had the capability so why not these? Well, these DO NOT have the dual speaker pairing like all 4 of their other products have (within the same page). Mix that with them essentially being the same size as the Angle 3 and these shouldn't even exist. Sound quality wise they are very similar to the Angle 3. The description on their page mentions dual speakers multiple times so this speaker should really be on its own page or just not exist. In fact, I really think OontZ needs to update how they list their products.What they do is, (maybe it's Amazon's fault for allowing this practice) they keep the item's page the same even though they have new generations of the item. This allows OontZ to keep the thousands of ratings from their previous generation of the speaker but they update the page's description when they come out with a new speakers. The problem is that Amazon customers heavily rely on the rating/review system and the Q&A section so it gets confusing when people ask questions about the product and the answer is for outdated products. It would be better if each generation of speakers had their own page so reviews and Q&As were more accurate to the most up-to-date items.Overall I wouldn't recommend these speakers since you can get the Angel 3 for less and experience the surround sound features."
"My trusty Sony speaker of 8 years or so is losing its battery life fast, so I got this as a gift. I am disappointed by the sound quality. In particular, it has no bass. It is closer to a janky checkout speaker at a superstore than to my old Sony. Unfortunately, there is no bass boost or EQ feature at all on this speaker. On Apple devices, you can try to use ""small speakers"" or ""Increase Bass"" or ""Treble Reducer"" EQ, but you're just not going to get a crisp, full sound. That being said, I was surprised at how affordable this product is, so I would not expect to get what I'm describing at this price point. And I am actually very impressed by how loud this thing can get, its range, and its battery life (so far). But don't let the reviews fool you. You get what you pay for. This does not come close in sound quality to other options."
Great sound but only lasted 3 years-all static in audio now-thought it would last longer
"I'll be direct, I bought this because the review said it had decent bass. I'm not trying to thump, but I am trying to hear most of the full range of the movies that I watch without waking up the household.This thing has no bass. This thing has no mid-bass. I would imagine it would be great for classical listeners or those that enjoy big band as it does have a loud, clear sound down to I'm guessing 300 Hz or so. I also thought it was going to be larger than it is; it's the width of two fire Stick remotes and the same length as one. The drivers are about the size of a 50 cent piece, so I didn't expect much when I got it out of the box. On the upside, it connected almost instantly to my fire stick so that was nice.Caveat emptor."
"great sound, it is loud but the BT range is off"
"My initial observation is that it won't last long. Even with its water proof rating. The rubber ends pull off completely and easily, exposing the electric board. Not sure how that's water proof.The sound is good. And its a good small size.I will take it on vacation and see if it holds up. Otherwise. I will likely be returning."
"Here is why I upgraded my rating from 1-Star to a 3-Star:  As it turned out, after charging this speaker, it no longer had the problem of losing blue tooth connection.  Apparently, there is a condition after using the speaker for a long while that it should be charged again, but the red led doesn't lite up telling me it needs to be charged.  But it really does need to be charged, because I'm loosing blue tooth connection after a few minutes of use.  Now I know to recharge the speaker when 1) the red led comes on and I can't turn the speaker ON, or 2) I can turn it ON, but I lose blue tooth connectivity after a few minutes of use.For a great $20 speaker, I can live with this annoyance. Here is what I like about the speaker:-  It runs many hours with it on full volume before I start it starts loosing blue tooth connection.- At full volume, the sound is LOUD so I can use it while doing chores inside or outside the home.- It has a greater blue tooth range than any other device I currently own- I especially like that it will automatically connect with my phone whenever I turn this speaker on.  For example,  if the speaker is off, and I hear my phone ringing, I can turn the speaker on, press the * button (by the blue led), and it connects to my phone immediately and I can take the call through the speaker!Previous comment for 1-Star rating: Worked great for one month...Now, almost a couple of days after 30 day Amazon free return has expired, it constantly loses blue tooth connection a few minutes after turning it on."
"I’ve owned an earlier model of this speaker and loved it. Very sturdy (dropped many times and never damaged) and surprisingly great sound quality.Unfortunately it was recently lost so I decided to seek out and find the newer model to purchase.Right out of the gate, I noticed it was much smaller than the one owned before and from taking it out of the box it was clearly not built as well as the original. Now the sound test, not even close to the quality of the original. Almost no bass sound and not as loud.Even though it was marked down and was around the same price as the one I bought 5 years ago, they have clearly made changes for the worse likely to save money on components sacrificing quality and performance.Overall, feels cheap. Disappointed"
"It really pains me to say this, but it's true. I've been a solid cheerleader for everything Oontz since I discovered them almost 5 years ago. I have the 1st Gen Angle 3, from 4 years ago and still going strong and the Ultra which is great as well for 3 years. So I decided to order an upgraded Angle 3 because it's upgraded with more sound, I don't understand how that is even possible because it's still the same 10 watts of output but I gave it a go. Sadly, the main thing I noticed is how tinny it sounds over my original one with the same level of loudness, so no improvement there just regrets. Also, the bass is half of what it used to be. I can take my original and put it up against a hollow wall or an interior door and hold it there and it massively increases the bass tone to where people think it's a much higher wattage speaker. Honestly impressive. I did the same thing with the upgraded Angle 3 and it's barely there with a sound that has almost zero punch. I'm really not happy. If it ain't broken, don't fix it unless you really are improving upon greatness. Also, you can do super Bluetooth but after a few seconds the upgraded one starts lagging a half second behind the original. Now I can understand that this may be something with my phone so I'm not making a huge deal about it. This has just left a bad and bitter taste and has me seriously regretting my purchase."
"When u pair 2 of these, there's a lag on one. This is my 3rd one as my dog ate the first one....the first 2 paired perfectly. Idk what happened this go round"
"I'm starting to think the average person doesn't know what good sound quality is.LOUD DOES NOT EQUATE TO GOOD SOUND.With that said, allow me to present the pros and cons...Pros:-Good, loud volume-Battery life is really good so far. Hopefully it stays good. I've only had to charge it twice in a month, once right out of the box (it had some charge to it already when I got it) and the yesterday when I played it all afternoon in the garage.-Bluetooth connectivity is nearly instantaneous, which is awesome. It has good range. Doesn't lose the connection at all.-Used it to talk on the phone and listen to virtual meetings and nothing dropped. The voice volume was crystal clear, and the microphone picked up my voice really well.-Durable little unit. Rubber sides, so it can more than likely take a fall and fare well, but it probably wouldn't fall with those rubber ends.-Triangular prism shape makes it easy to old and balance itself.-Haven't and do not plan to test the water resistant capabilities.Sounds awesome so far, huh?Cons: Music sounds bland playing through this speaker. Yes, is loud and clear, but it is not a full, rich sound. Mostly mids and highs. Bass is probably less than average, but you get what you pay for, right? Bass is virtually nonexistent and cheap sounding. I would pay a little more for a JBL speaker, as I have used one and it had AMAZING sound quality (louder, richer, fuller, broader). There are other $25 options in amazing that have better sound quality, too. I was hoping to save some money, but sadly it didn't work out. I was hoping the speakers just needed some time to stretch out and settle, as all speakers do, and it helped a little, but a little on top of bad isn't much.I like this speaker, as I mainly use it in the garage when I'm working on a project or in the backyard when I'm grilling or playing cornhole, but when I want a full sound without the loud volume when I'm fishing or hanging with friends, this speaker fails me.I know there are more pros than cons, but the average, underwhelming sound is a HUGE one for me, as listening to music is what bought this for. I like this speaker, but I am faaaar from loving it."
The sound quality is ok but the volume is very low.  Not even close to what I needed.  Spend a little more money to get a better product.
"So I bought the Oontz Angle 3 after my v2 went bust last year (wouldn't charge anymore). The Oontz Angle 2 was a perfectly respectable and usable little budget Bluetooth speaker; it had a surprisingly solid bass kick, clear mids, and crisp highs that weren't tinny or invasive. The Oontz Angle 3, however (smaller than the v2) has clear mids (very clear actually), but the highs are tinny and the bass is surprisingly non-existent compared to its forebearer. This is after I put it on the floor in the corner (a location the v2 excelled at) and other spots around our apartment, playing music I know well. It's possible that the bass function is entirely broken in this specific unit, so I'm not ruling that out. But if that isn't the issue, then I'm genuinely surprised that Oontz would make their v3 so much less than what their v2 was capable of projecting sound frequency-wise. The cool thing about these units is that they have an aux in, which I love to use for various older media players that were made prior to Bluetooth. So I'm hoping that the lack of bass and poor sound quality on the highs is a fluke."
"I really like the sound and size of this little wireless BT speaker. Unfortunately, there's a very tiny but annoying problem with the sound being very slightly out of sync with YouTube videos, which is the whole reason I ordered it. I like that it's wireless, but to fix the sync problem, I've attached an audio cable which defeats the whole purpose and the dust flap needs to be forced open the entire time. I looked for solutions online and Oontz offers an adapter for a minimum of $25 - why not fix the problem internally?! I'm reluctantly returning for a wired speaker."
Bought on Amazon days. I have a similar Tribit speaker. The Tribit seems much better built and sounds better. This one is okay but not great
"The speaker is good for the size but the advertised dual pairing feature does not work no matter how many times I follow all the instructions over and over and over again. Don't purchase two of these in hopes of it working for dual pairing because its not a guarantee it'll work for you. I'm so disappointed. For added context, I'm attempting dual pairing this one with another Oontz Angle 3 (Coca-Cola edition)."
"1.  The speaker is good BUT there is NO volume indicator other than the ""+"" and ""-"" symbols.  2.  When you increase or lower the volume, it does NOT change the volume indicator on your system (my mac).  This is confusing.  For example, if my Mac's volume is on say a 2 of 10 level BUT the Oontz is at a 10 of 10 level, it will have a LOW volume.  The REAL volume is a function of BOTH the mac's volume setting AND the Oontz's setting BUT the Oontz does NOT have an indicator so you do NOT know what level it is on.  3.  When I turned on the mic on Skype, and was playing a youtube song the output was VERY VERY muffled.  i.e., This unit is NOT compatible with Skype on a mac.  The ONLY way to get it to work is to turn the mic ON and OFF whenever you are NOT using skype which is a real pain.  4.  When I tested the Oontz mic (yes, it has one) on a Skype Test call - the result was a horrible quality.  In short, the mic STINKS.  It's a 2 of 10 at best.  So do NOT buy this as a speaker phone or you will be VERY sorry.  5.  Speaking of which, if you use this as a speakerphone, duh, the mic WILL pick up the OUTGOING spoken words and WILL - by definition - CREATE feedback.  Why?  B/c you really need to use this mic with a headset, NOT with outgoing sound.  Translation?  The ONLY way to get this to work properly on a mac / skype - is to use the crappy Oonz mic with a headset so there is no feedback.  *** Summary *** Though the speaker itself is great, the mic stinks and the fact there is NO volume indicator AND it does NOT change the Mac's volume - well, you really have to just GUESS how to adjust the volume between the mac settings and the oontz.  The way I did this was to set the mac's volume to about 8 of 10 and then play a test audio / youtube song video and raise the Oontz volume via the buttons until the Oontz sound maxed out.  Then I back it down 25% or so (by ear) and THEN I ONLY use(d) the Mac volume controls AFTER I know where the Oontz is set.  SoundWorks should put a volume indicator LED on this unit.  Good speaker, bad controls, bad mic, bad speakphone."
"The sound quality from the speaker is pretty great for the price. However, the charging port died after about a year and a half. No longer takes a charge, so it is useless. Contacted their technical support. And they just told me that it was out of warranty, sorry. Disappointing that they only expect one year of life out of their products. Take that into account when you purchase one.This happened on the last one of these that I owned, only it lasted almost 5 years so that wasn't too bad. I don't expect this to die after a year and a half. Too bad, because the sound quality is pretty good.The charging port died after about a year and a half. No longer takes a charge, so it is useless. This happened on the last one of these that I owned, only it lasted almost 5 years so that wasn't too bad. I don't expect this to die after a year and a half. Too bad, because the sound quality is pretty good.Also note, this version adds an extra button for Alexa, which is totally useless, but makes it almost impossible to know by touch which buttons are which, which was very handy for using in the shower previously."
"I have had this speaker since July of this year. I've connected both via bluetooth and wire. I recently started noticing that the sound coming out of it is distorted. I turned it up and it completely died! I let it sit for a few minutes and came back to life, but still sounding really distorted. Time to throw it away!"
It will do
"Review for:  Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 Next Generation Ultra Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker : Louder Volume 10W+, More Bass, Water Resistant, Perfect Speaker for Golf, Beach, Shower & Home (Black)        I purchased the OontZ Angle in January 2016 because I wanted a speaker to have in the shower and take on the go for hiking and picnics. I was originally attracted to the speaker because of its low price point and its advertised ability to withstand many adverse conditions. Initially I was very satisfied with the speaker, and it performed well for over a year with no issues until suddenly one day it stopped taking a charge. It still functions, but must be plugged in to work. Details on this are at the bottom.Good:Sound: It’s not very big, only a little larger than a soda can, but the sound it pumps out  is good quality. I’ve never had this at full volume for a regular party setting, and the sound can easily fill a room at medium volume. Even at full volume though, the sound retains its quality, no distortions in bass or treble, good for outdoor settings where sound can get lost easily.Build: It feels hefty and solid, and the rubber grips on the ends protect it from falls or bumps. I’ve taken this on trips where it’s been exposed to sand and water and it’s functioned perfectly.Connection: The bluetooth connection has a good range, about 20-30 feet in a straight line with no obstructions. Indoors however, walking into another room with your phone can cause crackling and skips.Charging/battery: The primary use of this was as a speaker for my shower, so after a couple hours to reach full charge, I would play it for 15 minutes every day and usually wouldn’t have to charge it again for a month or so. When I would use it for parties though, it could easily last for several hours with no problem. I once had it playing all day for ~10 hours at mid volume with no issue.Price Point: Although there are more expensive speakers out there that will give you higher quality sound, or perhaps look sleeker, for most people who aren’t sound artists, this speaker will be just fine. For around 30 dollars I was satisfied with how it performed and as I said, you could pay for a $100 speaker, but you probably won’t notice a huge sound difference.Meh:Mic: I rarely used the built in mic function. I usually found it more annoying than helpful when I was listening to music and suddenly a phone call came over the speaker. I tried using it once when I was busy in the kitchen and couldn’t pick up my phone to talk, but the other person had a hard time understanding me and their voice seemed distorted.Audio Cable: I also never used the audio cable, although in theory it would be nice if I ever wanted to have better speakers for my computer or something.Charging Light: I wish there was a battery light indicator that lit up when you turned it on, perhaps red/yellow/green to tell you roughly how much was left. When it was low on battery it was hard to tell and it would sometimes die in the middle of my shower or party and I’d have to go plug it in.Bad:Rubber Ends: The rubber ends on it which protect the delicate electronics from the water and grit pop off fairly easily, which made me concerned that I was getting water in it. The flap which covers the charging and audio port also pops out easily and there’s no good way to secure it.Charging failure: After only a year of use with no issues, one day it suddenly stopped taking a charge. It still works, but must be continuously plugged in to function. I was fairly gentle on it, especially for something described as “splashproof, rainproof, dustproof, [and] sandproof,” and I feel like it should definitely have been able to last longer than a year and 2 months before giving out. It still functions as a nice speaker, but is no longer portable or useful in the shower or on trips, which is most of why I bought it. If it had lasted for three or even two years, this review would have been 5 stars, but only a year of semi consistent use is just sad.That said though, this is still a decent speaker with a good price point, but until I know the manufacturer has fixed the charging issue, I can’t give this speaker too high of a recommendation."
"I’ve only used it a few times even though I’ve had it for over a year or so… it stopped working. Still turns on, but no sound. Product support window has closed so I can’t contact them"
I like the color and the design of it and it arrived in a timely manner my only gripe with it is that it is way smaller than it appeared in the images online
"Speaker was ""ok"" (what can you really expect from a single speaker that has to be ""waterproof""?).  But it did not last very long relative to the amount of use and its limited exposure to water.  Mine hung in the shower above the shower head, so it wasn't getting wet as much as some splash and maybe steam condensation.  After the last time I had to recharge it, it was simply garbage - really heavy distortion at all volume levels whether controlled by the speaker or by the source.  ""Banging"" on it did not have any effect, so it seems like a fundamental break due to poor quality and limited life expectancy.  Even for this price, it should have lasted much much longer.  Disappointed; I will not replace with the same brand or rebranded version of the same speaker."
"Review for OontZ Angle 3 bluetooth speaker.I’ve been happy with an Aptoyu JJYX-01 bluetooth speaker for about 5 years but it’s time to get a new portable speaker.  If I could, I’d buy a new version of the Aptoyu but I can’t find one.  As a second consideration, I'd like to be able to pair speakers.  I got the OontZ Angle 3 based on reviews of its good sound.  Unfortunately it doesn’t have the balanced sound profile I’m looking for.  It is clear and loud enough but lacks the bass I want for music.  I used my bluetooth device’s EQ  to add bass and midrange but the speaker just isn’t designed to provide those frequencies.  The result is a clear but noticeably higher sound frequency profile than I want.  The OontZ Angle 3 otherwise functioned normally.  (I was unable to use the TWS pairing feature because my Aptoyu doesn’t have that capability.)  The OontZ may be a good speaker for other uses but for listening to music that has a lot of bass, it’s just not good enough for me."
Did a side-by-side comparison to the Bose mini and there was absolutely no comparison. The Bose mini is by far superior in all Sound ranges.You get what you pay for.
"I have an older version of this speaker which is great, I paid a lot more for it. This seems like a newer model but it loses ""sound"" and the music get much much lower unless it is 100% charged. Even if you have the charger plugged in, the output loses quality very quickly.Also the input port is very difficult to get in, so will probably get ruined quickly. I would have returned it but didn't keep the box. Also it doesn't ""dual"" pair at least not with my equipment. So I use the old one that plays much louder than this one. Too bad, it's cute."
My First Oontz was one of the Original 19.99 speakers. It was phenomenal. Super loud! This clip Oontz is great design however I have formed an opinion now over a 30 days plus period that the fabric they use to lace the screen completely numbs off a lot of volume capacity. This speaker is only about half as loud and at twice the price than their louder 20 model. For that reason. I have too say im considering selling it to purchase a different style. Good idea but needs some adjustments.
"I find these frustrating. I specifically bought two so that we could listen to a weekly Zoom meeting together more easily. First week, they wouldn't link once I was logged into Zoom, waiting for the meeting to start.Second week, I linked them in advance. But then the Zoom meeting started late. They disconnected, and I couldn't get them to connect again, so we crowded in together to listen to the single speaker.And then we were listening to just one speaker. We paused for a few minutes, and the blasted thing disconnected AGAIN, so I had to reconnect before we could finish.The sound is decent. They're not as loud as I'd like, but they're tolerable. However, I would not recommend them because of the connectivity issues.UPDATE, 6 months later:I'm updating my review to 4 stars, though 3.5 probably best fits.The issue with connectivity seems to be solely an issue with Zoom. We've had no issues otherwise.However, I do find the method to connect the devices confusing, even now. Thankfully, they *mostly* connect automatically.In addition, the speakers automatically turn off when not used for a period of time, even when still connected. I would rather have a slightly reduced battery life and find my speakers on when I return. I'm a big girl. I know how to turn them off. And if I forget and the battery dies? Well, at least it wasn't a goldfish, and I'll learn a valuable lesson worthy of a sitcom, I'm sure.ANOTHER UPDATE: I'm dropping this down to 2 stars. When the speaker battery gets below 50%, the volume is reduced so it won't get as loud -- even when it's on the charger.HEY, OONTZ. Know what's better than extended battery life? The actual ability to use the damn things!Ah, but I get it now. This is a literal fraud to skew the numbers they give us for battery life. Now I'm mad."
While the size is really nice it lacks volume. It's OK if it's close to  you.  Any real distance away and it would be useless.
Well it should have some kind of a tie off but I'used Velcro. I put it on the hood of my tractor when I cut grass
"When you pause and play again, then it's start hiccuping, so you have to turn off and turn on again, which is really annoying."
"I bought two of these. They're connected to my laptop. They probably get 40 hours/week of use.***THE GOOD***The sound quality is surprisingly good.No stupid annoying messages like, ""Powering on! Welcome to Altec Lansing!""***THE BAD***After 1 year: One of the speakers developed a 5 hour max battery life, the other about 2 hours. Both speakers have a max connection distance of about 12ft.After 2 years both speakers have a 2 hour max battery life. One of them rarely stay connected, the other one is pretty spotty.So, decent speakers out-of-the-box, but they don't last.To put it in perspective, I've also had a JBL Charge 3 for 6+ Years and it's going strong (though the aux port broke within a year). You get what you pay for."
"I do like that the sound is crisp, one downfall, it does not get very loud, a bit louder then your phone..."
Easy to pair and connect. Volume all the way up is still on the low side. Does work as described.
"The Oontz Angle 3 is the best selling bluetooth speaker on Amazon and after trying others in the same price range, one can can see why. The sound is loud, clear and well balanced requiring no eq. On some songs the treble can be a bit forward sounding but for the most part it is stable. The bass is passable but nothing special. The sound quality of the Angle 3 is better than most of the competitors I have tried in this price range.Out-of-the-box the Angle 3 came with 30% charge enabling me to test it immediately. Battery life is reasonable, shows up in iOS and is in check with the specifications printed on manufacturer’s website.The Angle sports a triangular design with two drivers on the front configured in stereo and a passive radiator located at the bottom allowing the Angle 3 to resonate bass frequencies off the surface its placed on.The Angle 3 has two rubber pads on the bottom near both ends. I listen mostly to rock however if you play a track with excessive bass like “Billie Eilish - you should see me with a crown” at max volume the Angle 3 will move about on the table. This could have been prevented if SoundWorks installed weight strips in the Angle 3. This isn’t an issue for most music played through these but it’s still something to consider.Pairing the Angle 3 to my iPhone was simple and the connection is solid, even at great distances. The Angle 3 features a play/pause, volume controls. The volume controls are independent of iOS so you will have to set both at applicable levels.Films are a joy to watch on-the-go with the Angle 3 as audio plays back in sync with video. There is barely any noticeable latency when paired with my iPhone. Very important.Color: I love white electronics and would have appreciated SoundWorks providing the option of purchasing the Angle 3 in solid white as opposed to the black/white combination. As the option wasn’t available, I purchased the solid black version.The Angle 3 is a great little bluetooth speaker. It deliverers clear and balanced audio at an in-expensive price point. It could benefit from more bass, however considering the construction, competition and price point this is not a bad buy."
"You can't disable power saving mode, which means volume turns down automatically when 15% charge remains and the volume remains turned down even if you plug the speaker into a USB charger or laptop.  And there's no way to know you are nearing 15% charge on the way down!  Not sure if it needs to charge all the way back to 100% for the power saving mode to turn back off, but I plugged it into the charger 30 minutes ago and it still won't graduate out of power saving mode.  The instructions seem to indicate that if you plug it into an Amazon Echo then it will go out of power saving mode, but I don't own an Echo and am not using this speaker for that.  So if you to use the speaker on a daily basis you will need to plug it into the charger after every use, which eliminates much of the advantages of bluetooth.  This product will not enable you to free your space of wires, because you have to plug it in after every use.The port for jacks is badly designed, with insufficient clearance around the jack, so that some 3.5 cables are not able to seat fully in the jack.  If the plastic housing of your 3.5 mm plug is narrow (like with wired Apple ear buds) they will fit in the jack. But if the plastic housing of our 3.55 mm plug is a little more stout, it won't be able to seat fully in this jack.Good sound quality and volume  for this price point, though the low frequencies are absent.Bluetooth range is good. It reaches all my rooms one story down from the player, and even a small area two stories down."
1st Battery only lasts a few hours on max volume. About 4 hours2nd At work this is not loud enough to hear over the machines running if your more then a few feet away. (10ft ish)3rd The volume keeps dropping as the battery goes downAt %40 battery volume was about half as loud3.5 hours and was down to 25% battery life.I got this to use at work and work 12hr shifts in a loud factory.Definitely easy to use tho.No issues connecting to Bluetooth.
"I purchased this speaker to listen to iTunes while working on my new ThinkPad P50 laptop, whose internal speakers are useless.The first thing that struck me about the OontZ was how small it is -- under 5"" wide. This means the tiny speakers within don't have a lot of room to move, which places limitations on volume and quality of sound. There's nothing ""next generation"" about this thing. On a scale of 10 for sound quality from a compact system I'd give it a 5.I tried without success to pair it by Bluetooth with the PC, but I confess I didn't spend a lot of time on the process because the speaker comes with a fool-proof cable that connects the headphone jack with the unit.Ironically, the manufacturer goes on about the extra volume obtainable with this model, but the reality is that cranking up the volume leads to sound degradation and bass distortion. This speaker is best played at mid-volume, which is adequate for use behind your PC's monitor. It would not provide enough volume for outdoor use: for example, as a monitor for your iPhone's music at a picnic. It's just too' small.The manufacturer boasts of the speaker's portability being ideal for hikers. If in the silence of a pristine forest I encountered a hiker playing Justin Beiber on an external speaker while he trudged along, I'd hang him by his ankles from the nearest tree using his packsack staps, upload a Lawrence Welk album to his smartphone, and play it on autorepeat through this speaker, just out of arm's reach.I don't need a waterproof speaker, nor do I require a microphone -- my iPhone has a Speakerphone option. I use the speaker's USB power cord so have no need for its battery. Instead of loading this product with all these gizmos, the manufacturer would have been better off investing their money in something a little bigger, with a little more power, and a ""fatter"" sound. What this speaker does acceptably well (barely) is replace your PC's internal speakers. In my opinion it has no business being outdoors. Get a good set of Bluetooth earbuds instead and reduce the noise pollution at your favorite beach."
"I thought this was pretty darn good for the money when I bought it and used it for the past 3 years. However, about a year ago the volume level decreased a LOT and eventually the battery gave up the ghost. The biggest thing that bothered me was that for the last year it has been a very quiet speaker. When the battery life gave up I gave up too.  For the first 24 months it was pretty good though, hence the 3 stars rating."
"Due to good reviews, I purchase two, as the demo stated that you could pair them together.  No instructions on how to pair them.  The TV only sees one device, not both.  One device doesn't connect to my TV at all.  The other one connects, but it goes in and out constantly, so you're only catching every other word."
"The blue tooth connectivity was hit and miss on my PC.  There were also sync issues with the video. Beyond that, the sound was adequate but nothing to write home about. Luckily, I remembered I had a pair of Edifier R1280DB's I purchased years ago. Wow, after hooking them up, I realized how weak the sound out of these were."
"This is an excellent speaker for sound clarity.  I bought it along with a Bluetooth Taotronics TT-BA01 transmitter (dongle).  Once the two were paired, which was easy, I was able to simply plug the transmitter into the 3.5mm ports of any of my TV's or Kindle Fire tablet.  In each of these uses the volume and sound quality are excellent.  There is some decent base, but of course these are small speakers so it is limited.  My primary goal was to better hear and understand voices during news broadcasts, movies, etc.,  This speaker and transmitter gets this job done nicely.  A significant benefit, of this and any other Bluetooth speaker, is that it can be positioned more closely to you than the placement of a TV or other device; this permits a lower volume setting for even less distortion.I give this speaker 3 stars, not 5, because I do have a few gripes:-  My Taotronics transmitter says to ensure that speakers to be paired with it must have an A2DP Bluetooth Profile.  Nowhere on the Angle 3, or on its box, or in its Quick Start Guide (the only paperwork that came with it) is the speaker's Bluetooth Profile specified.  After looking high and low for the Angle 3's Bluetooth Profile I decided to just call Cambridge Soundworks and ask them.  Guess what, no phone number provided, neither direct dial or toll-free - nada.  In frustration I decided to just charge up the speaker and try to pair it to the transmitter.  It worked.  So I assume the Angle 3's Profile is correct; I still don't know.- Most of the speaker's specifications go unstated, such things as frequency range, volume capability, Bluetooth Profile(s), temperature limits, compliances, etc.- There is no statement of any warranty, although another Amazon reviewer stated a minuscule 90 days.  So, if mine fails, I hope it does it sooner rather than later.You have to wonder about a company [Cambridge Soundworks] that does not provide major product specifications, has an unstated, minuscule warranty, and no customer support phone number."
"Based on the thousands of good reviews I feel like my review should be taken with a grain of salt. Even though I got this on sale for about $20.00 I ended up returning it as I thought the sound was not great even for a $20.00 speaker. Sound is really subjective so look at other reviews re. that but I will say that the build quality is great, it charges and connects quickly with no drama and I'm sure customer service is good with OontZ."
"This speaker was purchased over others because there was an Amazon recommendation next to it.  It just does not really sound good.  I have tried it in multiple settings, such as in the car, on office desk, hooked up to Amazon Dot in the kitchen.  It is OK for music and terrible for spoken word.  For music it boosts the sound volume of my other devices and adds base.  The trouble is the mid range of the speaker.  If you listen to any talk radio or books, do not buy this speaker.  It makes the voice of the speaker sound like he is singing/speaking on the chipmunks album.  I have never heard anything like it.  I tried downloading some equalizer apps, but that did not work either.  It is actually very bad to listen to this speaker and now I guess I will have to gift it to someone or just let it sit collecting dust, because I cannot stand to listen to it.  I am now also jaded to Amazon's choice or Amazon's pick or whatever they call it.  It is obviously just a brazen sales ploy instead of an actual recommendation like consumer reports or other rating sites.  I suspect from my experience with this speaker that they just recommended it to get rid of the stock.  I waffled between two stars 'I don't like it' and one star 'I hate it'.  I hate it.  One star. I have to make an addendum to this review. Since I was not able to figure out how to return this item, I have used it subsequently in a very limited fashion. The chipmunk sound that I described has not recurred, so I suspect and Internet or provider error. The sound quality is not great, but this is a very small speaker.  I am not thrilled with the sound but I’m also not extremely unhappy with the device as I was previously. Rating has been changed from one star to three stars"
"It is waterproof, so that's a plus.  And, the sound quality when it's not wet is much better than the Echo Flex I have it paired with in my tiny apartment bathroom.Two somewhat fatal problems though.The first problem is that it doesn't hold a charge.  I find that if I charge it fully until the light no longer blinks I can get through a shower but not the next one.And the second problem is that the sound has static.  Sometimes it's worse than others.Taken together, yes, this device was cheaper than a JBL, but the flaws ruin the experience.  I am sorry that I purchased this, and that I was too lazy to return it within the return window.  But as Black Friday approaches, I hope that this can save others from making the same mistake.  You'll need to pay more to get something from a respected brand, but my advice is not to be penny wise and pound foolish as I was with this purchase.  I'm now probably going to shell out for a better unit because this one wasn't equal to the task.Also, with any of these waterproof speakers, keep in mind one thing:  Unlike your normal smart speaker, you're going to be constantly removing this from the shower to plug it in for a recharge.  Don't underestimate what a pain that is going to be, and how frequently you'll want a shower and realize you are going to be doing it music-free because the battery is dead."
"I had these on my desk for about a day. In the configuration I was looking for, they did not work out. I wanted to plug them into the headphone output of my computer monitor via a stereo cable and then connect a second speaker to the first one for stereo sound. They do give a solid warning that any configuration using the dual speaker setup would not be a good experience with video, so I won't fault them on that. And once I got all the different device volume controls at good settings, they did sound okay for the price. Also, they are much clearer when connected bluetooth only. That I can confirm. So if you plan to use these for sound only and connect only via bluetooth, they are probably okay. In the configuration I was using, they had a huge delay in sound starting up and they constantly made clicking sounds. I have three devices coming into the same monitor through DP and HDMI, so I really needed a wired solution most of the time. I just through it would be cool to be able to have more uses for the speakers. This probably isn't the scenario they planned on. In the end, I settled on a wired only 2.1 speaker set. Even though I was not using a typical setup, I stand by my 3 star rating in that they do support the scenario I wanted, just not very well."
"Ok nice little speaker. Big time audiophile. I read in depth prior to purchasing.  Great bass, great mids, etc. Ok you get absolutely great clarity at high volume.  But absolutely very minimal mids, and absolutely no bass. Regardless of the volume or what it is connected to.  Love the dual feature but the mids and bass are not there. AT ALL!!!! Glad i at least got them on sale. And maybe why i did. I have an off brand 30 dollar speaker that has more depth of sound."
"I bought both the Oontz and the Ankor, and in using them, the Ankor is much, much better.  WHY?  Because, on the Oontz--though they have a little sticker where the power button is--you're constantly turning the thing round and round to find the on button.  With the Ankor, the power button sits on the top left, and you can just reach over and feel it and turn it on.  Also, the Oontz DOES NOT REMEMBER DEVICES, so every time I use it with my iPhone, then use it with my iPad, I have to go through settings again and set up the bluetooth.  That might not sound like much, but in actual usage, here I am, flipping the thing round and round to turn it on, then I'm waiting for it to sync, then it's not syncing, then I have to push the sync button, then it makes me go through settings again, then wait again for it to sync, and YIKES!  Three full minutes of minutiae!  And the Ankor remembers all my devices.  PLUS, in the car, I can use the Ankor and just feel for the on button without taking my eyes off the road.  UPSHOT: Ankor makes a better device in the actual day-to-day usage...good things: it's compact (so is Ankor), the sound is nice (Ankor, ditto), but it's just a bit too cumbersome to be great.  Hope that helps!  Here is the Ankor I bought for 27.99 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016XTADG2?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details"
"At first it was a great little speaker, but it barely lasted 2 1/2 years. Everytime I used it I could hear it less and less until poof! all the sound was gone. Still searching for a better speaker and for that price I shouldn't have to."
"This was the perfect size bluetooth speaker for my car which doesn't have bluetooth built in. However, last week, after a little over 10 months of using it a couple of times a week, it suddenly... and I mean suddenly... went super staticky. Unlistenably so. Now, only a few days later, I gave it another chance and no sound at all.I've owned several other versions of Oontz speakers. This is the first one to fail on me."
"I like that this speaker had good sound, battery life, and only one small light instead of the circus show you normally see with portable speakers. But from the get-go the charger port was a very loose fit to the point where there were times it didn't connect enough to charge or would just fall off. It only got worse as time went along until finally it didn't stay at all and I had to dispose of the speaker.I really wish manufacturers would go back to the round charging ports with thin rod the that had a firm click when the cord was attached (like what you see with speaker cords), instead of the micro-USB's, which always seem to rapidly wear out. I truly hope Cambridge Soundworks corrects the issue with port connectivity, I would be happy to purchase another one of these speakers."
"update: I added 1 stars because the very muddy distant sound quality it had was when paired with phone. but connected to PC the sound quality is perfect (except no bass which you should expect from the size of the device.) So that is worth noting is what you're using as a source seems majorly responsible for the audio processing.update 2: I removed 1 star because this device has problem connecting to multiple pc's in a house. you have to first disconnect it in the settings of the LAST PC to use it, from the last PC every time. That's an inconvenience for sure because you need to plan to take that step whenever you want to use a different PC and the speaker.I work at home and was kind of sick of my desk speakers being too close at times, since it could be distracting. I also wanted something portable to wash the dishes with or do whatever, without worrying about putting my phone in weird situations.This works well if you have some use reason like that.I will say that the audio to me sounds quite muddy. However, like I said I wanted this not for a peak music experience but to be serviceable. Seems to be that.It is annoying that it has to be charged but I suppose I could buy a long cord wall charger for it eventually, as some areas I use it would make more sense just to plug.Overall, it's not expensive, particularly on sale and you might have a use for it. Just don't presume the main use is when you want the music to sound absolutely amazing. Get something dedicated for that."
"I personally love this speaker for Music Only. When connecting to Bluetooth, there's a half-second delay between the speaker and my phone, so things will happen on the screen then I'll hear them a half second later.There's a variety of things that could be causing it; the connection in my room isn't great, but since that's where I'm using it most often, it greatly affects my enjoyment of its use, especially when playing games or watching videos. My phone is not that great, I bought it refurbished, and I'm already seeing issues with it due to overuse. It could be that the two devices aren't very compatible, I didn't see my phone listed (Moto G Power 2021) on the ""Compatibility list"" on the product's page.When I do use a cable, that issue mostly goes away, but the delay is still present. There's also a super uncomfortable static-y noise that could have something to do with the cable itself.If you do have great WiFi though, please give this speaker a shot. It lasted nearly 1 and a half 8 hour shifts of off and on playing. The sound quality is excellent, and the base is enough to shake the whole thing when it's on hard surfaces. It's incredibly affordable for the quality as well. I highly recommend it especially if you just need a good speaker for music."
I feel like it dies way before it’s supposed to but other than that the audio quality is pretty good.
"I Read several good reviews , Yet I was disappointed with the volume. I was looking for a speaker that was very loud. It’s not a bad speaker, but if you’re looking for A speaker that provides great volume and base do not expect that from the speaker.."
"I primarily bought this to get news updates and listen to music via Alexa while I shower.  Unfortunately, the Alexa implementation is not conducive to a routine like this. Basically, you have to turn the speaker on, pair with your phone, launch an app on your phone, find and connect to the speaker from the app then push a button from the speaker if you want Alexa. It’s a hassle and a half to say the least and there’s no way I’m doing that every morning. So, the speaker is not very useful as a result.Why 2 stars then?  Well I quite like the actual speaker, design, waterproofing and audio quality. As a standalone Bluetooth speaker it’s pretty good."
"**Original Review (Update Below): TWO STARS**Original Title: ""Cheap and static-like sound""This speaker is inexpensive, is easy to use, and has a solid build.However, it is not that great for music.I had hoped that all of the great reviews would mean I could expect sound quality to match the better-end of this size of speakers (thinking the Jambox Mini) or even the generic small bluetooth speakers, but I was severely dissappointed.The unit played highs alright, mids so-so, and base was terrible and washed out.I hope this was due to a bad unit, but I am not sure.This is a certain return, and I will not skimp to save a few bucks for a speaker again.**2016-12-11 Update: THREE STARS**New Title: ""Great customer service does not make this a great small/mid-size speaker""OontZ Customer Support reached out and asked if they could send a replacement unit for me to try.So I really wanted to think this speaker was decent, and gave it a second chance.I tried playing music with and without the charging cable in and active to see if there was any affect on grounding or available power.Voice:I started with the Little Leagues, voice from a podcast.The speaking was clear and level, and low voices didn't sound too tinny despite lacking bass.I did a call with a female friend, and her voice was muddied and not clear at all (and that's compared to just a phone's speaker!).Music:Then I tried music of a few different genres: Pop, Electronic and Hip-hop.After a few songs in each genre, I can say that my experience is only slightly improved.The static-like sound I was hearing before is much less noticeable, but the bass remains a hollow.If you want a very-inexpensive speaker for dancing in the studio, working out, or something that does not desire amazing fidelity, then this could be your guy. If you are looking to really enjoy your music, spend money and get something that is better."
I’ve tapped the plus sign multiple times. It did increase the volume but not even close my half size same brand. I’ll give it another shot. If the volume doesn’t improve I’ll be returning it I have a little white ore being returned because it won’t charge.Oye ve 🤷🏻‍♂️
This speaker was fine for what it was until it broke just 3 months in. The issues started when after just a couple weeks it stopped holding a charge for more than an hour so it had to be constantly plugged in then the speakers would start to crackle with certain music and then one day it stopped playing audio all together. I’ve tried every “fix” I could find online and nothing will work to get it to play audio again even though it turns on and connects fine so I’m not sure what the issue is but unless you want to be buying a new speaker every quarter I would recommend another option than this.
"Third purchase of this speaker , first two, exactly two years apart, the speaker worked great, sound is good.Third purchase, another two years later, this one cuts off constantly.  Never had this problem with the previous two, and also tested another brand with no interruption.  So sound is great when it works, lifespan seems short at two years, and dropping rating because of constant interruption."
"Yup, should've learned from the first one I bought when it suddenly started to its sound. At first, I thought maybe it needed charging as when the charging is low. The volume gets low and after charging it and connecting it to my phone, it was obvious that it wasn't. This one is done as well. No apparent reason volume became fuzzy and low. Not worth it."
"I have been satisfied with the larger, Oontz Angle 3 Ultra - good sound, passable bass, easy connectivity with must devices, and reasonable battery life. I have three of them, as I like the two unit stereo capability in my kitchen.I purchased this smaller, lighter Oontz Angle 3 for my father to use with his television. Nope, but the same features capabilities or benefits:- Sound. Thin, tinny, no bad whatsoever, voices sound nasal. Worse, the volume is only about half of the Ultra, and you just can't hear this little thing across a 12 foot room.Battery life. I expected, as this was a smaller, lower power device, that it would have longer battery life. It has less, perhaps only 2/3rds of the Ultra, surprising and not in a good way.- No dual unit Stereo feature. The Ultra's super cool feature is not available here. I didn't think I would miss it. I did.I guess this base Angle 3 might be acceptable if you have never owned another Bluetooth speaker unit, but it's falls short to most others in sound, battery life, and features. Simple fix: get the Ultra, you will love it."
"This is a great speaker, good sound. Control buttons not easy to find and manipulate while driving. After using in my vehicles for a couple years, the speaker cover came apart. Now it doesn’t stay on."
"I bought the Oontz Angle 3 shower speaker for work. It worked great for the last year and a half and when I transferred to a different department, I left it there. I decided to buy another one since it worked so well. I purchased it and every time I checked on shipping, it hadn’t even shipped yet, even though it was in stock! I canceled my order because I couldn’t find any link to contact the company. I’ll be shopping elsewhere because I don’t want to pick a different item hoping for a different result."
"The speaker makes a constant static sound and if its a silent part of a show or movie, when someone starts talking or a sound is made it makes a slight pop or crackling noise. You probably wont notice if you are using it for music because there is constant sound. I bought this to use for the tv at bed time so i dont have to have the tv loud but it is driving me nuts hearing a popping or crackling sound every time there is a break in sound. Returning it unfortunately."
"I had an old oontz angle 3 that I was satisfied with but after years the battery went dead. So I bought another but was dissatisfied with the bass and the new button arrangement. I could deal with the buttons but the sound quality was gone. I ordered another brand. It's not a brick and it is very good compared to this angle 3. I'm just going to give this angle 3 away but it's not a brick is a keeper. Cheaper, bigger more bass and better sound. Get the ""it's not a brick"" and you'll be satisfied."
"Before purchasing I watched the video of the guy who sound tested four different Oontz speakers. Based on the results I thought the Angle 3 would be much more impressive than the SVES Bluetooth speaker I've had since around 2017. I'm not sure what all the hype is about with the Oontz though. I was expecting to be blown away the minute I turned this on but it wasn't even charged upon arrival and took over six hours to do so.In my own unscientific sound test, and without getting into the technicalities, I didn't think the Oontz blew SVES out of the water. To my untrained ears there wasn't much of an appreciable difference between the two and I'm not inclined to ditch my antique EVES for this fancy new OOntz. Overall I think Oontz is a good Bluetooth speaker, at a reasonable price with some cool functions. I'm just not 100% convinced it's worth all the hype."
"Great sound and you can pair it with an Amazon Echo device. BUT you cannot sync it with the Echo, when you turn on the Oontz, it takes over and you cannot listen to the Echo. Not good if you want to listen simultaneously (ie: indoor and outdoor)"
"It did well at first, but now it no longer charges. We didn't use it too often, but it clearly has some planned obsolescence built in. I guess for the price, it worked decently, but I feel like products shouldn't become landfill waste so soon. It's not like other tech that requires updates, it simply is what it is: a simple speaker with clear sound and decent volume. I'm planning to research an option that will last longer, I am not happy enough with the product to repurchase now that it is broken."
"When I recieved my Angle 3 Enhanced, initially I was as happy as one could be with my purchase. I LOVED this little thing, it sounded WAY better than I expected - not alot of bass thump, obviously, but - clear, musical, & loud - real loud. Suprising volume for it's size. This was perfect for my work - I am a route delivery driver, and with the speakerphone feature as well as a bluetooth in my ear, I was covered in & out of my vehicle. It would go to my earpiece out of my truck - and automatically switch back to the Angle III speakerphone when I was driving. And sounded great. Perfect.But out of the box the first day, I noticed right off the bat that was a real drag, and a problem I've noticed with many similar products - the lack of attention spent to the USB Charging input. It's one of those, ""some units the cable fits properly - some units it doesn't"" type deal. No matter how you inserted the cable, it's fit with the unit far below sub-par. It just didn't go in and fit securely, in fact, not at all. You kinda had to prop it up gently when it was in, not bump it, and watch it closely to make sure it stayed in there - because half the time it wouldnt. A couple of times the connection was so that instead of charging it - it drained it instead. Not to mention that the design of the rubber casing in relation to  the width of the connector that was needed for that connector the go in and fit snuggly was not considered when designed. That, to me, is a mental error.  It clearly didn't fit, nor did the connector on the unit hold up. Beyond dissapointing, to say the least. But, I loved the sound. It was perfect. I would just make do, and be very careful with that part of it. And just make sure it was fully charged when I left the house each day.Well, of course, I get just outside the warranty period - and the connector on the unit just desinigrated. The pins on the inside male part of the connector just collapsed or broke off, and the connector itself just pushed in & fell back into the unit. So now, the last full charge I had, is the last full charge I'll ever have. Once that charge cycle is used up, my bitchin' bluetooth speaker will be a paperweight. Or a doorstop. Gee, great. That's not what had in mind when I purchased it. The end of a great little speaker. Which could have been avoided.So - this is my stupid question to anyone in the know - can an Oontz III possibly in any way be charged by any type of wireless charging unit or plate? I know, it's a dumb question, but? I'd like to see it live on, but the charge is getting low, and the unit will be 100% useless to me. What a shame. Considering it's basically new.Any help from someone out there would be greatly appreciated...."
"Ordered this to use at our office. Connected easy to my phone, didn’t have the greatest sound. Coworker said it sounded like it was playing through a tin can.  Bass sounded flat. It was the perfect size and the battery life was good, just didn’t have the greatest sound."
"Both of these speakers are similar in price, the Anker being about $5 more.  After comparing the two, the Anker wins out by a mile.  Did not find the Oontz had the sound quality or volume that the Anker does.  I really liked the small compactness of the Oontz, ease of connecting the bluetooth, but the same is the ase for the Anker.  After listening to both speakers, the Anker wins out, and the Oontz is going to be returned."
"I bought the black Oontz Angle3 years ago and the sound quality was amazing for its size/price. So this time, I decided to buy the Coke design. I’m not sure if this is specific to the Coke speaker, or if this applies to all, but the sound quality was aweful! Not only was the design Coke, but music SOUNDED like it was also playing out of a Coke can. I compared it to my older Oontz Angle3 speaker. Had to return it. Again, not sure if the sound issues were specific to the Coke design speakers, or if the quality of product went down over the years."
"I wish this OontZ Angle 3 Bluetooth Speaker had just a little more bass. The sound clarity is good though, just not enough bass to make me keep it. I'm not an audiophile or anything just could tell the difference between this speaker and others I've had."
"I have purchased two of these speakers.  I bought a second because I loved the first so much!  I thought that the charging problems with the first was a fluke.  Well, unfortunately, I had the same problem with the second speaker I bought.  On both units, in less than a year, the charging port becomes loose or disconnected within it the body of the unit, and ceases to charge.  At first, it's just sketchy about charging.  I wiggled it around, and it made contact and started charging.  Then it got worse and worse until there was just zero connection between the cord and the charging port.  I even tried a replacement cord.  The problem is with the charging port inside the speaker unit.  It was consistent with both devices that I purchased.  I love, love, love this speaker.  I use it while out working in the garden, and it has a great range, great volume, great sound.  I use it in the shower, and it's flawless.  But I'm just not willing to buy a new one every single year.  Sorry, Oontz.  Until you fix this issue, which is well known if you read the reviews, I will be looking elsewhere for my new speaker."
"15 min auto off timer does not work with any ""Alexa like"" device. This apparently includes my generic TV Bluetooth transmitter. So return."
"So the distance is way off, possibly 30 feet from phone. The sound isn’t that great either"
"I wanted a BT speaker to supplement the really, really lousy, tinny speakers on my new corporate Dell laptop. I was not looking for room-filling volume or wall-shaking bass, I just wanted something small, portable, and good enough to use occasionally. This has decent sound, nothing spectacular, good volume, and virtually no bass whatsoever. For the money, and for what I wanted, it's reasonable. The BT connectivity isn't that great though, there is a noticeable delay when watching videos. The speaker is out of sync with the video's dialogue, so you get an annoying ""the lips don't match the sound"" experience. It's not bad enough to return, but I would not buy another one. I also purchased an Anker Soundcore for around the same price (a few dollars less actually). That speaker is similar in performance (sound quality, volume, etc), but does not have the same ""bluetooth delay"", so it is a better alternative, IMO anyhow.  Some of the 5-star reviews are a bit ""overstated"", and perhaps the reviewers were somehow ""motivated"" to leave them  :-) ... again, just IMO ."
Lasted about a year then quit working.
"Good sound but slow pairing. Other than disassembling it and cutting the light wires, I don’t see a solution to the automatic tweeker disco show that needs to be clicked multiple times every time I want to hear music without seeing it. Should be a switch disabling them unless one wants to see them"
Sound is good.Lights are CRAZY ... no needShould swith to turn off lights and save battery.No power indicator ...!!!Don't know when battery charging or empty.❌❌❌ --- very bad ----
"Sound quality was good but it didn’t stay charged but a few hours and then it just started shutting off, maybe I just got a bad one but that was my experience so I returned it with no issues"
"I charged it for more than 24 hours and  it lasted about an hour. Kept saying low battery.  Will be sending it back . Very disappointed , the sound was excellent, but battery life sucked!"
"Bought 2. Sound quality is fine. They connect easily to my android phone and charge properly. My issue is, first day of usage and I've noticed the light on one of the units doesn't cycle and light up properly. It appears to be missing certain colors and glitches in and out.. strobes awkward compared to the other 3 lights. I will be sending back this product because the light feature was a selling point for my 2 daughters. Sadly, these haven't worked properly and will not be purchased again."
Just bought this bad boy and I don’t mind it at all! Worth the 80$ and a good price good controls and range! Edit: I dropped it on cement and now it sounds terrible has a big dent. Yes it’s my fault but it should not just break within one fall from a 5 foot height.
"Used reviews for this product purchase. It's not loud, it doesn't last 24hrs per charge, it's not Bassey. Its an okay speaker forthe price,but bulky and heavy."
It is absolutely not as loud as I expected. It seemed like it was loud when I first got it and now the volume is no longer what I wanted to be. However it is perfect just for like cleaning
"Good speaker for the most part. Clear sound but not as much bass as I expected. All in all I'd say it's ok, if I had paid full price around $70 I'd be disappointed I didn't spend a few more dollars on a name brand like JBL."
"noticeable sound delay when using AUX with other speakers.sound quality is very mediocre.However, it looks great, beautiful lights, quite loud. It is quite suitable for use somewhere in nature, for a user who is undemanding to the sound quality."
"The speaker won’t turn off. Lights stay on until it dies. And today I received phone call when it was connected on Bluetooth and after the call was ignored the speaker continued to ring for over 5 minutes until I reconnected my phone and played a song on it. But it would not turn off, disconnect, or stop playing. Super weird. I am a teacher and I use this at school, so this is no good."
"I wish I could give 5 stars, but it really doesn't pack a punch and playing time is very short."
"The loudness isn't very loud at all .it wasn't what I read,or watched on video."
"Beautiful speaker, however, the bass is not enhanced. This is NOT comparable to JBL or Sony or Bose. I returned it immediately."
No bass not super load good for bedroom or bathroom
"The Bluetooth range is maybe 20ft at best. If the speaker has anything between you and it, the Bluetooth will cut out. Also, I had it outside on a table and within 20min. The lights started glitching out. The light button to control the lights quit quaking. I'm pretty sure it overheated.  The sound is decent but who wants to leave their phone next to the speaker the entire time it's playing.."
"I've only been able to connect this speaker once. Pain the rear to charge.  Cannot connect to my cell phone.Oh well, another POS for the trash."
The flashy LED's are a pain in the butt... you have to turn them off again every time you use the speaker.I wish it could remember that i turned them off and want them off and do not want them on.... but every time i use the speaker the stupid lights are on again.
Works sound could be better.  But prices is good.
I purchased this because most reviews mentioned how good the bass is . This speaker literally has no bass whatsoever. Save up and get something better
Loses Bluetooth easily and isn’t very oud
"Bought this speaker to have in my classroom. Only got to use it a few times. Charged all night, took it off the charger the next day, and still will not turn on. Will not even turn on while on the charger. Bought in May of 2023."
Well it works. It is loud. But I expected deep rich bass.  This does not deliver.
This did not have the sound quality I expected I did return it
"At first I thought it was because the speaker wasn’t fully charged, but no it’s just a terrible product. Speaker won’t play music unless i constantly press the forward button and that’s just about every song or every 30 seconds. I’m frustrated because I’ve been googling and even going through reviews on how to fix this problem but obviously I must’ve been sent a defective product."
It's ok but it's bass is terrible
Too large for my space !
I bought it and used it for 20 min and it never turned back on. I’ve tried charging it and it still won’t turn on. Waste of money I would return the speaker but my husband threw the box away that it came in.
"only used a few times since june, now it’s not working. Quit buying from amazon it’s a rip off. cheap crap. i want my money back !!!!!"
Day of delivery connected to Bluetooth and worked great!  Then the next morning connected again then only intermittent sound.  Tried to use usb and same result.  Also tried aux cable and same result. Returning item.
"The sound quality with highs and lows and bass do not compare to the Tribit BT speaker. I was looking for something else that could possibly produce more but this one did not. If you want great sound and bass, I would recommend: https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-XSound-Bluetooth-Speakers-Built/dp/B07594HZ6Y/ref=sxin_16_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa?content-id=amzn1.sym.77fb2c04-2466-444a-b28b-02979f4340a7%3Aamzn1.sym.77fb2c04-2466-444a-b28b-02979f4340a7&crid=232UBACSX07MS&cv_ct_cx=bluetooth%2Bspeakers%2Bwith%2Bsubwoofer&keywords=bluetooth%2Bspeakers%2Bwith%2Bsubwoofer&pd_rd_i=B07594HZ6Y&pd_rd_r=94952482-3ba4-47ff-9b55-5e07ac5c44cd&pd_rd_w=RoKko&pd_rd_wg=iQ9SF&pf_rd_p=77fb2c04-2466-444a-b28b-02979f4340a7&pf_rd_r=9H7YDXZP23J428AJQF66&qid=1681884072&sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&sprefix=bluetooth%2Bspeaker%2Caps%2C217&sr=1-1-1fa5bb29-8495-43da-8896-6cda87f207d0-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyNlpRWFY1VVgwM0ZPJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjMwMDc5N0xGTVlRTzdEWFIyJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxMjgzNzYyWThFMUpDN1FUWlJXJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3Bfc2VhcmNoX3RoZW1hdGljJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ&th=1"
Very disappointed in this product.  It says it’s water proof and it got a few drops of water on it and now it won’t work  Have only had it since July 12.
Blew speakers first use at 3/4 volume
It would be a great speaker if it held a charge for more than one hour
Had to return.  Not working
It wouldn't turn off then fried itself. Don't recommend
It’s ok…definitely not as loud as I thought it would be for the money…the lights are a nice added touch though…I must admit…
Too heavy and no case
"Won't charge, turn on or work at all anymore. Disappointed."
Not loud enough yeah has a little bass but not $60 worth Lol
I bought this speaker to listen to music and podcasts while I work as headphones tend to distract and irritate me while working.I am not a sound guy but my music just sounds worse on this than even my phone speaker or my old headphones. I dont know how to describe it other than all the music felt flat and many aspects of songs either couldnt be heard or were very quiet compared to what it should sound likeAs for podcasts It made the voices muffled and hard to understand for myself.
"I highly doubt you'll find a better sound in a similar package. What drew me in was the promise of improved stereo effect using Bose's effective Articulated Array. It does that wonderfully. It's incredible how effective it can be when the drivers are literally inches apart. While not perfect (the soundstage is large, but imprecise--a physical limitation of a narrow device), it creates a large sound atmosphere that is VERY well suited for live music. Listening to live albums through this is a genuine delight.Bass is great for the size. It won't give you full extension, but it's compact, so it's unreasonable to expect it to. Just judging by my ear, I think this is effective down to about 65Hz and smoothly rolls off below that. At low to moderate volumes, you can easily imagine you're listening to a large home stereo.Mids are.. unique, in a mostly-good way. There is a lot of processing going on in this frequency range that aids the stereo effect. In typical fashion, this means imprecision and a slightly-off tone, but the tradeoff is well worth it for this device class and form factor. Your ears will adjust quickly and it'll sound pleasant and realistic enough. You will likely find it subtly emphasizing details in songs that you've never paid attention to. It's kind of fun, honestly. Novel, but not offensive.Highs are a mixed bag. They're fairly smooth and detailed, but being a single tweeter in the center, all the detail is right there in the middle. In ordinary listening, you won't really notice.. especially if you're moving around or off axis. But it's something possibly worth mentioning.It all combines to a unique, pleasant experience. It's well-processed, but processed nonetheless. It's an impressive sounding speaker making the very best of its modest, portable size.But the price is just too high. I've long felt that Bose's Flex is the best combination of outstanding sound, overall quality, and price. I don't think this is enough of an upgrade over that to cost nearly 4x as much. And if you don't mind fussing with Bluetooth stereo pairing, two Flexes will give you an awesome, authentic stereo sound for about half the price of this. You'll only miss out on just a little bit of bass extension/emphasis, but everything else about the Flex sounds as good or better. It's a no-brainer to me.Battery life is outstanding at low to moderate volumes, btw. When camping, I had it playing lightly most of the night (~8hrs) and it only dropped around 20%. Crazy.A welcome addition is the 3-band tone control (bass, mids, treble). They're fairly well-spaced and nicely adjustable. That said, I barely touched it (bass 0, mids +1, treble +2). It sounds great right out of the box.Feature-wise, it's fairly basic, but I kind of like it that way. It's just a good, simple speaker. Happily, they included an aux input! If your TV has level-adjusted RCA analog output (Vizio does, many don't), you could practically use this as a nice little soundbar in a small to medium sized room, which was compelling to me as I was considering soundbars for my bedroom. I don't know if I'll bother doing that, but it is an option if it makes the price more palatable.But yes, the price is too high for my tastes. I think many people will find it worth it, but $299 would be a far more reasonable price (preferably even less, but this IS a luxury product).Ultimately, I don't know if I can recommend it. It's impressive, but not quite enough to justify the cost.Also possibly of note, my Bluetooth has disconnected periodically. I'm confident that it'll be improved with a firmware update eventually, but I still want to mention it. Sadly, that's just how things are--as things get more and more tech-heavy, everyone releases imperfect products once in a while, and Bose is no exception. Fortunately, most kinks can be worked out with simple updates. I won't hold this against it because it's so new.BASS 90/100MIDS 85/100HIGHS 80/100DETAIL 85/100SOUNDSTAGE 85/100BATTERY 100/100QUALITY 95/100---VALUE 65/100OVERALL 80/100RECOMMENDED? NOT AT MSRP."
"I purchased this as a portable - hopefully great - sounding speaker for my portable digital piano.Most of these sound devices don't come with an AUX input this one does and I thought that would be a great solution.Sadly, no, there's a noticeable latency between key press on the piano and the note coming out.I hooked it up to both the Bose and my own home monitor system with powered speakers and I could clearly hear the home speakers playing the first,  with the note from the Bose coming shortly after.This makes no sense. This is not over Bluetooth. It's a direct AUX connection so there's something in the circuitry that's causing a late delay.So I sent it back.If you're streaming music or connecting to music player and you're not doing anything interactive like a keyboard, this is a great speaker."
"I am loyal to Bose because of their consistency and high quality products. However this product in particular did not meet my expectations at all, especially given the price. I purchased this to be kept inside my pool room (which is enclosed), and whilst the speaker played loud, the bass and cleanliness of the sound left much to be desired. I am so disappointed as I had such high hopes for this product, and now i am embarrassed to bring this out when I have guests over. Bose usually has the standard where you get a big punch in a small package, so now it has me wondering whether I should have stuck to the smaller speakers instead. Given the price, i expected more out of this. I'm not saying the product isn't good, I'm just saying that it could be better."
"The Bose SoundLink Max is a stout little speaker that produces impressively big sound considering its compact size. It has a simple design, both aesthetically and in its features, and could appeal to most anyone looking for a portable bluetooth speaker if budget was not a factor.Rated IP67, the Max is water and dust proof with a powder coated silicone exterior that annoyingly attracts debris and fingerprints which are very visible on the black finish. Along with handles in different colors, shoulder straps can be purchased separately though it would have been nice to see a shoulder strap included at this price point.At low to moderate volumes the sound quality is quite good. Going louder, the bass begins to drop out and music loses its luster, which is expected to a certain extent but I didn't expect such a noticable sacrifice of depth for decibels. Connected to our satellite receiver, however, it played the role of a soundbar beautifully.After owning and using the SoundLink Max for two weeks, I can tell you there are plenty of bluetooth speakers with quality sound that are a better value. Many are significantly more affordable and/ or offer more features (one might expect a microphone and wifi capability in this price range but the Max has neither).Due to the exorbitant cost, friends and family said they'd be unable or unwilling to buy this speaker. I'm not sure who I'd recommend it to but my imagination tells me the Bose SoundLink Max might be purchased by 35+ crowd who have disposable income and/ or those who are Bose loyalists."
"When I first unpacked this product and listened to it, I was completely won over.  What an amazing first impression.  Excellent soundstage.  Wide, detailed, clear, everything you could want.Unfortunately, once you take the volume to even close to 50%, which you'd want to do in many situations and certainly outside, and it all falls apart.  Hero to zero in the blink of an eye.The bass has a fart-like quality to it which ruins everything.  The only way to make this sound acceptable is to use the EQ to take the bass pretty much to nothing or even a negative setting.  In which case, you could buy almost any other Bluetooth speaker for less than half the price that is going to sound just as good.Many of the reviews talk about bass and presence, but that's only true at really low levels.  At least assuming the unit I was sent is working to factory spec.And don't get me wrong, I'm not listening to music at window rattling levels designed to annoy the neighbors.  I'm not even listening to tracks that I think are especially bass heavy.As an example I listened to Clocks by Coldplay.  Hardly a hardcore bass fest.  The opening bars sounded amazing.  But as soon as the gentle bass chords joined the music, the speaker lost itself.I tried the product on a hard wooden stool.  A hard wooden deck.  A patio table.  A different patio table.  A few feet away.  A few meters away.  It really didn't matter.  I played with numerous EQ settings.  But the bottom line is that it just can't put out bass in any real capacity unless you are willing to lower the sound to a background volume.  In which case, it's amazing.  To me, the bass being available in such a quiet and tiny sweet spot, makes it kind of worthless to include it at all.  I have a pair of B&O Explore speakers, that sound amazing and can be set as a stereo pair.  If you buy them well you can have two of them for $100 less than this Bose.  What they lack in bass, they more than make up for in incredible sound stage, stereo separation and can go toe to toe in terms of detail.  The thing is, they also KNOW they can't do much bass, so they don't even try.  Bose, is trying too hard to make bass happen that apparently isn't possible in this system.Just like I don't drive my car at 100 mph ever, I want it to be capable of that.  I want it to accelerate from zero to sixty in under seven seconds, even though it's not how I drive.  And when it comes to speakers, I want to know that if I want to turn up the volume a little, it isn't going to sound like a box of farts.I tried to give it every opportunity to impress, but it failed at everything except very quiet listening levels.  I was mainly streaming from Apple Music, and I even looked for songs offered at their highest bitrate or including spacial audio technology.  For the price they are charging, there is no way I keep this item.  It is already in the box ready to go to UPS.Maybe it would be different if you have a different sound source, are using a different streaming service, are using AUX or Android.  My tests were iOS based, and bluetooth streaming.  Tracks that I have previously tested on my Marshall Woburn II speaker as an example, with the same source equipment."
"The Soundlink Max is a good speaker by itself, The finish and build are really great, The base and EQ work phenomenall, If you only want one portable speaker this is it. However, and unfortunately, it is sold as a sound link, which usually means you can pair it with another Bose and run it in stereo mode. This is not the case with the Max. I purchased this to pair up with my Bose flex But that's never going to happen. Bose missed the target once again. I can live with the fact that it does not have a microphone for phone conversations but it's hard to get stereo with 2 speakers, 4 inches apart. You can get 2 flex speakers with microphones and pair up in stereo and separate them by thirty feet and have an amazing sound and only spend three hundred instead of four hundred. Returning it today. BTW, I own many Bose sound systems Including sound bars SL3, SL2, mini's, And even the S1 pro with subwoofer that I use for small weddings, Very familiar with the software and using them.Thanks for listening."
"The sound quality is great and volume too I can hear it well at my job. Although I only get 3 hours of charge? That's while I have it plugged in too, maybe something's wrong? I don't knowm"
The good news - blue tooth pairing was a non-event and the speaker was playing quickly with no hassle. Nicely designed with a solid feel.The OK news - the sound out of the box could be best described as muffled but a little adjustment with the equalizer app fixed most of that. At low volume the bass is well controlled and overall the playback has acceptable distortion.The not so good news - as you turn the volume up the sound gets more distorted and the bass isn't quite right. It seems that there is some signal processing magic going on that isn't helping the fidelity. It does get loud but you probably won't like it. The stereo effect is minimal.The really bad news - after 10 minutes of use it locked up and refused to respond to any button presses. It couldn't even be shut down with the power button. Back she goes...
Just setting without using Battery won’t hold a charge over a day. Other then that is a great speaker
Battery only lasting 3 and half hours after fully charged
"This speaker connects seamlessly to any Bluetooth capable device. The sound is there, it’s definitely decent. What you would expect from a speaker this size. I run into a wall with the price, this is not worth the price at all. If this were about 50% less, it would be worth it. The sound quality is good, but not as good as the price. Definitely better than other speakers on the market, but you have to weigh the pros and cons with how much you’re willing to shell out! The speaker itself is large, but easy to handle (it literally has a handle). Easy to move from space to space or travel with. One good full charge seems to last a long while. We have used it 2 nights in a row at our bonfires with no need to charge again. It feels good quality. Nice sleek, black look… but I must say, again, the price—scary!"
"*Disappointing and Flawed: Bose SoundLink MAX Review*I am amazed that over 75% of the people who have written a review of this product do not mention that it does not link to another speaker. That just goes to show you that they have no intentions of buying another speaker because this probably cost so much, they can’t afford to buy another one.I'm writing this review with a heavy heart, as a lifelong Bose enthusiast who's been let down by their latest flagship product, the SoundLink MAX. This premium speaker's glaring omission – the inability to link with other identical models – is a staggering misstep.As a loyal customer with decades of Bose electronics and speakers, I expected excellence from the SoundLink MAX. Its name suggests a continuation of Bose's legendary linking capability, allowing seamless stereo pairing with other compatible models. Instead, this pricey speaker stands alone, stubbornly refusing to connect with its own kind.The customer service department's baffling response – ""they had no idea why"" – only compounds my disappointment. Did Bose abandon their signature linking feature to cut costs or cater to a new market? Whatever the reason, it's a catastrophic decision.The SoundLink MAX's performance, while decent, can't justify its premium price tag. It lacks the depth and richness I've come to expect from Bose. Compared to its predecessors, this speaker feels like a step backward.*Key Issues:*1. No linking capability with other SoundLink MAX models2. Overpriced considering its limited features3. Disappointing sound quality compared to previous Bose models4. Lack of innovation and progress in design*Verdict:*Avoid the Bose SoundLink MAX. Its flawed design and missing feature make it a poor investment. As a loyal customer, I'm saddened by Bose's apparent self-destructive trajectory, prioritizing profit over innovation and customer satisfaction.*Rating:* 1.5/5 stars*Recommendation:*Explore alternative options from brands that still prioritize quality, innovation, and customer needs. Consider the following:- Sonos Move- JBL Boombox- UE MegablastBose, take heed: loyal customers expect better. Revisit your design philosophy and reclaim your reputation as a leader in audio excellence.*UPDATE:* I hope Bose will address this critical issue and release a firmware update or new model that restores the linking capability. Until then, I cannot recommend the SoundLink MAX."
"Sound is great...it's expensive..with the sounding name I assumed it would ""link"" with the other sound link products but it doesn't.  Kind of underhanded way to false advertise. I think I'll switch to Sony or Sonos. Still...the bose sounding flex is as good as it gets"
"The sound was very decent, yet even though the bass is there, it sounds stiff at certain tones. The speaker itself is way too heavy to be something portable, especially compared to the SoundLink Color, which was like the perfect portable speaker already. The battery life sucks. It says up to 20 hours, but that's if you're playing at a very low volume. It doesn't even last a work shift, which is what I was trying to use it for. Takes forever to charge, and that's pretty ridiculous for 2024. I was still going to keep it and just tough it out for work, but the kicker was when the power button no longer works and it hasn't even been 5 days. Just returned it and think I'll find a different brand in an actual store so I don't have to guess and go through all of the extra when it doesn't work."
I’m a Bose guy. My surround sound my headphones my mini speakers…impressive sound with all of those but not so much with this one. I was disappointed. If you’re trying for a loud speaker for a larger gathering this is not the speaker for you. If you want a louder speaker than the mini speaker then you’ll be happy with this one. If you turn up the volume it gets distorted like most cheap speakers out there. Sad for Bose.
"I read all of the reviews and figured I'd buy it.It's OK for $100.00.  Not 300.  There are no highs and no lows.  Honestly,  it sounds like crap.I don't understand why this thing has great reviews.  It's mediocre.  I wish I could share what it sounds like so you would understand.  It's pretty loud, maybe that's why people like it?I'll be returning it."
I really tried to like it but it’s not what I had expected especially with that price.
Charged it overnight and next day says  70%... Weird cuz this shirt expensive and was excited too n now I'm sad 😂
Would be nice if it came with owners manual.
"I enjoyed the quality of the sound of this speaker but sound quality wasn't the only thing I was looking for, tribit speaker does more and is way cheaper."
"I assume most people want to upgrade from the Soundlink Flex to the Soundlink Max.  I thought the GREATEST feature of the soundlinks was being able to connect all of them via party mode. They even made the Bose Connect app solely for the purpose of connecting Soundlinks for party mode.  Well, I guess BOSE thought that was a dumb feature and got rid of it for the Max.The packaging for the Max literally says ""PARTY TO THE MAX"".  It should also say ""but it does not do party mode"""
"I had a first gen Bose sound link for about 6 years and I loved it, until I BROKE IT. Decided to finally upgrade and got the new Bose sound link max and just after a couple hours of listening I can hear a lot of “scratchy” noises or distortion after 50% of max volume. Sadly I returned it. Everything else about it was great (gotta pay to play, not in this case sadly). Would have loved to stay with Bose but I guess this is where I part ways with them."
"I've been a loyal customer of Bose since I bought my first Corvette in 1990 and it came loaded with Bose speakers. However, this new speaker system is really a disappointment. It actually is just an overpriced boombox, the sound quality Is fair at best.The part I don't like about it, is there is no way to pair 2 units together, in order to fill a room with sound.I was willing to put out the $850 on the purchase of 2. But it's technologically impossible, according to tech support at Bose.I have returned the product and will go with JBL signature sound because you can add as many speakers to your sound system as you want.Bose, you really should get your act together. This is really an inferior product, for the price. I suppose if you were going to take this speaker to the beach, it would be better than listening to music on your phone but not by much. So sad."
"I bought it thinking I could buy two nice compatible speakers albeit spendy... nope, soundlink is a joke and a spendy one at that"
First off it does not connect with the sound link flex. It would be better if it did. Second the bass is ok but expected more for the price. The size is reasonable and easy to pack in a backpack for traveling. But if you looking for more bass I would purchase a hyperboom from ultimate ears. The bass on that is amazing.
"I bought it for $300 on Black Friday.There are so many better speakers out there like Sony.The sound quality was horrible.  You can control the base, mids and treble from their app but that’s it and it sounds horrible.Don’t buy this."
"The price is too high for the speaker which did not meet my expectations.sound not good at all,battery life is not good,Bluetooth connectivity's issues take time to connect ,the way they built this device is not good at all in general.Wasting of money. I regret buying this product.Better buy KLIPSCH BLUETOOTH speaker they sounds great. I hope they will exchange it soon for not defective product.In my point of view there is something wrong with this item which I received."
"Sounds blown if bass is up while volume is up, I get that it’s small but the auto eq should take care of this, sounds good at low volume, returned. 400 should sound better for sure."
I could not be more frustrated with this speaker.  Bose had a new app so it will not sync with any of my other SoundLink speakers via Bose Connect.  This company has a strategy of constantly updating apps and creating connection problems so you have to keep updating your speakers-  I am done with Bose for good
"For less than 200 dollars you can find something better with Bose, now it's just the brand and the name and its quality has disappeared."
"speaker did not last long, and stopped charging"
Speaker claims to be water-resistant yet will break down if exposed to even the slightest wet environment pool side (without any direct water exposure). Combination of heat + humidity + light splashing is sufficient to render the speaker useless.
Speaker barely held a charge for 2 hours. If we kept it plugged in  we would get about 4 hours of charge before it died . The sound quality was muffled and crackle sound. We sent the speaker back after having it a week . I have contacted Amazon twice and still haven’t got my refund .
Recieved the speaker had no charging cord and was obviously used!! And when the volume was turned up the speaker sounded busted. Return policy is slow. Still waiting on refund to try to order another speaker
I dislike the battery doesn't last about an hour. I'm very dissatisfied with this product.
"Decent bass and good sound quality for its size, but this $400 speaker won't connect to my phone Bluetooth after initial setup. Returning!"
Way over priced
"It's smaller than I thought it would be. Smaller than a JBL Xtreme 2. In terms of bass, it has about the same loudness with bass as the Xtreme 2, but it goes a bit deeper. Most of the bass sounds really smooth except for certain tracks. G-Easy-Tumblr Girls the bass line overdrives the woofer, you can hear it not be able to render the bass note. It's not quite distortion, it sounds very strange. It did that on several more tracks though most of the time it's smooth and sounds really impressive for it's size. But when it is making that noise you can't just turn it down a couple of notches to get it to sound clean again, it was down under half and still couldn't render it cleanly.There is some stereo processing going on that widens the soundstage, making it sound like instruments and electronic sounds are WAY out to the sides. Most of the time this sounds exquisite, you can pick out small details and pin point exactly where they are from side to side. There were times on a few certain songs where I thought it sounded too diffuse. But not often.I think a more honest sales pitch for this speaker should have been ""A small detailed spacious speaker with deep bass"" and that would have been more of what this actually sounds like. Once you get above 2 volume steps above half the dynamics start breaking down. The bass doesn't get any louder, the mids and highs start going into overdrive and the last volume step is downright painful. It gets loud, but it doesn't sound good. The Xtreme 2 doesn't do that nearly as bad. That is why I say this is not a party speaker. At max it sounds really bad, you can't hear the bass over the boosted mids screeching. This is more of a small room half volume type of speaker, it sounds SO good at those levels.At $400 for the Bose Max, I brought the $200 Tribit Stormbox Blast into the mix. It's a real bass heavy monster for the price, and it sounds great even at max. It's bass is chest pounding in my small weight room. That's more of a party speaker and it's really underrated. You could buy 2 and link them in TWS for a real party for the same price as the Bose Max.I guess if you are thinking about buying this speaker, buy it for intimate listening in a smaller space for a really gorgeous soundstage with deeper bass than I have heard for this size. If you want a party speaker to play near max, I would look at the JBL Party Box 100, 110, or the Tribit Stormbox Blast (or 2!) They are all cheaper and will fill that role better while sounding great."
"At mid to low volumes this speaker sounds nice. Clear upper range, solid vocals and a full lower end bass. It's when you go past mid volume levels that things go south. This speaker will really struggle with bass heavy tracks at higher volume. At max it can sound downright terrible with distortion and strained drivers. The app allows you to adjust the EQ, but even with it flat this is a glaring issue. I would expect a speaker with this kind of price tag to not have.these issues."
"I don't know what Bose is thinking. Not all of their speakers are terrible. But this one was designed with so much treble boost neither my girlfriend nor I can tolerate it. We're not looking for a hifi experience. Just something to listen to while working out.I've been able to make it kind-of sort-of tolerable by using some of the iphone eq settings that boost bass and reduce treble. It still doesn't sound balanced, but it no longer sounds like fingernails on a blackboard.My headline says objectively awful because I'm not just giving an opinion. I've done listener training for recording and mixing and evaluating audio. But you don't even need this to know something's wrong whet it's boosted over 6db above 4khz.I don't believe Bose's engineers are utterly incompetent. Probably some jack-hat in marketing decided that this messed up eq curve sounds ""exciting,"" or some stupid thing. These people do not deserve their jobs. This is my first and last Bose product."
"I purchased this from dell and I would like to take the opportunity to ward off other folks.for $430 w/tax there are better options than this.I had a playlist of goo goo dolls and third eye blind songs and above 75% the speaker got very muddy even including static, and this was without bass boost on.I got 5 hours battery life at AVG 60% volume.Go for the sony ULT field 7 or for even less money than this bose unit, the SRS-XG500 absolutely blows it away.my issue with this bose product is the same flaw that plagues all bose portable speakers EXCEPT the soundlink revolve II, above 60% volume, the bass drops out and above 85% volume you start to hear a lot of muddiness to point you cant make out the lyrics sometimes. bose portable speakers are designed to sound GREAT at 30-50% volume for a laid back gathering like in all the marketing photos. this speaker has those same restrictions. if you're looking for a speaker for a sand volleyball court or a large bbq, or while washing the car in the driveway, THIS IS NOT IT. this is for indoors or 4-6 person small outdoor gatherings by the fire.I own a lot of bose products and have the house wired for bose surround sound in several rooms. im a bose fan, just not a fan of this unit. over priced, and designed to sound great at 40% volume. that's about it. if you're looking for something that holds up to the label ""MAX"" then go for other options in this price range. Sony XG500 blows it away whilst being twice the length. I expected this bose unit to pack more cajohnes for the price."
The battery isn't 20 hours is less the 8 hours don't like el robo mas grande 20 hora no dura ni 6 horas es una estafa la bateria no dura ni 6 horas
"This product makes no sense, its an upgraded flip with boombox pricing. Fails on physics alone"
"Loud and clear. But lacks bass. For 400 it should be louder and have a subwoofer. The design is ""cute"" though."
"same audio quality as the flex, too expensive"
Lacking the ability to link other BOSE speakers is ridiculous.. do not buy until they have that feature updated and if they do.
Not worth the price.
"So I’ll start off with saying it is a very good speaker, but the issue I had is the description shows that the actual speakers inside have LEDs. This is not the case. First, I thought I had a defective unit and did an exchange. The second unit also did not have these LEDs. I tried to email the company with no response. The outer LEDs are very nice and it does sound really good. I’m putting this review so buyers are aware.  It may be a newer version of this unit that they are releasing as I saw other reviews where the light button previously was a bass boost button."
"This constantly turns itself off in 5 minutes.  It also constantly drops sound from computer until you pause, then unpause video.  Triangular shape promotes rolling-off table onto the floor.  Controls feel the same as the texture of the surface therefore require looking at them to use.  More trouble than it's worth."
"Had a problem for an hour, it wouldn't show up on Bluetooth, when it finally hooked up it sounded badly muffled."
"I bought this speaker for 27 bucks. There are plenty of more expensive speakers out there and after listening to this speaker, I know why it's 27 bucks. When it comes to watching a movie or show on your phone, this speaker does the job. When it comes to music, it's trash. Clear and bassless. I bought this speaker to either watch YouTube videos or shows. In that area it works fine. But if your in the market for a small speaker for hiking trips, at the lake, beach, or just chillin in the backyard, this isn't the speaker for you. I give it 3 out of 5 because it does alright in half the things a speaker should do. I won't name drop other brands to look for like watt King that offers cheap speakers that are Damm good. But look into what your buying."
"This is a pretty cool speaker.  The sound is great.  It's loud.  Listening to music on Youtube, using the buttons on the speaker, it goes down to 3 for me, and it's still a bit loud.  Sometimes, I need to adjust the speaker on Youtube.  All music sounds great coming from it.  The size is just enough so it doesn't block my monitor.  It's easy to connect to bluetooth.  Buttons are a bit hard to push, but so are all others like this, no difference.  The LED light show is great.  At rest, it gradually goes through a variety of color combos, kinda soothing in itself.  When the music is on, then it pulsates accordingly, but not in a strobe like way, or a way that's annoying.  I don't about the battery life, it remains on my desk.So what is annoying.  When the speaker goes to sleep mode after five minutes, to get it back on, you have the press the power button twice, once I guess to ""wake"" it and it makes the waking tones, then a second time for it to actually turn on for sound to be heard.  It seems to also happen after shutting down to.  And you have to wait five seconds in between pressing the power button.  I don't know, do I have a bad one?  Every single time now, press the power button once, wait five seconds, press and hold the power button again.  With every incident, it gets further annoying.I don't know of another speaker in this size and price range, and with very cool LED light arrays.  I'll see how much more annoyance I can take.  Again, great speaker, but pretty damn annoying too."
"The sound is pretty good for a small speaker. I bought a second to make it even louder for parties.Be aware that using it via the aux port is tricky though not impossible if you know this tip: It TURNED OFF every 10 minutes when using the port which was inconvenient to say the least. After a long time of experimentation I found that it is the BLUETOOTH circuit timing out because of not receiving a signal even though it was being used through the cord. If you can make sure it doesn't connect to anything via Bluetooth after turning on (not even for a moment) then you can use the cord. (Seriously, just turn off Bluetooth on any devices it might try to auto-connect to.)TWS pairing of two together just takes a couple times of double-tapping the middle button button. There's no indicator that it is in pairing mode but trying one, then the other and then maybe the first again starts it going and it works fine.The lights can be turned off and they remember that selection when powering back on later."
"Is a loud speaker (good), however there SHOULD be a way to reduce the bass it outputs (directly on the speaker), as I frequently listen to talk podcasts or talk MP3s  (such as old Howard Stern shows)  The problem is frequently the bass will kick in on this speaker and it kind of distorts the audio when there is no bass needed.More importantly the device seems to go to sleep after 3-5 minutes of no audio being played ( and once again there's no way to turn off this sleep function)so for example if you have to pause or take a call you, the unit will go to sleep- and you have to walk back over the speaker hold down the power button and power it back on.Pros:- battery life is decent to pretty good, I get about 8 to 12 hours of play time- speaker is capable of putting out loud volume (I don't listen to music really)- price is pretty low at 25 to $30To be clear im commenting on my purchase (oct 2023) of: ""Portable Bluetooth Speaker, IPX7 Waterproof Wireless Speaker with Colorful Flashing Lights, 25W Super Bass 24H Playtime""  (since amazon allows sellers to switch out products but keep the old reviews , i want to be clear).  I also bought this myself and was not influenced or paid by anyone to write this review (Again something that shouldnt have to make clear,  but do.)"
"Sound quality is average,  Low and high frequencies are lacking, mostly mids.  Lights are cool, but i purchased because of reviews and I would be lead to believe the sound stage was more dynamic.  Not expecting high fidelity, but based on the reviews  I would have expected a fuller sound."
But it still has a decent volume. Bass response is ok. Not overwhelming but still a little underwhelming. We will see how it ages and if the speakers keep showing good quality with use.
"I really loved this speaker in the beginning the volume is loud, easy controls,however a month later will not hold a charge and the sound goes in and out 😮‍💨"
"Great price, decent volume. Can sound fuzzy. So if sound quality is important to you maybe check something else out."
Good sound wish it was a little louder and better base otherwise it is good
Bought this little speaker thinking the sound quality might be similar to a brand name one. It was not. It was in the same price range so I should have just spent the little extra money. However the lights are cool and I'll be keeping this for a backup speaker.
"Not sure why it took me so long to write a review for this. For some reason this never popped up as an option to write a review until I just left another review on another product I got. The speaker worked fine for the first couple of weeks…I took a chance after reading some of the reviews of people having very similar issues that I am experiencing. For the first couple of weeks the speaker worked flawlessly and I had no major complaints other than the LED lights. The function of them are absolutely worthless. I wish I could have just one single color that stays on steady burn the entire time instead of just randomly blinking. I'm not sure who designed this as far as the LED lights go or whoever designed the functionality of the LED lights...But, let's just say I hope that person is unemployed now because they are everything but an engineer..more like an engineer of disaster. As I stated, other than the LED lights functionality, the speaker worked flawlessly for a couple weeks until it didn't. I would notice that every now and again it would disconnect from my phone which really wasn't the biggest deal in the world but after it started happening numerous times throughout my shift it got extremely frustrating very quickly. It then got to the point to where the speaker did not work at all for about a couple days and then it magically came back on again like nothing ever happened. My biggest issue I have now is the LED lights have completely stopped working, and for whatever reason the volume of the speaker is so extremely low you can barely hear it. At this point, you might as well just say the speaker does not work because of how low the volume is. And just because I feel the need to throw this out there…I myself am an engineer and I'm very tech savvy to say the least  The volume on the speaker itself is at full blast as well as the volume on my cell phone. It is NOT a user error! It is 110% not only a design flaw but the engineering disaster to say the least. The speaker was very cheaply made and it would not surprise me if they had a budget of a dollar for each speaker. Also, IF I'm being totally honest...........I only purchased a speaker for two reasons.1) It was a bit cheaper than say a JBL or ANY other name brand.2) It just looked cool and who doesn't like purchasing something that looks cool?If I could give you any advice, spend the extra money and get a name brand speaker. I wish I would have. I would not recommend this speaker to anyone at all! Not even my ex girlfriend and I hate her. I would consider her an enemy and I would not give this speaker or recommend the speaker to my enemies. I believe this could be considered borderline a war crime for how terrible it is."
"i have arthritis/eds (in my 30s) and the buttons on this bluetooth speaker are extremely stiff and hard to press it hurts my fingersi got this to use for little on-bed groovebox/synthesizer jams with my fiancee but she will have to turn it on/off for me it's ridiculously hard to press the buttons i could literally injure myself so if you have trouble with your hands look elsewhere; i love the color and the lights are cool and it also sounds pretty decent and loud and feels very well built but the buttons issue are making me consider returning it, i might keep it and just get a different one additionally we will see"
I didn’t like the flashy lights and the microphone wasn’t loud enough for me to hear on…….I had to return it and buy a more expensive speaker……..
"Based off of other peoples reviews, I went ahead and purchased this. It’s OK, however it does not have bass. I love the lights. They are really fun!"
"Just got it and easy to set up, feels solid, sound is great but the lowest sound setting is almost too loud and I feel ridiculous saying that but it's true. I would say the lowest setting on the speaker is about a 3 on another speaker. Also not a fan of the buttons, especially the - button. But can't beat the price and other quality, might keep it anyway"
Speaker not as loud as expected
"I like it, but def don't love it.  For the price, not bad.  The bass is basically non-existent.  I'm not a heavy bass person either, so be prepped.  I'm still thinking of sending it back, but may keep it for outcalls for massage therapy work."
"Only lasted 10 months as it no longer charges. Now I need to buy another one and sadly I cannot trust this same one or this brand to last for longer. Money can't be valuable if the quality of the product isn't good. I only have it 3 stars bc sound was ok, volume control was good but not bass control, small speakers shouldn't have hard bass, yes it's portable, looks cool, but distortion is awful if gets too loud.  It's cool people can get a nice accessory for an affordable price but the quality is terrible."
The sound is kind of eh and I'd like to go a bit louder (more amperage) so am opting for a better speaker at a higher price point.
"2 stars for easy to setup/use and because I LOVE the look of the fabric covering so much.But the sound quality was terrible.Static like a loose phono jack should not be possible on a Blutooth speaker.And no matter the EQ settings from the phone, and regardless of the static, the sound itself was very hollow and tin-y.Might just be a bad unit, I'm not sure.  Will try a replacement if i can, and update if the next is any better."
It was a pretty good speaker I loved the led lights the bass was amazing. But I just bought it in March and it's only October and it's already done.. I use it for about an hour only 5 days a week and never let it run dead I always made sure to charge it at 1 bar left.. but I'm really bummed out that it won't turn on anymore.. went to use it and nothing worked. It won't light up to charge or anything..
"I've had the speaker for a week now and I have noticed a few minor issues. The first day I used the speaker, it would randomly ""disconnect"" from my phone. My phone would keep playing but no sound would come out the speaker. I have to pause my music on my phone then resume and the speaker would catch up.The battery life on my speaker is poor. My phone will show that the speaker has 50% left and the speaker will make a sound then shut off, at 50%.But again, I consider this minor given the price."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It’s a nice size, easy to transport and no issues to charge. It connected easily to my iPhone 11PRO . The sound is wonderful.My problem is the power button isn’t working like it did when I first received it. I have used it for about a month. Now it takes 2-3 minutes of trying to get it to turn on and off. I am not going to try to replace it because I don’t want to be bothered with returning it. The closest UPS store is about 25 miles from me."
It sounds great. The colors are cool. The one thing I have a problem with is the battery life. I had it fully charged and no lights but at full volume. It lasted maybe four hours. I will say yes if you just us at home but for a camping trip like we did ain't worth it.
"Music sounds tinny,no base"
I charge it full and it dies after 15 minutes. I have to keep it on the charger. It’s loud and the bass is cool but it’s annoying having to keep charging it.
"This speaker at 100% will last for a couple of hours and dies at 50% battery life. It died even at 60%. I'm not sure if my item is broken or not but the one I had before this was a better choice and cheaper and the battery would die at 20% not 50% full. The light show is cool but uses up most of the energy so I don't hardly use the lights. I have to keep it on the charger for best results. I don't trust the battery life of this device and wouldn't recommend it based on my experience with it. There is also no warning of the battery dying. No beeping noise no red dot indicator, nothing, it just shuts down. Not cool when you're relying on it for work related or party efforts and trying to utilize the 100% charge on it. Wouldn't buy it again."
It’s a good size. Good sound quality but it died at 50% everytime. It’s so frustrating. I tried letting it die and charging back to 100% and that did not work either. I realized this after the return window passed and now I’m stuck with it.
"Dislike  that it doesn’t hold a charge very long. If I don’t use it for four or five days, when I do use it, it shuts off. I start it again but it only plays about 40 seconds & it shuts off again. So annoying. I don’t have a charger for it in my car so I have to wait till I get home to charge it up again."
Great little speaker. But doesn’t not play simultaneously. It will connect to both but only play out of one speaker at a time. Tried everything for over an hour
The sound is not very good on this speaker. I've adjusted the sound components but it still doesn't have good sound quality.It is pretty though.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                UPDATE:: It's dead. It just cut off and won't turn back on. I purchased this in August 18th this year... 5 days short of 4 months and it's dead. None of the troublshooting options work. Oh well. It was good while it lasted.=====When I shop for anything I do look for bad reviews and make a note of the problems reported, and it  becomes a kind of checklist for me when it arrives. I am very happy to say none of those problems happened, and based on the other positive reviews, this is actually a good product.With the PC in my room, I walked out to the living room where I'd be using it most. C onnectivity was great even at 400 feet away, which means it'll work on the back deck as well.And the battery life so far seems good. It's going on 2 hours, out of the box with no charging. So far so good.But more importantly...The ONE thing I wanted *most* and was hoping for is the thing that I got. I've had other speakers before and they were good, but the BASS wasn't quite hitting right. They had bass, but you couldn't 'feel' the bass.You know what I mean? When the beat hits or the bass sounds, you can feel the waves and vibration around it in the air.When I'm gaming or listening to music, I need to feel the beat hit and the bass. This did a really great job of preserving that.I'm not sure it'll translate in the video I shared, but it's really nice."
I can't charge it anymore very disappointed I can't return it and now I'm stuck with a piece of garbage
"I bought this to use in my office while I am working and the lowest volume is still way too loud.  The sound is able to be heard throughout the entire first floor of my house, even on the lowest volume.  It is probably a great speaker for outdoors but definitely not recommended for an office or for a bedroom, if you want to have low-level background music while working or sleeping."
"Sound is decent, but not having a bass button to choose level is disappointing from a volume perspective.  It works great on the boat as I don’t need the volume up high, but didn’t impress me at work when I needed full volume to be FULL volume."
"I compared 5 different waterproof Bluetooth speakers just based on sound alone. I did not test out battery life or water proof quality. I paid 30 for this unit (supposedly half price). Sadly it underperformed relative to all other speakers I tested. To be fair, it is one of the cheaper options. That said, at the same price point, the “Ortizan” sounds a lot better. The main issue I have is the speaker sounds like it’s playing inside of a tin can. For such a small speaker you just aren’t going to get great bass at this price point. Nevertheless, you can do better than this. The light show is cute but not particularly important to me."
"What I liked: 1. Size, 2. LED Lights, 3. Decent sound for its size (although you had to be close to it to hear the bass).What I didn't like: 1. Continuous Sound Drop Out.Audio Source: Apple iPhone SE 2nd Gen, 128GB via Bluetooth.Did not get to test water resistance, MP3 capability, nor the signal distance.I saw that a previous reviewer stated that the speaker's sound drops out while in use, but I still wanted to take a chance at getting one that wasn't defective.  Over all it is a cool little speaker with good sound, and the light show, although it doesn't pulse with the beat of the music, it really awesome.  But, what good is a Bluetooth speaker if while playing music it goes silent... consistently.  Within the 30 minutes that I tested it (before putting it back in the box to return it), it went silent 5 times. The only way to get the sound back was to pause and un-pause the music on my iPhone, to which it would play for another couple of minutes and then silence.  I restarted the device, but still encountered the same issue.  I've never had any my other Bluetooth speakers do that, even the little cheap $5 one I bought from the local Big Lott's store.  Needless to say, as much as I hated doing it, I had to return it (I don't like returning things, I always want them to work). In conclusion, if you want to take a chance at getting one that isn't defective out of the box, go for it because it's a really nice little speaker. Chances are, you may fair better than myself & some of the other reviewers."
I like it for the price. It doesnt get loud enough for me though. The battery life is about a few hours. Im going to spend a little more next time and get a jbl speaker for 90 bucks.
"I was hoping I'd get the one speaker that wouldn't shut off like the other reviewers stated.  It is very nice sounding for the price and the color was amazing, I would have bout two more colors if it hadn't stopped while listening for the first time opening up and getting out of box.  It came fully charged so I was able to set up very easily and quickly.  I've been looking for a small portable speaker that doesn't break the bank but can take on bike rides and still have some bass.  This little speaker had great sound but who wants to keep having to hit play again on your app so it will start again.  You'd think with all those complaints piling up they would fix that issue.  I also saw it jump from $35 to $129 wth??? how do you sell it for that much more with the very issue that would keep you from listening to it non stop.  I've tried several speakers and by far right now Bose and Harmon Kardon are my favorite but they don't make cool looking ones for your bike bottle holder or for strap to bike style.  I'm waiting for my Altec Lansing to arrive and hoping that works out."
"Update - the seller contacted me and has requested to allow me to try another speaker. I appreciate that kind of customer support. So after a few months I can update my feedback and provide info on the new product. I really do like that it is compact, lightweight, and connects extremely easy with Bluetooth.Original feedback -I loved this speaker so much I bought a second. The volume was great and it worked quite a distance from my phone. However, after a few months the volume has diminished and will not increase. Both of the speakers have done this. I get as much volume from my phone as I get from these now."
"It isn't the best-sounding Bluetooth speaker I've ever used -- that honor goes to the Harmon Kardon Onyx 3 -- but it's very good for the price. Although you couldn't call it boomy, there's enough bass to keep the music from sounding too anemic. I'm glad the flashing lights can be turned off. Pairing with my phone was quick & easy. With the speaker being waterproof, I don't have to panic if I left it out on the patio and it starts to rain."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Update: 8/31/2024I bought this speaker few months ago and now it's giving me issues. So Im updating my review from 5 to 3 stars. It was good while it only lasted a couple months. Disappointed. It still works but the volume has gone lower for some reason even tho I tried turning it up from both ends. It's still at a low volume.Old news:I love the way it sounds , the bass, high volume , also lights up to the beat of the music, small to carry around. I love my speaker 💖 I had to do a review on this product because it’s worth the money especially the price for it is a really good deal."
I'm in love with this speaker. I love the bass and how high it goes for something so small. The only complaint I have is that it dies after it hits 50% and you have to charge it again for the music to go back on. It kinda sucks. I'm used to speakers playing until the battery hits zero. The speaker does play as it's charging however it sucks if you're outside with no charger you know.
Bought this in red for my son 8 months ago and it was great so I bought one for myself in purple. I’ve had it a couple weeks. It randomly cuts out like it’s dying. It can be on the charger for 2 days and still shows only one bar of battery life and dies super quick.  Sound is great for size. Accidentally left it in the rain and it still works. My only con is it won’t hold a charge and cuts out. Super annoying!
Product battery not charging after 1 month. No matter how long I charge it it says 10% battery.  Would not recommend.
"I bought this speaker only a little over a month ago, and it cuts off while using. At first it would just cut the music off, while the lights are still working as if the song is playing. All I would have to do to reconnect is pause the song and press play. (That rebooted it ) then it progressively got worse. Then it would completely shut off. Okay, I’m thinking it’s dead? No, it still has two lights on. Turn it back on, it’s obviously halfway charged still, and again, within 5 seconds it shuts off completely. I’ve never brought it even close to any body of water, never took it in my bathroom while I shower (for humidity reasons) nothing. Hasn’t taken a fall off the counter or any damage whaaattt so ever. I don’t understand. Everyone’s reviews are so positive and like it works great, maybe I got a defect one?? Of course I didn’t pay extra for the warranty and now I regret not doing so. Mine lasted barely a month before issues occurred. Super sad. I even let the battery die all the way from when I first opened it out the package, and let it charge all the way to full every time . I never charge it overnight either. I did everything I could to keep it in GREAT condition since no warranty. And pooey! :( hope everyone else gets one that works properly!!"
ThThought i would update...don't believe the pics showing its ok in water. Mine took a nose dive off a shelf about 10 inches into a fish tank..actually the non plug end is the other part to get wet and it was less than a couple minutes as i was just in the other room. The cord was holding that end up onto shelf. Now it lights up and turns on but i cant get music to play anymore. Really bummed. It worked decent until then. I have only had it like 3 months of course out of warranty This works out great in my plant nursery!It has good range. I cant get signal with my phone in my building but i can set it outside my building and this boombox gets the signal via bluetooth and plays my musicExcellent product for the price
"I read the reviews and many in addition to the add claimed the sound was so great.  I purchased a small portable mini tower Bose speaker in 2020 that far outweighs the crappy sound of this. I am returning it. I only got it for my old car after a bluetooth adapter broke off inside the aux port on my dashboard.  Since it has over 226k miles, I don't expect to keep it more than another year or so. I also do not listen to the regular stereo radio. So, I got this supposedly fantastic sounding bass speaker to play my music, videos and podcasts from my iphone.  It was a huge disappointment. Do not believe it. I have no kind words.  Who cares how cool it looks.  It is a speaker.  The sound is what is important."
Works good bad color lights and not that loud
"Battery life is not good, got about 4 hours of play without the lightshow. Other than that, it's a nice little speaker."
"Suddenly just gets disconnected and even though the battery is full, it just stops playing then I have to Reconnect by for turning on the button on the speaker, I cannot do it remotely unless I press that button. This is not convenient when I have the speaker far away from me and I cannot turn it on physically with the button."
"Speaker bass is okay. I was expecting something a bit stronger, or at least bass to be more distinguishable since it’s a 25w speaker. I purchased this speaker, and a Tribit Bluetooth speaker to compare since they were both on sale.Pros- nice sounding speakerCons- bigger speaker doesn’t equal louder or more bass.-Bass is weak for the size and power.-will need at least two speakers if you are using for gathering, but even then not sure if people would hear the actual music.I returned this speaker since the Tribit is more clear with treble and near the same bass sound."
Loved it until the battery died 5 months after purchase. Have never bought an extended warranty and have never needed one until this but 5 months of battery life is very poor.
I purchased this I believe it said 30 Watts thinking I would get a loud enough speaker to hear while I'm working 10 ft away. I have a boom that's over 10 years old advertised at 3 watts. Which one do you think is louder? The three watt 10-year-old boom blows this thing away as far as noise and distance. Next time somebody advertises something to be 30 watts maybe just maybe they should try to be a bit louder than something that is advertised as three watts. Therefore it was false advertised and disappointing. I have these two speakers now and which one do I have to listen to My old one since this new one doesn't have near the sound as a 10-year-old three watch speaker. False advertisement.
Depending on what your needs are this speaker may meet them. It was just ok. I thought it sounded a bit tinny and needed more depth and bass. I think if you just wanted a little something to listen to some podcasts or the news it would be fine but for music it was meh. I returned for something better... albeit more expensive.
The part where the charger should go fell into the speaker. Recieved it in December..broke in February. The only reason it gets three stars is because of the seller. They contacted me and rectified the issue right away without being annoying. I appreciate the customer service.
"First of all the seller placed a RED colored speaker system in the wrong speaker box. The box was meant for a BLACK speaker. That wasn't a deal breaker but it did raise eyebrows. The first time I used it was two weeks ago and noticed that it shuts off after two minutes when a song or show is paused. I don't think that's a special feature but I didn't think it needed to be returned for that either. But I'm starting to think if the speaker that was sent to me was a brand new one or was it refurbished. Was this speaker a discarded one for not working properly then returned then sold back to someone else? IDK... But when hubby and I wanted to watch a movie on his iPad we noticed the volume wasn't able to go up any higher and the speaker was too low. I pressed the button on the iPad which was to the MAX and tried the button on the Beat Boom speaker and it didn't work. The Volume was just not loud enough when paired with the latest iPad for added sound. I missed my return window so I'm stuck with this lemon! I'm going to have to find another seller & company to buy from. I'm so disappointed. It's a good looking speaker, too."
"I got two of these to replace a different Bluetooth speaker.  Reviews looked great.  The sound is really good, I love that it's waterproof, and that you can connect two together.  Love the fun lights and that it turns off automatically.  The feature that makes sounds if you tap on it is kinda useless IMO but I'm sure it's fun for someone.Now for what I don't love.....The battery life is not as advertised.  If the battery lasts 24 hours as they say it does, for anyone, I'd be surprised.  I use just one speaker and turn off the lights for about an hour and it uses 10% of the battery.  Both speakers are like this so it's not just one that's possibly defective.If you're looking for a speaker with great sound that's waterproof, this one is for you, just don't expect long battery life in the process."
"Speakers sound ok if you do not miss punchy bass.Lights are nice, but this speaker is really for young children.RJS"
Decent speaker for price. Good sound. Does not hold a charge very long. Wish volume would increase more for outdoor use.
"Debating if I should keep or return. The sound quality could be better. The sound is not mid loud but not what I’m used too. As I turn the sound on my phone up, the sound on the speaker decrease for some reason. So I have to keep my phone volume in the middle in order for the speaker to be loud. Weird.The power usage is good and last long. Love the flashing lights but wish the sound was louder.Update: The company contacted me regarding the product, and they was very helpful with resolving the issue. Great customer service!"
"The sound quality is solid enough, but the problem with this speaker is literally everything else.The lights are awkward, erratic and unpleasant. I turned them off the first day and never turned them back on.There’s a weird glitch where if I have a paused video on my computer, even if I am playing something entirely different, the speaker will go to sleep every minute or so.Approx 80% of the time I would turn it on, it would immediately turn itself entirely off and have to be powered on again.Lastly, after having this thing for a little under six months, it appears to have completely given up the ghost.Yesterday I turned it on and it seem to have connected. It didn’t make the normal beep from connecting, but it blinked like it normally does. Despite confirming that all other settings worked and produced sound on other devices, this thing has fully embraced its future as a paperweight on my shelf.Honestly, it will at least be a more consistent at holding down paper than it was at occasionally switching between Spotify and YouTube…I could not be less happy with this product.Maybe my specific speaker was an anomaly, but I definitely won’t be getting a new one, just in case."
"It’s my 2nd day with this item. Haven’t decided yet if I should keep it. I may return. It’s pretty loud no doubt, but not a great bass. Imagine playing a song you know has a great bass & beat (like the deep drums, guitar etc…) but when it gets to that point of the song, this speaker tends to reduce the sound making the song uninteresting & less enjoyable. Expected this to be somewhat close to JBL speaker but a bit disappointed. Love the lights though. It’s a pretty looking speaker overall."
"Honestly, I thought this was one of the best purchases I have ever made UNTIL owning it for a little over 3 months. I barely use it, so I rarely have had to charge it. Anyways, the first few times that I charged it, I was able to unhook it from the charger and bring it wherever, no problem. After the 3rd time of charging it, the speaker no longer works unless connected to an outlet, which completely defeats the purpose of me purchasing this item. I have tried over and over again charging it again thinking maybe it just didn’t reach its full charge, but no luck. It turns on for maybe a minute or two then powers off."
"When I use facebook while the speaker is turned on. The Speaker increase volume to maximum sound. Every time theres a video advertisement. And its 12am. Neighbors are complaining about the music.I have to turn off the speakers because the speakers is glitching. Every time I use facebook the volume would automatically set max volume. Which I keep lowering the volume. When I scroll up. It maxes the volume again automatically.This is annoying. I have to turn off bluetooth so the speaker does not automatically max volume.I see the lights turned on. However I don’t hear music. When I press volume up it plays music on my smartphone. Then minute later becomes mute. However when I press play on the speakers the music continuously playing music. I just cannot press play on my smartphone otherwise it causes the speaker to become mute.The music is good in acoustic! I can enjoy classical music when I changed my equalizer to bass its too much bass. However when I changed it to acoustic, pop music, r&b music, dance music sounds great!"
"I specifically ordered the grass green color to match up to the beach belongings but received the black one, which is also $6 cheaper.So I call Amazon customer service, Danielle was super nice and helpful to her abilities,  but apparently the seller doesn't provide the exchange option, so I would have to pack up the wrong speaker, print a return label with a printer I don't have and drop it off at a UPS store, get the refund, place a new order and wait for it a couple of days longer than it was initially stating with my Amazon prime membership.  All in all I'm just disappointed with how inconvenient it can get while paying over $120 membership fee that just keeps increasing annually and yet find myself in a situation where I need to perform 5 additional steps to get what I want because the seller wasn't attentive.I ended up keeping the black one and Danielle issued me a $10 GC to make up for the price difference, which was very nice.The quality of the speaker is OK for the money you pay. There's no ""wow"" factor about it, it just works fine. The sound can easily be compared to the Alexa speaker."
"I want to love this speaker - the sound is great and I can get it to the perfect volume (the bass is lacking a little), but every time the battery life drops below 50%, the speaker will turn itself off. It takes a bit to charge so having to charge it every other day because the battery won't work after it goes below 50% is extremely annoying."
Volume not very loud. Bass not strong
"This model does not have the slam drum function as the previous model had. Was fooled by "" but it again"" recommendation from Amazon and purchased. Was very disappointed that this model does not have the slam drum function that my kid loves."
"I wanted a speaker for an outdoor space and after calculations determined I would need about 25W of power to fill the space, this was advertised as 25W, its not even close, needless to say it failed to do its job.The sound quality is decent, the light show is super annoying and it has only 1 mode, on or off, the on mode is quite frankly seizure like, lots of flashing etc. You'll not be able to stand it for long,  theres a way to turn it off but its a tiny little button under the power cord flap and it has no memory, so the next time you turn it on those headache inducing lights are back, theres also a bass boost button which does not boost anything. Pressing it just disconnects the bluetooth.It has potential and could have been so much better but the failure for me was the lack of power / volume."
For the price it is great Bluetooth speaker. But it is not that powerfull nor loud enough. You have to keep it close to you. If you move little bit further not loud enough. Will probably return this
"""Punchy Bass"" is really misleading. Bass is barely noticeable and non existent where it should be ""punchy"". Get what you pay for and I get why this was on sale."
"So I have no idea how this could possibly be rated so well and at the same time be so bad. It works fine for a cheapo bt speaker, but come on people...the bass is terrible (especially given its size)...the drivers bottom out with anything above medium sound volume.It's poorly made, the buttons are kinda hard to get engaged under the mesh. It's a cheap toy for kids...not a serious speaker (certainly not 25 watts lol)...maybe 4 watts of volumetric sound...so I am super confused by the broader reviews being posted here.It's a cheap product, the smaller JBLs sound more expansive.Anyway, go find something else...it barely works for the money IMO."
"Maybe I'm just a weakling. but with the buttons being on the speaker , it was entirely too hard to press the power button on and off."
I do love these speakers for the sound quality reproduction. The reason for the lesser review is  they un-sync (from each other) when I attempt to use the lighting effects. The pair then revert to a single speaker working.
"The speakers look good and appear to be sturdy, but the fact that the sound ""drops out"" periodically drives us crazy.  I did not use these for a month after receiving them, only to discover this issue after the free return window closed.The sound quality was also not up to what I hoped for.  I suggest you spend a few more dollars and get something that generates better sound.  I also wanted 360 degree output, but these are very ""directional""."
"I loved it for 12 months.  Now the sound quality is constantly crackling.  I thought something might be interfering, but no matter where I move the speaker. Outside, garage, inside, in car or the distance I leave my phone I Bluetooth it with, near, far, different room all I get is sound like a radio with an unclear signal.  I will buy another one.  I am just disapointed that after 12 months the sound quality has become so poor."
It’s only the beginning of September and I bought it in June and it won’t hold a charge anymore. Sucks I really loved this speaker.
"My beloved Bluetooth speaker stopped working thus I started shopping for good priced Bluetooth speaker. I read some reviews on this product and I liked the price so I proceeded to buy it confidently….. this speaker is rather annoying for many reasons. 1.) it randomly silencies your music when your using it. (legit is cuts it off and you check your phone to see your phone is still playing.) 2) the power button sometimes doesn’t work sometimes, you gotta reposition your finger to press again for it to work. 3)sometimes when you play your music too loud it will also cut off the sound. Shopper to another shopper, don’t buy this speaker try another one out."
"I wanted to like the speaker, but it would not stay powered on. Even after charging the speaker full cycles uninterrupted, it would constantly cut off without dying while I was listening to music. Also, the speaker has very good bass, but not as loud as I would have hoped. And the last note I would add is because of the heavy bass if you put it on a smooth surface, the speaker will slide off due to vibrations."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            For an inexpensive little portable bluetooth speaker, it is pretty decent. However, when adjusting levels w/ an equalizer, the higher levels will muddle out the ones lower. I've fiddled w/ it enough to find an acceptable tweak. There is decent bass, I can feel it if I'm holding the speaker or touching near the surface on which it's placed. But if one wants really true bass, get something w/ a subwoofer.I was just wanting something better than a laptop/pc speaker or my phone speaker. This fit the bill. I've used it a lot since Saturday and the battery hasn't needed a charge yet. It does get very loud too; so no worry about having not enough volume."
"Honestly the whole reason I bought this speaker was for the slap functions. I have had many types and brands of speakers, but this was the first I'd seen with the slap function that added a lil something extra to your sound experience. It took Me till now to write this review because I have been trying to see if it was Me that was doing something wrong. However, it's NOT... My speaker simply does not have the slap functions. it lights up and sounds great but so do so many other speakers. Ya'll know y'all wrong for selling us on a feature that when you get the item it clearly doesn't have. Color Me disappointed.**********UPDATE: Almost immediately after I posted My original review of the speaker. The seller contacted Me and offered Me a full refund of My purchase. I accepted their offer, and they refunded Me just as quickly as they offered it. I appreciate the prompt response and refund. I will be buying from this seller again based on their action with this purchase."
"Sounds ok, not as loud as I expected for a supposed 25 watt speaker. Lights work but I'm not interested in them. Biggest complaint is that the speaker turns itself off after 10 minutes of inactivity even when still connected. Then you have to constantly go and push the button to start again. Pain in the neck of you take a phone call now and then. Next time I'll get another brand."
"Design is nice, sturdy and cool looking, but all of that is worthless because of the super underwhelming sound.  The moment you turn on the power switch, you are immediately aware the device is weak.  If you are only interested in listening to news and podcasts, that’ll do.  If you expect to enjoy music, stay clear."
"The sound wasn't horrible but also not rich and full. Also, when we tried to switch between phones for pairing, it ended up so confused, I couldn't get it to pair.If you aren't super picky on fullness of sound and only ever pair with one device,  it's probably worth the price.  But otherwise,  save your money.Company was awesome on return."
Helped out for Dragon Year
I use this for my mail vehicle since i dont have radio in it. With the vehicle being so loud i need a speaker i can hear well. I keep trying to increase volume and can barely hear it over the engine noise. Ordering a bose radio to see if better.
Battery refuses to recharge after about 4 months. There is no additional warranty available.
"I’ve ordered two of these since October 2023. The first one I ordered in October 2023, started malfunctioning in July 2024. I really only use this speaker when I’m sleeping to play brown noise or it’s on the counter of my bathroom playing music while I shower. Anyways, bought another one to replace the malfunctioning one in July 2024 and now it’s malfunctioning and October 2024 is just now beginning. These aren’t worth the money unless you’re okay with replacing them every few months. They don’t even last a year with daily use."
"I do not know if the one I got was defective or what.  The music was low, bass not good either. I like A LOT of bass. Will not group with any echo. I did like the lights. Lol Depends on what you are buying it for.  I spend a good amount of time speaking with amazon customer service reps. Most of them are kind and helpful. I do believe some are actually from our country as well."
"It's so disappointing to have to write this review, because when this little speaker decides to work it's awesome. The sound is clear, the bass is amazing and the lighting effects on it rock. That being said, it will just decide not to work for no reason. I can figure out when on Blue Tooth, so I'm constantly having to turn it off and back on to get it to keep sound. It stays on a very short period of time when not in use so you're constantly having to reconnect it if you get up to use the bathroom or there's a lull in your conversation. I thought it was the Blue Tooth connection not working well so I tried an AUX cable and no matter what I do I can't get the AUX cable to work. I eventually got so frustrated with it that I returned it. I don't know if mine was defective or what but it just... sucked after a while to try to use.Also, this is minor, admittedly, but the color purple is not as advertised. It's more of a dull and darker purple than the jewel tone shown."
"It's hard not to give this five stars because of how amazing this technology is and the fact that I've been dreaming about VR for 30 years. Unfortunately though, most of the positives I have to match with negatives.My biggest issue is the overall clarity with video. Yes, you can sit in a gondola as it moves through the Swiss Alps with the beautiful mountains and countryside around you, but even if it says you're watching in 1440p, it's going to look like youre watching on a VHS tape from the 80s. Same thing for watching movies. You want to watch Lord of the Rings? Great. You can expand the movie make it look like it's on a curved screen as big as you'd like, but the highest resolution you're going to get honestly looks like 720p. There is also always a bit of smudgyness with the lenses. I've wiped them off with the glasses-safe cloth numerous times, but there is always something there regardless.It took a while to find a good adjustment that didn't make wearing the headset painful but I feel like I'm fairly used to it now. That being said, you are always going to have a gap around the edges of your nose that lets light in. So if you were looking for a really immersive experience, you'll have to buy a new snap-on piece that frames your face a little bit differently. I also wear contacts, and they do include a small extender if you wear glasses, and I did play around with it a bit but unless you have pretty small classes, I think you might have to buy a different kind of extender.I think what this headset is making me realize is that outside of headsets that use either the Microsoft or Apple OS, all of these are going to feel like immersive smartphones. Facebook/Meta wants to own this space like everybody else. They have their own storefront for apps on this headset, and to some extent that means they are going to be the ones that control what is or isn't on this device. You can get Instagram. But you can't get tik tok. You can get prime video, but not Hulu, Netflix, or Max. You can apparently link to your desktop and do everything through that, but I haven't tested that yet.Also, one last feature that this thing is lacking. It gives you a mode that allows you to see what's around you as you're walking through your house in 720p vision, but you can't have screens follow you as you walk. Not sure why not. They allow you to move the screens everywhere and reposition at any time, but you can't put a video in the corner of your vision while your doing other things, which feels like a HUGE miss."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            If this is your first dip in the VR, you’re going to love it…. But there is one caveat if you’ve had the quest 2 previously, the specs look better than the upgrades by no means am I discouraging anybody from jumping into this because, after all as of right now, you are getting Batman Arkham shadow for free ,and 3 free months of Meta Quest  +. But the Meta Quest 3, although $200 more expensive for the 512 GB version in my opinion may justify the extra cost. Take a look at the specs . let me give you the key differences between previous generations.Meta QUEST 3s Key Features:Higher resolution displays (2064 x 2208 pixels per eye)Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processorFull-color passthrough for mixed realityThinner and lighter design compared to Quest 28GB RAMStarting at 128GB storageNew Touch Plus controllersNotable improvements over Quest 2:30% thinner form factor40% more powerful processorSignificantly improved mixed reality capabilitiesBetter lens design for reduced glareEnhanced controllers with improved hapticsHere are the Meta Quest 3's key technical specifications:Display:Resolution: 2064 x 2208 pixels per eye (4128 x 2208 total)LCD panels with quantum dot technology90Hz-120Hz refresh rate25 PPD (pixels per degree)IPD adjustment range: 53-75mmProcessor & Memory:Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 28GB RAMStorage options: 128GB or 512GBOptics:Pancake lenses110-degree horizontal field of view (FOV)96-degree vertical FOVMixed Reality:2 RGB color cameras for passthroughDepth sensorIR projector for hand tracking18 PPD passthrough resolutionControllers:Meta Quest Touch Plus controllersTruTouch hapticsNo external tracking ringsSelf-tracking with camerasRechargeable batteries via USB-CAudio:Integrated spatial audio speakers3.5mm headphone jackBuilt-in microphonePhysical:Weight: 515gBattery life: 2-3 hoursCharging via USB-CWiFi 6E supportBluetooth 5.2These specs represent a significant upgrade over the Quest 2, particularly in terms of display resolution, processing power, and mixed reality capabilities. The pancake lenses and improved optical design also allow for a more compact form factor.So basically, definitely worth the money if you’re coming from a generation, one oculus, still worth the money if you have a tired meta  quest 2, questionable if you’re meta quest 2 is working well, and I think the Meta quest 3 is going to be the ticket, if you’re looking for future proof and all around better quality that you will be able to notice tremendously as well as less eye strain."
"I got this and started the initial set up. It got stuck on applying an update for over 24 hours. After contacting the manufacturer, they told me not to update using a phone and to use my pc to side load the update. This required me to go out and spend more money to buy and adapter so i could plug it into my pc. If you are buying this, save yourself time and headache, buy a usb to usbc adapter piece and do initial update through pc not phone. Ive spent 4 days getting the update to work and my kids were so sad they couldn't play with it when it arrived."
I understand wanting to make more money by selling a superior strap separately but it’s unacceptable the one it comes with is so trash. A saving grace is it’s priced very reasonably. The sides are more noticeable than I thought they would be so if that bothers you I’d recommend the original 3.
My item was delivered not in an Amazon box but in the plain product box so anyone could see what it was!!! Not protected at all. Then it was delivered to the wrong address!!! Luckily I have good honest neighbors. For a pricey item you figured they would take the time to protect it in a box and deliver to the correct address!!!!!!
"I've been an avid VR user for over 4 yrs, buying my own Quest 3 from Amazon, without an issue. I own 2 Quest 2 headsets as well. One is my 28 yr old daughter's... but now the Quest 2 is becoming obsolete... so, I bought her a Q3S as its such a more affordable option. It came extremely quickly!! Overnight!! I immediately went to set it up for her, but could barely make out any text on the screen. I searched for settings, but there are NONE... & there are no settings on the app either to adjust the display or frame rate.  I then clicked on the help button here on the Amazon app, and it instructed me to change the settings on the app. THOSE settings are obviously meant for the Quest 3! NOT the 3S. So I kindly advise Amazon and/or Meta to change those instructions ASAP!  My daughter has very poor vision to begin with, & wears very high rx glasses. I gave it to her to try it out for herself. She gave it back & told me to return it immediately. Very upsetting, being that she & I love using our Quest headsets. But now I'm going to have to just get her a Quest 3...or just wait till her Quest 2 dies & see what new headset is put by then. I have a friend who also just purchased a 3S and has the same issue with blurriness...and is also returning hers. Ive spoken to 2 other people with the same issue. Maybe we all got Lemons? Idk.  Thank god Amazon has 0% financing available, which meta has as well on its website..  but purchasing ANYTHING from Amazon is superbly better, by far, than any other platform online, simply due to its next day delivery & extremely easy return policy! For that I do commend Amazon! Hopefully Meta can recall any blury headsets now and correct the issue, or give new replacement headsets. I've heard the majority of the vr community who bought the 3S  have had fantastic results. So.. who knows."
"There's no privacy when using the headset. You can't plug in headphones, so I guess you have to use Bluetooth? That means another device I have to have in order to play.I thought upgrades were supposed to be better, easier to use.The images are really nice, so far.It's still updating to the latest version.Just have to wait and see if it's worth it."
We ended up getting it . It took hours to download the update then had an error message that said the device was corrupted. Sent it right back. I should not have to factory reset a “new item”
"I'm very impressed with this device. Unfortunately, the one I received doesn't function properly. I'm returning it and buying a new one to see if I have better luck. Will update my review then."
I do not like that the battery of the head set is 2 hours max. if you buy add the battery headset.
"This is the third of the oculus headsets I have ordered for different members of the family. This one came with a promotional credit, but I still have not received it."
We were able to play this for about 4 days and then the screen went black and the light on thr side blinking fas red when charging. Meta customer service was great but it is frustrating after building account and getting it all set up to have to return it and get a new one.
"I was very happy, until I found a way cheaper price for the same thing."
I got it for my son for Christmas! I set it up and it’s nice
Product was supposed to come with a digital 100$ gift card never received it
