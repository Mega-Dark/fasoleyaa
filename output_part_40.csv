"Noisy, struggles to pump. Just seems as though Mr Coffee is poorly made compared to my early ones"
I have bought many Mr. Coffee machines and always had good performance for these little machines. However this morning I made my prep as usual turned it on and nothing. Absolutely nothing. So no coffee until I can afford to buy a new one. So disappointed.
"Other reviews have said the shutoff timer doesn't always go the full two hours before it shuts off.  I would confirm that with my unit.  It will go anywhere from 15 minutes to the advertised two hours.  The side opening lid is a poor design in my opinion as it drains water condensed onto the lid right into coffee basket tray and if there is not a pot on the burner the waster drains right onto the burner.  The older units with the back hinged lid drained into the water reservoir where it should.The biggest problem is getting the water filter discs (not the coffee filter).  I have contacted Mr. Coffee direct and the following is a direct quote from an email in reply to my inquiry: ""Right now, the parts for this model is still under with our planned products and we do not have any update when it will be available. The product was manufactured without any water filters yet and we're still on the process of planning of making the accessories but right now we cannot provide exact date about the availability.""  I copied and pasted that exactly as I got it!  Hard to believe they would offer a product with no availability of a part that requires periodic change - recommended monthly.  The filter with the frame can be purchased from Target for $4.99 but the frame isn't needed unless the one that came with the unit gets damaged (highly unlikely).  So somebody DOES make the disc but apparently only for the OEM at this point.  Based on the Amazon price for the larger filter discs that fit the higher capacity coffee makers, the filter disc for the 5 cup unit should cost $.50 or less."
"Product did not come with everything shown, and listed. The filter screens did not come with it."
"I had a 4-cup model (same brand) that I liked but which finally died. I would have gladly bought the same model again, but it's been discontinued for some time.So I bought this as the closest ""apples-to-apples"" replacement, but it's just not as good.Specifically:-Condensed water on the lid drips down unabated to the warming plate when you open the lid-Filter basket assembly can't accommodate the larger (5-cup) size - more regularly find grounds in the carafe and on the lid from overfilling or too-fast filling of filter basket-Buttons are too close to water paths, especially regarding my first ""con"" - afraid of condensation running out and over the buttons and shortcircuiting the whole machineIt's an adequate coffee maker, but when it dies I'm definitely not getting the same again (and will probably more strongly consider other brands)."
"It's not a bad coffee maker but the entire thing is for right handers!!! Since when does the top of a coffee maker open from left to right, getting in the way when pouring your water. I have to switch the pot to my right hand just to pour in the water. So dumb. It's also really loud and makes noise well after pouring your first cup."
"Yes, us lefties are confronted by another right-handed bigot (lol). I received this coffee maker as a gift. It replaced a smaller four-cup Mr. Coffee I had used for years. Generally, I like it. With two exceptions. Whoever designed designed this product is right handed. The lid rotates to the left when opened instead of to the back like the smaller four-cup I used before. The lid blocks a left handed person from pouring in water to adding coffee. The other issue will be annoying even to right handed people. The arm that dispenses hot water over the grounds is situated too low if you use a standard paper filter. It automatically swings into place when you close the lid using the paper filer aside so that a mess is created in the basket. UG!Also, the coffee maker does not come with instructions. At first I didn’t understand about the pre filter apparatus. The online instructions for this model do not exist. Perhaps Mr. Coffee with catch up with the instructions someday."
I bought this coffee maker jan 2022. It's worked great. My only complaints are it starts brewing and then shuts off and I only notice it when I go to get my coffee and there's only 1c when I poured 4 cups. 2nd complaint it will turn off right after brewing so I have to turn it back on so my husband can have hot coffee when he wakes up. It sometimes turns off before the 2 hour shutoff. My last issue is in order to get 4 cups of coffee I have to fill the carafe to 5 cups line. If I don't fill it to almost 5 and only to 4 I'll get 3 cups of coffee. Other than those 3 things it works great!
"I had an older model which I loved but I accidentally dropped the carafe and it broke. I couldn't find a replacement, so had to order a new one or pay twice as much for the original one. Anywho, I purchased this one which basically had all of the same basic features. I have a couple of issues though. I do not care for the lid opening on the side, instead of front to back, but this is just a preference thing. If you pour with your left hand though, it will be pretty inconvenient for you because it opens right to left. The second thing is that regardless of the order that I take the used coffee grounds out (I use my own filters) and pour the water into the pot, water always drips onto the burner from the dispenser part. I never had this issue with the old one but it's annoying that I have to wipe it off every time before I use it again. It might seem small but I'm trying to avoid starting a new pot with water sizzling while it's brewing. The last thing is that, while I didn't think I'd mind, the piece that dispurses the water onto the coffee grounds needs to be moved back and forth when removing the grounds. My old one was built into the lid. I wouldn't care so much but I still am using the rest of my old filters which are too tall, even though the number of cups/size of pot is the same as the old one. These may all seem small, but I think worth noting for those considering the purchase."
"Drip coffee is fine for me and Mr Coffee is usually a reliable brand. I've had this one two years. It has always had a glitch: it turns itself off sometimes, and not always at the same place in the cycle. Sometimes I turn it on, and it turns itself back off when I turn away. Other times it's a minute or two into the cycle or near the end. It's aggravating, but not terribly important since my life is no longer rush, rush, rush. I was just unfortunate to get a rare one with a glitch."
"There are several things that disappoint about this coffee maker. So bad, I'll not be buying this brand again.1. The filtering system is a mess. In my opinion, trash it all and use a small paper filter available here on Amazon, Walmart, or elsewhere.2. The fill level is towards the back. Annoying because you have to twirl the coffee maker around so you don't over-fill.3. The timer does not work most of the time.  Ideally, you set it to start brewing before you get up in the morning,  but it is erratic and doesn't always work. Also, no battery, so even a brief power outage will render this feature useless.4. The on-off switch is the worst. You turn it on and leave your coffee to brew. You come back later and have no coffee. It has shut itself off for no known reason. The same is true when you leave coffee in the carafe to warm. Half the time it shuts off, so you'll need to warm it up with your microwave.The coffee tastes okay, but I hate the idea of babysitting this thing. This is a poorly designed, poorly made product in my experience. I regret my purchase."
I like to make a large pot of coffee in the am.  This  one is way too small.
Liked the size but the coffee is not hot enough.
"I purchased the 5 cup Mr. Coffee maker (inc. water filtration system) and received  it on Sunday, Sept 29th. I realized when the coffee maker arrived the box had been open and resealed. I took the coffee maker out of the box; it had the new 2” charcoal filter; and associated filtration system components. There was no manual (I now was sure the system had been repacked).I went online to purchase paper filters and additional charcoal filters and found Mr. Coffee no longer offered the filters as an accessory. On Sunday, I emailed Mr. Coffee Customer care and left a message, I received a confirmation email (46560555) requesting the manufacturer of the 2” charcoal filter. On Monday I called customer care and waited online for 20 minutes before hanging up.It's been three days with no response, and I have searched the web for the filter manufacturer with no luck.The total lack of customer service and the inability or lack of support to order additional accessories; This machine is being returned. I am a long time Mr. Coffee customer NO MORE!"
"The flavor of the coffee is good, a bit strong so I switched to paper filters which is more to my preference.  BUT, I think I will be returning the item because it shuts off much too quickly.  It says it has auto shut-off after two hours, and that is the most important feature for me.  I can't always get back to the coffee maker (I work from home), so I need one that shuts off in a reasonable amount of time.  But for two days in a row, this has shut off WELL before 2 hours have passed.  This morning, it was shut off in less than 45 minutes, and based on how cold the coffee was, my guess is it shut down immediately after brewing.I read a few reviews saying they had similar issues.  I wish I'd paid more attention to those reviews.If you don't need it to stay on for a certain amount of time, then I would recommend this.  It makes good coffee, is easy to use and easy to clean.  But if you want a warm 2nd cup after 30 minutes, I would not recommend."
When did a cup become only 5oz. Make sure to read the product description. Makes only 2 standard size cups. Sending back.
"Just got the replacement I bought because I dropped the glass container and it broke. So I ordered the same modle and one of the filter leg was broken. I have the old one so it's not a problem for me, but if I didn't this would suck. Other than that I really like this coffee maker."
"No matter how much water I pour in, I always get 1 cup less of coffee. This morning I poured in 4-1/2 cups of water and got a little less than 3-1/2 cups of coffee. I’ve had this pot less than a month and am thinking about returning it."
"If you do 5 cups the coffee grounds will overflow and go into your coffee. If you use the basket your coffee will be weak. I tried with 4-5 cup size paper filter which collapse on it self. So will try the bigger size coffee filter; if that helps then I will give more stars but if it doesn't work I will send this supposedly 5 cup coffee maker back. This thing only makes 3 cups of weak coffee with the basket. I liked Mr. Coffee's older 5 cup version, they don't make them anymore."
This coffee pot set programmable it's only programmable to set it for the morning it has no clock on it it also does not fill five cups of coffee as stated it feels only four I'm not happy with the product but I'm going to keep it and search for something else
The coffee maker works fine.  Finding replacements for the charcoal filter has proven difficult.  The filters are smaller than the filters for a 12 cup so the filters available on Amazon don't fit.  I contacted the manufacturer and was referred to a replacement that can only be purchased with the plastic piece that holds the filter.  Purchasing two of those parts would exceed the purchase price of the coffee maker in two months so not very cost effective.  Fortunately the coffee maker will work without the filter.
"I love Mr.Coffee machines and my last one lasted nearly 10 years. I only drink two cups a day so I had to replace my 4 cup machine when it finally malfunctioned. This 5 cup seemed like the best option as there are no 4 cup makers and I don’t have the space nor need a 10-14 cup maker. I wanted the auto feature to brew in the mornings and loved the 2 hour window that the plate would keep your coffee hot should I not need all the coffee all at once. However, I’ve had this item a month now and found the machine off under the 1 hour mark about 4 or 5 times now. Twice now it’s turned off just after a minute with no coffee made at all. I end up having to press the button again and then it brews but it’s a bit unreliable. I either have to microwave any extra coffee to warmIt up again or if it doesn’t brew either rebrew or go without if I don’t have time wait and leave for work."
"There's a stark contrast between the product description's promise of 'pure, great tasting coffee every time' and the reality of the coffee it produces. Despite using the same ground coffee, the flavor profile was notably diminished when using this machine compared to a manual pour-over method. It is unacceptable and I wouldn't want to drink the coffee produced by this machine. I am returning it after two uses. Maybe I should try more and give it a chance to prove otherwise, because it is a cute little well-designed product. But I decided not to take a chance."
I bought this mainly for company. haven't used it yet. I do not drink coffee so waiting for guests that do..lol. seems simple to use
I've been trying to get a 5 cup coffee maker that you can read the time on it and this came close.  There is a debate whether the numbers light up or if they are backlit.  Well the numbers are black so they don't light up but at least I can read them.Now to the to the quality.  I think it's made ok except for the lid.  The lid I don't believe will last very long. Very flimsy.  Quality of coffee isn't the greatest.  I ran vinegar through it twice and ran clear water through it twice and the coffee had a burndt taste even after that.  So after several brews that went away but the taste still isn't the best.  Since 2016 I've had a Mr Coffee 5 cup (model CGX7) and I loved it but wore 2 of them out and now you can no longer get it.  It even had numbers that actually lit up.  SO COME ON MR COFFEE BRING THAT MODEL BACK!
This pot was fine. Easy to use and clean. but just this morning it just stopped working. No heat on plate and not water being passed through the coffee... In other words nothing is working.. Will have to buy a new one.  All lookes good but not working..
"I could have given this a 4 start because what features are just ok to me are probably fine to others.  What I like:  totally quiet!  Love that.  No loud beeping when it's finished brewing.  Compact, fits on my counter nicely and can be tucked away easily.  It's very easy to fill with water, it's very easy to scoop the coffee into the filter basket.  What took me a few tries before I got it right.... How much coffee grounds to measure into a 5 cup coffee maker.  They base the cup size on a 5oz. cup of coffee, who drinks a regular cup of coffee and only has 5oz.?  I was always measuring for a 6oz - 8oz. cup with my old machine.  Do a little math or just wing it till you get a good taste.  There weren't really any guidelines in the box.  It's not rocket science, but some suggestions/guidance would have been helpful."
Love the less coffee due to 1 mug a day
The size of the pot is supposed to be 5 cups. We are lucky to get 2 cups from it. It would be nice to travel with.
"For a full pot in my previous Mr. Coffee unit of this same size, I always used 3 scoops (tbsp) of grounds. The coffee was perfect.If I put 3 scoops in the ""permanent filter"" of this unit, it overflows during the brew. The overflow carries grounds into the filter basket, and straight into the pot.If I don't waste the last of the pot, I get a mouthful of coffee grounds in my final swig. Yum.I've taken to using paper filters instead, but they don't really fit very well. I use the permanent filter as a form to press a paper filter neatly into the filter basket.Even then, the water arm catches on the paper filter, so you have to swing it into place by hand, and push the filter back into place after the arm is in place. (See photo)But hey, after that hassle every time you brew, the coffee is terrific! And it's possible that everything would be ducky if one were to use two, not three, scoops to make a pot.But dammit Jim, a man's gotta have standards!P.S.: I'm fortunate to have world-class water where I live, because that goofy water purifier thingy is a bad joke. When, out of curiosity, I tested it (with the permanent filter of course), coffee saturated—and seriously stained—the pad on the first run; reusing it even once would be unappealing."
"Buyer beware. If the Mr. Coffee Charcoal Filter disk is an important feature to you, then do not buy this mini 5-cup model. The disk for this machine are an odd size that is smaller than the standard size Mr. Coffee filters and you won’t be able to find the 5-cup size charcoal anywhere online or in the retail stores. I wish I would have returned mine. Too bad. I sure liked that feature on my other Mr.Coffee machines. Mr. Coffee's Product support is awful. They like to keep “an arms’ distance” from their customers. I will change my review if I can ever find the Charcoal filters for my 5-cup mini coffee maker."
When received from this seller ot did not include the reusable basket or filter.
"Lasted a year, electronics work but brewing function stopped working 1 week outside of warranty. This can’t be a coincidence."
"Easy to program for a later start but the coffee tastes like metal. I even changed coffee brands to see if it was the coffee, no it's the coffee maker. I got out the old Mr. Coffee maker and tried making another cup to see if the metal taste was there and the coffee was good. Once the metallic taste is in your mouth it lingers. I always trusted Mr. Coffee, now am skeptical."
This NEW coffee pot came in a plain brown box. It makes me skeptical that it is not new. The instructions were one page and not helpful at all. I also have one part that I’m not sure what it is or where it goes. I have however used it twice and it did function properly. At least a Mr Coffee box may have helped me with the “spare” part . I’m not very happy about this purchase I do feel that the product was not new. Again the instructions for making the pot programmable are Horrible
"This replaced another small Mr Coffee I purchased a few years ago, that finally died. What I specifically liked about the last one was the size, 5 cups, and the delay brew feature, for a reasonable price. I scored the last one on a Black Friday deal, only $20. This one seems decent, but I'm less a fan of the side hinge top and the water spout inside swinging forward and back. The previous design, with the water attached to the lid was far better. It will do for now, but I wish my previous one hadn't broken.UPDATE: I am far less a fan of this machine. The last version could use larger filters 8-12 cup style even though it was a 5 cup machine, so it was easy to find the unbleached natural style. The cup in this is tiny and really needs 5 cup specific filters but they are difficult to find if you want them unbleached, even on Amazon. The machine comes with a reusable cup and silly water filter, which will never really dry if used daily. These two are horrible, and any time I make 5 cups of coffee the grounds flow over the edges. (Note: I added a bit of spice to my coffee when making the brew in the picture which is why the grounds look like brown and weird). Anyway, the side hinge too is really undesirable. I am now actively looking to replace this machine. It is very disappointing."
"In mid-January of 2023, I needed to replace a Black & Decker that I'd used for 20+ years until it died. I bought this one, because it had decent reviews for devices at the price point, functionality and size I wanted. Today, like some other reviewers, I found that my coffee maker would not heat. The brew now/later buttons light, but that's about it. Note that I didn't even use it daily, mostly for weekends and the 20-25% of the work week that I work from home. As I'm not a huge coffee drinker, I used it to brew tea. Needless to say, my next coffee maker will not be a Mr. Coffee; while I can't expect everything to last 20 years, it needs to last AT LEAST one. Heck, give me two or three!Before submitting this review, I attempted to file a warranty claim, but the Mr. Coffee site did not list my device model and did not like the supplier code I found on the prong of the plug. Next!"
"We've bought three of these Mr. Coffee 4-5 cup coffee makers over the years.  The first lasted around 3-4 years, we replaced it with a different one when the pot broke and we couldn't find a replacement pot.  The second one lasted around a year before the heating element gave out.  We're now on our 3rd, and they are the perfect size for our small family and kitchen.  Unfortunately, the design just keeps getting worse and worse.  The first one had a bright green LED that you could see from across the room.  The second one had the same LED but it did not light up.  This redesigned model the LED is flat and nearly impossible to see.  Also the buttons are easy to accidentally press when sliding the pot in (because of the flat, instead of sloped design), and the ""window"" to see how much water you've put in is on the right side (earlier models had the window on both sides).  Being on the right side only means we can't see it, because that's right next to our fridge.Overall this coffee maker works fine.  It makes five cups, which is exactly how much we need.  It's just disappointing how they've changed the design over the years.  Almost like they don't listen to their customers and just keep making it more and more frustrating to use.  They should bring back the green LED, sloped front, and water level window on both sides."
"Overall, I like the coffee machine. I especially like that you don't have to buy filters. However, due to the small basket size, it can't accommodate a 'whole pot' of decaf coffee, due to the expansion of the decaf coffee. You'll either need to brew even smaller batches, or you should buy a bigger coffee machine.Otherwise I like it. Although finding replacement filter discs is somewhat difficult."
Love the size since I only have a couple cups in the am it is perfect. The only issue is it drips water during preparation onto the warming plate and you have to wipe it up.
Worked well for about 6 weeks and then wouldn't brew anymore. It just quit working.
Worked fine for 1 year. Then just stopped working.
"Nice coffee pot. Perfect for single person or space saver for those who don't drink a lot of coffee. Percolate a bit loud but given the design of inside system, it is built like older styles of coffee pots meant to last. Recommend to use filter it comes with to keep coffee contained and water disperse even over your grounds. If you are looking for quiet coffee maker and faster, do not buy. If it won't bother you, it's worth it. Does take a bit longer to make, but, if you use auto brew feature then set it for maybe 15 minutes before you are ready for your coffee, it is useful. Love it, but, could be better for noise and pace of coffee brew. Despite these things, I like it enough not to return."
"The lid opens to the left which makes pouring the water difficult for a left handed person--me.  Also, after brewing and opening the lid, condensed water comes down from the lid, then onto the basket, and ends on the burner.  If done just prior to brewing one must dry the water or listed to it boil away once the power is turned on.  The coffee makes is good, just didn't think there was much of a drill to get it going."
"This coffee pot does everything I bought it to do and it makes a great cup of coffee.  What it doesn't have is a shut-off timer.  There has been more than one occasion where I've left it on only to come back to a horrible odor and coffee burned to the bottom of the carafe.  I give it only three stars mostly because I was asked to rate the coffee maker machine, not the guy that actually makes the coffee.  He would have suffered a much more critical review."
"I started having trouble with my old faithful of more than a decade, and when I checked Amazon I found this ""new, improved"" version for a lower price. It was during the pandemic, and I was desperate for easy coffee, so I got it.Three months later I accidentally broke the carafe / decanter.No problem, I thought... It's a new product, so I should be able to order a replacement on line. What a stupid thought that was....It's been more than TWO years, and I have YET to find a replacement decanter for sale anywhere, not even from the company that makes it.My advice? DON'T BUY IT if you are human and have ever broken a glass or ceramic item.The coffee it made was not any better than my original, and my original had an ergonomic design that fit my counter. This new one is too tall, and the cord is in the wrong place, so I can never both plug it in and read the display.I wish the makers would bring back  the old 5 cup maker design and sell it again. I could always find another carafe if I broke mine. Plus that design was  remarkably effective at brewing just enough coffee for 1 or 2 people and keeping it hot for an hour."
"I like this pot I get more flavor than I did with my single cup Keurig. My complaint is that they advertise it as 5 cups but it's not 5 cups. I measure out 3 cups of water with a liquid measuring cup, and it's full to the 5 cup mark in the water reservoir! And then it only brews to the 4 cup line in the pot. 2 cups in the pot is the equivalent of one normal size coffee mug - which is not 16 oz!Also you can't even put enough grounds in for 5 cups because the basket will overflow and you'll have grounds in your coffee."
"First time using the carafe it cracked. Glass is so thin!they replaced the whole thing instead of just the carafe, but you better handle it super gently because it’s not made of sturdy glass or plastics like other brands I’ve used. Extremely FRAGILE!!!  Beware!!!"
"I kept it but one side of the top is broken so it doesn’t clip on to the machine, other then that works fine"
"Loved this coffee maker - I had the same one in college that lasted all 4 years. Due to the outstanding track record and longevity of its predecessor I figured going with the same machine was the right call. Unfortunately I purchased in early September of 22' and it has completely stopped functioning by the end of Feb 23'. The ""brew now"" button seems to be jammed and unresponsive and when I tried to work around this issue by using the ""brew later"" function the coffee failed to brew at the selected time. (this function has been used several times and worked up until the the brew now button locked up) Not sure what the issue is here, I took good care of the machine and cleaned it often. Overall I am disappointed with the the lack of longevity of this coffee maker. I plan on switching to the Pour Over method moving forward.Hope this helps!"
"Gifted for Father’s Day in June, non-functional just under 5 months later. Apparently there’s a safety fuse that may have tripped but isn’t easy to get to (and that may or may not be the issue). Maddening. *Was great while it worked."
"Only 3 months old and the heating element is failing, so the coffee is watery and pale. I like the size since I'm the only person in the household drinking coffee, but I will probably be getting some other brand."
"Like that its small,4 cups. Just right for me. However CAN'T FIND the replacement filters anywhere. (Need new filter every month) no one sells the sml size filter.  I don't need a bigger size coffee pot. Only thing I am disappointed with."
I can't believe this coffee maker was put in a shipping box without the product box.  It was supposed to be a gift.  Just in plastic bag in the shipping box.  Not very happy.
"I purchased this back in December and it works fine. My only issue is that if you want to replace the water filter each month as they recomend this is very difficult. after attempting to find the repacements for some time i finaly contacted the company and recieved the response ""I understand you want a replacement filter, and we regret to inform you that the filter is already obsolete and the only one available is the water filtration disk with holder"" so if you want to replace it you have to spend $10 for the filter and holder from an outside company. Oh and did i mention that with that outside company what you will find is ""Factory Backorder Date Available: Unknown""  what is most disturbing is if you go to the official MrCoffee website they stll are listing this model being sold despite as they put it replacement parts are obsolete."
Only had it for a few days it was working fine. But this morning went to plug it in and out just died. Tried different outlets in my kitchen and nothing. Very Very Disappointing.
I wanted to like this little guy.  The size and features were perfect but the taste was horrific.  Plastic taste persisted after numerous washings and pots made.  I could only stomach a couple sips before the smell would make me nauseous.  Wasted a lot of time trying to clean out the the taste/smell and some good coffee grounds too.
Simple and To the point
"....this, ""Mr. COFFEE"" product DID NOT come with original packaging, and ONLY with plug in safety instructions. It did not come with assembly instructions nor with weren't, which comes with, ""Mr. Coffe"" products. You can figure it out but... the issuing Company/ Corp./Seller should let A CUSTOMER know if this is a third party/ 4th party Seller advertising a product, WITHOUT COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS or MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS."
"I've always used a mr. coffee 5 cup programmable machine - it is perfect for my needs.  I had black/chrome model for years and we had a carafe mishap - and rather than have to spend $19.99 for a replacement carafe (ridiculous!) - I opted to try this model.  It looked like a smaller footprint and I took a chance.  Should have returned it right off, it felt ""cheap"" as soon as I took it out of the box - but alas, I needed my coffee.....The mesh basket tended to get ""splashy"" and every day I had grounds in my coffee.  Yay for eco-friendly, boo for coffee quality.  One day the ""flow stopper"" above the pot got stuck, and all the water anf grounds were floating in the basket.  When trying to clean the hot mess (literally) over the sink to rinse everything out, the flip top hinge cracked.  That was two days ago and I ordered a new maker (different brand) that day.  Of course this morning I checked my account to start a return and my window closed yesterday - just figures :-(.I think I've used mr. coffee makers all of my adult life but time to check out the competition."
"It does what I expect it to do. I've read several reviews about it quitting in mid-brew or shutting off sooner than expected. Mine hasn't started those shenanigans yet. The carafe is marked as a 5-cup pot. I get two regular cups out of it. I'm guessing they mean the tiny espresso cups. So, as of Dec. 25, 2020, that is the only complaint and I'm not gonna take a star just for that. Thank you Mr. Coffee!10/23/21 Update: OK, it has stopped mid-brew a few times and shut off way before the two hour limit. As for calling itself a 5-cup coffee maker, I finally proved to myself and share with you the actual measurements! If Mr. Coffee was on trial, his word would mean nothing!! 😄 Of course, it doesn't help that I drink out of a larger than normal cup. I still think it's a great little brewer, just needs to change the markings on the carafe to show true amounts."
Nice size for one person but the brew now and brew later lights stayed lit and It would not work. Even tried to trouble shoot the issue on YouTube. Plugged unplugged. Searches for a reset button I never did find. Finally it reset itself but It went a week unusable. I almost threw it out!! Would not repurchase.
"First off, the coffee maker is really good. I upgraded from one that didn't have a self starting feature.I love that handy little addition that lets me wake up to fresh coffee. It's pretty self explanitory, thank goodness, because the directions are kind of trash.The suuuuuuuuuuper crappy part about the product is that trying to get replacement parts is pretty much a kick in the privates.I dropped my carafe and the plastic bit broke. I tried to look online for replacement handles. It is literally one screw holding it all on. But no. You won't find any. So I thought to myself, ""well, I guess I could just get a replacement carafe.""You can in fact get a new carafe. FOR 20 DOLLARS PLUS EXORBITANT SHIPPING.That's trash. Thank god for guerrilla tape. Get you some guerilla tape. Consider this a 30 star review for guerilla tape. LoL."
It works but gets coffee grounds all over the place as well as in your coffee.
This coffee maker is a big disappointment.I thought the Mr.Coffee name was all I needed to get a good product Well not the case.Coffee drips on the hot plate all the time and the fill lines on the maker and pot are very hard to read
"I use this when I travel instead of using hotel units..yuck. Makes STRONG coffee, so don’t add a tablespoon of coffee for every cup made unless you want coffee strong enough to stand a spoon in. The problem is that every time I try to pour a cup, coffee DRIPS everywhere. I’ve tried to pour at different angles, but still coffee drips heavily everywhere. I now pour over a sink."
I’ve had Mr Coffee brand coffee makers in the past and always liked them.  I would have used it to make coffee every morning.
This coffee maker takes up less space and is lighter in weight.  The paper filters supposedly made for this unit are too big and the filter discs are not even available as far as I can tell so I don't know how long I'll be able to use it.  I've been washing it off but it's not going to last forever and it needs that filter.  The coffee tastes fine- we'll see when it doesn't have 1 of the filters. I have to throw out the last couple of ounces of coffee because it has grounds in it from the filter not fitting properly.  I wouldn't buy this again even though I don't need a bigger one and this one is easier for me to handle.
"I have no problems with the coffee maker (other than a lack of a User Manual that tells me how it all fits together) but it's not ready for the marketplace.  You cannot purchase replacement parts for them as of the end of September 2020, so should I get klutzy and break the carafe, I need a whole new machine.  Same for the brew basket or the cute little swing-away water system...The manufacturer's website labels these as a new product.  Okay, but we need to be able to find replacement parts before these get rushed to market.It has all the minor shortcomings of every Mr. Coffee coffee-maker I've ever owned, but I'm used to them and they don't bother me.  It makes a couple of cups of good-tasting coffee.Mr. Coffee just needs spare parts in inventory.  Until then, wait a while before buying one."
"If you try the bigger filter that does not fit this demo machine, your coffee will taste like dish soup and plastic. Waste of money."
"I bought this coffee maker because I work from my home office and like bolder coffee than my roommate buys. I get about two cups from the pot with my 12oz mug. I went out and bought #2 filters because I got tired of washing out the reusable and it works fine.There's nothing special about this coffee maker. It has a ""Brew Later"" with a timer and a ""Brew Now."" That's really about it and it's fine for a single person, but I wouldn't suggest this for more than 1-2 people or if you want more from a coffee maker. My only complaint is the cord is too damn short, so unless you're putting this on a kitchen counter close to an outlet, plan on buying a small extension cord."
"I’ve always liked Mr Coffee products so when my most recent coffee maker died, I went with the programmable 5-cup Mr Coffee machine. Setting it up for the first time I realized you have to move the hot water nozzle EVERYTIME you make a pot of coffee.Not sure whose genius idea this was, but it’s crazy that you have to move the hot water nozzle to fill or remove the coffee basket. CRAZY. How on earth this got approved is beyond me, but it’s a critical design flaw."
"Compact. Has extra filter which I didn't realize and like this a-lot.UPDATE - 3 months later - the water filter is worn out and needs to be replaced and NO ONE carries the smaller disk filters for the 5-cup models.  NOT EVEN MR COFFEE.  They refer you to part #2135683 which amazon does not carry, nor does Walmart, nor Target and when you google the part number it takes you back to Mr Coffee website where they are answering questions about it, saying they don't carry it and here's the part number for you to buy where Mr Coffee products are sold!!  Still like the pot itself but you can really taste the difference without the filter."
"No matter how many times I clean this, my coffee has a metal taste. Didn't test it before the return window closed. :("
The water does not pump through the coffee. This is my first use. It’s sputtering and causing grounds to overflow into the coffee. It’s going back. Never again on this brand for me.
Used for 3 months and then it stared leakng from the back wat Her reservoir. Had to throw it away..past teturn time.
"We have been using the Mr. Coffee for over a month now.  If you fill it and brew now immediately, it works fine and we have been enjoying using it.  But this past week, we have tried using the brew later feature.  The water leaks out all over the counter, if the coffee is not brewed immediately.  The first time, we set it up the night before and found the water all over in the morning.  We tried it again, and the same thing happened.  Then, we waited just an hour to press brew, and the water had started leaking out.  So, if you like the brew later setting, or just setting up the pot the night before then this does not work."
Bought for my 98 year old mother.  Worked perfect for 6 months and now not heating up at all.  Never had a coffee maker go bad this quick.
I purchased 2 of them.  One was for a gift and the other one was for me.  Unfortunately the one that I gifted leaked all the water out from the bottom.  Mine works great and has great flavor.  I would give it a 5 if the other one wasn’t leaking.
The basket is very small. I have to cut down the 4-cup size paper filter to fit. Since there was no owners manual included (and I couldn’t access one online) I’m unsure about the small circular filter for the top. It is messy and hard to clean… and noisy to operate.
"Only 8 months out of her, too bad I through old one out caused it looked nasty ,Sucks not  having that  morning cup to new  one comes."
"A quick background – My home is completely automated via Alexa, having every iteration of Echo device made, from the first echo dot through the echo show 15. I have everything, from major appliances to all my window blinds, security cams, security system, ALL plugs, switches, etc. working through Alexa. I can troubleshoot issues that even their own techs can’t seem to solve. Point being, I know how to setup and use smart devices.My relationship with Keurig is a love/hate one. I loved my first Keurigs and was excited when they first came out with ones that included the frother. Unfortunately, the first models with frothers were literally useless. Their weird magnetic system to froth simply did not work, though I continued to use it until it died a fairly quick death immediately upon warranty expiration. Not learning my lesson, I replaced it with the same machine. Seeing the forther worked no better, I bought a separate frother to use with the coffeemaker. Then I saw they came out with a new machine that not only had a whisk-type frother, but was also a “smart” machine that would integrate with my alexa devices. I grabbed one. Upon unpacking it, I quickly noticed that their was no user manual, though they were able to afford to include an expensive looking large color brochure which did nothing except to extol all the virtues of the machine (more on that coming).I immediately got the new machine turned on to try to make just a simple cup of coffee to test it. Nope. Can’t do. Have to download the Keurig app and set it up before any use. So, got the app on my phone and went through the initial setup to my wifi quickly and easily. Then got to the setup with alexa part. The Keurig app directed me to the Alexa app automatically, explaining firt to simply follow the instructions when it opened the Alexa app. WRONG! It just opens the Alexa app to its main home with nothing about connecting to the Keurig. Fine. I went to devices to add it manually. Keurig isn’t even listed under the coffeemaker category. So, had to enter it manually and finally got the two to connect.At the same time, decided I’d better find a user manual and finally found a so-called one at the Keurig site. 8 pages long, with a scant half a page on operating ALL the features. Over a page on troubleshooting, however. The rest was basically useless fluff and filler. One of the first things I wanted to try out was the frother. The front of the frother has, what appears to the naked eye to be one button with a large “K” covering most of it and a vey thin, almost unnoticeable line above it. The phone app offers no help on operation at all. The manual just had a microscopic pic of just the thin line. Finally, with a magnifying glass, was able to see that what appeared to be just one button was one piece of rubber with a very, very thin indentation line between the line and the “K” on the one button. The very small space that contains the line is what controls the heat level of the frother, from cold to very hot, which in turn, controls the amount of froth. Am still figuring out the right amount of liquid to use to get my desired volume of froth, but that will come. So far, it’s okay, though not yet near the level of my separate frother.As for the actual coffeemaker, again it’s a love/hate. It reads the pod you put in, including the universal pods, which aren’t included, and jumps to default settings for temp, strength, etc for that type of pod and coffee. However, those weren’t the settings I wanted. But, it does allow you to preset up to 10 “Favorites” settings. However, that involves going back to the phone app to setup. That took a little figuring out, as the main purpose of the phone app seems to be to puch recipes and settings I would never use. Finally got 3 “Favorites” set for our different likes. With that done, brewing is fairly easy. Insert whatever pod, wait for the machine to read it and jump to its default settings, then click “Favorites”(which does not light up as an option) scroll through to the one I have preset and finally hit the “K” button to brew. I must admit, I am pleased with the actual improvement over the end result of the coffee, enabled by the ability to set 5 different strength levels and 5 different temp levels. The end result is a definite improvement over the past machines. One last point, it cannot froth and brew at the same time (akin to walking and chewing gum). Am still not sure about the frother and may end up going back to my separate frother. Time will tell.Was also hoping that, like my previous 2 Keurigs with frothers, this one would include the same coupon for a decent -size assortment of pods for free. No such luck. It included a $3 off coupon. Guess all the money they spent to include the useless, basically marketing brochure used up the budget.In the end, I would only recommend this machine if you have a lot of patience to get it up and running to suit your personal needs. And finally, don’t expect much from the integration with Alexa. In my case, at least, it basically useless.EDIT 03/26/2023:It’s been about a month and a half now and I’m compelled to warn others to steer clear of this ill-conceived piece of trash! I’ll start with my main concern in my original review. I wasn’t happy with the initial results, but figured maybe it was me and it would just take some time to figure it out. After a week, I figured out it was worthless and went back to my separate electric frother. If you consider ‘froth’ to be slightly whipped liquid that is not much different than pouring warm cream into your coffee, it’s fine. But, if you expect froth to be, well, frothy, you won’t get it here.Next, it’s “SMART” features. Nothing smart about it. All a gimmick that doesn’t work half the time. When you put a pod in, the machine reads “Brew ID”, which its way of supposedly reading the type of coffee you have placed into it. While it goes through that process, which is required before you can brew, you just stand there waiting. About half the time, it just keeps spinning and blinking, whatever, for forever. I finally learned that, after a couple of minutes of this wasted time, you simply open the lid and re-close it and the machine magically all of a sudden recognizes your pod. A total waste of time.Now, onto a combo of Keurig’s own universal pods for use with your own freshly ground coffee, which also includes a review of their supposed customer service. After using the pods for a while, I awoke yesterday, only to find that the machine immediately read “no pod inserted” after I attempted to make my coffee. Tried again, same result. Since I bought 4 of the pods, I thought maybe the one had become defective after only 6 weeks, so tried all the others. Same result, which meant the machine would not make y morning coffee at all. This takes me to their customer service, whom I hoped could tell me what was wrong so I could actually get the machine to make my, now much-needed, morning coffee. As expected, I got an offshore rep, whom admitted she had never seen or used a Keurig machine. Took her 4 times to get my machine’s serial number correct. Explained the pod problem to her and she proceeded to go ito a monologue about properly cleaning the frother! As is the case with many companies’ offshore reps, they either don’t actually listen to the reason for you call or they simply don’t understand what you are saying. Once I finally got her to understand what the actual problem was, she instructed me to ‘reboot’ the coffeemaker! Unplug it and wait a minute or so, plug it back in and try again. Fortunately that worked and only took about 45 minutes on the phone to get there.All told, my morning cup of coffee took almost 1-1/2 hours to brew. I have been a Keurig customer and lover of their machines since they first debuted. But, as is the case with far too many companies, the prices continue to go up for a premium product that is now cheap garbage.If you care about either your time or your money, look elsewhere, even if you have loved Keurig in the past. They are no longer the same company or do they offer the same high-quality products and customer service. Downgrading to ONE star.FINAL UPDATE (05/29/23): Exactly 2 months after getting the machine, it died. Initially, offshore customer service was great, promising an immediate warranty replacement. However, they make you jump through hoops to get it. Then, it went south. First, they wrote to tell me it had been turned down because I hadn’t supplied everything they asked for, which to the letter I had. I responded with that fact and they went silent, but I did received a replacement within a few days, unannounced. Just one problem – the “new” replacement was dead on arrival. A call to customer service (offshore) only got me a promise of a callback the next day, a call that never came. I finally gave up. Sent them a scathing email, took a $250 loss and into the trash their “new” replacement went and I bought another brand, which turns out to be SO much better than the over-priced crap Keurig is selling these days. Still, over a month later have not heard a single word from Keurig, they simply don’t care. The new machine I now have, whose name sounds like a Japanese warrior, unbelievably outperforms the expensive Keurig garbage. After being a loyal Keurig customer since 2004, when they first entered the home retail market, they couldn’t even be bothered to respond to the fact that I ate the $250 for their garbage. Steer clear of Keurig at all costs. Chances are your new expensive machine will die VERY quickly or be dead right out of the box. And, you will get ZERO customer service and simply be ignored. Welcome to the new face of corporate America. Sad."
"Updated 11/21/22.1) I thought I wasn't pressing the 'K' bottom properly when I first got the unit, but it turns out that the unit fails to complete the brew process about 25% of the time.  It most often occurs when the unit hasn't been used in a while, such as first thing in the morning.  It literally says 'Brewing...' and makes some noises, quits, and says 'Enjoy'.  I had read the other reviews where people complained about this, and I can verify it is a widespread problem.  And no it does NOT need cleaning, my unit has only brewed about 40 cups so far.  And no it's no clogged, I'm using the water filter, wiping down the delivery jets and I even run a standard hot water rinse after I'm done with coffee for the day.  And yes, when it does work, water/coffee flow just fine.  It's bad engineering either via software or faulty pump/sensors.2)  The 'Brew ID' process is REALLY REALLY irritating.  It wastes a lot of time and doesn't work for off-brand cups.  It also doesn't seem to count them, even though it knows there is a cup in the brewer versus a hot water dispense, on the Keurig site for re-order.  Keurig really fubared the experience.  I don't know how it could be worse, other than if it doesn't brew coffee, like my complaint number 1, which could be related.This is a review of the 'Keurig K-Café SMART Single Serve Coffee Maker with WiFi Compatibility' on 11/8/22.  I state this because the way Amazon has this product setup, the reviews appear to be shared across the 3 current K-Cafe models available for purchase on a single product page.  Or at a minimum people seem to confuse which one in the selection before reviewing or reading reviews.Pros:- Combination coffee maker and frothier- Coffee maker is fast- Multi-stream technology works well - up to about 8 ounces- Build quality appears excellent- Frothier actually works - See Cons for some oddities, but not show stoppers.- Overall dimensions are not small, but really not large given the additional frothier.  I expected it to be bigger.Cons:- Can't brew and froth at the same time, probably because of power requirements exceeding 15 amps if it did.- Using old pods without brew ID technology delays brewing by about 10 seconds while it searches the Internet and tries to locate the pod manufacturer - in my case Jewel-Osco brand.- Drip stand is awkward. While it works once put together it feels like they could have engineered it better as it's loose and hard to align easily.- Frothier isn't dishwasher safe.  Here's a tip.  Rinse with water, add some more water and squeeze some soap into it, place in machine and run frothier with head and rinse when done.  I found that I don't need the lid while frothing so I just put that away in storage so that it's one less item to get dirty and need cleaning.- Frothier minimum is a lot, meaning you can't brew a 6 ounce cup of coffee and add frothed milk/creamer using the minimum as you will go over 8 ounces on the standard cup.  They expect you do do a 'coffee shot' when frothing for some reason.  The effectiveness of the frothier drops dramatically with the less you use.  Here's a tip.  I found that it froths acceptably if you add about 2/3 to the minimum line (which hides the bottom part of the wire agitator and its sloping wings, but leaves the top axle part that you use to remove/add visible).  This completely fills a 8 ounce coffee cup right to the top, but is manageable.- If you run the frothier in high heat mode more than once in succession you may notice it short cycles the additional times.  It appears that there is heat sensor in it that turns it off once it reaches a certain temperature.  Tip, if you want to run a second time because you left it too long, turn it to cold mode for subsequent frothing to prevent it from short-cycling.- Not unique to this unit, but K-cups aren't necessary great at brews over 8 ounces.  Your milage will vary depending on the manufacturer, but I found that anything over 10 ounces is just pouring lightly murky hot water into your cup.  This multi-stream technology won't fix this!- Unit is taller than my prior unit, a Mini. While it still fits and opens on the counter under the cabinet by itself, you won't be able to get a drawer underneath and open the pod door fully without smashing your nuckles.  Consider one of the drawers that is on wheels that you can pull out to brew if having a drawer underneath is important to you.Neutral:WIFI - Meh, it doesn't really do anything except attempt to discover you pod Brew ID and report back usage in order to aid in automatic pod replacement, if you have setup to do such on Keurig's website.  I have setup this up, but have not used enough of my current stock to have an opinion as of this review.  It would also be nice if they integrated reordering for cleaning products, like descaling, but alas it appears it can't do this at present from what I can tell.Unknown:- Reliability.  I've only owned the unit for a couple days, but it's working well and the build quality gives me hope.  I see several reviewers have had issues, but as it appears Amazon combined reviews for this unit with two others not sure which they apply to.  I will update this review if it fails.  Be sure to register you unit so you get the 12 month warranty, failure to do so could leave you angry and out a lot of money.  The good news is that the coffee maker side is identical to the other SMART brewers so hopefully Kuerig designed them well, or there will probably be a lot of angry customers and class action if they didn't given the commonality and number of buyers. As for the frothier, it can easily be replaced as the electronics, heater and motor are all self contained in the removable unit.  It's even available for purchase on Kuerig's site should it fail outside the 12-month warranty.Summary:Even though I listed a few cons above, I've still happy with this product and would buy again over others.  All single-serve coffee makers have issues, it's just understanding what is important to you and what's not.  If you looking at single-serve coffee makers AND either combined or separate frothier, you should definitely consider this product."
"I bought the machine in 2019 and it still is working well for my household to make coffee.  So it does make a good hot cup of coffee, but not at the correct temperature.  The first cup is only 165F and by the time you add your cream and sit down to drink it’s lukewarm.  After the 3rd cup it’s up to 180 which isn’t 185 but good enough.  First cup of the day can take up to 2 minutes to brew but all other cups are about 15 seconds.The frother has never worked.  Frankly I’m not sure how it should function ever.  The post is solid metal (male side) and the cup has a female solid metal side that fits over the post; neither pice of metal moves, not even by hand.  There’s a little plastic ring that looks like a watch gear (except plastic) that fit inside the cup.  The frother has two lines etched inside at the bottom of the cup for fill lines that are nearly impossible to read and know they exist.  There are 3 buttons that allegedly operate the frother.  However,  to date the most I’ve ever had is warm milk.  Based on everything I just described I have no clue why it would ever work.  I have a hand frother that has a whisk at the end, that does the job in seconds (bought at Williams Sonoma) with its high speed spinning action!  Thus, the main purpose I bought this unit (verses others at the same price point) is worthless!  Reading other reviews, I’m not alone, it’s a function that should have been recalled for its defect or at least given everyone a refund!  Now I have a huge machine wasting space on my counter, and I can’t even detach it!This machine doesn’t require 2.0, thank you!  This machine replaced my 2.0 which failed to read the pods more than it worked; we had cut off tops of those that worked to put over the failures, just to make a cup of coffee.  Let’s just say 2.0 was the Edsel of their line!  I have no issue with any pod nor using my own coffee.  The selections are from a shot, 6, 8, 10, or 12 oz cup.  You can select strong which does a better job at saturating the grounds and is like a Shot but just more, so it’s great for iced coffee or tea.  The negative is it doesn’t do the carafe so I have lots of pods aging away in my pantry.The cleaning isn’t the easiest.  If you have hard water, you may want to look around.  This reservoir is narrow and has a lot of ridges, edges, and curves that make it very difficult to get the hard water deposits off.  The clear plastic container, encourages the growth of algae in the reservoir and on the filter, even if you use the red or blue light.  Oh yeah, you have the ability to change the uplighting in the reservoir , however it appears to be cosmetic and not ultraviolet to clarify the water.  The reservoir holds a lot for our needs and we find we have to dump the water out and refill more than we experience an empty reservoir.  So it’s a great feature.  Run a blend of distilled vinegar (3:1) and water through; not straight vinegar because there’s a lot of plastic and pure distilled vinegar will ruin it.I can put my travel mugs under this as well as, my carafe from my old machine; it’s nice and tall.  I an also use an espresso cup but it will splash so I flip a regular cup upside-down and place the espresso cup on it.  My suggestion is that if you like HOT coffee, then the first cup you make should just be hot water, because it isn’t that hot.  This will also warm your cup up so that your coffee isn’t hitting a cold cup and chilling it right away.  Leave your cup get hot then dump it out and brew your first cup,  you’ll love it way better!  If you use a milk product too and like hot coffee then make sure your cup is hot and put the milk in first so that while it is filling it with hot coffee it is organically getting it hot verses shocking it with cold in the end.  For iced coffee, you can use the shot but I use the Strong button.  I fill my carafe with crushed ice and put my pod in, press strong and twelve, and then do another shot at the end with the same pod.  Stir and then pour over ice!  It’s great!Because of the frother not working for most people, I do not recommend this model, however it makes a good, rich cup of coffee pretty quickly; there are other models and This brand does seem to last!  They have a metal one now that looks really nice and is a counter space saver with temperature control too...so check it out!Note: I use Illy coffee, lavazza coffee, Bentley tea, and Ghirardelli-Chocolate-Premium-Indulgence.  Yeah I’m probably considered a coffee snob after 40 years of drinking the stuff I know what I like!  Half and half always in the coffee!"
"I have had my new whiz bang Keurig for less than 24 hours – it replaced my previous one which lasted a good many years – so I decided to go with the K-Café unit so I could make lattes and cappuccinos. I set it up last night washed the reservoir and the frother cup let them dry.  Then I filled the reservoir with water and placed in on the unit.  Once I turned the unit on it drew water into the unit itself and I topped off the reservoir before running 12 oz through the unit without a K cup to run any impurities out of the machine.I made my first cup of coffee and the unit performed beautifully . . . So far so good . . .  or so I thought.  I then decided to make a latte, put in a new K-Cup, 2% milk in the frother and pushed the latte button on the frother . . . it was supposed to beep, the button illuminate and then take three minutes or so to heat the milk and froth it.  Zip, Zero, Nada – I pushed the button again – no go.  I turned the machine off and on again then tried again – still nothing.  I called the number on the instruction supplied with the machine and spoke to Paula.  She asked if I had an account and offered to set it up for me since I did not have one.  (There is more to that story but I won’t bore you with it, there is enough ammunition ahead to accomplish that.)  She had me try different things, asked me a bunch of questions and decided when all was said and done that she would have to send me “an entire new frothing unit” and that I would also get instructions on how to replace that part of the unit as well.  She said I could call customer service if I had a problem.  OK great I thought I was done. Not so fast – I then get an email telling me” good things are coming your way.” – I opened it and was informed I was getting a new frother cup and lid – WHAT ? – The frother cup and lid were not the problem.  I was in the middle of something on my phone so decided to use the Keurig chat feature and got a virtual assistant, so I typed ""please get me a live rep"" – the virtual assistant replied with six people are ahead you and you will be connected in 3 minutes.  After several voice announcements telling me to be patient, as there were now only five people ahead of me and that it would be another few minutes, an hour had passed.  I finished my other call and redialed customer service. I spoke to a very polite young lady who said her name was “Sweet” she is based in the Philippines call center and was happy to help.  She listened to my saga and went away to investigate.  When she returned she said she saw the order for a new frother cup and lid and agreed that would not solve my problem.  She also stated that the machine frother unit was not detachable and that the entire machine would be replaced.  Here is all you have to do . . .1. Take a picture of the serial number on the side of the unit.2. Take a screen shot of the amazon invoice3. Take a picture of the machine itself with a piece of paper showing my name, the date, the reference number, which she was going to send me by email, in the picture.4. A picture of my birth certificate and my automobile pink slip.The last item I added – she didn’t really ask for it although I anticipated it.So, before I jumped through all those hoops, I called Amazon to request their help.  The automated assistant informed me that I would have to reach out to the seller since although I bought it THROUGH Amazon, and not directly FROM Amazon, I would have to contact the seller.  I repeated ""representative"" numerous times before I was connected to an Amazon representative.  In the middle of explaining why I was calling, I was suddenly disconnected.  SO NOW I’M PISSED – so I called customer no-service again and repeated “representative” again to the virtual attendant, (I was determined not to be made to go away a second time).I decided to keep my cool realizing the new rep, Norman was not at fault.  Norman explained that since it was purchased through Amazon that the seller should be willing to replace the unit and that he would contact them and ask them to contact me to resolve the issue.  I will keep Keurig corporate's solution in my back pocket just in case.So, what I have learned is sometimes you get a lemon.  And when you do get a lemon, unless you bought it - FROM - Amazon and not - THROUGH - Amazon, you will have to contact the third-party seller.  If you elect to contact the manufacturer be prepared for some rep to misidentify the problem and not fix the problem.  When you reach someone who can fix your problem, you may need to jump through hoops to prove to them you aren’t some con artist trying to score a free machine.Fair enough . . . I am told I should hear from the seller in two business days.  The silver lining is that I can make a regular cup of coffee while I wait to hear back. (I have a tendency to be a crankasauris without it.)  I hope I can give the seller 5 points for customer service when all is said and done. I don’t know where I can go to get the last frustrating six hours of my life back though.  I hope this helps you if you encounter problems with your new Keurig."
"⭐⭐⭐I purchased this Keurig early 2023, it is now mid 2024 and half of it still works. I know it's time consuming to make a whole pot of coffee, but I'd rather do that than have a little mold treat in my coffee every morning.✨PROS✨-Its a great coffee maker overall, using the standard K Cups.-This system has a feature where prior to brewing your cup, you can select 'STRONG' to make a stronger cup but I honestly don't taste the difference.-Great range of sizes, 6oz, 8oz, 10oz, and 12oz.-Compatible with espresso K Cups where you can select a shot.-And of course, the latte and cappuccino feature, but more about that in the cons.❌CONS❌-We specifically spent the extra $ on this maker because of the latte and cappuccino feature. You are able to use the little steam cup that is provided to make steamed milk. This part of the Keurig lasted about 6 months before it completely stopped working. I've tried everything to fix it, nothing. So now it can only be used as a standard Keurig.-Completely my fault, but the removeable parts are NOT dishwasher safe! Don't be lazy like me, just handwash it! (except the steamer cup of course)-The water needs to be cleaned weekly, even twice a week. It collects mold VERY EASILY. Also, make sure you are using cold or room temperature water to fill the tank.-The whole system collects mold very easily. It says to run it a few times with just the hot water but this is not enough.-The water tank is very slim and small. In a household of two, we are constantly refilling it.Overall, I would say don't waste the extra money on the latte extra because it barely lasted 6 months. Keurig is a great ""idea"" but the mold factor is just too icky. Its impossible to clean the whole system. I know its time consuming to make a whole pot of coffee but ehh..the mold is a big no-no for me!"
"We have had our K-Cafe SMART for over 6 months.  It automatically detects the k-cup pod you are using to set the brew cycle, but it can incorrectly identify your pod (especially if using the Keurig reusable pod) and then won't let you manually change the settings.  It can require several attempts to get it to read the pod correctly.  It also sometimes locks up on a setting and will not start the brew cycle.  Great product when it works right, but very frustrating when it does not."
"You can't brew and heat milk at the same time, be patient!"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Update #2 (12.26.18): I'm very leery to post this updated review based on my unit going defective when I posted original review below. Hopefully no jinxing this time. So I called Amazon who connected me through Keurig manufacturers of this machine, and I was able to get it replaced. I might add how really frustrating that process was, but Amazon stayed connected for duration of the call which was nice. Took 20 minutes for the K-rep to get my email address correct, and about another 15 for my address; clearly they are based outside the US if you need to spell Illinois five times. Then you have to wait almost a week to get an email to print the FedEx label to ship out. K-rep instructed me to leave on porch and someone would get it in a few days, but how would they know when I got/printed label? Since that didn't sit well I called FedEx and was another daunting experience in itself (I'll spare you the details).In the end I got my replacement unit but was not the correct color (K-rep never asked, and I was so frustrated in the 50 minute phone call that I forgot to inquire). I was instead sent the ""special edition"" and I was like, WoW free upgrade. Sadly still low tech, no extra features. I must admit I like this special edition better. The only difference is the color and a couple finishes. It's more metallic looking and goes better with my SS appliances. The drip tray cover and handle to brewer are metal and appearance is nicer so it doesn't have the cheap look as the black did. Bear in mind I didn't think that of the black model at the time until I can now compare the two. I hated the drip tray on the black model, cover never seated right; had to mess with it a few times every time you clean it to seat properly (not with special edition). I've now had my replacement for two weeks (1 week longer than previous machine that crapped out after 5 days). I am pleased to report no electrical issues or draining of my tank. I bumped this review up to three stars, cause I dont think I'm out of the woods yet. I still cringe everytime I turn machine on, is it going to break? I'll provide another update 6-12 months and give 5 stars if still no further issues.Update # 1: I was in bed late writing 5 star review below, now one star. Irony is literally hours later when I woke up, i turned power on for first time after posting review, and drained my tank. Unit is defective... just drains tells you to add water and kept on draining. See video. Silver lining/Bonus to no auto on feature... the tank was full, and would of emptied out all over the counter and floor so it could have been worse.Original review: More money on this unit for less tech. Power button/auto off that's it folks. No fancy clock, no auto on to a preset time, and the addition of water tank handle is annoying! Interferes with the lid operation. Cash in the chips and trade all that tech for some latte's and capps! Is it worth it, you bet! Had the lattes and caps not turn out so well I would of been furious to back pedal from the elite version. I have had no breaker issues at all *sigh relief*Helpful tip: When auto off is engaged, (power off cycle) it is possible for the unit to provide false feedback from frother during auto off cycle fooling one to think it can operate and fool you again to believe its broke. For reasons unclear you can press cold, latte, or capp buttons on frother and they beep/ light up on frother, but milk wont churn. Once I realized auto off engaged, I turned power to Keurig on, and it was fine. Weird glitch..... again, power to frother comes on and can press capp or latte and seems responsive, but didn't froth or do anything.. come to find out the power to Keurig must be on or you will have froth issues. My only question is why did they design it this way? If power is off to Keurig machine, there should be no power to frother, fooling one to think its broke since it is reactive minus the froth process."
My wife and I are fairly satisfied but we are not sure why the reservoir is so small. It will only make 4x 12oz cups. So my wife and I have to fill it up everyday and it's a pain. I would have paid more for a larger water tank.
"OVERALL IMPRESSION: I would honestly not recommend getting this product or a Keurig with the smart features. This machine is trying to do more than it really should and it makes it more susceptible to issues. They clearly aren’t being engineered to the same quality as they were prior.FUNCTIONALITY: I’ve been using Keurig’s for many years and I honestly don’t believe this machine makes coffee taste any better than other Keurig machines I’ve used. I haven’t had issues with the water flow, but the Brew ID feature seems more like a ploy for Keurig to know what pods people drink for them to advertise products similar to those flavor or to “expand their at home barista” abilities. This machine also doesn’t have the ability to use the reusable pod designs I’ve seen that allow people to use their own coffee beans like other keurigs I’ve used.BUILD QUALITY: As for build quality, I’ve purchased this product twice now. The first one worked well with no issues, but I had to move and it being briefly boxed up must have done some form of damage, as it shorted immediately after being plugged back in (could smell the burnt plastic trying to run water through it, no bueno). It had been just over a year of use, so it was out of warranty, but I ordered a new machine as replacement through Keurig directly and that one broke within days attempting to perform a brew ID. The whole coffee machine was dead in the water, stopped working like it fried the machine.Keurig sent me another replacement and this model has worked better over the last 3 months, but the frother on this one is a 50:50 gamble. Some days it decides to turn on and work, other days it’s just an attached cup. The Brew ID can take a notable delay some times, you have to just open the machine and re-close the lid so it either gives up or somehow reads the pod label better. The needle is sharp though, so it at least has no problem puncturing the pod."
"I dont know why I didnt listen to all the reviews and Youtube videos I watched because they were all right.It works, but has features that I dont like:You cant brew your cup of coffee and froth at the same time...I didnt think it would bother me but it does.  Becuase of this it would take too long to make a cup of coffee!! So I'm STILL brewing my coffee on my Nespresso at the same time the milk is frothing....which I was already doing before...So it was a total waste of my gift card!Also the mian reason I bought this model was because it punctures the coffee pod with 4 holes instead of 1 which I thought would give me a stirnger more robust cup of coffee....It Does Not. If I can return it I will..I have had it for 2 months now and keep hoping that one of these days I will get used to it and not mind the time it takes to do the brewing and frothing and that I will get as strong cup of coffee but I havnt yet!"
Defective is self explanatory.Return was easy.
"It worked great for a little over a year with daily use.  For what I paid for it, I was very disappointed it did not last longer.  Will not replace with same machine."
"I bought this Keurig to replace the one that I’ve  had for 5 years which stopped working.  I bought the same model. The quality of this one seems cheaper and not as well made.  I doubt it will last 5 years this time around. Additionally, it makes a lot more noise than my older one. Overall, disappointed in the quality."
Used mostly for the frothier and it went out in less than a year
"If you had Keurig machines before, this machine won't blow you away.  I paid a Cyber Monday price for it so I am willing to cut it some slack.  If I had paid full price I would have sent it back. I have owned four Keurig machines in the past and this machine is very much a basic, entry-level Keurig machine with an attached milk frother.  By entry-level, I am referring that it does not have a programmable timer or programmable off-switch.  It doesn't have water temperature controls like other Keurig in its price range.  The temperature of the brewing water cannot be set between 186-192F like other Keurigs.  It's pretty lightweight compared to previous models so not sure what that might imply about the build quality.The milk frother is essentially and literally a magnetic spinning cogwheel that whips up the milk inside the milk frother cup.  The stainless steel cup has a coupling mechanism on the bottom that attaches to a spinning motor in the housing of the coffee maker.  The cogwheel is held in place by magnetism, but not a very strong magnet.  So when washing out the steel cup, make sure the cogwheel doesn't fall lose and go down your kitchen drain otherwise you will be without a milk frother.  How long the mechanism frothers the milk isn't adjustable which would explain why many people might have different degrees of luck frothing milk.What I do like about the machine is that it saves you some time by dropping in a k-cup and some creamer, pressing a few buttons and walking away while it makes your coffee.  And it may take a while because unlike other Keurig machines I have own, this one takes its time heating up the pump.  If you already have a medium-end Keurig machine, you don't need this.  Just get yourself an AA-battery powered spinning milk frother and a steel milk frothing cup and you will have your cup of coffee sooner than this gadget will make it for you.It is compatible with reusable k-cups for loose coffee grains.  The mechanism for inserting k-cups is exactly the same as found on first-gen Keurig machines so those attachments should work fine with this machine.If I could turn back the clock, I would have not ordered it since I already had a programmable Keurig machine with LCD display and the milk frother on this machine is a joke for any serious cappuccino and latte drinker.**** EDIT 3 Hours Later.This Keurig model does not even have a water filter holder like every other Keurig before it.  The Milk frother does not even warm up the milk or cream.  On closer inspection, the spinning cogwheel spins based on changing magnetic polarities which means this thing will be prone to get stuck.  I am really disappointed with Keurig.  I will be returning this back to them after all.  My old Keurig was much better.  If you paid more than a hundred dollars, you overpaid for this machine."
"I am returning this Keurig.  I love that it heats and foams the milk, but the coffee does not taste as good as my other Keurig.  Also, the lid for the water tank, always falls into the tank. it's slick and when I take it off, it just falls right in the water tank."
"Missing part, no replacement info."
One big issue is the Latte maker doesn't work most of the time unless you unplug the machine and plug it back in.  Sometimes you have to do it more than once.  The other issue is the automatic power off takes forever to kick in.It's very difficult to clean the area of the cup holder.If you want a double shot of cappuccino you have to use two kcups and run it twice.It's too expensive for what you get.
"I purchased the stainless steel model in 2019.  it worked great until last year when the frothier would not work.  I called customer service they said ""let's trouble shoot the problem"", then asked for the SN number which I gave them.  As soon as I gave them the SN number I was told ""oh, your unit is out of warranty"" and offered me a me a new one with a 20% discount.  There was no trouble shooting. I unplugged the unit for a day and the issue resolved itself.  Yesterday on Sept 24th, the unit shut off as soon as I tried to brew a cup of coffee, this happened over and over again.  I called customer service and once again he asked for the SN number and said let's trouble shoot the unit.  Once I gave him the number, he said ""I was out of warranty"" and he offered me a 20% discount on a new coffee maker.  I asked him ""where is the trouble shooting'?  he said ""I just did it"".  I said ""did what""?  He once again repeated I just did it.  I said you did nothing except try to sell me another unit.I unplugged the unit over night and once again the issue resolved itself this morning.  I cannot explain why.  I ordered another unit which will arrive today and I will keep it for a couple of weeks to see if the issue has been resolved."
"We really liked the idea of this coffee maker. In fact this is our 2nd purchase of the same coffee maker in 4 years. The first one was refurbished then died after 2 years, I thought ok, it was a refurb so I will be a new one and it should last longer. I purchased another one and same thing. The amount it was putting out got less and less, even with regular cleaning as directed. Finally I had enough and started trying different YouTube suggestions, none of which worked. I did discover a little metal filter that has extremely fine mesh making it super easy to get clogged over time, 2 years to be exact. After removing and cleaning this filter the system somehow knew it has been apart since I unplugged several items and now a relay on the back of the board just clicks and will not let the machine turn on. Nothing is now wrong with the machine, everything should work and the amount should be a back to normal but the relay will not let it turn on. I believe this is intentional on the part of Keurig and I would highly suggest no one buys this specific product again. It does call into question their other products and if they have any other parts that are designed to fail. Also, interesting why they would need or install a serial debug port if they system wasn’t designed to “trip” if it was taken apart."
We make about 5 cups per day.  Makes great coffee.  We clean it with vinegar every 2 months but after 10 months the descale light comes on and it just shuts off.  At that point you can no longer clean it since as soon as you turn it on it shuts off.  $189 for 10 months.  Pretty bad.
"Unit worked for the first 8 months than developed an intermittent NO frothing issue (it would make a loud screeching noise all the lights would flash and the unit had to be unplugged to clear the issue).  The issue became more and more regular to the point I gave up and called the company. Explained the issue to their tech support person, that told me he would send a new frothing unit, since it was external to the machine?? I told him the frothing system in integral to the unit and I wasn't going to take it apart and replace it. After being put on hold for 20 minutes he came back and said they would send me a new frothing cup??  At that point I insisted on talking to a manager; the second person told me they would just sending me a new unit under the warranty.  So after having to jump through hoops on providing proof of purchase, pictures of the unit and serial numbers and proof of delivery; I was told they would need to contact Amazon to confirm the purchase!  Now January of 2024 and still no replacement! Contacted Keurig and asked what's up?  Now I am being told to ship the unit back and they will analysis and determine the next course of action!  I have been waiting 4 months for a replacement, now I have to go another how many months without coffee?  Checking the internet I found many reports of this same forthing issue.  Given their techs ability to address the issue previously I told them I would buy a new unit from a reputable company and I would never buy their products again. If you purchase be warned, they have poor customer service, worse tech service and will jerk you around every chance the get."
"This Keurig worked well for about 9 months. Originally purchased in October of 2022, this unit started to struggle making a cup of coffee in summer of 2023. Pours became increasingly slow; pours would often end with a ""spurt"" that would splatter coffee everywhere; and the machine would often turn off in the middle of a pour. Keurig's customer support is very difficult to access, and Keurig provided no useful support for these issues.Considering the price of this unit, I had higher expectations for longevity. This unit was used daily by two members of our household, averaging 1-4 cups a day, as you would expect from a household unit such as this. The milk foaming option was a nice budget option for foamed milk, and cobbled together with the extra strong ""shot"" function, made passable espresso-style drinks for someone who isn't too serious about their coffee. Had this unit had better longevity, it would have received a higher rating, but buyers should beware that it won't last long with regular use."
"TLDR:  Buggy and annoying software, coffee isn't hot enough, reservoir is small.After carefully determining my needs, and diligently studying reviews of similar products , I finally settled on this coffeemaker.  And while it's mostly adequate to the task, there are a few things not to like.The software sucks.  I don't ask for much; simply to start the coffee brewing so that it's ready for me by the time I get to the kitchen.  But I must log in from my phone (that I keep on my night stand) to brew the coffee.  If I'm successful, all is well, but the software is buggy.  It often doesn't recognize my credentials, and I have to log in from my laptop first, then it will allow me to log in from my phone.Every few weeks, for some unknown reason, the software requires me to change my password.  And that's an ordeal too.  Once the password is changed, it seems to take some time before the software on my phone recognizes the new password, even if I use my phone to change it!  I'm not sure why the change is required.  It's not like someone's going to hack in and brew a cup of my coffee or order K-cups for me!As an aside, I don't buy K-cups, I grind my own coffee to use.  But the software is all about selling their products to you.  Fortunately, I can just skip past all that and brew my own coffee.The largest coffee I can brew is 12 oz.  (I was hoping to find one that brews 14 oz.)  Even on the hottest setting, the coffee isn't all that hot.  30 seconds in the microwave, however, fixes that.There are options for strength, ""balanced"" to ""intense"", all of which seem more of a gimmick than practical.Overall, my expectations, based on Keurig's claims, far exceeded the results.  It's a glorified coffee maker with lots of bells and whistles, all of which do pretty much nothing special, and all of which can sometimes be controlled with a buggy app that fails at nearly every level."
The machine was great until the milk frother stopped working within a few months of use. Note that I am one person only using the frother one time a day.
I had to send it back because it didn't work. Maybe I didn't set it up right. I had one wonderful cup of latte and I couldn't get it to work again. I need my money back so I can buy another one! Please hurry as I sent it back via pick up UPS or Fed X
I bought mine in 10/22.  Fast forward to 07/24 and it no longer will make a full cup.  6 oz siring nets 4 ounces of coffee.  I have cleaned the machine as well as the needle numerous times.  Still won’t make a full cup.  This will be the last Keurig.  They do not last.  $164 down the drain.
"Hard pass. While it’s nice to have choices on temperature and strength of coffee, it all loses with the frother that doesn’t work. I had them replace the first one because it stopped working. The replacement doesn’t work either. The problem is the brother wires are really cheap. Darn near impossible to clean either."
"This makes good coffee using k-cups as expected and that's about it. My family members like k-cups and i like espresso made right so I figured this would benefit everyone in the household. I found it to be way overpriced and lacking in its quality of espresso.Making a cup of espresso, cappuccino or latte with this machine is a gimmick due to the fact the machine doesn't make a good shot of espresso. As someone who has worked with making espresso's this machine basically makes the same consistency of espresso as it would a cup of coffee. Espresso is meant to be rich, thick, creamy and frothy via 1-2 oz of slow pouring goodness. You can YouTube a video of espresso to see its texture. This machine puts out nothing like it. It's basically between a 1-2 shot of water flowing through grounds that comes out thin and lifeless. I tested this multiple ways of using an espresso k-cup with the machines one shot feature, espresso re-usable pod that was freshly ground via one shot feature and even went as far as making a 6oz cup of espresso using the machines coffee setting for 6oz coffee. The two shots of espresso using the k-cup espresso and freshly ground espresso were just as consistent as the 6oz coffee version.Save yourself the cost and buy a 80$ Keurig mini for your k-cup coffees only if that's what you desire. I regret my purchase as this machine is a glorified Keurig mini with a frother that cost 100$ more for no reason."
"It works .. But I have issues:1. The app on your phone is nothing more than a way for Keurig to sell coffee subscriptions.. It literally is not needed in the coffee maker. I mean it's debatable if recognizing the k-cup would make a better cup of coffee.  They imply that your going to get free K-Cups... That is.. If your buy a subscription or purchase a 12 month warranty extension..2. Yet another design like the Keurig 2.0 where you could not use the K-Cup refillables.  Good news, it's not checking for licenses with a special reader. But, you DO have to buy their new design K-Cup refillable. The worst part is you have to take out the k-cup sleeve in order use them. So, if you have users that use k-cups and reusable cups.. It's a big bother ... Refilling the refillable also is a multistep process.  Bad design and decision for Keurig.3. I was using a slightly taller Thermos coffee mug.. The height even with removing the platform does not clear... Barely... But you will spill it trying to remove it. Count on getting the more ""Wide"" 12-oz mugs with this brewer.4. The Milk foamer they give you... Don't even think you can clean this in a dishwasher. The electronics are  in the foamer unit.. They really should have made it with a removable sleeve that you can spray in the kitchen sink.. Just don't get it too wet or immerse it...The UI is good, and when it can make coffee it does a decent job.. But I feel annoyed the cost of the unit vs the design tricks to get you to buy additional things that it's counterpart does not have any of these issues.  I won't return it.. But probably this one is going to office instead of replacing the other ""after 2.0"" unit that uses resuable 3-party K-Cup dispensers."
"Not what I expected from the Keurig brand.I will keep this short and to the point.Durability is lacking when lifting and lowering the handle. It feels like you need to be careful as to not break it. Expected a little bit better quality material and design.Performance is fine with the exception of the mess it makes after each use. The attached photo is after cleaning it, and then brewing a 12oz coffee. You will need to be sure to clean the unit itself after ever use to avoid build up.Conclusion.It's okay, just not what I expected from the Keurig brand or for the money paid."
The machine is great and works as advertised. Makes good coffee and has a lot of different settings. Connects to an app which is nice. What I have a problem with is the frother. It stopped working just months after. I tried using different milk and it just doesn't work anymore. Would be great if Keurig could send me a new frother that works.
It worked fine for a few months but the pump broke on the unit and it can't be repaired so the entire unit is a bust. A shame really because it was neat when it made the coffee.
"As “high tech “ this is , when you set up a schedule to make your coffee you still have to go to the app and click brew . It doesn’t auto brew when you set the date and time . It just sends you a notification and then click brew on your smart device . First world issue, but even old coffee machines have this function . Over all it’s neat, but you’ll think with the amount of tech in it, it still would have this."
"I love this model but the foam for the latte or cafe option works when it feels like it. I have re-read the manual, but this is not the best make considering the price."
"Great coffee maker with option for an extra strong shot of coffee which goes perfect with the frothed milk it makes.3 months after purchase and the handle tore through the water reservoir.  Kuerig representative on the phone stated that because my machine was manufactured in 2021, it was no longer under warranty regardless of purchase date?!?!?  If that is true, any Kuerig machine may be out of warranty before a customer purchases it.  I'm hoping that was just confusion on the phone rep's part.  I worked out a ""one time exception"" and have a new reservoir on the way."
"Dispensed coffee or water didn’t seem as hot as the Keurig model we were replacing. Brewed coffee also seemed weak compared to our previous model. Food thermometer read 170 degrees consistently. Keurig range is 170-190 but this model can not be adjusted higher.  I consulted with Keurig customer service to confirm that the factory setting is 170, probably the with the assumption you’re adding heated milk or cream.  If you’re making one cup of quick coffee, it will not stand up to a splash of half and half from the refrigerator.  Also for the frother/steamer to work properly, there is a minimum fill line, so there was some waste.  Box was damaged somewhere in shipping as well.  Returning."
Like the coffee but not making foam for my latte.....
"After a few months every 2 out of 3 cups I try to make has some kind of error or fault and I have to restart the process.  Very annoying, especially given how slowly the machine works"
"Don't know why but I am sent to the wrong brewer when submitting this review. I have the K-Cafe and purchased the new one below. The SMART, but not really.Keurig K-Café SMART Single Serve Coffee Maker with WiFi Compatibility, Latte and Cappuccino Machine with Built-In Frother, 6 Brew Sizes, Works with Alexa, BlackIt looked great and I was ready for an upgrade. The unit is sleek, the water pitcher is easy to use, the frother is no longer built into the base - more freestanding. The ability to set water temp and frother setup is a pushbutton.Unfortunately, the bad outweighs the good. Sometimes the frother doesn't heat the milk but still froths it. The system seems to have a mind of its own. The intent is for the frother to work first and the brewer will make the shot after the frother stops. Not so much. Sometimes the shot goes first and then the frother comes on. The shot sits in the cup waiting...and cooling.The unit is internet connected - it looks at the k-cup and then goes online to see the best brewing setup. It will then tell you the brew settings. Attempting to change the temperature, number of shots, won't be allowed. I guess it knows me better than myself. I have to stop the brew and restart before the internet search.Big issue: the frother only holds a small amount - less than the older models. Game changer for me. Who wants a small latte? The frother is non stick on the inside. However, size matters.In my opinion, this unit is not ready for the market. Hopefully, it went through testing before production began. If so, where? Someone should have picked up on the issues.If Keurig fixes the issues, I'd try it again.I would not give this as a Christmas present - unless you don't like the recipient."
"We bought this unit for several reasons: ability to brew both coffee and shots for latte's and the versatility of brewing both K cups and bring your own coffee using the universal reusable coffee filter (""URCF"").  This unit gets most of it right except for the part about using your own coffee grounds.  We've read all the directions and done everything in accordance with Keurig guidance, but can do nothing about coffee grounds spilling out of the URCF.  I've since read about others who experienced the same issue, but in a nutshell, the pods and the URCF are about the size as a shot glass but the only paper filters you can get for it are the size of those little cups you fill up with ketchup at the burger joint which is about half the size of the URCF.  The filters specifically say not to push them down to the bottom of the URCF so I assumed there was some strategic reason Keurig needed the extra space that was below the paper filter but still inside the URCF.  Well, we experimented with varying amounts of medium ground coffee (they do warn you that fine ground will clog it up) and the best it could handle without incident was about 1/2 tablespoon, or enough coffee to brew about 4 oz., but the minimum size of the machine is a 6 oz cup.  My wife likes 12 to kick-start her day so that was a non-starter.  There is the possibility of using the URCF without a paper filter but that's not something we wanted to entertain due to the mess.  But hey, the pods work great."
Bought the wife one for Christmas. She loves it. Especially the milk frother. Well just this morning it burnt up. Literally we smelled burnt electronics and it shut off. Didn’t catch fire or anything but you get the idea if you’ve ever had electronics go up. There is clearly issues with this design or components used. Luckily Amazon is returning it with no hassle. Since it doesn’t cost anything I’ll try another one and see what happens.
"I really. Like this coffee maker, but had some issues. They put a small light in the bottom of the reservoir somover time it grows algae on it which is kind of gross and impossible to get to to clean. Second a biggest. Problem. Is it just stopped working. I came down one morning and it was powered ?  Ok, so I powered it back on, nothing it won't power on, checked the power cord, yep, it plugged in, tested the outlet, yet it's got power, but the coffee maker is completely dead. We never used tap water unit always 0.000 ppm water we make ourselves with a special. Reverse osmosis machine made to make salt water aquarium water which has to be 0 ppm which is basically 100% pure, tap water is usually 600ppm, bottle water is usually 100 ppm so we used the best water possible and we even descared it and ran vinegar through it once a month even thought it didn't really need it using the good water but it still died. This was a more expensive kureig and I am very disappointed in it.  I had cheaper once that lasted. Longer than this one.  We didn't .even use it as much as some. I only made maybe 3 or four cups per week, not even multiple cups a day.  I won't be buying another rone now. I'll try a Cuisinart instead."
"Doesnt connect to wifi, after hours of looking up solutions and calling it still wont work...""Needs a 2.4ghz band."" disabled the 5 ghz and attempted with no luck.""Cell phone service needs to be off"" turned it off and tried to connect.

Nothing.Going through the setup on the app it cant even connect to the brewer half the time.Best part is if the wifi doesn't work it gets hung up on the brewing process and wont start because it cant find ""recommendations"" on how to brew...so you have to restart it and waste a pod. Useless.Save yourself the money and frustration and buy anything else but a Keurig."
"I liked this product a lot. Unfortunately, less than a year later the Frother stopped working."
"I'm enjoying the last cup of coffee I will ever make with this awful product. This is going to be one of those reviews where you need to read between the lines to see how I really feel.I've used it for about a year now, and have extensive experience flossing the needles so that this coffee maker will not lock up on every third brew.As with most Keurig products, descaling nearly destroyed the coffee maker.There is absolutely no reason for your coffee maker to be connected to Wi-Fi. All this did was bring the absolute worst practices of inkjet printer cartridges to my morning coffee experience. If you don't use an expensive brand of coffee who have paid money to Keurig, you get to wait up to 15 seconds while the coffee maker tries to figure out what pod you just inserted. There is no way to turn this 'feature' off.After about a year, the coffee maker started having errors anytime an Aldi coffee pod was used. When I use the more expensive coffee pods, it only had an error about every third cup. Still an absolutely awful performance for a $200 coffee maker.The frother was okay, but I've seen frothers here on Amazon for $19 that would do the job just as well.At this point, Keurig products are essentially disposable. You buy one, use it for about a year, and then hope most of it is recyclable when you toss it in the garbage.This has been replaced with a $40 no name cup at a time coffee maker. I figure I can buy five of these over the next few years for the cost of a single ""smart"" coffee maker from Keurig.Avoid if you value your sanity, don't want 'connectivity issues', stupid attempts to 'nudge' you towards brands that paid the vig to Keurig, and really do not want to be trying to use a paper clip to clean out your orifices at 5am."
"I am so disappointed in this machine.Let me preface this review by saying that before swapping to this machine, I had an original Keurig brewer that worked flawlessly for 7 years. I gave that machine to a friend when I “upgraded” to this subpar product.I purchased this in December 2022. By February 2023, the frother stopped working. Dead as a door nail.It was under warranty, and replaced at no cost to me.By June 2023, the machine itself broke. It drew in water, there was a loud *pop* and smoke puffed out of the top housing. The machine never turned on again.The warranty saved me again and replaced the machine as well as granting me a new warranty.The new machine has caused me nothing but grief. I have to reset it multiple time a week due to crazy errors (it tells me to add water when the reservoir is full, it won’t register a K-Cup is in it, the display freezes, and more). Plus, since the day I took this one out of the box, anytime I brew something, coffee or plain hot water, the water spits out all over the place. Hot water even spits out of the top door when I open it and will hit me in the face if I’m not careful. Descaling was no help, which I knew before attempting since it happened out of the box.Also, the frother sometimes doesn’t register that it’s on the base and won’t receive power.At this point, I’m ready to toss this stupid thing, get a regular drip coffee maker and a standalone frother.Never been so frustrated to have spent $200."
"Great machine until it stopped working on 12/10/24. When I tried calling keurig customer service I first got a female robot pretending to be human. Second time I called it was a male version. Then my husband called twice and got the same thing. The robot script is the same: you hear background human voices like the robot is in a cubicle and then repeats “hello” like 4 times then says it doesn’t hear anything so it’s disconnecting the call and hangs up. If your customer service is closed then just have a message saying so. The robot crap is annoying, bad service, and wastes people’s time. Will never buy keurig again. Second time I’ve had my machines f up and die."
"I have had this item for a while now…while I do like it, it has flaws that make it overpriced. It is glitchy - tells me it needs water when it is full (have to unplug it and plug it back in to clear the error), for example.  Despite the way it is written, you CANNOT set any type of timer…the closest I can get is to set up an automatic size, temperature, strength, etc., which is something that can be done on (basically) any other similar model for less money.  My pods explode fairly routinely, and if you do not have sufficient water in the vessel before placing the pod, it will make you have to use a new pod.On the upside, however, it does make the beverage (although I am not sure that is actually a positive given that this is the only function).  If I had ANY of this information, I would have bought one of the earlier versions (or a competitor brand)."
The WiFi won’t connect to 2.4 or 5. Amazon sent a replacement and I had the same issue. This isn’t worth the money.
Why does it keep disconnecting from the wifi? I keep having to unplug it for a few seconds and plug it back up. That's a real let down and just defeats the purpose of buying a smart keurig that you can connect and start the brew from your phone if you keep having to connect it back up everyday. Other than that it's great so far.
"Product was great for the first few months. Approximately eight months after purchase, the machine started giving me error codes. I then had to unplug/plug the machine several times to get it to work. Now at eleven months the machine works approximately twenty five percent of the time.It’s past the warranty and I’m hesitant about purchasing another of the same Keurig. That said, the reviews are good and I’m sure I just received a bad unit. Info for all buyers to pay attention for similar issues.Side note, I had a Keurig in the past and it lasted for years. Was happy with Keurig and their product that I replaced it with this model. 50/50 on quality. Bummer."
"This worked great, until it died less than 6 months into using it. I purchased this as a Christmas gift, and it died on May 25th. My wife turned it on this morning and started to brew her coffee. It shot out a little steam and turned off. It will not turn back on.We will be looking for a brand other than Keurig. The Keurig machines just don't seem to last very long, and this one didn't even make it a half year.At least we still have an old, reliable Mr. Coffee in the storage room that we were able to put back into service. (It is at least 6 years old and has outlasted 3 or 4 Keurigs.)"
my new coffee pot did not perform as expected. The froth or does not work at all. It is going back up.
"I did not like the design of the water reservoir, or the lack of settings.The water reservoir lid comes completely off and is not hinged, so it is easy to drop in the water and not the easiest to put in place.The latte is never hot and you cannot adjust the temperature settings, on and off times, etc. The coffee part is an inferior machine to my previous Keurigs, and the latte addition is not worth the sacrifice of quality.  Not a good machine for the money."
"This machine was working great up until it decided to power off forever. Connected to a GFCI outlet. Something must of burned out as it did smell off while brewing a cup of joe. Contacted Keurig support, followed troubleshooting but still no power. Keurig Support said they will be sending a replacement but they first need to receive the faulty one. Unfortunately this happened in the middle of the holiday season, so we will see when we get our replacement out. :("
When descaling and /or processing with low water - the thermostat switch over heats and makes the machine inoperable.
"This is the 3rd unit we have purchased; the first 2 stopped functioning after a few years; luckily we bought a protection plan with the 2nd one and were able to get a replacement for which we also purchased a protection plan. It is unfortunately very wasteful to have appliances that only last a few years but for daily use (with regular descaling), this machine will make a decent cup of Cappuccino (disclaimer: I am not a coffee connoisseur)"
This worked great for about 8 months the the capp and laatte maker side stopped working. Still haven't heard back from customer service. I would think spending this much money it should last longer then 8 months.
"Since day one it has made like a bang sound, so after a couple of days I unplugged it and it was fine but then it started over again. I only have this machine so if I return it then I will be without a coffee machine so I am kinda stuck with it not unless Amazon can work something out. I need my coffee machine so please tell me what to do. I had the same machine before and it lasted over 3 years with no problem."
"I would advise once you get your Keurig to immediately plug it in and see if it works properly, if you don't have time then get the warranty, it only has 30 day warranty from the manufacturer. We did not even use it until after the warranty period since we were trying to use up the coffee we had for our regular coffee maker.  The very first time we used it the Keurig immediately started leaking from the bottom. The coffee was excellent. We were hoping it would stop leaking but it didn't. Then one morning it completely stopped working, it would not power on.  I thought a name brand like Keurig would have a 60 day warranty and never thought I would need a warranty past that time frame. I was wrong. Keurig does make great coffee but not a long lasting machine. If you get one then get a warranty. We are stuck with a useless machine right  from the starting gate that we paid almost $200 for."
"The rubber plastic type seal near the bottom of the frother is sticking out and in guessing it should be pushed in or flush/not even visible. Theres no way for me to get it back in? Not sure if this will cause issues in the future, might just return it."
"I bought this after my last one stopped working. My old one was only 3 years old but I figured I’d get a new one so I wouldn’t have any issues. Boy was I wrong. After only a few weeks it stopped working. The power kept shutting off. I did all of the troubleshooting with no prevail. I called the Keurig help line and they said they could replace it and they would email me. Well, no email ever came. When I called to let them know, they kept putting me on hold and hanging up. Keurig products are trash!!!"
"This item was missing the drip tray, had to order one from keurig for $30 because it was a birthday present and didn’t want to return and wait on another to come"
"Simple to use however we are on our second unit now.  Seems to have a thermal issue or something and suddenly just stopped.  Seems there are so many positive reviews on the wifi connectivity but in reality i feel it is pretty worthless in this aspect.  All it wants to do is search your cup on the internet then try to sell them through their service.  This also causes a delay as it searches the internet before it will start brewing.  It is much faster if you leave it disconnected from wifi.  When we had issues the process is not very useful as the app does not help and registration of the product also does not seem to help.  Seems if they would incorporate chat type help and base it on your serial number on record would make the warranty process much easier than a subcontracted call center with English as a second language reading a script.  We also experienced the issue another disappointed reviewer posted about it says it brewed coffee but nothing there.  Yes it was clean and not plugged.  Our previous Keurig was a workhorse, this one has lots of bells and whistles but I don’t think it will last like our previous one.  It looks nice but the internal components are not up to standard.  Our first one failed in less than 3 months, I don’t have a great feeling about the second one."
The coffee maker handle isn’t closing properly and the coffee grounds keep overflowing into the coffee. Basically it is broken after a few mo thanks use. The frother is a good one.
"UPDATE (11/17/20)...we’ve only had this for a couple years, minimal use.  It has completely flamed out.  Customer Service is beyond deplorable.  Expect ZERO help.  I called and politely talked with a Keurig rep twice, both times I got the same story, they are unable to take any customer service calls right now...yeah right!  AND when I explained my issue to her, she stated, “yes, we have been having issues with this model for some time now”.  How nice.(Original review)-Well, I’m a loooong time coffee drinker, so I consider myself just as much an “expert” at consumption as the next guy.  This Keurig model is our 3rd purchase from over the past few years at trying the easier way of brewing that morning cup.  Our first 2 machines flamed out after a few months of use, both of those failures were related to the pump, I guess.  We replaced the first w the 2nd after a few months and I don’t remember how long we had the 2nd machine, but it quit as well and got returned. While I admit it is just as easy as ever, now, maybe 6 yrs later, we’re on number 3.  My wife uses the foaming feature regular, and it seems to work quite well.  I brew my own K-cup recommended refillables everyday.  My biggest complaint w this machine is the brew temperature.  It isn’t CLOSE to industry standards for an accepted range.  (165°-185°).  I have measured the immediate brew temp w a digital food thermometer to be a consistent 166°, which when blended w any flavors or creams will temper down to 144° almost immediately!  By the time you sit down w your breakfast or morning paper, you’ll have to nuke it to make it “hot” again.  Kinda defeats the purpose of HOT coffee in the morning.  Even if I build a cup and go into my shop to work, it’s usually too cold for consumption and I just toss it out.  Unfortunately we've had this marching for about 45 days and I doubt it'll be worth retuning/replacing.  Based on the Keurig track record in this household, a 4th machine WILL NOT HAPPEN.  Keurig gets the win, we’ll use this machine until we get fed up w it and toss it out.  I guess this is how they stay in business??$200 for luke warm coffee isn’t much of a deal.  Sorry folks.UPDATE!!!!!...... 11/16/2020 this machine has failed!!!  It started brewing short cups (a 10oz requested brew that only yields about 8-9ozs), about 4-5 months ago.  AND yes we descale every 3-4 months.  I have read that the Keurigs last about 5 years............DONT BE FOOLED, that's not true!!!  These are a great idea, but a total WASTE OF YOUR MONEY!!!!!"
"Well, it lasted for 4 months of daily use. Here is what is happening now:1. Keeps asking to add water with a full water tank. You can’t brew while it’s happening. I had to unplug/plug it back in to fix it.2. Wifi disconnected and will not connect again.3. I insert an original pod with a qr code only to get a message “cloud is unavailable. Insert pod”. 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ I have too lift the handle multiple times to fix it.4. The Pods with qr codes are not recognized.5. While trying to adjust a size and strength, it keeps going back to the pod recognition stage and freezes.I didn’t expect great quality from Keurig but it really sucks.Make your own choices."
"The machine is fine but the frother cup stopped working properly after just a year of use. I always use the same 2% milk and clean the whisk after each use. I even bought a replacement whisk after reading that the magnet may have become weaker but it did not help. Might be a mechanical issue with the motor. I am pretty disappointed as I got it specifically for making lattes and cappuccinos. I do not much care for the regular coffee. Alas, I'm putting it up on sale on FaceBook marketplace."
"I was so excited to receive my Keurig when I purchased it and start using it. The milk frother only worked for two weeks and then it stopped working. There are clear instructions to not submerge the frother in water or place in the dishwasher, which I followed. I contacted customer support and they sent me a replacement which worked for another week and then stopped working again. I have only had this product for one month and I will be returning it and purchasing a different one."
"I purchased two of these keurig machines for my food businesses. The milk frothing mechanism works great, my only complaint is the espresso. BOTH of my machines automatically brew a double espresso. It will dispense one shot and then a few seconds later dispense another shot. If you want a single shot then you have to be ready to pull the cup away and replace with another cup to catch the second shot. The shots are also watery, nothing close to real espresso.I contacted keurig and they said my machine is defective and I will need a replacement.  I’m not sure that is correct because it seems to be the way the machine is designed to work being as I have 2 machines that do the same dispensing. Definitely not in love with this for espresso making."
I have had Keurig products for years and love them very much but for the last few years the products only seem to last a year to year and a half. I will continue to buy the products but think I will add an extra warranty.
I’m going to have to return this if they don’t hurry up and make a decent reusable kcup to fit this design. I don’t have money to keep buying wasteful kcups. I want the coffee I want and Keurig you should not make machines that don’t have reusable items to go with it or make sure it is stated somewhere so we aren’t blindsided when we get it! Rude to buyers and disrespectful to the earth!
"If the SOFTWARE is K-Cafe Smart v1.0.1-RC1-14 , the software has been updated & you will NOT be able to link to the wi-fi no matter how many times you try, not even if you do a factory reset. Do not frustrate yourself, Keurig says the unit must be replaced so you can use the wifi function. I'm not sure why Keurig made that impossible, but the tech said it would never connect with that version of the software.After 2 units & 8 hours of my troubleshooting time, & another few hours boxing & unboxing, I got a refund, both machines wouldn't hook to the wifi. I bought from Keurig & boom! immediately connected."
"If i could have given zero stars on this product, i would. I received this as a gift and it stopped working within a few months. The power would not come on. When I talked to customer service, they told me to send a picture of the  proof of purchase, and serial number. I was informed that the picture of the proof of purchase did not meet their requirements. I now have to purchase a new Keurig machine, even though it was less than a year when the machine stopped working. I am seriously considering buying a different brand if this the customer service that is given."
"Coffee takes a long time to brew compared to my other keurigs. The sensors need cleaning between each use, again my non “smart” keurig barely needed to have sensors cleaned. The flavor doesn’t take the same despite tinkering with all the possible options for last 3 weeks. Oh and you need the app for it - hate that. It’s going back and I’ll buy a dumb keurig."
It does a good job making a cup of coffee and the frothing unit works nicely. The housing seems cheap and feels like poor quality plastic. The resivoir lid is clumsy to remove for refilling and easily falls into the resivoir. It feels cheap for an expensive coffee maker.
"The ""frother"" quit working at 12 - 13 months old (about 4 months ago) and now the coffee part stopped working today. Tried descaling with 3 different products & nothing. We use filtered bottled water & i descale it routinely at about every 4 months. It's just my wife & I and we drink around 4-5 cups total per day (not each, TOTAL).It was great for the first year, then it went to crap. Very disappointing and honestly, we'll probably buy a ""knock off"" Keurig at half the price because this is the 2nd one that's took a crap on us (both under 18 months old)."
"EDIT: It’s the end of November 2020, the same year I bought this and only a few months later, and the milk frother is not working. It seems to be cooking the milk instead and sometimes I pick up the pitcher and it’s cold underneath yet the milk is hot and sort of has this weird glossy porous bubbly froth on top. Usually, you should see where the steamed milk subverts a nice airy frothy layer of milk but now it just seems to be mixing all together and coming out foamy on top. It’s not frothy at all and doesn’t taste like a latte. The picture with the glassy mug is what it looks like now and the picture with the green and white Portland mug is what it should look like. Pretty sure that, even as I only bought this thing just about 4 months ago and only use it 1-2 a day, it’s on the fritz. Buyer beware.I waited for ages to buy a Keurig until I knew that recycling the cups was possible. I’m honestly terrible about making coffee— I usually French press it or make stovetop espresso drinks, and they always came out bitter or the proportions of coffee to milk were way off. It’s so nice to just have a decent cup of coffee and this machine makes GREAT coffee!! I love that it is “idiot proof” with the lines on the milk pitcher marked. This also takes away the need to use up more dishes by measuring it out yourself, but also ensures the correct proportions. The little parts are easy to clean— very glad the frother is magnetic because I would be scared of losing it or dropping it down the garbage disposal when washing the pitcher. Bonus: the cold drink option is AWESOME for making iced lattes or even iced coffee, since I got it in the summer and I always bought jugs of iced coffee at the store. I absolutely LOVE my Keurig! Highly recommend this machine!"
"Purchased from Amazon $177 but Keurig had same machine for $140 with four boxes of 24 pack coffees. Do your research and look for a better price before you purchase. Also, machine quality doesn’t appear to be what Keurig has been known for in the past."
"Nothing works properly. From WiFi to pod scanner and inaccurate water level, just a few days ago this brand new system would not registered the water level and is constantly saying add water while the container is filled with water. every time you close the lid to start a coffee it takes so long for the scanner to scan the pot that you literally waste minutes instead of the old mod that you could just close it and start your fresh hot brew coffee, right away. Conveniently most of these issues started right after the return window closed. We use only about 3 pods per day between me and my wife so it is not the high volume usage yet the system is completely a failure. I absolutely do not recommend it. I hope KEURIG Will read this review and reach out to troubleshoot the system and that very least replace it to find out what went wrong with this new system.  I have been using KEURIG ever since they started the coffee pot, we have all the different models at work and at home and really do not have problem with any of them, but this model."
"Updated status 3/13/21.. frother stopped working. I loved this product and it was working so we'll until the frother just decided to never froth again. Disappointing.If you love variety and don't want to spend $$$ for a professional brewer then this the one for.you.I bought this for the additional Cappacino and Latte brewing features. I am not a coffee snob by any stretch of the imagination and typically  lattes from coffee shops.Coffee controls are awesome especially the automatic feature that lets you turn it on, drop in a pod, and bit brew...when ready it brews, no waiting for the water to heat up before setting up.The latte brew is great and I get two.shota of coffee from each pod though instructions say to discard after one use. I make two lattes with one pod if it's at least a medium roast coffee. Light or breakfast tend to get that water down taste.The frother works perfectly and I can use any K-Cup flavor to mix it up. There are separate setting for latte and cappacino and again it's pour in milk (or heavy cream) to the right line and push a button...magnetic wheel makes perfect froth you can spoon out the extra!The bad...well really the bad is if you love real cappuccino. This brewer not going to give you that barista magic hear people talk about. But if you use the cappacino pods I think it delivers a decent shot.The ehhh.... The water tank is a hot and miss. The side load with handle is awesome. My old keurig had that side tank that was awkward to move about. The capacity sucks be honest. If it could.hold two more cups of water it would be perfect in my opinion."
"I bought this Keurig just one year ago and a few weeks ago the milk spinner/frother (which has gotten minimal use) stopped working and emitted an electrical burn smell. I'm now afraid to use the machine and Keurig has not responded to my email.  Frustrating! If they ever respond and I get a decent result from them I will update this review, but for now, I would not recommend this brewer to anyone.**Update!  Keurig stands by their products and replaced my brewer.  They responded to my email by asking that I call them and once I spoke with a rep, the issue was handled and a new brewer arrived within 10 days.  Here's hoping brewer #2 will last a little longer.  I still can't give this machine a higher review until I give it some time to see if it will last but I have had Keurig products since the invention of K-cups and this is the first issue I have ever encountered."
"1st K-Cafe arrived defective out of the box, was returned for a replacement.  That one worked okay for about six months.  Then it started shutting itself off even with the auto off feature disabled.  It's maddening when you insert a cappuccino pod, select the 12 ounce button and then walk away to return a few minutes later to find it had shut off.  If you just turn it on, lift the handle up and down and re-select 12 ounces, it over fills a 12 oz cup.  The 6 ounce setting only produces 3 ounces.  And even after a pod is removed, liquid drips.So I called Keurig support and the young lady was very friendly, agreed the K-Cafe was defective, and sent me an email with instructions to get a replacement under warranty.  But that turned out to be another problem.  I provided pictures of the Keurig with its serial number and copies of the Amazon invoices.  That wasn't good enough.  There had to be a hand written note on the picture of the Keurig.  So I did that and sent another email.  That wasn't good enough either.  Finally, after I mentioned that the first pictures I took, along with invoices, would have been sufficient proof in the US, Keurig finally agreed to replace the K-Cafe.I think they were just trying to tire me out and hope I would give up the battle.  If and when the new K-Cafe quits, I will not buy another Keurig."
"The machine is great but there’s no point in wasting your money on the smart features.  You need to wait for it to scan your pod every use and in the event it does recognize the pod, the information it provides is useless.  It’s just there to get you buying more pods. I originally thought the auto start feature would be nice in the morning but it doesn’t actually start making the coffee when you schedule it to. You still need to open the app to get it going.  Might as well just go to the machine and start it manually.  In short, get the dumb model."
"Less than a year in and not satisfied.  Sucks, can't return it, but searching for something higher quality that grinds real coffee.- Keeps telling me to add water, but the water tank is full.  I have to repeatedly turn it off and on just to brew coffee, killing the ""Push Button, Get Coffee"" concept.- Coffee tastes ok, but sometimes there's a hint of burned plastic (k-Cup).- The frother only works with specific milks/creamers, took a while to find one that would froth.- Thought I would use smart features, didn't.- K-Cups are not recycle-able."
"After connecting it to the internet, creating an account, downloading the app, I was ready to run the cleaning brew. It started, said there was an error and went dead. Oh, and there was the smell of something burning. When I looked up how to reset the machine, I was sent to a video where you need to take the whole thing apart. What a waste of money!"
"My wife loves these. This is our 3rd one because they only last for about 1500-2000 cups of coffee. We follow all the suggested maintenance, but they start acting wonky, like making less coffee than usual, or the latest one (this one), no longer foams up milk, although it's still making a decent cup of coffee.We may be done with pods. I have a full pot maker that holds hot water and it makes a pot in about the time this makes a cup. It last twice as long and costs half as much. She's finally started to come over to my way of thinking about coffee makers."
"If you love coffee, get a Nespresso. I had a Keurig for years and was satisfied. Then I tried a Nespresso, which I loved but after it no longer worked, I got this Keurig. What I have come to understand is that Keurig coffee tastes like water compared to Nespresso coffee. The Nespresso coffee has a thicker consistency. The Virtuo will only last you about a year and a half, however, and descaling is complicated. The Essenza Mini is less expensive and makes Lungo and espresso shots. Two Lungos makes a bit more than a standard cup. Also, you can buy metal capsules for it by AOZBZ on Amazon and they work fantastically well but get CAPMESSO Espresso Foils rather than using the foils the capsules come with. I gave this Keurig to a refugee family from Afghanistan after just using it a few times as it's fine just not nearly as good as the Nespresso coffee."
Lasted a year...ish. I didn't use it all summer and the first brew last week took it out. It was out of warranty.
"Loved this machine.However, after 9 months it no longer turns on and is broken. The troubleshooting videos did not resolve my issue."
"First the good, it makes good coffee and the frother is nice!The bad:You cannot disable BrewID.  It takes 10 seconds to sense the coffee pod before you can brew.  I know that seems trivial but count to 10 slowly while staring at the coffee maker each morning. I asked support if I can disable, and their suggestion was to disconnect from wifi.  I did that but the BrewID still waits 10 seconds before you can brew.  It is a cool idea, and if you believe it is worth the wait more power to you. Keurig please update the software to allow users to bypass BrewID and brew instantly!  The other complaint is you cannot drop a reusable pod with your own ground coffee into the machine. You have to use a special one from Keurig that requires unsnapping the pod holder and snapping in a different one. It makes it a real pain to go back and forth between reusable pods and store-bought.I should have bought the regular model!  Slowly count to 10 before closing this review. LOL!"
"I really wanted to like this machine especially since it has the attached milk frother.  But it simply didn't work.  As soon as you turn on the machine, you are asked to create an account and connect the brewer to the account.  The first day things worked reasonably well although it does take more time than I would like to get a cup of coffee.  Day two, nothing.  Turned on the machine and immediately got an error message.  Turned off the machine and turned it back on.  Same error message.  My husband tried it and managed to get the machine working.  But instead of a 10 ounce cup of coffee, the brewer dumped 20 ounces of hot coffee all over our counter.  All we wanted was a good, hot, simple cup of coffee!  The machine has been returned."
The nice pictures show frothed milk or non dairy creamer.  This was primarily my main reason for purchase and the frother did not froth on any of the 3 settings.
"After using my Keurig coffee maker for seven years, my machine went bad. I was very happy with it.However, after ordering another machine through Amazon, I found the machine I purchased was malfunctioning.I returned the unit and purchased a more expensive model. Upon receiving it, it started to malfunction in the same way.The machine would start to brew and then power completely off in the beginning of the brew cycle.Unfortunately it started this after the return date had expired.I contacted Keurig and after a long drawn out process I received a replacement.Much to my disappointment, the replacement is doing the same thing.I called  the Company back to request a refund so I can go buy a K-cup machine from another company.Basically all they will do is keep sending me inferior replacement machines. They won’t offer a refund.Additionally they want me to send the defective machines back for analysis.This would be fine. I even took a video of the machine malfunctions so they could actually see what the problem is.They evidently are not interested.I have been on the phone several times trying to get them to send me return labels which for some reason they can’t seem to figure out how to do.They have no problem sending me e-mails trying to sell me their products however.In addition, every time you call, you call a different part of the Globe.They always tell you they have to transfer you to the service department only to come back after putting you on hold God knows how many times, to tell you that no one will answer and they will call back within twenty for hours.The last time, that twenty for hours reached seven days before I called them back. This is the end result.So, I will be copying this review and posting it on every social media site I can find, to warn customers to stay away from this inferior company."
We bought this in January of 2024 and it only lasted until September before it died.
Too cheaply made.  Worth $79.00 not the $150. I paid.  Works okay but doubt it will last even a year - just too cheaply made
"Makes great coffee, like all Keurigs.  However, the frother has started to not work properly the last few months.  Bought in June and its October now.  Frother starts up, gets to speed, and then slows down resulting in low or no froth.  If frother worked as it did at first, I would give five stars."
"22 Nov 2024.  The HB Flex Brew 5-in-1 I ordered 2 days ago was delivered today 22 Nov 2024.  After inspecting all parts, cleaning the parts as directed,  I set up the coffee maker.  The first issue I found was the inability/difficulty in moving the water tank from the back of the machine to the side of the machine.  I'm unable to remove the space saver on the side to facilitate having tank on the side of the machine. I set the machine to brew 12 cups using the pot.  Despite the tank being filled to the 60oz maximum, the machine only brewed 10 cups.  I then set the machine to brew a 12 oz cup of coffee using a coffee pod.  The machine didn't brew the 12 ozs with a continuous stream, but in 3 oz increments with long pauses in between each of the 3ozs. I then brewed a 12oz cup using the single-serve insert with no coffee, and using only water and had no issues.  One last observation.  While the machine is brewing, there is a lot of steam emanating from the top of the machine and causing the cabinet over the machine to sweat.  Over time this will damage the cabinet.  If the functionality does not improve, I will return the machine.  I will submit a followup comment with a recommendation to buy or not buy."
"Six days in and it backed up and there was water everywhere, but my cup. I went to lookfor a customer service number and there wasn’t one. You are to only contact them by email. Their reply was automated and noted the response time would be up to a week. I am going back to my Kuerig.  They have live people to talk to."
"We like the slim design.  Good for countertops with limited space.We don't like how super slow the coffee drips from the coffee pod feature. Its soooo slow, staff was thinking it was broken. Not understanding the Cold Brew feature either. Its like watery coffee. Are we doing something wrong? Any suggestions out there?We have not tried making a pot of coffee yet though."
"Have had this coffee maker for just over 3 weeks, I loved it until this morning. I ran a full pot like usual, using filtered water, and at some point between getting our first and second cup the machine decided it needed a cleaning cycle to be ran. The machine turned off and didn’t keep the pot I had ran hot. I was forced to run the cleaning cycle, that takes almost an hour, before I could run another pot of hot coffee and have the keep warm function work. It’s going back!"
"Once the 2 hours are up to keep the pot warm, you can’t turn it back on to keep the pot warm. If you make a pot of coffee and someone wants a different coffee and you make an individual cup the heating pad goes off and there’s no way to turn it back on to keep the pot warm. A major flaw in this coffee pot. I’d return it but, I’ve used it too many times. Had snow storm and couldn’t get out."
"2 stars for looking nice, easy to navigate settings, keeps coffee warm for 4 hours, the rest is horrible. When set for 12 cups, always overflows, carafe should be on the front, this side thing is awful. The reservoir is not the easiest to maneuver. The grounds basket is small, so getting a good bold coffee is not really possible,  even on bold setting, because basket is very small/shallow.  Have not tried the single cup or iced drink features.  For me, the design is an epic let down."
This is my 2nd flex brew unit. The first one quit working after a month. The 2nd one is now making a loud whistling sound while brewing. I'm worried this one is going to quit.
"I love the size and looks of this machine, but after trying to use it for a week. I have to say no way and returning it tomorrow. I am so disappointed, 1st. In the 12 oz carafe the coffee comes out lukewarm, I like my coffee HOT, not tepid. so that right there is a deal breaker. 2nd. there where constant grounds in my cup making a K cup. finally, realized the needle that pierces the k cup is huge, so grounds get in the coffee. 3rd. no matter how small an amount of my favorite coffee i put into the single brew, it overflows and makes a big mess. Could not once get a cup of coffee. I followed all instruction did all the trouble shoots. Nothing would fix that problem. So now I'm tired of cleaning and not getting any coffee. And as far as iced drinks, it is easier to just put ice cubes in a glass and pour your drink over it. So, back it has to go. Too bad. I really liked the design. But don't need the headache."
"The first time I used it, I put a K-cup in it and had a catastrophic failure; the K-cup exploded. I was using a K-cup from a pack of 120, and I have 17 left, so I tried again. Again, I had a catastrophic explosion in the coffee pot, which took me half an hour to clean up. I do not trust this coffee maker. Do not recommend."
I paid full price for this coffee maker because I wanted brand new. Well what I got for full price was a used coffee maker. While setting it up I noticed it looked like it had been used because water marks and marks on the front where the buttons are. Then I plugged it in and accidentally turned it on and it started brewing with a little water coming out of it. If I wanted a used machine I would have purchased a used one at discount. I didn’t pay $106.00  for something that got used and returned by someone else.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I thought this was going to be a less expensive option to replace a 3-year old Keurig K-Duo machine, however it has so many issues.The brewing is so loud and creates so much steam. If you have under a wood cabinet it will ruin it. Only brews 9.5 cups for a carafe but uses the entire reservoir of water. K cup option is inconsistent, sometimes a good cup and sometimes has many grounds, sometimes very weak/watery. Very disappointing as I always thought this brand was a good one. I’m trying customer service but will end up returning."
"Poor single brew. Customer service slow and gives directions. Single brew clogs with each cup, overflows and hard to clean area ( small outflow). Requested a replacement, will see if machine flaw or complete design flaw."
bought 9-23-24 quit working properly 11-5-24.
Less than 2 weeks and the pod sectuon stopped working.
I’ve returned 2. They leak out the bottom of water reservoir.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                I REALLY wanted to like this dual station coffee brewer/maker.I have not had a problem with Hamilton Beach, ever really. And this coffee maker really seemed like a great deal, and it seemed very versatile. It seemed to be so capable of doing so much. But only ONE time has it brewed through the single serve front part.All of the sudden, after brewing my first single cup of coffee (which was a good cup of coffee), no matter what I do, no matter what button I push, it only does a pot of coffee now.It does not make any single servings anymore (like you can see in my video). It totally bypasses the front section, and ONLY uses the carafe station. That is NOT a FlexBrew, whatsoever.This thing looks great, and seems to be very sturdy made, but it will not do a Single serve now, after the first serving...Not Good.I mean, I REALLY wanted to like this thing!I don't."
I have purchased Cuisinart coffee makers for many years. This last purchase I can tell the quality is not the same. The lid will not close correctly on the glass pot. I have reached out to Cuisinart and not received any help at this point.
"In use 2 weeks.  It makes a decent cup of coffee, even for a small batch (3-5 cups), so no complaint in that department.  But it doesn't feel like it's going to last.  knobs feel like they'll give out easily, as does the on/off switch.I don't like that the water reservoir lacks a window either.  A couple of times, I got distracted and forgotten I'd already put a small amount of water in for 2-4 cups - a window to check the amount going in would have prevented that hassle.  In addition, the opening to pour water into the reservoir is too narrow:  a lot has gone over the back of the machine to make a mess on the counter.The high heat setting on the warmer doesn't seem to remain high; and I don't like that you have to turn the option dial to get it to auto off after brewing:  it'd be nice if it just had the auto off with the heat option.All in all, I just don't think the machine is worth $100.  I'm sorry I went with the heat option on the warmer and the small batch setting instead of getting a maker with a bloom option - especially if I'm right and it doesn't hold up for long.  The quality of the brew isn't noticeable enough to make up for the shortcomings."
"This was my 5th one in 25 years I had one in the office and one at home. Had to replace both about 10 years ago. Needed to replace the home one last year.This one keeps lighting the self clean button while making coffee. I have repeatedly cleaned it… it still lights up.I bought it last October, it is now September. A year is not good enough."
"How can a coffee pot not be user friendly?  We replaced our old Cuisinart with this one.  The old one was ten years old and one day went up in smoke, literally.  The problem with the new unit is how you measure the  amount of water you put into it.  Instead of a glass window on the outside where you can easily see how much water you put in, the window is eliminated in the new unit.  Instead, there are several plastic tabs inside the pot that indicate the water level once filled to that level.  So, to set up the pot, one has to peer down into  the cavity where the water is held and then pour water to the desired level.  i plan to send the pot back for its poor design."
"I think this machine brews a good cup of coffee, but it has flaws. I don't like that it has an LCD screen that is difficult to read.  I didn't even know LCD screens were still used. I also don't like that where you pour the water in is narrow and you have to look into it to see how much water has been placed.  Cuisinart probably left out the water level for aesthetics, but I prefer the water level on the outside of the machine where I can see it. Update this an add an LED display and this would get five stars."
"I don't like this model of Cuisinart coffee maker. Wish I knew, The flavor of the coffee is much differant then my previous Cuisinart coffee maker. Wish I knew that there is No way to turn off the audible tone which peeps 5X rather loud when coffee is complete. Wish I knew that the number of cups when filling the reservoir with water was on the inside and not clearly marked on the outside.. I find it difficult to read while trying to look down into the resevoir to pour the water. Now I have to fill the carafe with water first so I can visiable see the cups then pour it into the reservoir making this an extra step for me. The  Brew Pause is suppose to be a feature on this model,unfortunately they recommand you use the feature before the cycle has completed. Yes, it does tell you to read the instructions before using but I've always purchased a Cuisinart didn't realize this particular model would be such a pain :("
"If you like mediocre, weak flavored coffee, this is the one to buy.  I had high hopes for this model but the coffee that it produces is extremely weak in flavor.  There is no ""bold"" setting on this machine so you are stuck with a bland cup of coffee that lacks in flavor, taste, and body.  The controls are functional (rotary dial) but not as easy to use as a simple push button.  The clock is not backlit and very small so is not useful for anything other than setting the timer.  We purchased this after our older Cuisinart 3200 died 2x in 3.5 years.  The 3200 makes very good coffee but sadly didn't last very long due to leaking that took out the heating element.  Looks like we are back to a 3200 if that is what it takes to brew a good pot of coffee.  It shouldn't be this difficult."
Well started out a great coffee maker actually still good coffee maker but all of the letters to read Around the knobs are gone a year into the game how do I know what to do well I had to go back to Google but that's not the point the point is this sucks for real
"It makes good hot coffee, I don't have a thermometer to measure but it seems to come up to and maintain the proper brewing temp quickly. I also like the #4 cone filter because of its better extraction especially if your not making full pots like I make 1/2 - 3/4 pots most of the time. I'm not a fan of having a ton of bells and whistles I just like an on switch with auto shut off.Cons - imho there are some design trade offs I don't like.1). I knew about the small opening in the water reservoir but unfortunately I disregarded reviews because I keep my coffee maker next to the sink and use the pullout faucet to fill it. However, besides the small opening there is no window in the reservoir to see its fill level. Instead, it has a stepped sort of dipstick mounted inside the reservoir. This dipstick is pretty much impossible to see below the 10 cup mark without a flashlight and completely impossible to see while filling. So, now I (HAVE TO) fill using the carafe which also has its share of issues I'll get into later.2). The top cover has a hinge that in open position puts it behind the machine so that the condensation drips on my countertop behind the coffee maker. Btw it drips just as much whether you open it to discard the used grounds next morning or right after brewing.3). The clock is LCD not LED and it's not backlit. So, it's also pretty much impossible to see without a flashlight or bending over directly in front of it.4). The carafe has multiple issues. The fill marks on the carafe are adequate but a bit fine for my 60 years old eyes. They are visible with direct front lighting but disappear with indirect lighting, glare, and water drops on the carafe whether inside or out. The marks on the carafe are also off by 1 cup to the reservoirs dipstick. The lid snaps onto the carafe, it does not have a hinge so you CANNOT open it with your thumb like 99% of carafes. Why is that a problem? Because the opening is only 8mm. When you try to fill through an 8mm hole you will inevitably miss a little bit one way or the other causing water to spray randomly about. So now you have another inconvenience to unsnap the lip to fill the carafe with water then reattach it before brewingSo to summarize, this makes great coffee. But for me there are too many design trade offs that make this coffee machine to inconvenient for me. The small footprint makes a small fill opening. No fill window no leak but to difficult to see how full it is. Small opening on the lid keeps coffee from steaming off but without a hinge the snap on/off lid makes it more inconvenient to fill. And I suppose the top opens behind the machine to give better access to fill its small reservoir opening but then of course it drips on the countertop"
"5 stars for the adjustable warming plate temperature and 3 stars for the rest. In the photo are my 10-year old trusty white Cuisinart, which developed a leak, and the replacement DCC-1200P1, bought in 8/2024 and which brewed its first pot for the picture.On the plus side, the new one's redeeming feature is its adjustable warming plate temperature. On the minus side, the old one looks better, and has a reservoir window, which the new one lacks, and needs. The DCC-1200P1's reservoir is so hard to see into that the manufacturer added interior white measuring tabs along one side of the interior of the reservoir. This seems like a design guaranteed to cause problems for people with water quality issues and visual frustration for most everyone else. I always make a full pot and have good water so it's less of an issue for me.While it's good to see various brands now offering adjustable warming plate temperature, I stayed with Cuisinart as they've performed well for me over the last 25+ years. I favor dark roasts, which are sensitive to overheating and can taste scorched if overheated. Standard warming plates are all too hot for most dark roasts, but the DCC-1200P1's adjustable heat level saves the day.***UPDATE*** Nov. 2024: Minus 4 stars -- this item is defective, 10 weeks after purchase (and thus outside Amazon's return window), the unit no longer turns on. I called Cuisinart and while speaking with the agent, the unit turned on once after I had turned it upside down to inspect the serial number on the bottom. Once off the phone with the agent, the unit would not turn on again. I will have to return it to the manufacturer for a replacement. Have had many products from this company and never had a Cuisinart appliance die before, except from old age, so if this issue is indicative of the company's new quality control, I'll likely pass on further Cuisinart purchases."
"This is the 3rd Cusinart 12 cup coffee maker I’ve purchased and owned them for years.  Have an exact same model at a second home and it works great.  The original one I purchased some years back after going thru the distilled vinegar and water cleaning process extremely carefully stopped brewing coffee after the second pot.  And yes I change out the charcoal filters and only use filtered water.  This third Cusinart (identical to one in my second home) digital clock would not keep time after the second day.  Did everything right.  Delayed program stayed the same and next morning woke up to a perfect pot of coffee.  The second day noticed the clock was off.  Reprogrammed it.  The coffee maker was not unplugged and there were no power outages.  The programmed time to turn on and brew remained the same.  But noticed that the clock was off.  Reprogrammed it.  Came back just out of curiosity to see if it was keeping time.  Nope.  Reprogrammed the digital clock numerous times and it can’t keep time.  Makes great coffee but only good for manual on or off as the digital clock is defective.  Purchased this new.  Hopefully this is just a fluke and a unit that got by Cusinarts quality control.  Had registered this under Cusinarts 3 year warranty but since only a few days have passed from receiving this unit requested a replacement unit and label from Amazon.  Hopefully the replacement unit works properly.  It’s actually a big hassle unpacking this unit and than have to repack it and drop it off at UPS.  Not to mention before using it followed instructions by putting both new filters charcoal and coffee filters and running a full pot of water through it before brewing the first pot.  Have no idea how difficult it will be to repackage in original packaging, box and outer shipping box.  There’s at least 4 hours of my life gone that cannot be replaced.  Wished I had purchased it from Costco or another brick and mortar retailer.  Let them figure out how to pack it back up in original packaging and outer shipping box, printing return label and transporting over to UPS store."
"I had an older model that I loved and tried to replace but ended up ordering this one, and I wish I would have returned it. The clock/time display is very difficult to read because it’s not lit, so at night the numbers are dark on a dark background. I have to turn my phone flashlight on to read the display. The lettering for all of the controls is tiny, and again, very difficult to read. I don’t have a problem with my eyes at all, but this coffee maker sure makes it seem like I do. The last thing is that there is not a water level indicator, so you have to use the carafe to fill the machine so you know how much water you’re using. I wish I could have found the other model I used to have. I loved that coffee maker. I don’t recommend this one. Another note, I don’t recommend the auto start insulated carafe machines because you have to fill the carafe with hot water to “prime” the carafe so that it keeps your coffee hot enough, but it’s not helpful if you do it at night while you prepare the coffee for the next day. Because it loses its heat overnight, so the coffee in the thermal carafe doesn’t stay hot enough."
"This machine works very well.  There are two reasons why I give it three stars because unlike the previous Cuisinart I had on which the delay timer broke, this one does not have a view panel to see the water level when you fill it up.  You have to look down the water reservoir to see the level markers.  This may not be such a big deal if you currently just fill the carafe with the desired amount of water and then pour it in.  I like to use filtered or bottled water so it is an extra step to fill the carafe and then pour in when on my old one I could just pour from my water pitcher or water bottle and see from the side how much I was pouring in.  The second reason I don't like this machine as much as my old grind and brew model  is because you don't seem to be able to lift out the container basket that the gold filter basket sits in.  That means you have to soak up any condensation or coffee with a paper towel after each use before whatever gunk dries in there and creates a film of residue. (Strangely, the inner basket has a plastic loop sticking out the top which leads you to believe you can easily lift this out.  I tried, but it doesn't lift out.  Now, I am not pulling really hard because I don't want to break it, but maybe it really does come out after pressing a secret button or something?  I will search the instruction manual to see for sure and will revise this review if I find a way to lift it free without damaging the parts.)  Anyway, this bothers me because I don't like any water or residue sitting in there between uses for any potential mold or gross matter to accumulate.  With the grind and brew, you could lift out the plastic cartridge and wash or rinse it.  This might not be an issue for you either, but since I am a short person and this coffee pot sits under an overhanging cabinet, I have to pull the machine as far out as possible to both fill water and try to see down the water reservoir and the plastic container to see what is what.  Even standing on my toes this is difficult to do, so for me at 5' 3"" that is annoying.You might wonder why I didn't just buy another grind and brew.  Well, whether you use the grinder or not, heavy condensation collects in the grinder part, so you are going to have to remove it and clean it after each use.  Now, you may think, hey, I use my coffee pot every day, there's no funky stuff growing in there.  Check again, especially in the grinder.  Somehow, if I didn't clean or dry that part out, slimey stuff seemingly  came from nowhere which is now my concern with the cartridge basket that won't lift out from under the filter basket on this particular machine here.  I just figured I would use my separate grinding machine whenever I needed it to save this extra cleaning step.Besides those two annoying features, this is a really good coffee maker."
"3rd time I have purchased this model as it has been quality and lasts long time. When unpackaged, things seemed different but could not figure out what. The pot lid failed to lock in place after two pots made and dumped coffee on two guests. Called Cuisinart for warranty and they will send me replacement lid in 10 days.  Don't think it will fix it. New pot might but friends who have this model say they have had same issue and ended up super gluing to pot to keep on as replacements don't work.  Quality is less that in years past so rating is 2.  Won't recommend or purchase again. Looking for new type."
"I've commented on others' reviews, but wanted to get this up there where people can see it readily.  I liked this coffee maker a LOT since I got it just over a year ago.  It has a few little quirks, which you'll read about in other reviews, but made good coffee and I hadn't had any problems with it.  UNTIL last week.  It auto-brewed like normal and my husband had taken his coffee and left the pot with the remaining coffee (2-3 cups worth) for me to drink later.  I came into the kitchen perhaps 20 minutes after the brewing to find the pot BOILING...literally, a HARD, rolling boil, there was a little smoke and the kitchen smelled like burning wires.  I cringe every time I think of what ""could"" have happened if I hadn't been there!  I removed the pot, unplugged the unit, and poured water into the reservoir in hopes of cooling it down - which worked.I was outside the return time for Amazon so I contacted Cuisinart to inquire about the 3-year limited warranty.  They ""normally"" charge a $10 replacement fee, plus require you to pay to send the old unit back to them.  They were willing to waive the $10 return fee, but I paid $9.95 to send the old one back.  I haven't yet gotten the replacement, but after doing more research, I've decided that I don't feel safe using it.  I've contacted the Consumer Products Safety Commission (1-800-698-2772) and suggest that anyone with a similar problem do so.  I think that this coffee maker should be recalled.I'm adding more here in hopes that this review gets refreshed and up to the top again!  In addition, I've commented the following on another's review:""I'm one of those who posted in an earlier posting about the fire hazard on this coffeemaker.  I am SHOCKED that it is still being sold!  People - if you are looking at this coffeemaker, I suggest you keep looking.  Yes, it makes great coffee and looks great, as many reviewers have said.  However, please give more weight to the safety issues than the coffee or the looks.  As far as I can tell there have been no injuries from this...but it seems just a matter of time.  If you insist on this coffee maker, don't ever leave it alone on the stay warm setting!"""
We were excited to get this coffee pot and assumed a Cuisinart pot would be 5 star all the way.  This one just wasn't.  We loved the retro look to the pot and it was very attractive sitting on the counter.  It made coffee quickly and was easy to operate.  The temperature was just too cool.  When it initially made a pot we measured the temp at 143 degrees.  After sitting in the carafe for an hour the temp was 155.  Just not what we wanted.  We returned this coffee maker and purchased a different model of Cuisinart.  The coffee brewed in it at 193 degrees.  Much more to our liking.
"Was happy with the unit overall.  The LED is a bit hard to read but otherwise it worked fine for 11 months until it stopped brewing out of the blue.  While a normal person would simply go out and buy a new unit, I decided to make a warranty claim on principles.  Given this is 2023 one would imagine they have an easy online process LIKE EVERY OTHER COMPANY ON THE PLANET.  But Cuisinart hates their customers and wants us all to live in 1975 so they expect us to either make a phone call during business hours or MAIL IT IN with a ten dollar check to cover their return shipping!  WHAT?!??The agent was pleasant on the phone and it looks like I will be able to get a new unit sent over, but it cost me 20+ minutes to get an effective resolution that should have taken me 30 seconds with an online form or even a chatbot.  Then they required me to actually cut the cord on the machine, and email them a photo of the machine with the cut cord to verify that the machine is dead and eligible for replacement.While they have competence in making small kitchen appliances, they are inept at process efficiency and customer technology.Now I know why their machines cost $100."
"This would be a 5 star coffee pot were it not for a major design flaw with the water tank.  The tank has no ‘window’ so the only way to know how much water is in it is to peer down from the top and even then it is really hard to tell because of the awkward markings for the water line.  You have to use your pot to fill the water tank if you want a fairly accurate measurement.  Really don’t know how this one passed design review.  I would not buy this pot again, and not sure how long we’ll keep this one, because of the poor design even tho everything else about the pot is great."
"This is my second Cuisinart Brew Central coffee maker.  I used one of the original Brew Stations for a few years.  My wife bought this one.  I don't think that I would have done so.  IT MAKES GOOD COFFEE, but.... If good coffee is all you want for a higher priced unit then you should be happy with this one.  Cuisinart missed a HUGE opportunity to make a great coffee maker.  This unit shares some of the weaknesses of the original and they could have fixed it.  Instead they compounded the weaknesses.Number one complaint is the programming window which is tiny and dark and unless you are in direct sunlight requires a flashlight to read.  Forget the clock.  It can't be seen without bending over and looking closely.  How much would it have cost to use a back-lit or bright display?  Secondly, the controls on this unit are smaller than the original and are therefore harder to handle.  I have to look closely to distinguish the white line that indicates the setting.  I sure hope the white line doesn't come off or I'll have no clue as to how to set it.  This unit and the original are hard to pour water into if you want to make a full pot, which is what I do 98% of the time.  The original would spill out a little overflow in the back and pool on the counter top, eventually depositing rust under the unit.  I kept a paper towel under the unit to wick out all the water that always overflowed unless you poured it in verrrrry slowly.  This unit is better but it lacks the water level indicator on the outside so you can see how to add the water.  Instead, this unit has little white blocks on the inside of the water tank.  This requires you to lean over and look down into the tank to know how much water to pour into the tank.  Now water in Texas is clear so I have to make sure the overhead light is on or get out the flashlight again to add the correct amount of water.  The original Brew Station did not have a carafe and it was easy to dispense the coffee by setting your cup under the spout and dispensed it almost hands free.  This worked well, except...  They really needed a little tiny light underneath because coffee in Texas is black and it was easy to run it over especially in a dark colored cup, but I seriously digress.  The carafe solves the problem, but returns to the age old method of dispensing.  This unit is much slimmer and takes up less room, but for its' drawbacks, its' basic unfriendliness, I would not have purchased it again.  However, I am enjoying the coffee with my sour grapes."
"I've been using Cuisinart 12-cup programmable coffeemakers for longer than I can remember.  Over 20 years. The coffee always tasted wonderful, and once when I had an issue with a carafe, the company sent me a new carafe at no charge. Recently  I needed to replace my current Cuisinart coffeemaker with a new one, and could see from photos that the design was now a bit different, but hoped for the best. Although the ability to modify the resting temperature is a nice new feature, I think the new design is very flawed due to the lack of a water window. (Tip: don't use the carafe to fill the water, use something narrower such as a travel mug.)  But most importantly,  the coffee did not taste good.  I even did a vinegar/water cleanse which improved it slightly, but not enough. I gave it three tries before giving up. Not fun to rebox it for returning, but I managed it. Hope others have better luck with the flavor."
"We’ve only had this coffee maker a touch over 9 months and the pot cracked today between my 1st and 2nd mug of coffee.  I made my coffee and filled my big mug as usual.  When I came back for my second mug, most of the coffee was on the counter and there was a big crack in the pot.  I had to order another pot and they’re not cheap, especially since they’re made in China, as is their competitions which is at least $10 cheaper.  Pretty disappointed.  They also have a filter that they say needs replacing every so often which adds to the cost. This shouldn’t be necessary since I use only purified bottle water."
"I want to first note that I have MANY small kitchen appliances made by cuisinart (food processor, ice cream maker, etc.) as well as pots and pans, and have never had any problems with any of them (and my food processor is 15 years old).  So I was excited to see this coffee maker made by Cuisinart have Consumer Reports' approval, and thus I purchased it.1.  I receive the coffee maker, and I immediately notice that it would drip liquid when I pulled the carafe out.  I called the company, and they asked me to first soak the top of the carafe and the basket in vinegar, and to try again.  When I explained that there could be no build up because it did this the first time I ever used, it, they still insisted I do this vinegar step.  So I did.  Of course, it did not work2.  I then call back, and explain what happened, and the customer service rep was very nice and sent me a new basket, completely free shipping and everything.  I receive the basket, try it, and liquid still dripped when I pulled the carafe out during brewing.3.  I call back, and explain the situation to the customer rep, and tell him a new discovery, which is when I held a paper towel under the drip (like I pull the carafe out and it drips and drips and drips), the liquid is clear water, not coffee.  So then he asked me to do something very smart: he told me to fill the basket with water over the sink.  I did so, and it did not leak.  Then he told me to take the basket full of water and insert it into the coffee maker.  I then put the carafe in its place, and then pulled it out:  no leaking.So at this point the customer service rep says it's not the basket, and I agree:  he decides it's steam from the coffee maker, and then asks if am I careful to not have it brewing under a cabinet.  I actually do not, because I don't like steam damaging my cabinets, and so I tell him I want a new coffee maker because when I pull the carafe out, it is not supposed to be leaking anything.  The customer service rep then becomes VERY rude and says:  ""there is no defect in the coffee machine.  The basket does not leak; the coffee maker makes coffee.""  I tell him that is ridiculous, and after much arguing I tell him I want to talk to his manager.He leaves, and then comes back and tells me his manager says that since it's a new coffee maker, he will send me a new coffee maker, but ONLY once (again, very rude and condescending), and then I would have to pay a $10 shipping charge, and they would like me to send the original coffee maker back.  I was like, fine, so I do so.4.  I receive the new coffee maker, an this one works just fine, which tells me there is something completely defective with the original coffee maker.  So now I am annoyed I even paid $10 to have it shipped to me.  But as I'm packing up the original coffee maker to send back, I see that they want me to pay the postage to send back their defective machine!!  So I was like, what?~!?  So I call, and they say yes, I need to pay for the shipping to send it back.  I'm like, are you kidding me - you want me to send back your defective machine, and pay for the postage?  The customer service rep said that it is in the warranty that all shipping is paid for by the customer.  I ask to speak to the manager, and after arguing back and forth, I ask what if I refuse to send it back?  They tell me that then my warranty is void on the machine!!I am unlikely to send it back, because I only paid $60 or something for the thing to begin with, and I've already paid $10 to have a new one shipped to me, and then another $10 to ship back, and then if it breaks again, I need to pay $20 round trip for a new machine?  At that point I need to just buy another one.I am disgusted with Cuisinart's policy, and will be writing to them to tell them so (although I now read others who have had the same problems)."
I replaced my Cuisinart with another and still have the same problems.  The one I purchased was actually older than the one I had.  Coffee makers in general are just not like they used to be.  It makes coffee and I am used to the all the quirks so I do not want to complain too much.  It is what it is!
"I've had mine for 6 months and can say this is not for anyone with poor vision.The dials are very, very small and the labels are even smaller. Have a magnifying glass handy.There's poor design behind the water tank and level indicator. 6 cups on the carafe does not reach the 6-cup indicator in the tank. It is nearly impossible to guage your water level by looking down into the black tank.A simple see-thru indicator on the outside would have been a much more user-friendly choice.The clock is teeny-tiny and not backlit. I don't bother to set it because I can't see it from any angle except straight on and closer than 2 feet away. Completely useless.All the indicators likewise have very small print and are hard to see unless you're directly in front of the face of it.I've figured out how to work around these flaws and make a decent cup. The coffee is good, but it took time to be able to use i this coffeemaker successfully.I don't even bother with things like setting it up the night before because it's just stupid hard to do.I strongly urge seniors to avoid this item.I also strongly urge Cuisinart to get it together. There's no excuse for allowing this level of design incompetence to get to the market."
"The machine makes coffee very well.  At issue are the water level indicator buried in the fill tank, difficult to read.  This is a change from our previous machine.  Bad design.  Also, the small readout screen is very difficult to read.  Again, another bad change from our previous machine.  We won’t buy another coffee maker from this company and you shouldn’t either"
"A vacation property we stayed at had this coffee maker in the kitchen and it made a decent cup of coffee for our brief visit. Purchased this item after reading generally positive reviews. Now for my experience...this coffee maker has been a HUGE letdown. First and foremost, there seems to be a problem with the filter being that it doesn't always drain fast enough into the coffee pot resulting in an OVERFLOW that works its way into the interior of the device so that coffee is actually INSIDE the base of the beneath the pot. I've had to leave a towel permanently beneath the coffee maker for the times it overflows. I also like using paper filters since I feel it removes more of the ground but thought perhaps the paper filter was causing some of the problem so I switched to the gold metal cone filter that comes with the device. I purchased ground specific for a metal cone filter but find that some small grounds still get through leaving a black mess in that last gulp or two of coffee. Despite switching to the metal filter we still had problems with overflow! The pot also does not seem to fit naturally, at times, under the base such that the lid depresses the filter switch to allow the coffee to flow into the pot. God forbid you make this mistake where the pot is slightly off or tilted then the overflow is ridiculous. A few other points, as mentioned by others the water is difficult to pour into the reservoir due to the location at the top-back-right of the machine. Also, if coffee gets under the metal band circling the base of the pot it is near impossible to get clean. I shouldn't have to think about my brew. I want to 'set it and forget it' but that's not the case with this machine. I purchased this around October of 2011 and as of this writing, 3 months later, am now looking for a new device. Be warned!Update -After talking with customer service they decided I had a faulty product. They sent me a replacement and wanted me to return the original to them but since that would have cost me additional $$ I just tossed it. The replacement works exactly as I'd expect. I'm raising my rating from 1 star to 3 stars, the reason not higher is because they clearly have a quality control issue and woe unto thee who gets one of the duds."
"Overall ok. Not sure it’s worth the extra money. For the cost, I would have hoped it would have lasted longer. As others have mentioned, the lack of a window for the water is a huge design flaw. I do like the option of the 4 cup or less brew for when you want to make a little extra in the afternoon. Would buy again if it was deeply discounted."
"This coffee maker makes fantastic coffee and the timer, once set works great. The problem I have with this coffee maker is that the display where you set the time etc is super small. It also doesn't have backlighting. So your lighting needs to be good in the room where you're setting it. And if you wear contacts or glasses you definitely cannot do it without them. All in all, if they would've just made the display bigger or backlit or both that would make it so much better. The display is also grey with black numbers. Not much contrast."
"Like others have mentioned: a pain to pour in the water, I measure the amount of water in the carafe,hard to figure out the inside water level, no smooth way to remove the handle- I would not buy it again -"
Like the maker but it has a lot of fall back. One is the pot you have to remove the lid entirely. It does not just flip up. It is hard to pour from dribbles especially trying to fill the coffee maker. Coffee maker nobs or control are marked with very very small black on silver not a good choice for clarity. Get out your magnifying glass to read. Would not purchase another one
"Just got my coffee pot delivered today, however water level markers are positioned on the wrong side and very difficult to read the water level without tipping the coffee pot forward. I have added photos above ( first photo is old coffee pot & second photo is from new coffee pot)of my old Cuisineart coffee pot and new to show water level marker being on opposite side, perhaps it’s defective. Very disappointed having enjoyed my old one with no issues for many years, therefore ordering the identical coffee pot expecting the same quality product."
"Excellent, as expected.  Nice-looking unit with easy-to-use features: old design but a good one."
"I bought this unit at amazon.com in early October, 2010.  It worked flawlessly for 484 days (about 1 year, 5 months).  It made good coffee and I would agree with most of the positive reviews of this unit.  There are a number of annoying features: 1) it is very tall making it difficult to fit under the kitchen cabinets and making it impossible to fill without pulling it out from under the cabinets, 2) the lid of the carafe does not come off and the opening for filling is small, making it hard to fill, 3) the cup level indicator is inside the unit and very difficult to see and since the unit is vey tall, shorter people (5' 6"" or less) will have to stand on tiptoes to peer into it to see the level, 4) the opening for filling it with water is very small, making spills likely.  Nevertheless, we got used to all of this and it made a good cup of coffee.  Overall, we were pleased with it.We used this coffee maker 7 days/week, usually making two pots of coffee per day.On the morning of day 485, I tried to turn it on and it was completely dead; none of the indicator lights nor the clock were working.  At first, I though it had come unlpugged (it had not), then I checked whether power was coming to the wall socket (it was).  There was no prior indication that anything was wrong with it; it just seemed to have ""died quietly in its sleep"" overnight.  When I bought this unit, I had looked at many of the reviews and this type of problem seemed to be common, but most of the reviews were good and Consumer Reports rated it highly so I bought it.  I now again went over the reviews and, in retrospect, should have paid more attention to them.  I spent another several hours going thru many reviews of other makes and came to the conclusion that failure within the first two years is to be expected.  IS THIS THE NEW NORM?  Anyway, I discussed this with my wife and we concluded that it was, and decided to buy the least expesive coffee maker we could find locally in one day ... we really did not want to miss out on our coffee for even a day.My wife bought a Mr. Coffe Maker at our local ShopRite (the closest store to our home). It is the same model that is on amazon.com [Mr. Coffee DWX23 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker].  She paid $4 more than the amazon.com price.  It was easy to set up, and most notably: it was 1/2 of the price of the Cuisinart, it is not as tall as the Cuisinart, the carafe lid is large and it is easy to fill, the cup markers (on both sides of the unit) are easily visible from the outside, the opening to pour the water in is very large, and it even looks very attractive, we got it in white.  Overall, the Mr. Coffee Maker is more ""user friendly"" than the Cuisinart.  We brewed our first cup of coffee today and we noted no difference in the quality/taste of the coffee.  So, after one day, we are very pleased with our decision.And if it also fails soon, at least we have not spent that much money on it.I'll review the Mr. Coffee on amazon.com after we've been using it for a several months.UPDATE (4/23/2012): Mr. Coffee still works great, still makes great coffee, it was inexpensive and we really like it.  Mistake was buying a Cuisinart!"
"Update:I wrote my initial review of this product in August just after buying the coffee maker.  At that time I read a couple of reviews about this unit starting on fire, but I chose to ignore them because there were hundreds of very positive reveiws.  Well today my machine burned out.  Thankfully it did not start on fire, but there was a definite electrical burning smell that filled the house.  The machine seems to be fried and none the lights or clock work.To make matters worse, the customer service I received from Cuisinart was horrible.  Responses to my emails to their customer service center would take days.  It took over a month to finally get my replacement unit.  I could not believe that they actually expected me to pay shipping for the new unit as well as the cost of sending the old unit back to them.  Why should I have to pay $10 shipping when it was their product that failed?  They finally agreed to ship it for free after a lot of arguing.I will never again buy a Cuisinart product.Buyer beware.When my 14 year old Braun coffee maker finally bit the dust, I shopped and shopped to find a suitable replacement and finally settled on the Cuisinart.Overall I really like this machine, but there are a few things that I definitely preferred on the old Braun, which is no longer made...I would have bought that same model if I could have.  Any product that is used every day and lasts 14 years is pretty impressive to me.The pros:Adjustable heat setting.  This is nice for those who use cream in their coffee since you can set it to be hot enough so that even after you add cream to your coffee, you still get a good hot cup. If you drink it back, you can dial the heat back a bit so it's not lava hot on that first sip.Styling - it looks nice sitting on the counter.Excellent carafe - the carafe pours PERFECTLY...not a single drip, ever.  I also like the plastic rim around the top which offers a little protection from breaking.Adjustable auto shut off timer.  The default is two hours, but you can adjust it up to four.The cons:As many other reviewers have noted, it is a bit of a pain to pour water into.  It's not that bad, but no doubt you need to watch what you're doing or you'll end up pouring water all over the counter instead of into the machine.  I haven't missed yet, so I'd call this just a minor annoyance.  Plus, the fact that the carafe pours so nicely makes it a little easier to hit the small opening when pouring water in.Slow brew time - the good old Braun was a lot faster at making a pot.  I would say this one might take up to twice as long (just a gut feel since I can't actually time it out against the dead Braun).Carafe lid - the lid is hard to get on and off.  I have worked out a technique to be able to do it fairly easily, but it does not just easily snap into place nor does it come off very easily.Based on reviews I read about countless other machines, I do think this one might be the best one out there.  It's not quite perfect, but it is very good.  Oh, and it does brew a great cup of coffee!"
I love Cuisinart coffee makers. They brew hotter than any other brand I've owned. Hot is the most important feature to me. This coffee maker didn't disappoint on that. The one thing I hated about this machine is that you can't tell how much water you're putting in without looking into the coffee maker reservoir. There is no water level view on the outside of the machine. I'm 5.2 and this is a problem. It sits on a standard height counter and I have to stand on my toes to view the water level. But most disappointing is that the machine only lasted 16 months. I might expect that from a $29  coffee maker but I paid over 100 for this one. The Cuisinart I had before this one was refurbished and lasted 7 years! I use filtered water and clean the machine regularly but that obviously didn't prolong its life. Highly disappointed.
"It works, looks good, but the design is a 1 star. First it doesn’t have a flippy lid. I would take no stars away for this but give a flippy lid. The deal breaker for me is the visibility of controls. Tiny little nobs that you can barely see the indicator marks on. Then the tiny black lettering to mark what option you have selected. If you are direct line with it you can see them but barely. Any light reflecting of the face and you cannot tell what’s what. Then the clock they have recessed .5” into the face with no backlight. So you have to do a peeping Tom all hunched over to see it. It’s nice looking, compact space but the worst thing ever to read or select your input."
"I would like to mention, I have previously owned a similar model of Cuisinart Coffee Maker. Which lasted many years without issue. Hence leading to the purchase of this newer model. This model has had a terrible issue, which seems to be getting worse, if lots of coffee grounds ending up in the brewed coffee. Which means wasting coffee towards the end of the carafe. At a price of $99, in October 2023, I would not expect this poor of quality from this price point and from Cuisinart. I strongly DO NOT RECOMMEND this model."
"This makes a great cup of coffee. My parents have had it for more than 5 years and love it. However, I've had one major problem with it: The ""on"" switch is smooth-action, which means it doesn't ""click"" or snap into place when you flip it to ""on"". As a result, sometimes I think I have turned the machine on, but haven't pushed the switch up hard enough, so the pre-programmed brew cycle never starts and I don't have coffee ready when I get up in the morning. This is not a fun realization at 6 am, especially as I don't have time to brew a pot at that point. My parents don't use the programmed start time, so they haven't had this problem, because you can hear whether or not it's brewing if you are using the regular brew function.I'm conscious of this problem, so I make an effort to flip the switch on all the way, but it still happens periodically that I haven't quite flipped it far enough. There's a button to heat the water extra-hot when you're making a small pot, and that light will blink on if you push the button, even when the on switch isn't flipped all the way. As a result, it's even harder to notice that you've failed to flip the switch for the auto-on cycle.Even though I think this machine is easy to use and makes a great cup of coffee, the on switch is a major design flaw in my opinion."
"I accidentally threw away the manual when I unpacked it, which is fine--my previous coffee maker was a Cuisinart, and this model is similar. Plus, I downloaded the manual from the Cuisinart website, which is why I know this model is already discontinued. Anyway, I went to run a clean pot through and realized how cheaply made the face of it is--the knobs, on/off switch, and the rest all feel cheap. My last Cuisinart lasted a dozen years, so... I'd probably stick with the brand. BUT I would not buy this model. I'm tempted to give it away and get a different one. But maybe I'll luck out and it'll die on me."
"I always heard about how great Cuisinart coffee makers are and was looking to make a change after having my current Krups maker one for about 10 years.  This maker is an older design, I like that you can adjust the temp of the hot plate/carafe.  The gold tone filter is a nice touch.  Programming the time and setting the auto brew is fairly simple process.  There is no indicator on the side of the coffee pot for water level; there is a plastic water level indicator inside the water reservoir which is nice but not easy to tell what he water level is when only brewing 4 - 6 cups, but you have that on the carafe so not that big of a deal.  The major reason for rating this a 3 of 5 stars is the annoying beep that alerts you when your coffee has finished brewing - let me say once it again that the beep is annoying.  Secondly, there is no way to turn off the alert beep, unless you want to take apart the coffee maker.  I think there should be a way to turn off the beep alert, I had a way on my $40 Krups that I bought 10 years ago and paid over $50 for this one.  So I sent it back and found another brand that doesn't beep.  I am disappointing in this great appliance company that can't even add the option to turn a feature that some people will not like."
"Just bought the Cuisinart DCC-1200 very recently. I should probably have waited another week or so before writing a review but, I was so dissappointed in some of the features that I couldn't wait to put in my two cents.I went from the top selling Bunn (which finally gave out) to this machine. As I do on most purchases I went straight to Consumer Reports to help make my decision. This Cuisinart was rated #1. The Bunn, surprisingly, was waaaay down the list.Pros:1. Nice looking2. Makes a slightly better tasting cup of coffee than the Bunn3. Uses less energy than the Bunn. (the Bunn keeps water preheated at all times for faster brewing)4. Carafe is designed well for pouring. Very neat.Cons:1. Virtually impossible to pour the water into the small opening provided without spilling.2. The top flips up to access the filter and water resevoir. This means, if the machine is under a standard cabinet, you will half to pull the whole machine out completely to the edge of the (standard) counter top and then rotate ir sideways to fully open the top lid. Which you must do just to pour the water in.3. Clock is so small and dark I can't see it.4. Carafe fits so snugly under the basket due to the ""get an early cup before brewing is finished"" feature, that if you brewed a full pot, you have to be very careful not to jostle the pot and spill coffee.5. Knobs are so small and the indicator marks so hard to see, it's difficult to tell what setting you're on.I gave it a 3 star due to the fact that it does make a good cup of coffee. I definitley not overly impressed though. I'm also scratching my head at consumer reports rating system now too. The Bunn was only 10 dollars more. And even though the Bunn uses more energy, I think you come out ahead due to the fact they last so long. But I'll give this one a chance. It does have a three year warranty so we'll see."
"There are a few features that I needed before buying a good coffeemaker in addition to the obvious -- must make a good cup of coffee:- Programmable. Need to have the auto feature so coffee is ready and hot when we get up- Water gauge. Need to see how much water we can add.- Time. Good to see what time it is!- Cheat cup. Yeah, at least one of us cannot wait for the coffee to finish brewing.I turned first to Cuisinart, since many of my appliances are this brand and it is always reliable. My sister has one so I thought I'd go for it. A few things are annoying:- Yes it is programmable and I can set the time. HOWEVER, I cannot see the numbers like I did with our old coffeemaker. SOunds silly, but having a backlit display would be enormously helpful instead of using a flashlight or turning on the kitchen light.- Water gauge is impossible to see. I'd have to stand on a stool to see the numbers inside. And, it's BLACK. Like staring into the dark ocean. I use a measuring cup to add my water and ignore the useless gauge. How about an indicator that displays on the outside of the unit (again our old coffeemaker had this great feature ---- just didn't make the best coffee!!)- Cheat cup sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. Beware of cascading coffee on the hotplate if it doesn't!  Doesn't pay to cheat.So, why did we keep it? The coffee is hot and well-brewed. Also, the changeable charcoal water filter and the self-clean reminder are good items to have, even though we only use spring water in the machine.Up to you if you choose to purchase. Know what you are getting and not getting, though. Happy sipping!"
"I so wanted to like this coffeemaker, but the first inconvenience I noticed is that it’s too tall for the lid to open under my cabinets. The second is how complicated it is to program. The third is the awkward position for filling the water tank and impossible to read markings inside the water tank.  I gave it two stars because I like that it’s BPA free, which is a plus.  Take a video of the unpacking in case you want to return it.  Better yet, don’t order it in the first place!.  It’s a very tight fit and difficult to both unpack and even more difficult to put back in the box.  I returned it and ordered a beautiful white Melitta which is made in Germany, not China like this one.  Sooo glad I did!!"
"UPDATE 9/21/15: No more coffee grind mess once you understand the tricks of the trade. Always push in firmly on the filter basket until you hear/feel a ""click"" to make sure it doesn't float up and cause the coffee grinds to overflow into the machine. I believe this is what cause the problem on first use. Also started using my own #4 filters instead of the ones provided with the machine. This could have helped with the overflow issue; not sure.Three new dislikes I discovered vs my old machine: the carafe needs to be held almost completely upside town in order to get all the liquid out. There's a lip at the top of the glass that doesn't allow coffee/water to pour completely out of the carafe unless you invert and shake. Pretty irritating and unnecessary.Once you're done making coffee, you need to open the top lid and let the inside dry out. If you just turn off the machine and empty the filter basket, it will remain very wet inside. I could see this causing mold issues over time if it's not dried out.Also, water reservoir could stand to be wider. It is somewhat challenging to pour water into when you're only half awake. /END UPDATEOn first use, something happened inside the machine that caused water and coffee grounds to overflow and back up into the water reservoir. Right now, I'm waiting for the grounds to dry so I can try to go in and vacuum them up as the machine is too big to fit in the sink for a rinse. I read the entire instruction manual before using and I don't know what I did wrong. It's a huge mess. (Note: We took it outside and hosed it out)Very tall: The height of this thing just barely squeaks in beneath our upper cabinets for ""neat"" storage, so beware of that if you don't have a lot of headroom.The coffee this machine made tasted fine, thus the two stars instead of one.This was a replacement unit for a Krups coffee maker that we've had for 11 years with NO problems. An electrical brownout in our area caused the Krups to break, thus necessitating this purchase. I'll give it another try tomorrow."
"Over the years we have owned least 5 of these drip coffee makers. YES, it does make excellent coffee. There is no faulting the Cuisinart DCC-1200 on that score.So, what's the problem?This an unchanged design that could have easily been updated over it's 15-20 year run.1) The clock is not back-lit. Basically you need a flashlight to view/adjust the clock. I know. This seems as a minor issue but over the years you will see it raises to be a considerable frustration.2) ALL the dial labels are very small and also not back-lit. Again, you need a flashlight and possibly magnifying glasses to read them.3) Now for the MAJOR frustration: It is virtually impossible to read the reservoir settings located inside the Cuisinart DCC-1200. To see the reservoir cup markings you need to be both quite tall and possibly use a flashlight. This flaw requires that you must measure the water using the coffee pot and then pour into the reservoir. Over a product run of 2 decades the Cuisinart DCC-1200 one would think that this inconvenience could be remedied by an update.This leaves us with one final question: Why did we keep buying the Cuisinart DCC-1200 if it is so frustrating?When we bought our 1st Cuisinart DCC-1200 it was priced in the $60.00 range and thus a reasonably priced drip coffee maker that in all fairness produces excellent coffee. However, now that the  Cuisinart DCC-1200 is at the $90.00 level there are many other excellent choices. We keep our Cuisinart DCC-1200 at the beach house.NB: The RSVP International (TAM) Dual Sided Coffee Espresso Tamper [ https://www.amazon.com/RSVP-Terrys-Sided-Espresso-Tamper/dp/B0001XRNEM/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=RSVP+International+%28TAM%29+Dual+Sided+Coffee+Espresso+Tamper&qid=1594465630&sr=8-2 ] an essential accessory."
"My husband purchased this coffeemaker since my other little coffeemaker quit working after 5 years and it was bought at a local thrift store. This purchase was a spur of the moment buy which was a mistake. After, the purchase for $79.00+ for this unit, I found it locally at Lowes for $49.00+. So this was a big bummer for me. Some of the finer features that the marketing blurb didn't tell you about:1) On and off switch is a small silver toggle switch on the front of the coffeemaker - it makes this machine look cheap and a little red lite comes on to tell you the coffee maker is working and then you have to turn it off!! So what is automatic about this machine.2) The lid to the carafe container does not lift up, you have to remove it to clean it, place the glass carafe on the counter and align the lid and the carafe and push down so the lid is in place back on the unit.3) The directions say you can remove the carafe from the heating tray and pour a cup of coffee, without drips-- not true the thing drips.4) It is hard to see the little area where the water is to be poured into the machine, there are little white looks like, Lego markers for how many cups you are making - hard to see.5) The regular time clock on the front of the machine is not backlit so in the dark you can't see the time - so why put a clock on it in the first place.6) Beware buying just for the name Cuisinart, the unit the silver upper part looks cheap, I would have expected more.If I were to purchase this again, I wouldn't ---the price was outrageous and some of the features I don't like. Shop around.My fault for not looking closely. The price was a shock to me!! Was going to ship it back but thought that would turn into a hassle so I am just sucking it up and using this unit. Do your homework before you buy!!!"
"I have to shake my head at whoever thought up the design of this coffee maker. First let me say that it makes decent coffee and that it has all the features I wanted for making coffee: auto timer, 1-3 cup option, auto off function, easy to program.Here's the stupid parts: Unless you are wearing a headlight, it is almost impossible to see where the water line is in the well. There are markers *inside* but it's so dark in there, that it's very difficult to see how much water you actually put in there. And yes, you can measure into the carafe, but once you've run the water into the carafe, you have to let the turbulence settle to see where the water line is. I find this annoying after having a Braun coffee maker for 10 years that had very easy-to-see fill lines. The other stupid part of the design is that instead of having a filter basket that swings out to the side and is easily removed for cleaning and DRYING, this maker opens from the top. I have to pull the whole machine out from under my cabinets to open it. Lots of condensation forms under the lid, so that when I open it, all the condensation runs down the back of the machine right where the power cord is. This is stupid. I can see down the road that there will be moisture issues inside the coffee maker like mold or mildew. The third stupidity is the opening where you pour the water is 1) very small and 2) on the right side of the machine making this difficult for both myself and my spouse who are left handed to pour the water into the machine, further dribbling water down the back or worse, into the filter basket.I had the same Braun coffee maker 2x in a row spanning about 1 1/2 decades. This coffee maker has all the same features but the design flaws, as illustrated above, make this, in my opinion, an inferior and an annoying appliance. I wish I hadn't bought it."
It makes decent coffee but we’ve had some issues with this coffee maker. After only using it for a few weeks the “clean” light started flashing. So we cleaned it according to the instructions and a couple weeks later it started flashing again. We have city water so I’m not sure why it does this. We just ignore it now. Next problem was with the pause and serve function. I made a pot of coffee and coffee overflowed out the top from the filter area. There was coffee and coffee grounds everywhere. This happened twice. So I removed the pause and serve parts from the filter basket and it hasn’t happened since. I’m not sure why but every once in awhile we get coffee grounds in the coffee. I would think for the price paid we wouldn’t have all these issues. I wouldn’t buy this again.
"This is not my favorite coffee maker for a few reasons. Most of which have to do with not being designed for use by sleepy people who haven't had any coffee yet. It's just too easy to do something wrong and end up with really awful tasting coffee, or a mess. I believe coffee makers should be designed to be ""dummy proof"" because - who is wide awake when they're making coffee in the morning?- you can't see how much water is in the reservoir. That's ok if you never ever get interupted while making coffee... did I put in 6 cups or 8 cups of water?- if you don't put the carafe lid on quite right, or forget to put it on at all, it will brew away, but the coffee won't drip into the carafe... so it overflows into the water reservoir.- the interface is overly complicated- I just haven't been wowed by the coffee it makes so it doesn't make up for the annoyancesOn the ""plus"" side - it is programmable, which would probably alleviate the problems I have with it. I've just never been in the habit of preparing it the night before.I've only had it a year but already looking forward to replacing it, when it conks out or I just can't stand it any more."
"I have had several of the Cuisinart coffee makers.  The models I had before had a side section that showed the water level.  This one has an inner one (that no one can see) and even when trying to use the glass container to measure, the marks are so light I can't read them in any light, nor with the highest powered reading glasses.  My coffee is a guess now so always either too light or too strong.Cuisinart needs to make measuring coffee an easier job on all of their machines.  The person who designed this measuring system clearly doesn't drink coffee."
Older model better. Had water gaugeMore functionality
"We've owned 2 of the E model cappuccino makers and gifted one, three of the 12 Cup  Brew Central's a 14 cup Brew Central, and a similar model with the thermal mug (the thermal did not keep coffee hot, guests nicely and rightfully complained). While the cappuccino makers have held up the best at about 3 years life span before they started sputtering (bi-monthly cleaned out with vinegar); all of the coffee makers have died in an average of 2 to 2.5 years. Sadly, we've kept buying for the aesthetics until we find a brand that looks attractive on the counter and actually lasts. I am convinced  (from experiences in the last four years of owning multiple homes with washing machines, dryers, refrigerators, coffee pots, food processor, vacuum, etc all dying far before their time) that the corporate objective of the majority of mid-market small and large appliances is to design them to have one or multiple parts break within a certain time span so that you have to purchase another. A sickening reality of contemporary consumerism driven by corporate greed. I'd prefer they charge 20% more and create a product that does not need to go into land fills. From Cuisinart to brands that may be more sturdy; the prices double to triple, and many of the more expensive non-commercial models also do not last. Our nearly $200 Cuisinart set of butcher block knives is also the worst that we've ever owned, with the edges of the blades actually crumbling/ chunking off. If you can find another brand with decent reviews of reliability and longevity, I'd try that brand instead."
"Second time buying this coffee maker.  First one lasted about six months before the programmable feature stopped working, so we could no longer wake up to a pot of coffee.  Stuck with it for 3-4 years making it manually each morning. Recently, we decided we wanted that feature back. Purchased this unit in April 2017 and within weeks, noticed that the coffee had a large amount of grounds in the cup/pot.  We noticed that the basket that holds the grounds looked like it had been blown to smithereens!  There were grounds everywhere!  Even back down into the water tank, into the filter, throughout the top of the lid - everywhere!  Had this happen several other times in the coming weeks. Felt it had to be getting a large, pressurized blast of water to create such a mess.  I decided to start brewing coffee manually to listen for anything unusual each morning.  After three attempts, on the fourth day I could clearly hear a rush of water/gurgling-sputtering sound during brewing and once the brewing had run it's course - I opened the top to -  sure enough - see grounds/water shot out through everything!  An absolute mess!  There is no easy way to clean this, as the grounds continue to fall back into the water tank and just make your coffee terrible.  Of course this all happens well past the Amazon return date. Called Cuisinart just outside the 90 day window and they wanted a fee to send me a new unit, plus I would need to pay to send the old unit back.  While this may be an isolated incident, this experience, coupled with our old coffee maker breaking down within months - left us with the decision to move on from Cuisinart products all-together. They have lost a customer for life and we will not be giving them our money again.  Buyer beware!  There are better coffee makers on the market  for much less money, likely with a company that stands behind their product!"
I don’t know if other people have this happen but the last 2 or 3 coffee makers have only lasted 3 years. I like it but my very first one lasted a very long time but since the first one they don’t seem to last more than 3 years.
"Six months since I bought this coffee maker, which supposed to be a great brand, stopped working this morning. Please advise"
"Cuisinart is a typically great brand, but I am a bit disappointment with this product. After receiving I discovered that it’s not possible to disable the ready tone. It wakes everyone in my household. My previous coffee maker had a button to turn to sound on and off. I wrote to Cuisinart and they confirmed - no option to disable. Pretty silly thing to overlook in product design. I live in an apartment and get up before my children in the morning. It’s a big deal for me. Beware if this is an issue for you too"
"We had this same model for years and it was time to replace it. First negative is that they removed the window on the side of the unit that showed water level. This is critical because, over time, the markings on the carafe wash off. The second negative is that the markings on this carafe washed off VERY fast - within about a month. The only way to confirm water level is to look down inside the unit to see the tabs inside the reservoir that mark each 2 cups. Very inconvenient. Makes good coffee, but these negatives leave us very disappointed about how they've cheaped out on this coffee maker."
The lid to carafe doesn't snap in and sometimes slides off if not careful. I haven't contacted the manufacturer yet since I still get it to work but probably should. Just didn't want the hassle and does make tasty coffee.I do like the product look and is actually my a replacement for the one around 10 yrs that started to leak out the bottom.
"Pros: Looks nice, makes great coffeeCons: Clock is not backlit and very hard to see, Top of carafe isn’t easy to snap on, water level is inside, little buttons with little print that’s hard to read."
"I bought this to replace an old model I really loved. The new model has removed the clear fill indicator chamber with markings for how much water you are adding. So if you have made coffee, relying on the pot to determine your fill, and you decide you might want to make a few more cups before you have finished it you have to guess how much to ad. Will probably be returning. The only reason to remove this feature is to make it cheaper to produce, I would have rather paid $10 more."
"I’ve used Cuisinart coffee makers for many years. Mine identical to this one was my first. It lasted 12 years.  There is an immense amount of condensation when you lift the lid that pours out on the counter. The coffee filter holder plunger is mismatched with the hump on the pot lid, so it doesn’t open enough. I can’t make my coffee strong enough for my liking because the water/coffee mix in the holder runs over. I hate the screen filter. So I just use a paper filter but can’t put enough coffee in it for my liking.I’ll not buy anymore cuisinart coffee makers. I won’t even go into my experience with my second one. It was less expensive for another retailer. Had a round clock/settings display. This one I am reviewing is my 3rd cuisinart."
"This is the second factory refurbished Cuisinart DCC-1200 Central 12-cup Programmable Coffeemaker I've purchased from Amazon in 4 years. The first one held up to daily use, and performed beautifully, offering cup after cup of delicious coffee - until it didn't.One morning the coffeemaker would turn on and then when it finally did, it wouldn't stay on.  I assumed some sort of electrical issue was to blame. After reading the reviews (both before I purchased the first one and now), I had concerns about the potential fire hazard with this coffeemaker. I tossed it into the garbage, fully intending to buy another brand, however my husband loves this coffeemaker, thus the second purchase of another refurbished one.At the list price, or if I was intending to pay over fifty for it, I'd have chosen another coffeemaker (reading reviews first of course...).  This model has performed well over the past 4 years, but you really can't fully ignore the numerous reviews referencing electrical issues with this maker.What made me stick with this model? Looking at how we use our coffeemaker.I brew a pot and then turn off the heat.  I'm standing nearby when it brews.  I don't use the programmable function but about twice a year (Christmas and New Years Day).  If I was setting it and going to bed, I think I'd consider another model based solely on the other reviews which mention issues related to electrical fires.If you are considering this purchase, know it makes great coffee.  Also know that your usage may be the determining factor in whether or not this Cuisinart is right for you.  But truly, that shouldn't be the case should it?"
"I've had two issues.  I don't find that it has an automatic shut off if you forget to turn it off.  It may, but the manual is unclear about that and I haven't stuck around long enough to find out.  I literally turned around and drove home the other morning because i forgot to turn it off.  The last coffee pot I had was very clear about it having an automatic shut off. And this morning for the second time, the pot stopped filling with the water and the filter clogged, and I had a mess on my hands. . .  not because the coffee filter needed cleaning but because the coiled hole where the water drips/pours into the pot became clogged. And I don't really understand why that is happening.  I am not getting coffee grounds in my coffee.  So this is a coffee system that requires pampering. It makes a good pot of coffee but you have to keep an eye on the water access points to be sure they are totally clear.  I'll keep using it, but I wouldn't buy it again.  I waited to write this review for just this reason.  I've had it now for three months."
"I am a little surprised the unit cost what it did.I chose it over another top-seller because I thought it would be more stainless steel and less plastic. It feels light and flimsy, though, which is something someone else said. The control seems and feels pretty cheap -- the buttons and dials seem like something from a plastic Chinese-made toy.The water hole is difficult to pour into, and the instructions also say to take out the filter to fill it with coffee grounds. I can see why it said to do this -- it's easy to get grounds into the water area if you don't pull the filter out.Also, I tested the machine twice to its full capacity of a 12-cup brew. I measured the coffee more loosely the first time, and the machine went a little crazy at the end: grounds and water made a small mess. The second time, I measured more carefully and it was fine.Also, when I used just the gold filter, I got a lot of silt in my coffee -- it wasn't a clean brew. I tried it with the paper filter AND the gold filter, and the coffee was much more clean. I suppose some care about this and others don't.The programming feature is nice, but honestly, the brew is so quick, I don't see why a pre-programmed start is very necessary. (Freshly-ground coffee beans should be used within the hour, anyway.)"
"When my krups of 9 years broke, I was looking to kick it up a notch and replace it with something better.  My wish-list, I thought, was simple: 1)Brushed Chrome finish, 2)Digital LED readout so I can actually SEE the time, 3)12-cup capacity, 4)Carafe Pot.  Of course it had to have an auto-start feature as well.  Well, I searched high and low, and this coffee maker doesn't exist!  So, I found this cuisinart to be the next best thing.  It IS a small hole to pour the water through, but not really a problem.  My only complaint would be that the condensation is a bit much... about 4-5 tablespoons worth.  I think this is basically a design flaw.  Be prepared to wipe up the excess condensation each day on the inside top lid.  If you're preparing the coffee the night prior to the auto-start the following morning, wiping up the condensation is a must to prevent premature wetting of the grounds.  On a positive note, the unit is sturdy, the pot doesn't dribble or spill, and the coffee is what you would expect.  The charcoal filter is a plus for those with hard water.  I give it a B-."
"Originally bought this for our winter home in 2014, so it was used daily for six months/year.  It lasted until this year when I replaced it with the same model as I had a lot of accessory parts on hand, including a good carafe--which was the 3rd one I had bought, the first two broke (quite easily as I am a gentle ole lady).  Over the years, I have usually bought highly-rated cheaper brands of coffee-maker and the 2014 purchase was an experiment to see if it produced coffee tasting three times better to justify its three times as expensive cost.  I am probably not a good judge--I do not like Starbucks.  And, I like to make a second pot by adding water to the remaining coffee and pour it all in, re-using the same grounds.  This does create a cleaning problem as apparently some fine grounds slip through the basic filter, the 2nd fine golden filter, AND the paper filter that I use, the clogs up the little tubes.  It is probably better for me to get the cheaper coffeemakers and just throw them away after each season."
"We bought this coffee maker in January or February of this year, and it worked really well and made great coffee for quite awhile. Then we moved to a more rural area and are on well water. We have a brand new, state-of-the-art water treatment center in the house and our water is soft, so we shouldn't have scaling.After 4 months of living here and typically making between 1/3 and 1/2 a pot of coffee a day (and occasionally in the evening), the self-clean light started flashing and the coffee tasted terrible. We followed the directions and ran the vinegar-water mixture through the machine to clean it - we even did it twice to be extra-thorough.  The coffee tasted great again for about 2 pots, and then the light started flashing again.  We've been having this back & forth for about a month now and I've resorted to looking for a new machine -- we're going through 2 gallons of vinegar a week just for cleanings. Last night I cleaned the machine twice and my husband had delicious coffee this morning. However, when I brewed 1/3 pot later this morning, the self-clean button was flashing again.  Since we live on well water, and the water has been recently tested, we should not be having these problems.On the pro-side, when the machine works, it works well. We like the little 1-4 cup lever since we don't make lots of coffee at once (I'm pregnant so drink decaf and my husband still drinks regular). The timer is great and the machine is attractive, plus it's nice to be able to set the heat temperature of the burner.  And it's nice that the machine tells you when it needs to be de-scaled -- I just think there's something defective with ours."
"I have my coffee pot about three years.  It works the way it is supposed to.  Until recently I've had no trouble with it.  Lately, every now and then, the water doesn't run through.  I've got to remove the paper insert and the coffee grounds, remove the black plastic liner and set it under the faucet while pushing up that little center part that the water drips through.  After doing that, it will work properly.My main and most important complaint about this pot is that I have yet to taste a GOOD cup of coffee.  I don't use the tiny coffee measure that they include because the coffee turns out too weak.  I use a commonly familiar regular coffee scoop which holds twice as much coffee than the little scoop that comes with the pot.  No matter how I measure; no matter what the ratio of coffee to water (and I tried every kind of combination which I recorded on paper and checked off ) - either the coffee was tasteless and weak or it was too strong or tasted like Espresso or burnt. I have tried every kind of coffee even coffee costing $16.99 lb.  I simply cannot get a good-tasting cup of coffee from this pot and I wonder what magic some people perform who report delicious coffee from this pot.  Very disappointing.  If anyone has a suggestion, I would welcome it."
"I bought this coffee maker in 2010 - not my first - and for years, we have enjoyed the best coffee.  UNTIL two weeks ago.  I was standing in the kitchen, enjoying my coffee, when I heard popping coming from the coffee maker.  I turned and smelled electrical fire ... I quickly unplugged, and emptied, and carried the thing out to the street, where it continued smoking.  Clearly it overheated or arced or something ...I went on the internet and googled Cuisinart coffee maker fires ... and found one reported case after another.  Distraught, I turned to a made in america coffee maker.  BUNN ... supposed to have the best coffee ... ok ... so we ordered it.  We changed our grind, when it overflowed ... our proportions, when it was too weak ... took out the cinnamon when it leaked again ... we thought we would never have good coffee again.Yesterday, we ordered another Cuisinart ... perhaps we are kidding ourselves to be comforted by the ""north american electrical standards.""  We have vowed to keep it unplugged at all times when it is not under supervision ... but let's face it ... a good cup of coffee is hard to live without."
"I really like this coffee maker. My coffee tastes great. I love that it’s so easy to setup the timer for my coffee to be ready in the am. The carafe is the bummer part. The design is terrible. It’s spills every time I use it. I had requested an exchanged on the carafe. The company was great and send a new one. But, it has the same terrible design. My countertop is always a mess. It’s really a bummer."
"I am a little disappointed with this coffee pot.  First of all, it makes excellent coffee.  I replaced my Melitta Grind & Brew with this pot because I wanted a pot with an adjustable burner that stayed warm for more than 1 hour, and brewed coffee at the proper temperature.  This pot has all of that, and does a nice job.The quirky things I am disappointed with:1) This coffee pot feels it needs to announce to the world that it is done brewing with a series of beeps.  Who cares?  Why add this feature?  It can easily disturb a peaceful household early in the morning, and there is nothing you can do to turn it off.2) If you don't load the carafe under the brewer correctly the machine will back up and spill coffee all over the place.  The difference between correctly loaded and incorrectly loaded carafe can be a very subtle difference too, nothing too obvious looking.  I'm paranoid now and usually stand around and make sure coffee starts pouring into the carafe.3) The water reservoir is dark and narrow.  I have to turn on all the lights in my kitchen to see in there to judge the correct water level.  Having some kind of gauge outside the machine would be perfect.4) Someone was smoking grass when they designed the lid to the carafe.  It is just plain weird.  If you pour coffee too fast it will leak out the sides of the carafe lid.  I think the lid is difficult to attach and remove, and I worry about it lasting because you have to snap it on and off each time you want to rinse out the carafe.If you can overlook these things, this pot is a good one.  Otherwise 'keep looking' would be my recommendation."
"I traded in my Keurig for this. I wanted a real cup of coffee and not the slightly artificial Keurig cup that I put up with for so long. And this machine delivers that. It's easy to use and clean and I do like it. However, it has this special button to push if you make less than 5 cups of coffee that is supposed to help make it hot enough for consumption. This button works just fine for 4 cups. But anything less, the coffee is just not hot enough when the machine beeps to say it's ready. Even if I increase the plate temperature to the max amount. I end up putting it in the microwave for 30 seconds to a minute to get it up to the right temp. I just thought people should be aware if they are used to making a single cup of coffee. Also the lines inside the reservoir to indicate the cups are very difficult to see less than 6 cups. There should be a clear window to see the water level on the outside. Simple addition that would make it so much better."
"If it lasts as long as my old 1200 I'll be ok but not good with it.The 4 bad things:1. the ""retro "" on off switch (cheap junk)2. no external water level viewer on a product that's at the back of the countertop. The opening is at shoulder height where you can't see inside the unit to see the level guage. Way beyond stupid really sucks.... really a 80 dollar coffee maker and no $ 0 .50 cent external view tube???3 the worst is how horrible it is to try to pour water into the stupid little opening at the back. A moron ok'ed this design old 1200 one was shorter and bad enough but this 1 is way beyond stupidly abysmal. Only reason I bought was 4 hr auto off option.4. Lastly, Every time you raise the lid the condensation (considerable amount) on the underside of the lid runs off the lid onto the countertop  behind the coffee maker Duh x 10 !!!"
"This identical (almost) coffee maker was purchased to replace a great unit we had for many years.  The electrical cord on this unit is only 24” long.  Therefore measure the length yo need for your kitchen outlets to see if it will work.  I have to now move my unit to a spot close to an outlet from the prior more convenient location.  After discovering this, I read in the manual because of this short length of cord you may need to use an extension cord!  STUPID!!!  But, it gets even better!  It also states in the owners manual they placed a small cord on the unit to “prevent entanglement and to reduce the tripping hazard”!  I kid you not!  Ok.... what idiot places their coffee maker on the kitchen floor to brew a pot, where they might trip over it?  Or, what idiot walks on their kitchen counter causing them to trip over the cord to their coffee maker, or their toaster for that matter?  I must say, in my 72 years, this has to be one of the dumbest things I have ever seen!  People, stop being sheep!  Hopefully this is not some new government regulation from Big Brother!  Cuisinart, are you that stupid?  At least remove the tripping reference in your manual!"
"Good things first:- It is really easy to pour out the coffee from the mug. No dripping, to spilling, no mess.- You get coffee out of this machineBad things:- Black steel is maybe the name of the color or the design, but it’s all plastic. And does not feel sturdy for the price- If you open the top, condensed water is dripping down the back of the machine and pooling on the kitchen counter- Water is collecting below the plastic rim of the glass pot in the dishwasher and is then running down the sides when taking it out- Judging the water level at the horribly designed indicator that is crammed into the narrow canyon of a water reservoir is a real challenge early in the morning. Better measure first and then fill in, if you like to get it right!- The designers must have thought: “What do people really like in the morning? What has no other coffee machine that we really really have to add? Shrill peeping noises!!! Let’s put a bone-marrow-piercing sound to alert all the morning-zombies that their coffee is ready for consumption!Summary. Would be so-so for $15-20. Is a waste at the current price. Was happier with my $10 Mr. Coffee"
"Makes very good coffee, but this is a messy machine. Brewing creates so much steam inside the unit that if you open the Reservoir lid (which is hinged at the back) after brewing, the condensate on the lid spills down the back of the machine and leaves a wet mess behind and underneath the unit. Also, the water spill wets the power cord. It's apparent Cuisinart designers saw this problem so they placed a very small catch-lip just below the hinge stop when flipped open, thus, ideally the condensate would all flow back inside the unit leaving the outside dry. But, there's too much condensate. If you are diligent and immediately wipe the unit AND your counter after every use this wont be a problem. Otherwise, you'll need to wait about 10-15mins before opening the lid so that most of the condensate will have time to dry or drip inside the unit.Another disappointment; the clock is not back-lighted and is not easy to see in low light or at an angle. Nevertheless, the coffee is very good."
"I got tired of a Bunn. I got about 2-3 years service out of Bunns before they either started falling apart of leaking. You have to turn a Bunn off if your going to be away for a few days or the water boils away or drain it completely if your going for an extended period. My 4th and last Bunn was hauled away to a landfill this morning.Hopefully I'll get a bit more longevity out of this one but when plastic is heated and cooled repeatedly it fails. The price of this unit causes me to want it to have a long life, but the Amazon price is better than any other seller I have found.As for features, I like the ease of which the carafe slides in and out when paused to pour a cup before brewing is complete.  Coffee made with it tastes good. Filling the reservoir is not handy, the opening is small and water splashing elsewhere is common. I would prefer a water level indicator on the outside. Its more compact than the Bunn taking up less counter space. The clock is a joke. Its not backlit, I can't see it from only a few feet away. It makes coffee fast, 9 minutes after throwing the switch its done. I do not understand the temperature selection on the warmer. I set it on ""high"". Is there another way to drink coffee?"
"We recently purchase the Cuisinart  DCC-1200 programmable coffee maker, because old faithful Mr. Coffee was broken. Our purchase of this machine was on the advice of a family member.  The first thing we noticed was the lack of an outside water level indicator. This is a design flaw in our estimation. Trying to discover the water level is a real challenge.  You need a light directly above the coffee maker to determine the water level. Also, adding water to the water reservoir is not user friendly; the reservoir opening is not very large.  You'd better be wide awake when adding water to this feature:)  The carafe lid is not user friendly either  There is no easy access to clean it; rather you have to completely pop or pry off the lid to clean the carafe.  The outward appearance is sleek looking, until you realize that the brushed stainless steel appearance is plastic.  It remains to be seen whether this purchase was worth the price, even though we did get a good price through Amazon.  I would give it a 2 star rating for design, because of the mentioned problems that we have noted, and a 4 star for performance in producing a good cup of coffee. That means the rating averages out to a three star. a coffee enthusiast"
"This coffee maker is fine and makes decent coffee. However, when the coffee is ready, it makes a noise like a back up beep on a truck, and you can’t turn it off. If you’re trying not to wake a houseful of people, it’s super annoying!"
"Have had this for a few years now and we’re rather unhappy with it. As a basic caffeine delivery system, from the grounds to my tired brain, it’s fine. As a coffee maker though, it’s rather sad.First, it doesn’t matter how many grounds I put in for a full pot of coffee: grounds will end up on the inside of the lid. Grounds end up in the filter side, the water side, *inside* the lid, and inside the coffee carafe itself. It’s disgusting and difficult to clean. Add to that the water which gets everywhere so that every time I open the lid water just drains off as if it’s a shower, down the back, onto the electrical cable(!!!) and on my countertop. This water often carries the grounds with it, making cleanup that much worse.Second, and this is my problem for not paying more attention when buying it, the “keep warm” feature lasts about as long as it takes to maybe drink a cup of coffee and then cools off rather quickly. There’s no way to reset this to any sort of “lazy Sunday” feature - you better guzzle that coffee if you want a second piping hot cup.In the market for a new coffee maker this year, but we maybe, probably, won’t get another Cuisinart."
"I would have given it 5 stars except it's frustrating to clean the grinder and it only has one grind.  It HAS to be totally dry or the beans will gum up.  I also have to stop after the grinder is done to brush out the grounds from the grinder, even when dry, or it leaves about a cups worth of grounds in it.  It also has only one grind.  Cuisinart seems to think they know what is best for the way I want to drink my coffee..............they don't!  I like a fine grind and they like a medium grind.  To get the strength I want I either have to stop it mid-grind and restart or use less water.  And if you don't get all the grounds into the basket it's too weak for me.  Oh, and it's also loud but then most grind and brew coffee pots are.  I solved my problem with a ""coffee cozy"", an old quilt I keep in the cabinet below the pot to cover when my husband or guests aren't up yet."
"Next time I guess I'll have to remember to check that the unit has a visible fill gauge. I thought every coffee maker would have that!?? I don't enjoy peering into the depths of the unit through the fill opening in order to view how much water you've added (via an awkward measuring stick buried inside).  No outside gauge for you to easily see how much water you've added.  The lines on the pot do not equal the fill lines inside, so if you often make short pots, you'll hate this model.I love product engineers that don't actually try using their product..."
"The DCC-1200 is a sharp-looking coffee maker with only one flaw.  The included charcoal filter does seem to work in removing tap water's chemicals, and its controls are simple and intuitive.  After a year of ownership, I can say that with one exception, its build quality seems to be very good.  It feels solid - not even very much steam escapes.The one exception seems to be the same problem quite a few other people have had here - its longevity.  We only brew 6-8 cups a day (in one sitting), and change the filter every two months.  However, one morning about a year to the day after its purchase, it just stopped making coffee.  The indicator light and clock still worked, but that was it.The representative at Cuisinart instructed us to clean the machine with 6 cups of white vinegar and 6 cups of water.  Per instructions, we let it sit for an hour.  If that didn't work, said Cuisinart, we should try it a second time.  The second phone call had Cuisinart sending us a new DCC-1200, which we received yesterday.  The s/h charge is $10, and we are returning the old one today.We had never sent in the warranty card, so it was nice of Cuisinart to honor its 3-year warranty.  Hopefully, this one will last longer than a year."
"This is my second Cuisinart 12 cup programmable coffee maker.  The first one lasted almost 13 years, so I stuck with the brand when purchasing a replacement.  I ordered this one January 14, 2020 and when I got up this morning found that it quit working.  I set the auto-on last night and when I got up this morning all the lights were on, but it failed to make any coffee at all.  I unplugged it to reset and same thing.  I'm really disappointed in Cuisinart.  75 bucks down the drain.***EDITED 3/30/2020*** Upped to 3 stars due to the helpfulness on Amazon in replacing this item.  I received a replacement coffee maker and so far so good.  Fingers crossed this one makes it more than a few weeks."
"I've owned at least four of the Cuisinart 12 cup programmable coffeemakers since 2014:  the first one lasted 3 years, the second lasted a little over 1 and 1/2 years, and the third lasted under 1 and 1/2 years.  The third one was replaced under warrantee, and the replacement (fourth) coffeemaker lasted just 9 months. The problem is that all the coffeemakers eventually produced excessive steam and the water evaporated, leaving less brewed coffee in the pot. The last coffeemaker produced 2 cups of coffee using 10 cups of water. I changed water filters time, used filtered water, ran the cleaning cycle as needed,  and followed the advice of customer service to unplug the unit over night and try again.  It's a great product, if only it would last!  I expected more from a Cuisinart product at this price point."
"We'd replaced our old Cuisinart with this one a few weeks ago, but sadly I'd thrown the old one out and we're stuck with this thing!  This new model has made a horrible mess several times.  I think there is a flaw with the basket.  We make sure the basket and carafe are in place every time, but for no apparent reason the basket sometimes backs up, which then pushes coffee and grounds out onto our white counters and into the reservoir.  Basically, the coffee goes everywhere except into the carafe.This happened again at 5:30 this AM!  A huge mess and no coffee to take to the office.  Today, the basket and carafe were clearly in place (we've had such issues that we make sure it's set perfectly), but for some reason the basket clogged halfway through--stopped dripping into carafe--and just went all over the counter.Making coffee shouldn't be this hard.Really disappointed with this purchase and would not recommend.Can we return this and order another model?  Is there a known issue, perhaps the manufacturer can send us a replacement and/ or replacement basket?"
"I bought this product first in 2015. It stopped working by 2016. I called Cuisinart; they replaced it as it was under warranty for three years. The new one that they sent worked for a little over 1 year and then stopped working. I called; they stated that the three year warranty on the first one that I bought carried over to the new product. They they said that they would not replace the second one that stopped working because the warranty on the first one had run out, although it's only been three years since I bought it in 2015. They said I'd have to buy a new one and that I could get it for 20% off. Unfortunately, the product doesn't last more than two years, so I declined and I'm now trying another brand and Cuisinart has lost me as a customer, probably for the rest of our lives since their products and customer service aren't up to par. If you make a product and it doesn't work, replace it and keep customers happy. If you replace a product because the previous version stopped working, don't use the warranty from the old product to cover the new one. Provide a guarantee to customers that they'll always have a working coffee pot for at least a full three years. I don't want coffee pots that last less than two years."
"I purchased this coffeemaker to replace a previous one which broke down after 2 1/2 years. This one is the same model but they made some design changes.GOOD DESIGN CHANGES:  No more protruding metal disk on the plate, which made it awkward to place the carafe.Top is now horizontal, not slanted. The whole coffeemaker is narrower.No more holes in the back which caused leaking.Larger opening for pouring water. BAD DESIGN CHANGE: No more side window showing how much water you put in coffeemaker. There are some marks inside which are impossible to see except for the 12 and maybe the 10 cups levels. You would have to look directly into the coffeemaker, and even then, it's black inside and you can't see the water level. It's very inconvenient. I have kept the carafe from my previous coffeemaker, so I use it to measure the water.The coffee is OK but not great."
"In our continuing search for the perfect coffee maker, the search continues. I like the compactness of the maker, and it has a good brewing flavor once I master the water vs coffee ground mixture. What frustrates me is the water reservoir. It's a small 3"" opening that you pour water into (hard to do in the dark early morning hours!). The measuring indicators are down in the small ""well"" and you have to pour water into the dark well and without a flashlight or a direct overhead light, you can't see the level of the water. The on/off switch is a small toggle device that doesn't click like a normal toggle, so you're not sure it's working until the on light illuminates. I'll keep it rather than return it; it makes decent coffee. Next time, I'll go to a store and visually look over a maker before I buy."
"Do not buy this machine or anything from Cuisinart because  of defects and their arcane warranty policy.  I purchased the first one from Amazon, and it leaked. The replacement machine leaked, after a year or two. It was then I learned of their company friendly warranty policy.  If you buy a machine and, say, in two years it begins to leak (as mine did), the replacement machine has only a ONE year warranty, not THREE year, because, according to Cuisinart, you used up your two years.  So, I went to the director of customer service in New Jersey who finally agreed to replace it, without acknowledging the absurdity of their policy.  Guess what happened this morning? The replacement machine leaked, of course, more than one year later. I called their customer service, they refused to budge, asked for a supervisor (his name was Kras, he refused to provide his last name) and they kept me waiting for 16 minutes (surely hoping I'd hang up).  Kras of course, did nothing. In fact, he defended the policy, saying if they didn't have such a policy, warranties would last forever. I EXPLODED ""If you build quality products, you wouldn't need a warranty"".  So, I asked for the name of his boss, apparently the head of customer service.  He said ""Sandy"".  I said whats the last name. He refused to give it to me.Obviously, this is Cuisinart's policy. Build poor quality products, hope they last 3 years, if they don't, maybe replace it (manufacturing costs are typically 25% of retail selling price, so if your machine sells for $100, they are only out $25 to replace it).  They are clearly disinterested in quality and customer service."
I like the style of this coffee maker. This is the third one I have purchased that is having some kind of issue. The first two have lasted more than 5 years so I am ok with them developing problems over time. The one I have DCC-1200 is over 6 years old and shuts down during brew cycle . I can turn back on so it works fine then. The one I bought Sept 2017 to replace my moms 7 year old mode (leaking water -bad water hose probably)l is having issues. When the brew cycle is almost done it starts steaming and popping for well over 3 minutes and never makes the chime noise for end of brew cycle like mine does. I will be returning it to get money back as I no longer have faith in the quality of these machines. This one seems to be a fire hazard just waiting to happen.
"I bought this because it was pretty highly rated at the time and I liked that it had an option to brew 2-4 cups instead of a full pot. I don't drink a lot of coffee so I wanted smaller quantities. I used it a few times and never could get it to actually turn on with the programmable feature. Probably operator error but I followed all the directions and it would never come on when it was programmed to. I put it away for a few months (I don't tend to drink hot coffee during summer months) and brought it back out in the fall. When I brought it back out, every single brew it was spilling tons of grounds into the cup. I thoroughly cleaned it as well as I could, tried different filters, coffees, amounts, etc. I finally gave up on it and starting using a Keurig, now I use an Aeropress. When it was working, it made great coffee and I loved it's look and features, I just wish it worked longer."
"I've purchased 2 of these and one with the hot water to the side. All of them have had the issue where the hot plate rusts even though I try to keep it dry. My current one is now leaking somewhere and it's always wet under the unit. It makes a nice cup of coffee, has the features I wanted and so on but with the rusting hot plates and now the leak, I'm going to go with another brand now. I really wanted to like these and stay with this coffee maker (I've bought 3 over the years) but I'm tired of the issues I've had and it's time to try something else. Not sure what I'll go with as I'm looking and comparing right now, maybe one with a k-cup on the side....."
Coffee stays hotter for a longer time than old one.
From day one water drips down to the burner plate no matter how many times I try the pot or area
"The best thing about this coffee maker is its solid good looks. I enjoy seeing it on the kitchen counter in the morning and making coffee with it. The gold tone filter is nice and fine, and the holder is solid. The burner turns off shortly after the coffee is made, which I like (there may be a setting for this I'm not aware of). It makes coffee fairly quickly and the buzzer that sounds when it's ready is just right (not obstrusive like one reviewer said). However, it's still a fairly mediocre coffee maker. Problems:1. The coffee isn't quite piping hot enough, this is critical to good coffee.2. The carafe lid can't be flipped open, there's no hinge. You have to pry it off with difficulty and snap it back into place with difficulty. It's hard to fill with water without removing the lid because the opening in the lid is small.3. It's not brushed metal as advertised, but plastic that's painted silver.The bottom line is, for the price (I also got a discount) you get an attractive kitchen appliance which seems to add to the experience of making coffee. If you're a stickler for these things, you might want to look elsewhere. In the end, the plastic is probably a better material than ill fitting metal."
"Just got this as a replacement for a dead Krups 453 ProAroma, no longer available I'm sad to say.  There's no comparison.  The Krups made absolutely perfect coffee.  This Cuisinart is curious.  The coffee it makes is smooth & dark, but there's a distinct lack of taste - no burnt pencil or dirty sock flavor like a Mr. Coffee makes, no objectional flavors at all, but a general lack of flavor.  So I've doubled the amount of grounds that I would have used in my Krups & while there's definitely more flavor (as well as a powerful hit of caffeine - whoa mama, peel me off the ceiling!), my wife & I both made the same comment - it doesn't taste like coffee.  I know that may not make sense, but that's our first impression.  We've tried making about 15 different runs using the 1-4 setting, normal setting, more grounds, less grounds, more water, less water. We're kinda frustrated.  I'm going to continue making adjustments & give this machine as much of a chance as I can before I return it.  I'll give a final update at a later date.We've had this coffee maker for 3 days and decided to return it.  Not one pot of decent coffee.  Too bad."
All in all I'm happy with the coffee maker and how it brews but didn't notice at the time of purchase it has no exterior water line mark. You have to look inside the machine and when you pour the water it covers the numbers but it's hard to tell when it's covered the number because water is of course clear therefore hard to see and you have to lean over the pot and look inside.  Clock is very small and hard to see and doesn't light up.  I'm keeping it because I like the brew.
"Overall, I liked this coffepot. Had it for just over 3 years. We have hard water, but I'd cleaned with vinegar when the light would come on. But, no way to take anything apart to make sure it is clean. Now for the last few months, water is disappearing. No puddles on the counter, but you put in 10 cups of water, get 8 cups of coffee. I took out the filter (which I'd also changed regularly). No improvement. The coffee gets super-hot, lots of steam coming out of the top, so I turned down the carafe heat. Still way less coffee than water. I think the temperature regulation is off and water is literally evaporating rather than turning into coffee. And of course, I'm 6 months out of the warranty. This coffee pot is going to a secondhand store."
"Even with the 1-4 cup button chosen this machine does not work as well as my old Cuisanart, which I only replaced because a leak had developed. Also the setting for the coffee base also does not seem to keep the coffee hot enough. Result: less flavorful coffee."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            While you can't beat this little unit and almost every way, it has not been electrical tested by underwriter Laboratories!I'm sure this is why the instructions tell you to unplug it after every use.That being said, it is a nice little unit if you are willing to stand there while using it and unplug it after each use.Watch me make a cup of coffee in the video using a pod. About 5 minutes, but some of that time is spent explaining things.It's actually a pretty fast brew.A couple things I didn't mention in the video?In addition to making coffee with a pod or grounds, this makes iced coffee. I believe it can also make tea using a tea bag, but I'm not 100% sure on that, but I see no reason why it wouldn't.I don't have a lot of shelf space in this one bedroom apartment, so the small footprint is a big deal for me.They tell you to clean it before using it, which is simply a matter of running three cups of water through it without any coffee or tea. Bingo bingo Bongo.I don't see any leaks, and the cleaning was easy. The design seems to be perfect as is the functionality. The instructions are very easy to understand.If I can figure this unit out quickly after only skimming through the directions? Anyone can."
Saw this in another review and the replaced the machine. Went step by step and the machine is not working. We’ll see what the customer service says but I’m most likely returning.
"It is made to look like the area where the cup goes, is taller than it is.  You show a tall glass with ice in it, but I can't even fit a fairly normal size glass there.  None of my travel mugs fit.  That is with the drip tray out too."
The coffee is brewed fairly fast.  And I like that the coffee maker has different sizes and has capsules or ground
Makes great coffee but make sure you don’t have a tall cup or it will not fit.
This coffee maker is a POS. It blew up the k-cup and filled the coffee mug with grounds. It exploded coffee and grounds all over the counter. Do not buy this!
"The Shardor single serve coffee maker came well packaged and with easy-to-follow instructions. It has a small footprint and fits easily into my cupboard when not using it.  But I was startled to find that it has not been tested by UL Labs, so I'm definitely not going to leave it plugged in on my counter.  That said, it is easy and quick to brew coffee with either K-Cups or coffee grounds (my choice).  Haven't tried iced coffee yet, but I definitely will soon."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                I was very excited about this coffee maker even went out and bought ground coffee and K cups and unfortunately it doesn’t work.
"After reading many, many reviews this coffee maker ended up the winner to replace my fairly cheap machine that was showing age with electrical problems, and the Breville toaster works so well we just had to get another one of their creations.First and foremost, I was not happy giving up cone filters for the basket type and it took a while for me to give in to that, but in the end it's not that huge a deal.  Aside from the horribly designed carafe that drips no matter how you pour it and has to be tipped upside down and shaken to try and get all the coffee or water out (when rinsing), my biggest issue is with the grind size.  I have been using an old Braun coffee grinder for over 20 years and like my espresso roast coffee ground into a powder to use for my coffee (European style) and despite the adjustable grind control, this coffee maker just will not do a fine grind.  My first attempt at using the default settings was pretty surprising as I couldn't believe the amount of coffee it dumped in the basket for just half a pot.  It was ridiculous.  So I used the calibration feature which lets you weigh the amount of coffee ground in 10 seconds and input it into the settings (which disappear after each power fluctuation, just like the time) to reduce the amount it was grinding for each strength level.  I also thought maybe there was a piece I could shim or adjust to get it finer, but cleaning the whole thing (it comes apart in many pieces for cleaning in a very clever manner) actually made it worse because I think I added more room for the larger grounds to fit through the teeth.  Also, while cleaning out the grinder I noticed there were a lot of grounds that stay stuck in the chute each day so unless you disassemble everything and clean it every day, the first coffee that hits the basket is the stuff that was sitting there for around 24 hours getting stale.Getting ready to brew is quick and easy, but cleaning up is a little annoying.  The point where the basket meets the grinder is up under the top of the coffee maker so unless you have really tall counters, you have to bend over (maybe get some artificial lighting too) and get a cloth of some sort in there to wipe up the wet grounds.  There's also a cute shelf below the rotating disk that seals the grinder from the basket to catch grounds, and that shelf can be pulled out for cleaning.  Then after getting rid of the grounds and rinsing out the lid (I use a little dishwashing liquid as well to get rid of the oil from the grounds) then it all has to be dried before putting together for the next run.  Therein lies another of the issues I have with this coffee maker.  All my previous coffee pots I could just leave half open or partially disassembled to dry, but this one goes together one way and one way only.  So you either have to lay the pieces all over the counter or dry everything off with a paper towel -- every day.  One additional topic on cleaning has to do with the water reservoir.  There is no access to where the water is stored and no way to see or clean it.The convenience of this machine is great and like other Breville appliances it has great engineering and thought into the design, but for me a few key things keep it from being great.  Bottom line, I expected more for a $300 coffee maker.Pros- No more ground coffee everywhere on the counter to clean up in the morning- Awesome user interface to control making coffee- Water tank can stay full and it only uses enough for the amount of coffee being made- Works excellent for individually brewing almost any size cup- Grinder disassembles nicely for cleaning- Basket seals cleverly to allow coffee and water to enter with little mess- Emits almost no steam during or after brewing (I'm not sure where it goes)Cons- Have to use a napkin or paper towel to clean up wet grounds off coffee maker and basket every morning- Can't pour coffee without dripping on the counter or down the carafe- Custom settings disappear after each power fluctuation- Time disappears after each power fluctuation (auto start time was saved though)- No way to ""open everything up"" to dry- Grind chute holds a lot of coffee which ends up sitting there getting stale- Uses LOTS of coffee with default settings- Requires more cleanup than any other coffee making system I have ever owned- Takes up a lot of counter spacePictures show awesome display and controls, finest grind possible, things inside (behind filter basket) that need to be cleaned.Update:After using this machine for a number of months now, I can definitely say this is going to be the next appliance replaced in our house.  And I am downgrading it to one star.Multiple times I have awoken with little to no coffee brewed in the morning for various reasons.- Since the beans in the grinder feed only from the front, sometimes they don't feed at all (see picture) and there is about 1 cups worth of beans ground into a 10 cup carafe of ""coffee"" (this has happened with all sorts of roasted types, oily and dry).- Since the bean hopper is smoke colored its tough to see in there at night and occasionally it will just run out of beans (because it uses SO many beans) and I won't find out until the next morning (when I'm running late of course and don't have time to go through the whole cleaning process required to make another pot of coffee).  So the result is I have to take the top off the hopper ALL THE TIME to see what is in there and to redistribute the beans to the front so they will grind properly, totally negating the reason for keeping beans out of the air for freshness (not that the lid is anywhere near airtight to keep beans fresh anyway).- Sometimes a bean will jam the grinder and it just doesn't grind.  Of course I don't find this out until I try and figure out what the issue was THIS TIME and possibly end up wasting beans to try and make it grind something.I also noticed that the ""grind control"" knob (at least on mine) rattles like crazy while it is grinding and makes more noise than the grinder.  If I put my finger on the knob while it is grinding, it's amazing how much less noise it makes.  I was actually going to put a piece of tape over it, but since you have to open the top of the hopper a couple times a day that would be even more annoying than the increased noise.I still can't get over how little control over the grind size you have and how much coffee this thing goes through to make a decent cup of coffee (see picture of massive amount of grounds in filter).  I'm about ready to get my 30 year old Braun grinder back out and deal with cleaning it up instead of all the cleaning required for this coffee maker (the whole reason I got this coffee maker was to reduce the need to cleanup bean dust flying everywhere).  Speaking of the cleaning, I have never washed coffee grounds down the drain before in my life (on a regular basis), and I am very uncomfortable with how much coffee you have to wash down the drain to clean this thing out on a daily basis (be prepared for at least an extra 10 minutes a day).  Every other coffee maker I've had I would just crack the filter basket open on and let it dry out during the day so it could get composted, but there's no way to do that with this machine.Taking the hopper out and cleaning the grinder out is a mess.  When it is all fresh and new it comes apart great and looks like it was really well thought out, but I don't think any of the engineers actually use their own product.  I went back and read through the instructions and started laughing when I realized they want you to use a vacuum cleaner and waste a handful of beans just to disassemble the grinder.  I've been using a spoon to scoop out all the beans left under the hopper when it gets removed, and that takes quite a while, but coffee beans are like gold -- you don't just throw them away because its inconvenient to pick them up.Finally, the carafe not being able to pour without dripping all over the place is driving me nuts.  I was actually going to make a video of all the different ways you can try to pour to keep it from dripping and how the carafe still spills coffee either on the counter, down the front of the carafe, or in the coffee maker.  I'm pretty close to just heating up a nail and forming a real spout on it.This thing was certainly a waste of $300, maybe someone will be happy buying it at Goodwill."
"A couple things to know about me that pertain to this review.  I drink a lot of coffee, so between my wife and I we almost always make more than one pot per day.  That means that ease of making a second pot is important.  Second, I’m not a fan of very strong coffee.  Starbucks is not for me.  So making a good moderate strength cup is more important the making a Turkish coffee.There are some nice and interesting things about this coffee maker.  I really like the reservoir and the fact that the amount of water is known via electric current (or something) and the pour location is excellent and easy to use. No awkward pouring water into a small, oddly placed space while trying to watch how much is going it. The carafe keeps the coffee hot for a long time.  There are complaints that it’s difficult to impossible to get all the coffee out, and while true, it’s not as bad as the Cuisinart.There is one, kind of innovative, item with this coffee maker, and it is the main problem with it.  The coffee basket is an all-in-one basket/water infuser/coffee chute.  After adding the filter, there is a hinged top that you close.  In the top there is a horizontal chute with a soft rubber gasket that connects to a vertical circular metal plate or disk.  The disk rotates about 90 degrees to open or close the path from the grinder.  When operating the grounds drop from the grinder and get to the basket via this chute.  Water then comes into the enclosed basket from the top.  There is a kind of ‘roof’ between the basket and the water entry point with a number of slots to allow the water to disperse over the grounds.This generally results in a decent cup of coffee though at the expense of using more than normal grounds.  I’m using more coffee than ever before even though I have it set to the lowest strength.  This is most likely because the not all the grounds from the chute make it to the basket so more coffee needs to be ground.Water in the basket will usually fill up past the water entry vents, getting wet grounds into the top part of the basket cover.  Water also backs up into the chute or at least steam does, wetting and packing the grounds at the opening.  When the metal disk rotates, wet grounds go with it.  This makes a mess and can also cause the chute to jam.  This is not always obvious and can cause grounds to not get to the basket.  I’ve had times where I just made hot water due to this issue.In short, this is the messiest coffee maker I have ever had.  Since the grounds end up everywhere, it’s almost impossible to rinse them all out of the basket.  And with the section between the basket and the top, you can’t dry it out completely so making that second pot is very difficult.  This coffee make has the capability of making single servings of various sizes which is cool, but the thought of making 2 of them?  Everything you do with this causes grounds, wet or dry, to be scattered.  And you are constantly having to clean out the drop from the grinder to the disk opening so keep grounds from jamming up. And that is very messy as well."
"Right after I posted my 3 star review (below), the unit developed an entirely new problem. It stopped grinding beans. As in, altogether just refused to grind them. When you hit the start button, the grinder still makes noise and appears to spin, but nothing happens. I'm past the Amazon return window (purchased in January), so I'll have to see what remedy Breville will offer via their warranty. Save your $240. This thing is a piece of junk.*******I really wanted to love this. I am a sucker for both fresh brewed coffee and for appliances that make life easier. This seemed like it might deliver both, but it's mildly disappointing on both fronts.Coffee quality first. When it works properly, it does indeed brew a nice cup of coffee. I'm not sure it's any better than my Cuisinart  Cuisinart DCC-3200 14-Cup Glass Carafe with Stainless Steel Handle Programmable Coffeemaker, Silver        using beans ground up in a standard burr grinder  KRUPS F203 Electric Spice and Coffee Grinder with Stainless Steel Blades, 3-Ounce, Black        , which all in costs less than $100, but it's good coffee.Appliance issues next. Notice I said ""when it works properly"" above. I'd say 1 out of 10 times I use it, for whatever reason the coffee grounds don't make it from the grinder into the filter. Sometimes this is because the beans get a little hung up in the storage unit and don't make it down into the grinder. Sometimes this is because old grounds tend to get stuck and clog up the entryway to the filter area (you need to wash this out every 2 or 3 uses at a minimum.) But when you go to pour a cup of strong coffee and it comes out as brown water and you have to start over, it's pretty frustrating.I find the size of both the bean storage area and the water reservoir a little disappointing. You'll burn thru the entire bean supply with 2 full pots of coffee and the Breville definition of a cup of coffee is pretty small. I have to set it to 4 cups to fill my 20oz travel cup. What Breville calls a full pot (12 cups) is probably 8 to 10 on most other coffee makers.My biggest gripe about this coffee maker is that it lacks a heating element in the base plate to keep the pot warm. A big part of the reason I wanted this was the ability to set it to brew at 6AM and come downstairs to hot coffee somewhere between say 6:30AM and 8:30AM. If you go to drink it 30 to 60 minutes after it's been brewed, it's not very hot. Which means microwaving it. It seems odd to have to microwave ""fresh"" coffee. The stainless steel carafe is supposed to keep the coffee warmer (and no doubt it does keep it warmer than glass.) And Breville suggests you run the pot under hot water before you brew to help it retain heat. Since convenience was a big part of the draw to this machine in the first place, having to pre-heat the pot sort of obviates one of the main reasons I bought it. As an aside, I also dislike that you can't see how much coffee is in the pot because of the stainless steel. Also, while it's not difficult to pour coffee out of the pot, the design of the pot + lid means you really have to tip it at a very steep angle to get the coffee into your cup, which is annoying.That's a lot of criticism thus far. There are some nice features to this unit. The controls are very nice and easy to use. You can fill the entire water reservoir but then set it to the number of cups you want, which is a nice feature. You can also control the strength of the coffee on a scale of 1 to 8, and that feature works quite nicely. The machine heats the water very quickly when you start it. You can get a fresh pot of 4 cups (~20oz) in about 5 minutes. And I guess that's really the point of this machine. It is designed to give the serious coffee drinker a very fresh pot in a short amount of time without the fuss of the bean grinder. It does that quite well and as long as you are fastidious about cleaning the entire filter apparatus (not just eh permanent filter itself) and keeping the  grinder well stocked and free of bean debris.One note on customer service. After I had unpacked and set up the machine I realized that the plastic handle on the carafe was totally shattered. Amazon nicely offered an immediate replacement of the entire machine but by that point the packaging was already in the trash. We settled (after a bit of a lengthy online chat) on them giving me a $40 credit towards a new carafe. Only problem is, Amazon does not carry a replacement carafe at this point. I then contacted Breville directly and they very nicely and quickly shipped me a replacement carafe, no charge. So I'll give Amazon an A- for service on this and Breville an A+.This machine has some nice features and makes good coffee as long as you keep it maintained. For me, at this price point, I expected more and would not wholeheartedly recommend it given its limitations."
"Update again: April 2018I'm thinking a big fat no on recommending this coffee maker. The maintenance is nuts. I'm cleaning the grinder and chute weekly now. I actually bought a dust buster and a giant box of q-tips just for the coffee maker maintenance. I know. Nuts. I descale regularly and try to keep everything running smoothly, including recalibrating often. It loses the calibration for no reason at all. And now the water float is busted and I have to either guess and wait for the beep when filling or replace the filter and use the indicator on the LED screen which doesn't always work. I'm ready to go back to a simple burr grinder and a simple coffee maker that doesn't require so much care. Sorry, Breville.Main complaints? The beans have to pushed into the chute or it grinds away at air. The carafe leaves way too much coffee in the bottom and it has to be tipped on its head to get the coffee out when near the bottom and that means coffee goes everywhere, in the cup on the table. It's a dumb carafe design. I cannot tell you how many times it fails to work if you don't push the carafe directly into place correctly. 1mm off and the coffee pours all over the counter, into the drawers, and what a mess. The burr grinder only partially comes out so cleaning it is not exactly as thorough as the Breville burr grinder was so there's always coffee ground goop stuck where you can't clean and it matters. Coffee maker cannot go under a cupboard because you have to access the top to fill the hopper (small thing, but someone - not me- keeps shoving it back and it's a pain to pull out once water is in there). I'm not naming it anything except PITA which is exactly as you can guess. I emailed Breville through their site to get some info on the dead float indicator and they have yet to respond. It hasn't been long, but still. Not even a note to say they got the email. All I want is an easy to make decent pot of coffee in the morning. Something that tastes good and stays hot. Changing my rating to 3 stars cause expensive to buy this thing and give up on it before a year is up.UPDATE:It's been a couple of months and we still highly recommend this coffee maker. By the next update, I am certain we will have a name for it because it requires a very close relationship. Go into this knowing it is high maintenance. You can't just plug it in and go. But so far, it's worth every minute of attention because it makes great coffee.Pros:-It does well with really dark oily beans, but you'll have to clean out the chute more often.-Once you've gone through the Breville processes a few times you won't need to read the manual for specific directions for ordinary tasks- It really keeps the coffee quiet hot and then very warm for a long time. I've gone to pour coffee from the carafe hours later for iced and find it's too warm, still.- Routine is your best friend when caring for this machine. If you are a routine person, this is gonna be easy for you.- It makes a supremely hot cup of great coffee if all your settings are adjust to your liking- The morning timer can be a great alarm clock if grinding beans wakes you up- Coffee brews rather quicklyCONS-Always always put a filter in place before closing the filter holder because if it brews with nothing there, hot water and half as*&ed coffee will flood everywhere- Don't try to descale by just running it through like an ordinary coffee pot. It has a programmed function for it (manual) and that's the only way it knows it was descaled. I cleverly descaled a week before the machine gave me the descale message and I learned the stupid way that it is a ""function"" needing buttons pushed (manual!). I wasted some good descale stuff, but hey, smart machine, stupid owner.- I learned, also the hard way, to clean the grinder by using the brush and a vacuum machine to suck up the stuff that goes flying. First time I did it without vacuum I was cleaning tiny grounds for days from everywhere in the kitchen. It's a bit annoying when you remove the hopper that whole beans rest on the top and you have to take those off before proceeding to remove the burr. Plus get some good coffee brushes because the one that comes with it is inadequate (I had those already). I use canned air plus vacuum to clean out residue. Works great but it is a ballet. (see - high maintenance but worth it).- Every time the machine gets unplugged it forgets your calibration for the grind (manual - learn that one if you hate wasting coffee beans).- The hopper is way too small. I get that it's that way to fit under most cupboards on countertop but you have to move it to load in beans anyway so why not have the hopper style that's on the bean grinder which holds a lot of coffee beans? I fill ours every evening.- You have to push the beans into the chute before loading in beans or it does that pretend ""I need beans noise"" and your coffee will suck. Push those beans down every time. Again, fix the hopper and chute, Breville.- We use oxygen bleached filters cause our coffee is too fine for the gold filter. Don't ever forget to place some filter in there before brewing or the coffee muck will go everywhere except in the carafe.- Requires wiping down not only the inside top of the filter holder, but the stainless plate where the grounds come out and the little catcher at the bottom of the filter holder every time. See, high maintenance.-Do not get me started on the carafe. It is the dumbest thing Breville ever designed. It keeps the coffee hot (yay) but getting the coffee out is part art, part, luck and you will always have a bit left in there that cannot be poured anywhere. It has to turn completely upside down to get the last cup out and even then it sprinkles coffee drops everywhere. It only works marginally well when the carafe is totally full. Plus the lid to the carafe never dries out. I rinse it and shake it to death, turn it all kinds of directions to dry and it never, never dries.This Grind Control is pretty awesome. It makes a good cuppa, nice and hot and that's all I want in the early morning. I learned a few things that made the process easier because all those buttons and menus make the coffee maker a little bit annoying. First, find the instruction manual online and read it a few times - only because Breville is detailed and if you own any Breville appliances you know they mean exactly what they specify. Like A before B or C never happens. Here's an example. The grind chute is behind the basket. To clean it (which you should do a lot if you use dark oily beans) you unlock the bean hopper and the automagically stainless plate opening moves to the chute so you can access it to clean. Remember A before B? Yeah. That. I almost returned the machine because I couldn't get that stainless plate to move to open the chute. Then I reread the instructions for the 80 gazillionth time and et voila! There it was. Hopper first, open basket second. Then you hear a whirring noise and the plate moves and there's the chute. I'd been opening the basket thing, then removing the hopper and nothing. So read the instructions and don't feel bad about reading them several times. Honest. It isn't your reading skills. It's Breville's quirky way of doing things.Many folks (in the reviews) felt bad about the strength of the coffee and how much it chewed up a pound of beans in short order. It does. But it doesn't have to be that chewy. Try the calibration function (again, instruction book). We ended up using far less beans to get to our best cup of coffee which is pretty strong. Calibration is your cost cutting friend. Beans are spendy. Also, pay attention to the instruction manual about Breville's coffee cup size - it's small. Not at all what we drink. But use their size as your measure for everything.If you've owned the Breville bean grinder this hopper will make you slightly sad. It says it holds a half-pound of coffee but not ours. It holds about a third pound and I fill it every other day which still bothers me because the other grinder held about a whole pound. Also, use something to gently send the beans toward the burr when filling it (not when it's in operation) because sometimes it will grind air if the beans aren't moving. Smooth the beans gently with a little pressure and that should do it. Over fill and the top won't set on there properly. The grind setting from coarse to fine is up there, too. Use the setting they recommend. For regular 8 cups plus pots of coffee we use a coarser grind (calibrated) and that seems to work. A finer grind will be a perfect storm for overflowing the basket if you are making a large pot.The timer is great. I can set the thing before bed and it wakes us up in the morning which is preferable to an alarm because the smell of grinding coffee is pretty nice.The thermal carafe is keeping the coffee very hot for a long time. We made coffee, forgot we made it, went out and came back two hours later and the coffee was quite warm. Not hot, but a good warm. The only downside to the carafe is the way it pours. Others have mentioned it in the reviews and they are spot on. It dribbles out, even when full. The spout is on the rim but there is no indent on the pot rim to account for the pour so it really has to be tipped to get it to give you some coffee. And when the pot is low, well, it's like the little teapot rhyme. Just tip it over and pour it out. It seems counterintuitive and almost silly (not to mention slightly dangerous if you are pouring it over a light colored carpet) but I have to tip it almost fully upside down to get the last cup out of it. Dripped out of it, actually. Breville can redesign that carafe any time.Last, no matter what they say about when to clean the chute, the burr and all the places where stuff collects, do it more often. I do it a couple times a week. Takes a minute or two and keeps the grinder from getting gummy from the oily beans. The basket not only should be rinsed each time you empty it but wipe down the inside top where the grinds drop in and you'll come away with plenty of coffee gunk. We also ditched the gold filter and use oxygen bleached paper filters to catch the bitter oils and residue.Size? Giant. It's like adding a refrigerator to your counter top and it needs breathing room for vents so it can't get squished in a corner under the cupboard. You can't get to the hopper easily if it's under the cupboard. My solution was to let it sit on the countertop edge next to the real refrigerator so it has plenty of space to vent in the back. I'd say it takes up the same real estate as did the other grinder, water heater pot and french press so there really was no space saving in buying a single machine (for us). Though it is huge and makes my giant stand mixer look like a little sibling, I don't mind giving it half the kitchen counter space. It's worth it. The only improvement would be to make the feet be little wheels that lock in place so you can move it to fill up the hopper and water. (I can hear Breville laughing at me from here).I'm glad I waited to buy this model. It's a keeper. Even without wheels. But, please fix that carafe design. It's embarrassing."
"UPDATE:  JULY 20, 2020Ok, so I got through most of the fiddly parts with my Breville Grind & Brew.  It makes GREAT coffee.  It requires regular maintenance.  If you DON'T clean it/maintain it properly you will NOT get great coffee & you may not get any coffee at all!!  I'm now very proficient at maintaining this machine.  Of course, sometimes I push the envelope. Like, when I KNOW I should clean out the chute where grounds can solidify & stop pushing the coffee into the basket assembly.  The next pot of coffee is usually just yellow liquid - no coffee.Here are important points about maintenance.  I use a vacuum cleaner clean out the burr grinder & even the chute.  Old coffee grounds will solidify over time & harden.  I use a toothpick to loosen everything & then get it out with the vacuum.  It's very effective.  I never ever put parts in the dishwasher.  I've made the mistake a couple of times of putting the carafe in the dishwasher.  Water gets into the thermal carafe & doesn't come out.  The other parts to this machine, while removeable, have rubber or metal blades on them.  Over time, I believe, the dishwasher will weaken the rubber and corrode the metal. It's very easy to use a good bottle brush & detergent to clean everything.  DO NOT reassemble the machine with wet parts.  The inner burr grinder will compact grounds over time and that's enough of a problem.  If you attach it damp or wet, the clumping will occur more frequently.  Having had this machine for 5 years, & using it daily (sometimes twice per day), the burr grinder & chute must be disassembled and cleaned each time a FULL bean hopper is emptied from use.  It just will make your life easier & coffee experience better.  FOLLOW DESCALING procedure.  When the machine tells you to descale with 8 cups of water & 4 cups of white vinegar, just do it.  Once that's done, run 12 cups of clean water through the machine once or twice.Ok, so as an ""update"", I'll add that my Breville, though not fully broken was becoming more and more temperamental.  So, I just replaced it through Amazon.  Even with hand washing everything, the rubber parts to this machine were starting to fail.  It was becoming more difficult to release the hopper.  The rubber on the basket assembly wasn't that great and wasn't perfectly aligning with the chute opening.  There's a rubber in the chute opening too.  I noticed grounds sticking & hardening there more frequently.My decision to replace this Breville was easy.  I truly love the coffee it makes.  I figured I got 4.5 years out of my original machine & figuring how much coffee I make, it was worth the cost.  The original machine likely would have performed for another year or so.  I just noticed the rubber parts giving out & figured it was time.  I'll hold on to my original machine for a little while - just in case the new one is a total lemon.Review remains at 3 stars.  You have to really really want a great cup of coffee every day to be willing to deal with the maintenance.  I'm willing to do it but it's not for everybody.UPDATE: DECEMBER 30 2019So, I figured out how to get that shiney metal disc to open.  You have to have ALL the pieces in place (the plastic little grinds catcher & the basket assembly) with the door closed BEFORE taking apart the hopper.  When you loosen the grinder assembly in the hopper, the silver disc will move to an open position.  THEN you can get in there and clean the chute.And it really needs to be cleaned!!!!  Maybe it's because my machine is approaching 4 years old that it's become more finicky.  Lately, it seems, every other pot is just hot water because the chute is clogged.  I've gotten into the habit of using a toothpick in the chute to loosen the packed grinds & then taking the hose of my vacuum to it.  That gets everything out but it's a pain in the ass to have to do every other day.In the past, I could go through 2 full bean hoppers before cleaning the machine.  Now, it's much more frequent.When I clean the chute, I also use a flashlight to inspect the inside to make sure none of the rubber is damaged.  It's not but I guess it's a little older & worn now so the grounds jam within the machine more readily. Timed obsolescence??I'm contemplating replacing this machine with a new one just because it's now temperamental.When it works, it makes great coffee though.  Oh, bear in mind that if you're making a full pot (12 cups) DON'T fill the machine beyond the first ""beep"" sound.  The carafe will spill over.  This is a flaw, I think, since the carafe should stop brewing at the correct amount of water.  The coffee maker should not just empty its contents if you set the machine for 12 cups.I haven't found a machine that makes a better cup of coffee.  The comparable Cuisinart also has issues and complaints.  It's a little cheaper than  Breville.  For now, I'll stick with what I know.  Maybe I'll just replace it with another since getting it fixed with all new interior parts may cost almost as much as the current price.Happy Coffee in 2020!!UPDATE: NOVEMBER 29, 2018Ok, it's been just under 3 years that I've had this Breville.  I really really liked it.  I had no issue cleaning it.  I liked the way it told me when to descale it - and I did that as soon as I got the ""DESCALE"" notice on the machine.Up until a few days ago, it would have gotten a stellar review.  But now, for the first time, the disc that covers the grinding chute suddenly stopped functioning.  For the past 3 days, I've only gotten a pot of hot water in the morning instead of my needed cup of coffee.I cleaned the entire machine.  I emptied the hopper, pulled everything out, vacuumed it out completely.  I pulled out the burr grinder & cleaned it with a toothpick (not that it was all that dirty.)  I made sure that the lower grinder turned easily.I ran another pot and again, hot water.  Then I noticed that when I unlocked the burr grinder, the mirrored disc doesn't turn.I'm tempted to take out the screws holding the plastic cover that attaches the mirrored disc, but I'm a little afraid to do that.  It seems to me that there must be some kind of jam at the lower part of the chute that I can't reach without taking apart the entire housing.What a drag.So, the question is:  Do I call Breville?  Do I replace this machine with another one?  Do I get the new Cuisinart or Capresso?I can't seem to get any coffee maker to last more than 3 years.  I so loved waking up to a hot freshly ground cup of coffee!!My machine had light daily use - about 2 full mugs of coffee per day (6 cups).  It has been cleaned every day & descaled per instructions.  I don't know why this happened but I'm disappointed.Lowering my rating to 2 stars for 3 good years anyway.I intend to update this review as I continue with this Breville.  Having owned TWO Cuisinart Grind & Brew machines, I know that time will tell whether this machine will hold up.I note the following:Hopper is significantly smaller than on the Cuisinart & holds fewer beans.  That's probably a good thing as it's my policy to clean the grinder when the hopper is empty.  With fewer beans, I'm brushing it out every few days as opposed to once per week or so with the Cuisinart.It uses A LOT of beans at one time.  My only comparison here is by considering the amount of ground beans in the filter after making a pot.  A 6 or  8-cup pot on the Breville at 3 strength used significantly more beans than my Cuisinart at Medium strength.  I switched to 3-strength since level 4 almost filled the filter & was actually stronger than I'm used to.I'm very fastidious with my coffee machines & clean up after I have my first morning cup.  I can see that over time the chute disc at the back of the machine may get funky if it's not regularly wiped down.  I also worry about that mechanism getting jammed or stuck over time.  There's no way to remove it to see if there's any clog where the ground beans come out.The coffee basket has a hinged top.  It seems a little flimsy to me and may give way over time.  Also, the rubber opening to the basket may wear down over time - as it did on my Cuisinart.  At the end of the life of the Cuisinart, I began to regularly apply a little vegetable oil to the rubbery parts so that they wouldn't stick.  I fear that that process may be needed on the soft rubbery parts of the Breville as well.The coffee pot keeps the coffee hot - for hours.  Now, I don't know if it reaches that optimum level that coffee affecionados desire, but it works for me.  I was drinking Christmas brunch coffee at 9pm & didn't have to heat up my cup in the microwave.  That's OK with me!However, I find that cleaning the pot is bothersome.  I have small hands.  Yet, my hand can't reach into the pot to clean it it.  I have to purchase one of those spongy dish cleaning things on a stick to get in there.  That's slightly annoying.Making a single cup is totally cool - except you have to go through the process of cleaning everything up again.Taking everything apart and brushing out that burr grinder regularly is essential!! I can see how bean residue will get clogged in there.  So, you DO have to remove the hopper, release the upper burr grinder thingy & really brush everything out.  It's a little cumbersome to do & frankly, you don't know if you're getting everything out.  You can't remove the lower burr grinder. (The upper burr grinder is a round disc that screws into place directly above the lower grinder.  The lower grinder sits in a well area & is not moveable.)  So I don't know whether you can ever tell if there's a clog below the lower grinder.  Time will tell whether such a build up (if any) poses a problem.Filling the tank is easy enough.  However, I found it's easiest to use a measuring cup with a pour spout to prevent drips outside the machine.Ultimately - and so far - I truly like this machine.  I DO believe it requires regular maintenance for optimum results.  Frankly, any machine with a burr grinder in it requires maintenance.  It seems like it takes a few more steps to maintain as opposed to the Cuisinart Grind & Brew.  But those extra steps really don't take any more time.And, if I can have a great cup of coffee everyday without a machine leaking water all over my counter after 2 years of use, I'll be happy. (That was my SECOND Cuisinart Grind & Brew.  My first Cuisinart took nearly 3 years to break down.  That's why that machine is selling so cheaply now.)If the Breville holds up longer, I'll be a happy coffee drinker.  So far, So good."
"I have been searching long and hard for a machine that would both grind beans and brew coffee all-in-one, that isn't single serve, and also allows for timers (so i can wake up to a fresh pot).  While i have to admit this is probably the best at it based on everything i have tried, and it does make some good and hot coffee... it still isn't quite as good as it could be, and i ultimately returned it and reverted back to two machines (a separate grinder and pourer) for a few reasons.  My principal complaints are:1. the grinder is incredibly loud, and would wake up my entire house every morning when it ran... ultimately making me realize i would rather grind the night before even if that means risking some minor freshness, and just have the brew run in the morning rather than both.2. the grinder is incredibly wasteful, as the chute mechanism that pushes ground coffee into the filter basket is not precise and gets stuck / loses some grind along the way, and the machine ultimately grinds way more coffee than needed for a single pot, so i find myself running through beans way faster than with other machines that are more precise.  i also wish it grinded by weight rather than time;3. the carafe is one of the worst pouring carafes i have ever seen, and often times for the last 2-3 cups in the carafe, you need to turn it fully upside down, wrestle and shake the coffee out of the pot, and inevitably have it drip everywhere while trying to get into a cup, including from the center drip hole on the pot.  That said, it does keep the coffee nice and hot for at least 2-3 hours, so i guess one might outweigh the other..?4. the workflow of the machine isnt as good as it could be in terms of using the screen and buttons.  in particular, if the filter basket is missing (because, say you are cleaning it and letting it dry), you cant access any of the controls (including seeing how much water is in, setting timers for the next morning, etc).  It also does not have a sensor to understand whether there is a carafe or mug under the drip, so if you forget to put the carafe back in, it will just drip the coffee out anyway.Lastly, this goes without saying for every coffee machine, but dont underplay how often you need to clean it, especially since grounds get caught in the chute between the grinder and brewer almost every run."
"Loaded with features, the only 5 star part about it. Just by the description it's easy to see this coffee machine  sounds  great and it could be a nice machine BUT!!!!! and this is after owning another machine with a burr grinder.First impression I ask myself where is the grind off button?????? there isn't, you have to turn the grind control down till the selection say ground. Big dead right,, wrong. Where's the auto on button, has none. Example, I hear the machine run out of beans, I run over and stop it and open the filter basket to see how much coffee ground and by design, bad design it slings a big glob of wet grounds on the floor. OK, so it looks like it ground about half of what I needed so I dial in what I think I need and restart but now another flaw, after grinding the amount I set it for and brewing I pull the carafe out to poor and it's not full. It turns out it stopped brewing before using all the water, about what I set it for when it ran out of beans and stopped. I then need to dial in the amount of water it let in the machine and turn the grind control down till is says ground and again have to open the filter basket to continue and, yep another blob of wet grounds end up on the floor. It finishes, now the next day I have to set it back up and set the grind amount again when it should be just a grind off button. Now we have the missing auto start, you have to hit the auto start 2 times, it first flashes the time it's set for (stupid) and then it turns on the auto start on the second push and still displays the time.  Cleaning, yup if you just want to brew your coffee, drink it and run out the door forget it. There is a stainless disc with a opening for the shoot that rotates after grinding and it requires cleaning every brew when it done brewing or it hardens and is tough to get it off latter. The filter basket lid is the same, having slits in the top it traps coffee and debris inside and only rinses out if you take time to clean it right away instead of setting down to drink your coffee.  We bought this after the clock quit on our old one we had so no auto start but it had a grind off and had no cleaning to speak of. If I had a replacement picked out and it didn't cost $350 I wound just take a 5lb hammer to it and smash it. I now have to alter my busy schedule to take time to clean this thing every morning when all I want is my coffee when I get out of bed.I have more but this review is long enough.Pro's, lots of features to get the taste you want and grinder is quiet.Con's, No grind off button, no just push a button for auto start, PITA having to clean right away, Setup menu's have a lot to be desired, filter basket lid traps debris  and just don't push the button and let if open by itself or it will sling wet grounds out.I  W A N T  M Y O L D  M A C H I N E  B A C K we gave awayUpdate, This stupid thing just quit brewing with 3 cups of water in it, had to open and close the basket and set the amount to 3 cups to get it to finish.Above is pictures of having to clean, may as well get a vacuum cleaner out or you have do pick all those beans out to reassemble it. They give you a straight brush that should be more like a small tooth brush to clean out that shoot that doesn't work. You can't se up in there so you need a flashlight and it should have a downward slope to it and doesn't. It is a short and when you open the basket and find coffee grounds packed in the inlet of the basket it's time to clean it.Poor design, we had the grind and brew before and liked it much better. We will toss this peace of junk some day and get another grind and brew like we had before.Update, both me and my wife can't wait for it to break, Shoot gets plugged and then you end up with a pot of hot water. You have to take time to pull the basket right away or the humidity hardens what's in the shoot. The hooper doesn't feed the grinder well, you can hear the grinder speed up like it's out beans and then you find them off to one side not entering the grinder. WE HATE IT."
"I was very drawn to this coffee maker.  I read the reviews, watched the videos, and did my research.  This consistently came out on top, AND its dimensions fit the limited space of my counter top!  However, I ended up having to return it.FIrst, it does brew a great pot of coffee with precision.  There is a lot of great technology here that may suit others, but as a single adult living alone, the features did not overcome the disadvantages in my opinion.The feature to brew a single cup to perfectly fill a travel mug was very attractive!  However all of my Contigo travel mugs are too wide to fit in the narrow base, so that feature was not useable.The burr grinder is clearly superior to a blade grinder, but the grinder and bin doesn't all an interchange of roasts.  I like a dark roast during the week and a larger pot of a milder roast on the weekend.  Changing the beans out is very awkward.  Some mixing of beans is tolerable, but a little annoying.I thought the complaints about the carafe were exaggerated, but they're not.  My Contigo travel mugs do a much better job at maintaining the coffee temperature than the thermal carafe.  The complaints about the difficulty in getting the last bit out of the pot are accurate, but not the deal breaker.  What did it for me was that despite cleaning with detergent and a bottle brush, the interior stained within a couple of weeks.  That really made the opening too narrow for a hand a problem.But keeping the brewer clean really is a hassle.  This is where the bin, grinder, and filter design is way more complicated than necessary and actually a hindrance.  I followed the written directions and video suggestions carefully.  However the chute for the grounds would still clog occasionally.  That's what caused me to return the coffee maker.I loved the potential of the technology, but unfortunately the features turned out to be more of a hindrance than help.  I replaced the Breville with a Gevi.  While it's not as sophisticated as the Breville, it is so far meeting all of my needs with a lot less hassle."
"UPDATE:  I have had my Breville coffee pot now for one week past a year. Cleaning the burr grinder is a bit of a pain, but I do it faithfully every 2 weeks. If I don't clean it this often, the hole where the coffee beans are ground and deposited into the coffee filter basket gets clogged. When cleaning, if I touch the part of the burr grinder in the fixed position (but moves) just a tiny bit, even when I align the removable part inside the machine, when brewing the first cup/pot of coffee after cleaning, it ""spits"" coffee grounds all over, which are visible when you open the door holding the coffee basket. The burr grinder then realigns itself and not a problem until the next cleaning. This morning, the burr grinder must have slipped, because it spit coffee grounds all over the inside of the coffee basket compartment, and I did not just clean the machine. Not sure why this is happening, but I am seriously disappointed. I thought about purchasing a new burr grinder, if possible, but I am thinking I will just cut my losses and purchase a different brand of coffee maker. I expected this pot to last more than just one year.My previous coffee pot began leaking water from the back & the heating element was going, as the coffee was not very hot when just brewed. I ordered this beauty and (thank you Amazon, it arrived 2 days early). OH MY WORD this coffee is DELICIOUS!!! Whomever designed this coffee pot, THANK YOU & thank you Breville for manufacturing it. They didn't leave out a thing. The options are truly great!!! You can brew a single cup at a time, which is what I was used to and love. You can brew an entire pot into the stainless carafe. It comes with a gold, permanent filter, or you can use paper filters. You can set the auto timer so your coffee is ready when you get up in the morning. You can brew from 2 to 12 cups in the carafe or 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 & 20 ounce cups of coffee, which I also LOVE because I have a special coffee mug that was my Mom's that holds 16 ounces of coffee. You can brew directly into travel mugs (within the given measurements). They have a built in cleaning brush, so you won't lose it in a kitchen drawer somewhere. Love the spring loaded, hinged door on the coffee filter compartment & the water tank. It beeps when your coffee is finished brewing. The bean grinder is quiet. I like my coffee pot to grind my beans, which this does, BUT you can also use pre-ground coffee if you choose. You can set the grind of your coffee beans and you can set the brewing strength. Additionally, you can clean this pot with a white vinegar & water solution, which is so much better than having to buy the expensive and toxic acids to clean many of the pots on the market today. Over the last 15 years, I have had 3 coffee pots (one $600, one $900 both on sale, & one $1800 coffee pot, a gift from my Mom) and this Breville pot brews as good or even better cup of coffee than any of these past 3 pots. I am done with the very expensive pots that don't last very long, or you have to fix a lot. This pot is very reasonably priced for the features you get and the incredible cup of coffee it makes. Now, obviously, since I just received it yesterday, I have no idea about the longevity of this pot, but I have high hopes. I am seriously thrilled with my choice at this point."
"The good: Can customize grind size & coffee strength.The bad: so many ways to make a huge mess!1) the filter door blows open for no reason during grinding — Dry grounds everywhere!2) scheduled coffee-making gets turned on and there’s no pot in place — Coffee all over the counter!3) perform routine recommended cleaning — you’ll need a scrubber, 17 paper towels, and a vacuum cleaner.Bottom line: decent coffee maker, very silly design engineering.Edit: yet another way to make a huge mess! The filter door blows open during grinding so you hit the “start/cancel” button to cancel. Clean up the dry grounds it sprayed all over the kitchen. Set it up again and hit start; guess what it does! Now it makes more than a full carafe of coffee! The pot overflows and you’ve got hot coffee all over the counter. Surely there’s an engineer who can build a better grind control coffee maker?"
"I love coffee.  I love making coffee.  I love coffee gadgets.  I have them all, large and small.  I use a manual espresso maker from La Pavoni.  I have baratza grinders.  I use a bonavita digital gooseneck tea kettle.  I use aeropresses, clever brewers, French presses, and cold brewers. But I am also a sleepy person.  The idea of using a coffee machine as a morning alarm sounds like a brilliant way to ease the transition from bed.  I also have a lazy girlfriend and, if I'm not around to make her coffee, she makes herself nescafe.  I live in New York in 2016.  I couldn’t stand by while atrocities were being committed in my kitchen.  So I searched for an all in one that would make coffee like I make coffee -- starting with fresh beans -- but with the press of a button.  On first glance, this Breville machine did just that.  After living with the grind control for many months, I am left at best ambivalent about it and it’s usurpation of my morning ritual.  I will reduce my thoughts to a brief pro-con list.Pros• All in one grind/brew features allows for one to streamline the brewing process.• It’s not too difficult to clean on a daily basis• The settings and operation are very intuitive• When one uses the single cup brewing cycle, the coffee is often (but not always) pretty good.  Not aeropress good, but passable.• Goldtone filter is reasonably green.Cons• My model is wildly inconsistent in terms of the output.  When I set the brewer to produce a 10oz cup, sometimes the cup is half full and sometimes it is overflowing.  That means some cups are spot on in terms of the ratio of beans to water, while others produce weak or overly concentrated coffee.• Since the reservoir is non-removable, it is hard to clean frequently and I worry about what may be growing in there• The single cup brewing cycle uses prolonged contact (like a French press or clever dripper) to extract compounds from the beans. The multi-cup brew cycle uses a continuous drip extraction method.  The single cup brew cycle produces a far better cup than the multi-cup cycle.  When brewing multiple cups, the machine produces bitter and acidic coffee.  I suspect the multi-cup cycle extracts suboptimal compounds because it takes too long.  Or perhaps the machine has trouble maintaining a consistent water temperature over a longer brew cycle.  Either way, I am rarely willing to drink the coffee brewed into the carafe.  As such, I often have to run the machine twice in order to make a cup for me and my gal.• Since I rarely brew multiple cups into the carafe, all the machine’s programmability is rendered useless as I don’t want to brew into a cold, uninsulated cup when I am not going to drink my coffee immediately.• Again, since I rarely use the carafe and typically run the machine twice to make two cups of coffee (while heating mugs and cleaning the filter/basket after each cycle), it takes more time and effort to use this machine than it does to use my aeropress and baratza grinder.  And I greatly prefer the coffee that I produce by hand.• When I am forced to use the carafe (e.g., when I have house guests), I find it a little annoying as one must invert it to pour coffee.  In addition, there is often a significant build up of sediment at the bottom of the carafe that makes the last cup or two unpleasant.• There's no gasket on the bean hopper so my beans go stale more quickly than they should.  As such, I wind up dribbling in small quantities of beans every morning.SummaryThis machine is great in concept.  If you aren’t a true quality obsessive, this might be the machine for you, however, if you really LOVE your morning coffee, this probably isn’t a great solution for you.  Keep making coffee by hand while Breville works to perfect their technology.  Or, if you need more automation now and are unwilling to sacrifice quality, get one of the many high quality SCAA aproved machines (check out the ones from bonavita, technovarm, behmor) that don’t have a built in grinder."
"The manual tries to steer you away from oily coffee beans. Prior to this, we were using a burr grinder and a high quality drip coffee maker, but the automation of this machine and good reviews convinced me to try it. The first machine broke on day 2. Breville promptly replaced it but it also made me glad I purchased a 3 year warranty via Amazon.  We like strong, full bodied coffee but NOT dark roasts that taste burned. Over 3 months we tried numerous non-oily beans from local roasters that we hoped would satisfy our palette, but could do no better than a 'decent' cup of coffee. And all during this time, I cleaned the unit once a week (more on that later).  We finally broke down and tried something more in line with what we had previously been drinking, a locally roasted blend of Sumatra and Ethiopian.  The coffee was great but there was a penalty. The oily nature of the beans means you probably need to clean the machine every few days. We learned this the hard way when the chute that delivers the grounds to the basket totally jammed up.  What is involved in cleaning? This is what I do.  I unlock and remove the hopper. There can still be beans in it when you do this. Then I vacuum out the remaining beans and grounds under the hopper. Then I remove the grinder head. Use a toothpick to remove the packed grounds around the circumference, and vacuum out that area.  I open the basket door and the disk that acts as the grounds chute door, rotates, giving you access to the chute. They provide you with a brush to clean the chute. I find the brush to be worthless. Instead, I wrap a paper towel around my finger and swipe around inside the chute. Finally, I take a wet sponge, dampen the disk until the dried on grounds come lose, and the wipe the disk clean.  All of this takes 10 minutes.  So, if you like to use oily beans like us, and don't mind spending 10 minutes every few days cleaning the unit, you can get some very nice, freshly ground/brew coffee.  One last thing I should mention. Breville recommends beans that have been roasted at least 5 day prior to using but no more than 21 days.  That eliminates pretty much any coffee beans other than a local roasting company."
"Updated 7/3/16 - Changing from 2 stars to 1 StarI have officially stopped using this machine and now have a $299 paperweight. I have wasted so much time, energy and coffee on this product that I actually feel like Breville owes me money. I absolutely cannot get a normal pot of coffee, even when I check the grinder to make sure it isn't jammed and clean the chute before making my coffee. I have no idea what is wrong with this machine, but based on other reviews it seems to be a common problem. Breville should be ashamed of themselves. I reached out to them asking for a refund given that I have a coffee maker that could never really make coffee and have not heard back. Just terrible. Please trust me on this - stay far far away!Original ReviewI have had many grind and brew coffee makers (Cuisinart, Melina, Black and Decker) and I have never been happy with any of them. First of all, they all seemed to have a shelf life of 2-3 years, and I only make coffee on weekends. So, when it was time for a new machine, given all my past disappointments, I decided to make a larger investment and go for a more expensive grind and brew model. Unfortunately that was a decision I now regret.I think it may be easier to open, start and operate a Starbucks than maintain this machine. There are many things you have to do to maintain this machine, and they have to be done regularly... as in all the time.You have to:1. Clean the chute - this requires you to unlock the top hopper, open the basket hatch, stick something in this tiny hole (I use chopsticks) to try and scoop out the built up grinds on a tray below the hole. You may have to stick your finger in there to really get everything out. You then have to clean out all the grinds that landed on little grind catcher below the hole. You then have to clean the utensil you used, your finger, and any other stray grinds on the machine/counter.2. Clean the grinder - Unlock the hopper and lift. Beans will likely fall from the bottom, so be careful. Then you have to scoop out individual beans from the top grinder. Unlock top grinder, remove, and then clear out the beans inside the grinder. Not an easy task given the limited space you have to work in. Once removed, brush out grinds and spin the grinder a bit to ensure it is free and clear of any beans that maybe lodged in. Truth be told, I find the only way to really clean this out is to actually vacuum it out. Replace the top and lock. Replace the hopper and lock.3. Descale (in all fairness, all machines must be descaled) - Basically brew vinegar and water several times. Takes about half an hour.4. Pre-Heat Carafe - You have to pre-heat the carafe every time you use this. This requires 5 minutes of getting super hot water, filling, letting it sit, and then dumping. This also makes the idea of scheduling a brew pretty pointless. Not sure how nobody thought of that.Now, if any one of these things are not done, and not done 100% perfectly, you will end up with brown water. This can happen EVEN if you just performed the 3 steps above. So, ANY batch could be either cold or brown water, even if the machine was cleaned before your last brew. Plus, even if you just cleaned it out, it may not be perfect. That is how sensitive this machine is. Ironically, you can brew a single cup with this machine. Ha! Imagine going through this nightmare spiral of maintenance hell for a single cup????This machine is big and heavy. If you have normal cabinets you will be lifting and pulling out this bulky machine every time you use it in order to fill the water from the top. The stainless steel is very quick to pick up oils from your hands, especially after handling the beans, so the machine requires constant wiping down and cleaning.Now, a few good things. When the machine does brew coffee properly, it is pretty good... although, so is a zero maintenance and reliable Keurig tastes pretty good as well. It looks nice and holds a good amount of beans. The no drip works flawlessly (first time I have experienced that) and the carafe can be placed on a countertop once brewed as there is no heating element.This machine is high maintenance and expensive. You will waste many beans with this machine as you try to balance the many settings and the awful maintenance until you get a decent cup. While some features are cleverly designed, the overall design of this machine is poor. For the price, it is absolutely not worth the time and energy to make a cup of coffee."
"I really love coffee, and our Breville Grind Control makes the best coffee I've ever had. Yes, even superior to our Technivorm Moccamaster that we've used for nearly 20 years. (20 years... try that with your typical made in China machine!) While the Moccamaster is still going strong, we thought we'd try a grind-and-brew coffee maker. While our experience with the Breville started out well, it has ultimately proven to be a huge dissapointment.First off, the required maintanence is absurd, and after the first couple of months I felt like I'd become a slave to the machine.  Understand, we make a lot of coffee (2 to 3 pots a day), so the cleaning ritual gets old in a hurry. The filter basket, a complex piece that resembles an artificial heart, must be rinsed thoroughly after each use. I mean thoroughly. Water must be run over and though the gadget from multiple  angles, as there are many nooks and crannies for grinds to hide. Then, if you want to make another pot right away, you must, as per the manual, dry it. Drying requires running a paper towel over the interior of the basket, making sure to put extra focus on the opening where the ground beans enter. Having finished with the filter basket, you must then wipe off the residual grinds from this silver disk behind the basket. (it opens/closes the chute where the ground beans enter) At this point you might think I'm a serial whiner, or that this procedure isn't so bad for a great cup of coffee, and make no mistake, it's splendid coffee. But the worst is yet to come.According to the manual, the LCD screen will notify the user when the ""coffee chute"" requires cleaning. As I soon discovered, it doesn't. What happens is that the grinder suddenly slows and stops, as though a stick was shoved into the works. Now the fun begins. You must follow a somewhat complex procedure to access the chute, the idea being that the included brush will open things up. But what I was faced with was a mass of grounds that were unfazed by the flimsy brush. Toothpicks were also of no avail, and I finally found what Breville should have packed with the Grind Control in the first place: a flat-bladed screwdriver. That finally broke through the concrete-like obstruction. Since then I've been careful to check it periodically (and checking it is an annoying procedure at best) But the time between clogs is getting shorter, so I still find myself experiencing the grinder, er, grinding to a halt.Initially my passion for good coffee kept me going... cleaning, unclogging, and drinking heavenly coffee. But three months later I've seen that heaven has no part in this diabolical contraption, and have decided that, on the next full moon, I will act. Not wishing this cursed device to fall into the unsuspecting hands of others, it will be buried in my back yard, a screwdriver driven though its evil heart."
"First and foremost, we own several Breville products and find me gravitating towards them for their design athletics and purported quality and performance.  I have developed a love/hate relationship with this coffee maker.  When it works, there isn't anything better that delivers the flavor of fresh ground beans.  The carafe is on par with Yeti for keeping my coffee hot until near noon.  Although it is a pain to dispense 100% off the coffee due to the nature of its design. The hate...  approximately 1 out of 5 grinds, the chute from the grinder to the hopper clogs.  To my knowledge the only way to position the stainless closure disc is to turn the machine on, then open the hopper door to access the chute before the disc closes.  It is generally messy and a pain to clear the chute.  Eventually the machine's internal water valves must crack and allow water to leak internally.  This unfortunately occurred with ours and has seemingly shorted out the circuit board.  During the grind cycle, the grinder never stops, and it eventually comes to a halt creating the smell of a burning motor.  The bottom the machine shows water damage, rust, and discoloration.  What a shame!  What do you want for nearly $380.  Breville clearly has an issue with this design yet does little to stand by their products.  The factory offered for me to send the unit it to be repaired (if possible) at my expense.  Losing faith in the Breville Brand.  Had an on/off switch fail on my Breville Burr Grinder a few years ago...that made it into the trash."
"I really wanted to love this coffee maker. I've had 2 Capresso coffeeteam grind and brews before and found that the heating element failing after a year or two. Being an engineer and exUSAF electronics tech, I actually replaced one of those heating elements and got another year out of it. But when the last one failed before Thanksgiving I looked at reviews and asked around and thought that this one would be the best. Well after two months or so, this is what I feel. Is the coffee tasty - yes. Is it hot - not so much. Does the thermos carafe work - yes if you take the time to pre-heat it by boiling a pot of water, pouring it in and letting it sit. Is it easy to clean - not really. There is a plate in the back behind the filter that needs wiped off every time. At least the filter holder comes out and can be rinsed. If your power goes out and comes back on, the coffee maker runs a pot whether you have the carafe in place or not as I found out with a mess in the morning. The carafe holds onto about an ounce that won't pour out unless you turn the thing upside down. And you're not getting your hand in there to clean it. Lastly the three things I miss about my old maker is the flat front screen with the time displayed and the glass carafe where your can see how much coffee is remaining, and the heating plate which kept the coffee hot.  Which I continued to restart thru the day to keep the pot hot and therefore burned out the heating element over time from overuse."
"I've had this machine for 2 1/2 years now and it has started going South. It is not dispersing the correct amount of water. I've tried the troubleshooting solutions offered in the manual to no avail. This morning I attempted to make a 14 oz cup of coffee as I do every morning and when the buzzer went off I went to fetch my coffee. I had a teaspoon of coffee in my cup. That was the last straw. Honestly, this machine has always had some kind of issue. Mostly with the amount of coffee it would grind. I've had to calibrate it several times but it eventually seemed to work itself out. I bought a warranty for this product based on the reviews and I'm glad I did. I have submitted a claim and will be purchasing another coffee machine but it will not be this one. It had one job to do and it never really did it consistently. It was a nice concept but it does not work and apparently Breville does not care because they have not addressed the complaints/issues so I'm back to the drawing board. I think I'll buy a separate coffee grinder and coffee maker. Neither will be a Breville.I read all the reviews, good and bad, and weighed my options. The winning feature that sold me on this machine was that I could fill the water tank to capacity and it would disperse water according to the number of cups/ounces I wanted. Setup was stupid easy. Wash all the parts. Put it back together. Run a couple of tanks of water through it to clean out any nasties that may be lurking and walla! You are ready to go. I did get a little surprise when I plugged it up. The measurements showed up in milliliters. Oh no! You mean I have to convert? Have no fear. Just grab your trusty manual and it will tell you how to toggle to ounces. You do have to customize it to your liking which could take at least a week. For instance, you have to get the grind size right for your beans and tweak the strength according to your taste. Making single adjustments at a time will eventually get you there. I also tossed the included gold toned filter to the side and opted for paper filters. I don't like the muddiness you get from those mesh filter baskets. I have never made a pot of coffee so I've never used the carafe. I only make one cup a day so I only use the single serving mode which is freaking awesome. By the way, a cup of coffee to Breville is a paltry 5 oz. My cup is 12 to 14 oz depending on the vessel I'm using that day. With the single serving mode, the water infuses with the coffee for a period of time depending on your strength before it is released into the cup. This is quite important because when making small amounts of coffee, the water would not be in contact with the coffee long enough to extract its goodness and would produce a weak cup of joe which is the basis of a lot of complaints concerning grind and brew coffee makers. This infusion feature is the cure for that.Now I've seen a few complaints/comments about the daily cleaning routine for this machine. I'm not sure why. Like setup, daily cleanup is a breeze. A few damp coffee grounds are left on the silver plate that opens to let the coffee drop into the basket and a few dry grinds fall into the catch tray underneath. You simply wipe the grounds off the plate, dump the tray and rinse the coffee basket. Takes less than 30 seconds. I've added a few photos that show the machine after a brew cycle, after I've wiped the plate down and even the grinder when dissembled. The grinder is a little fuzzy but there is nothing but dust in there. A couple more things. I don't like the brush that came with the machine. I will be purchasing another small stiff bristled brush to brush away the grounds. And since some people complained of the machine giving up the ghost way to soon, I brought a 4-year warranty from Square Trade for $30 bucks. If it does break I'm covered."
"*Pics attached showed product leaking while brewing - watch the paper towel below the machine get progressively more wet.*One year of greatness - brewed delicious coffee at the touch of a button. Could be a little tricky to clean but nothing too difficult. Then problems started piling up.After just over a year of use (now just barely out of warranty) the grinder started acting oddly. The grinder motor wouldn't stop running during the brewing process (when it would previously only run for about 10 seconds at the start of a new brew), or even after the cup of coffee was ready. I assumed there may have been a bean stuck somewhere, so I gave the machine a full deep clean which seemed to solve the problem. Until I noticed water would now leak from the back of the machine during use, leaving large puddles of water on the countertop (see photos). Not great obviously, but theoretically something I could have lived with if it wasn't a sign of key problems with the rest of the machine (hint: it was).About this time I get in touch with Breville support, who were a huge disappointment during this process. They ask me to take a video of the machine running so they could help determine the issue. Well, I ran the machine again, prepared with paper towels for the mess. However, not only did water start pooling underneath the machine, but I caught a whiff of a new, strange smell. I thought it might have been something burning, but it was tough to be sure over the coffee aroma. At that point I was not willing to run the machine again.Things break - it happens. But when you pay this kind of money for something this ""high quality"", you assume that if/when something goes wrong that the company who made it would stand by their product and make it right. Breville had great reviews across their suite of products, so I was willing to take the leap on a fancy coffee machine with that false assumption. All told there were around 7-8 messages between myself and Breville support - the last three were me asking for any follow-ups, maybe troubleshooting tips, etc over the course of the last 2-3 weeks. I have yet to receive any more responses.No one paying this $ amount for a coffee machine is only hoping it lasts a year, so a 2-star rating feels right. Great first year, but ultimately feel very let down by the lack of longevity and poor customer support. I'll be drinking instant coffee while I save up for a different brand."
"I've had this coffee maker for around 2-3 weeks now.  I did a lot of research to find what would work for myself and husband so I made sure if I was spending this much for a coffee maker I wanted it to be for the right one.  EXCELLENT coffee btw!  Not without concerns I might add. Not the easiest machine to operate or get through directions on. First of all I bought this because it had a built in Burr grinder. Unfortunately to set the grinder they expect you to have a food scale which I do not have. So I wound up playing with the setting till I found the best one for me for the calabration of the machine beans.  Now down to some of the main issues I saw listed in other posts about it pouring water everywhere or grinds overflowing.  So, it did pour water out everywhere and that was because although you may hear a click when shutting the door where the filter basket is you have to make sure it is fully secure by pushing it in ALL the way. If the door opens the water doesn't pour into the basket but on your countertop. Once you verify it is in all the way you have no worries.  Other issue I've noticed on this one is the grinder gets clogged once a week and then won't grind and therefore you won't have coffee.  The cheap burr grinder I had before this machine rarely ever clogged up. Oh and the instructions mention a indicator when the grinder gets clogged.  That doesn't pop up. At least not with both the times I've had to clean out mine.  That being said it isn't a extremely difficult process once you know what you are doing. There did seem to be an overflow of grinds just a time or two in the basket. I see that normally when I switch the bean.  Some are denser than others so it might make more or less depending on how easy the beans grind. I never did get any grinds in my coffee during these seldom occasions!  I have noticed the place you pour the water in keeps opening during the brewing circle.  Minor issue but the plastic clip they used to hold it closed doesn't seem to be able to withstand the heat from the brew cycle so it releases it's hold. Once it cools off you can close it again.  Hoping it holds up in the long run.  I really do love the effort they took to make a great coffee machine and you can't beat the coffee flavor 10 out of 10!  Plus the insulated carafe keeps coffee hot for at least 8 hours!"
"I really looked forward to receiving this coffee maker.  It is a really beautiful piece of equipment.  But, unfortunately, the unit simply does not work correctly.  The first several pots of coffee worked perfectly and I was quite happy.  It takes some effort to clean the machine after each use, but that's not a big deal.  The big problem is with the liquid level sensor and the brew cycle.  The pot has the ability to brew 12 cups of coffee.  When you pour water into the unit, a series of numbers on the left of the display show the water level.  When you reach the 12 cup level, the unit beeps, letting you know that it is full.  At least . . . it did that for the first few days.  After a few days, it would no longer beep and the fill level would never go past a reading of ""11"".  I actually overfilled the unit a couple of times, with water pouring out onto the kitchen counter.  There is a red, mechanical float on the right side of the machine that does indicate when the unit is more or less full.  This should have been a warning.  If the level sensor worked properly . . . why is there a need for a mechanical float?The big problem with this machine is that it does not use all of the water that you put into it.  I would fill the unit with water.  I set the requested brew quantity to 12 cups.  After starting the brew cycle, the timer indicates that it will be approximately 11 minutes to complete the cycle.  As the brew cycle continues, the level indicator goes from 11 to 10 to 9 . . . down to 5.  But, that's where the level sensor stops . . . it does not show it decreasing to 4, 3, 2, 1, etc.  It suddenly just shows a message that the water supply needs to be filled.  This seems to happen when there is about 4 1/2 minutes of brew time left.When the cycle finishes . . . the pot is only about 2/3rds full.When starting a new cycle, the water level shows ""Fill"", indicating that the reservoir is empty.  But, if I only pour a small amount of water into the reservoir . . . the water level immediately displays ""5"".  I think this happens because the previous brew cycle did not complete all the way and water is left in the reservoir.  I could understand this, if I had previously asked to brew less than 12 cups . . . but, that's not the case.The net result is that the coffee is very strong (probably because not enough water is being used).  This also means you end up wasting a ton of coffee beans.A final complaint is with the carafe itself.  It is sealed so that you don't need a warming plate.  Initially, I loved this idea because it meant no wasted electricity to keep the coffee warm.  And the carafe does keep the coffee warm for more than two hours.  But, this comes at a price.  The design of the carafe prevents you from easily emptying the coffee completely.  There is a rim around the top of the carafe that makes emptying the carafe cumbersome.  You have to tilt the carafe completely upside down to get the last of the coffee out.  Good luck hitting your cup when you try this.In summary . . . this is an absolutely beautiful coffee maker . . . that doesn't really work.  I think this is the only thing I've ever returned to Amazon.  If you don't want to be disappointed . . . look elsewhere for your coffee maker."
"After 7 months, my husband has stopped using this expensive coffee grinder/brewer.  I bought it because it had a clock and timer and it would make coffee by the cup on demand, #1 the bean grinding woke us up every morning right at 5:15 am, it's very loud and obnoxious and our room is on the opposite side of the house!#2 all of the water for the coffee would not drip to the cup or the carafe, it left over and inch to 2 inches of water each time which made clean-up and removal of the half full filter from the filter cavity difficult; furthermore for a carafe of coffee for 3 people, we needed to brew it 3 different times to get enough liquid from the filter to serve 3 people, that's ridiculous. #3 after repeated use, the grind of the coffee became less fine and more chunky so the burr grinder plates probably need replacing, but after 7 months this seems unreasonable? It'll be  taken to Goodwill, maybe someone else will appreciate it. I would not advise purchasing."
"I bought this as a replacement to a much older BHG grinder/brewer I've had for a while. My old machine was 10 cup, and had a grinder built in, but it was a blade. It made good coffee and I liked that I could control the taste by the volume of beans I put in it. However, I wanted a 12 cup brewer and a bur grinder so the Breville seemed like it had all the features I was looking for. I like that it has a bean hopper that I can just fill and use. I like that I can fill the water reservoir and use only the amount of water I need for each brew. I like that I can adjust the grind size, the number of cups in the carafe and the fact that I can change to a single cup brew. Previously I'd have to break out my French press if I wanted a single cup. All good features and it's been working good so far. Con's so far? it's taken me a while to get things dialed in to my taste. I'm having trouble getting a strong enough cup of coffee for my liking. The nice bean hopper feature is also a drawback as I can't adjust the amount of beans I grind to suite my taste. Even a strength setting of 8 I find too weak for my taste. But it's getting better as I am adjusting and experimenting with grind size. At first I was a little disappointed with this unit, but as I'm learning it, the better it's getting and the more I'm enjoying it. In my case, the benefits certainly outweigh the con's and so far I recommend it. I've only had it since Christmas so I can't comment to the longer term function of the unit, but based on other reviews, I'm definitely doing my part to keep the unit clean after each use.(Update) It's been a couple months now of use and I am loving this machine! Yes, it does require upkeep, but that's fine with me.  I do a light cleaning about once a week and about every 2 weeks remove the hopper and do the deep cleaning. Other than that, nothing else and this thing works great. I don't mind it cause I like to tinker anyway. Makes a good cup every time, especially now that I have the settings the way I like it. Works just as good using beans or pre-ground coffee. I love that I can make a single up on weekday mornings and brew a full pot on weekends. In both instances, the coffee comes out great. Really enjoying this machine and highly recommend it.1 Yr Update: It's been almost a year so I thought I'd revisit this. After 11+ months of use, I have to say I love this machine. Well worth the price. For all those who complain about having to clean the machine, I say suck it up and stop complaining. How pissed would you be if you discovered your favorite coffee cafe wasn't cleaning their machines on a daily basis! Once a week I spend 10 minutes doing a detailed cleaning and I've had zero issues with this unit. I believe weekly maintenance is important. If I can't find 10 minutes a week, then I don't deserve to complain when the machine doesn't live up to my standards. I've also discovered the key to getting the perfect strength coffee. People, use the calibration routine! This is essential to dialing in the perfect taste. I had been struggling getting the coffee strong enough for my liking. By calibrating, and then lowering the weighed grams amount on the dial, I was able to fool the machine into grinding more beans per cup, resulting in the strength I've been looking for. If you're going to spend $200-$300 on a coffee machine and aren't prepared to put the effort into maintaining and calibration, then don't complain when it doesn't give you what you expect. Did I say I love this machine! I've raised my rating to 5 stars as this machine delivers in every way.(UPDATE) It was great while it lasted. The computer doesn't allow me to brew anymore. I've taken everything apart and cleaned it, followed all the troubleshooting solutions, it just beeps at me and gives me a code 001. For the price I should have gotten more than a year and a half out of it. Changed my rating from 5 to 2 stars. It's a 5 Star product, until it breaks!"
"I really wanted to love it. But I don’t.  After much research and reading here on Amazon, and other reviews, etc., I decided I wanted to splurge for a great coffee maker.  As a busy mom of 5, coffee is something I really like… need… actually think about in the morning when I wake up… so I figured this expensive unit would be worth it.  Most of the comments, here and at the video tube, gave great reviews, “best cup of coffee ever” and so on and so on.  Well, it is just an “average” cup of coffee.  The end.I am returning it, after two weeks of trying to convince myself that this expensive machine must be good.  I understand the importance of good coffee so I buy quality expensive/quality coffee beans.  I have great water.  I cleaned the machine regularly.  Boy, did I clean.  I have never put so much time into cleaning a coffee maker.  Any time I would have otherwise saved, by having the beans in the hopper and pushing the fancy buttons to make my brew, was tripled in the clean up of the unit.Why? Well, the grinder sends the coffee into the chute that goes to a two-layered lid on the coffee filter basket.  The top half of the basket lid cannot be cleaned inside and you have to let really hot water run through it for a few minutes to get out all of the grounds that get stuck in there, (after each and every use), and you can still see some coffee “oil” residue after doing that.  That might account for what I found to be a more bitter taste a week after regular use.The carafe… oh that carafe…. You will need a bottle brush.  You will hurt your fingers, when you try to wipe out the inside of the sharp top of the thing.  And… you have to literally dump the carafe upside down to get out the last cup of coffee, and some still stays in there.  The carafe has a lip around it that wont even let out all of the hot water that you put into it – to warm the thing up before brewing.  Oh, yeah, you have to do that too, warm the thing up if you want a hot cup of coffee, and I have to have it hot.  The whole premise of the carafe is so your coffee will not get bitter if is sits there on that heating element.  It’s a good thing for this unit, because the coffee is not great enough to drink much of, so it will sit there.Now, the grinder… The grinder also must be thoroughly cleaned after each use.  Breville thoughtfully put a little brush inside the hopper for you to use, so I did.  And, I cleaned the grinder wheel underneath that gets pretty grimy, and that almost invisible little basket shelf -that says “clean me”, on it and you better do it.  When the grinder started making halting noises during some of the grinds,  that’s when I made the decision to send it back. So, another issue, the manual says don’t use oily beans.  Okay, I have new expensive beans from the store, and they do look a bit shiny, but nothing out of the ordinary.  So, I cleaned it again.  I found myself cleaning this coffee machine and all of its gadgets more than I have ever cleaned any coffee maker.  If I would have gotten that absolutely amazing, gee, its totally worth it cup of Joe, then maybe I would have kept it.As for the best cup of coffee I have ever had… that would be the coffee that my grandmother made for me in her old time percolator.  It took time to make, and you had to stick around to make sure you did it right. But, it was “really” good.  I do have one of those, but my schedule doesn’t allow me to use it as much as I would like.  So, I am on a quest to find the best cup of coffee that I can find from a time saving machine.  I will let you know how it goes..."
"We bought this unit for convenience, switching over from making our coffee in the morning with a standalone burr-grinder and a couple of Clever drippers. The coffee we made with that system was really delicious, but it took a bit of time every morning and we felt like the convenience and welcoming smell of coffee already brewed when we got downstairs was a good tradeoff.After a bit of research we bought the Breville Grind Control, and we've had it for probably a year now I'd say. This morning, having made one of the common (for our house) mistakes this brewer makes really easy to do, I feel prompted to review it.1. If you forget to insert the filter, the machine makes a giant mess all over your counter. Hot semi-brewed coffee everywhere, grounds everywhere. Do not forget the filter. I did this morning and spent 15 infuriating minutes cleaning up and then I had to re-brew. ARGH. It feels like at least the leaking mess part could have been engineered out of this doohickey.2. Don't forget to dry the grounds chute on the filter cup. If you rinse it and leave it wet just before you make coffee, the grounds will clog in that little chute and you won't have enough in the filter and the grinder will make sad noises as it struggles to shove powder into a stopped up hole. I guess like how Charlie Sheen must've sounded at points in the 80's.3. There is quite a bit of cleaning that goes along with this brewer. Several small plastic trays and covers need cleaning, there's a metal plate that collects hardened coffee that needs cleaning, the filter cup, the catcher under the carafe, and the carafe itself-- all need cleaning, and not just once in a moon. Some of these things you have to clean every day.4. Speaking of the carafe, it's weird. The design makes it so in order to pour the coffee you almost have to turn the thing upside down. It's a kind of strange experience.5. The machine will say ""4 cups"" but it thinks 4oz is a cup. You can't adjust this, so I'm just letting you know. Who drinks drip coffee 4oz at a time? WTF Breville?6. The coffee is a little bit weak. Especially coming from a pour-over style method, we were underwhelmed by the strength and richness of the coffee that the Breville makes. We got used to it, but it's now more of a treat to get coffee at a shop than it used to be when we could make awesome coffee at home. (Due to space constraints we got rid of our other apparatus for making coffee.) We tried various methods for increasing the strength-- the Breville itself only goes up to a strength level of ""8"" and then it brews what it brews. And if you make like, 7 cups, it basically fills the filter with grounds. So it's not like you can add a ton more to boost the strength-- even if you did want to waste your nice coffee beans to compensate for your brewer.So anyway, yeah. Three stars."
"This machine is a great bean grinder that you can run water through. HOWEVER, IF YOU WANT A HOT CUP OF COFFEE, save your money and buy a bean grinder for $18 and a kettle.This coffee maker has a DESIGN FLAW because it has a faulty internal heating element and no base/carafe warmer. Any buyer should have a reasonable expectation that the coffee machine they are purchasing heats the water that then makes the coffee. This coffee maker does not. See manual photos where Breville repeatedly writes,""Pre-heat the carafe or cup for best results. A pre-heated carafe or cup will help maintain the coffee's optimal temperature and help keep coffee hotter for longer.""You are reading correctly. The temperature of the coffee is dependent upon the temperature of the water YOU PUT into 1) the carafe (or cup) to warm it up and 2) the temperature of the water YOU PUT into the coffee maker's water tank. You quickly discover that this completely defeats the ""programmable"" feature, the expensive feature you are paying for, and all hope of coffee that isn't lukewarm.To be clear, there is a light on the easy-to-read LED screen that reads, ""Pre-Heating,"" but the water has never risen above 138 F (far below the 'optimal brewing temperature of 194-203 F"" listed on Breville's own ""Tips and Techniques"" package insert). Moreover, there is no way to access this pre-heating element to adjust it upward. Moreover, the stand or drip tray is a piece of plastic: NO heating or warming element here either. Once again, your coffee temp is limited to the temperature of the water you put in.Let's talk about the carafe; it is unusually heavy while still not holding any temperature. It cannot be ""warmed""  once the coffee has brewed, and it requires a funnel (not included) to pour all of the water out of the blunt-angle carafe lip into the very narrow 'flip-top' lid leading to the water tank.The adjustable burr grinder and strength dial are amazing and the reason I was sold on the machine. However, these features are useless because the machine is only capable of putting out lukewarm coffee even AFTER you spend the suggested ""30 seconds"" warming up the carafe or cup and then filling the water tank.After working with this new machine for over a month because I was convinced the water temperature issue was my fault (so I am past all return options). I finally called customer service to complain about the lukewarm coffee that this machine consistently makes. The Breville agent told me, ""The machine specs do not list any heating element,"" and it was my fault for not deducing this before I bought the coffee maker."
"I was so excited by this coffee maker but it has been a headache the last 3 weeks or so of use. It started to malfunction in the programed state, it would start at 6:00 a.m. like I programed it to do and then I would walk into my kitchen to see the brew basket popped out, coffee grounds all over the counter and floor and no coffee made, sometimes it would only brew half the batch and then pop out the brew basket. I am guessing I got a lemon of a coffee maker and of course it just started doing this after having it since July so I can not longer return it. That is an expensive coffee maker to no longer have the auto function work. It is also a real pain to just grind coffee and not have it brew. I like to camp with my coffee press and just bring fresh ground coffee, but you have to go full barista and weigh out grind modes and difficult settings to just get ground beans.  Not worth all the extra $$"
"This is my 4th ""grind and brew"" coffee maker. While this Breville model makes good tasting coffee, there are a few shortcomings to be aware of when comparing to other models:- The carafe itself: most coffee makers you take the carafe to your faucet or a filtered fridge water supply to fill it up (using the carafe's volume indicator to measure how much water you will need). Not possible with this Breville model for 2 reasons; the carafe does not have a volume indicator at all, and the caraf is just too thick to even fit in a refrigerator's water supply inlet. This leaves me to have to grab a different large cup to workaround this shortcoming. Not the end of the world, just annoying I cannot just use the carafe itself to get an accurate water supply. Sure there is a digital indicator of how much water you are adding when you pour the water in, but it would be nice to know that when I'm standing at the fridge (not when it- Bean hoper: This model holds the average amount of coffee beans, but most times the beans do not properly distribute within the hopper after beans have been ground. This means that each morning before making the next pot of coffee I have to open the bean hopper lid & manually move the beans around so that the next pot of coffee has the right amount of beans dispensed. Before noticing this issue I had several pots of coffee with very little beans ground up because all the beans were in a pile on one side of the bean hopper and not properly disbursing down the hopper chute on their own.Temperature - coffee tastes good, but the fact that this unit doesn't have a burner/warming plate under the carafe results in room temp coffee. The instructions indicate to manually warm your cup with hot water, but those are extra steps you don't have to take with other coffee makers that do happen to have a warming plate. This workaround seem like a cop-out response to me.Suggestions to the product team;- Thinner carafe with volume lines, so that you can easily use the carafe to add the perfect volume of water (instead of a guessing game).- Warming plate under the carafe, so that 1-2 hrs later you still have warm coffee (just like every other model provides, not sure why Breville cannot accomplish this when much less expensive models do provide this).- Adjust the bean hopper so that beans naturally fall down the hopper chute without manual intervention."
"If I were to name this machine, that name would be “heartbreak”.When my burr grinder died a little over a year ago, I decided to splurge on this really cool all-in-one grinder/maker.  The thought of making my requisite three cups of coffee every morning by simply hitting a button seemed almost too good to be true.  I fact— it seemed like a dream. Those feelings, however, soon gave way to a sobering slap in the face from reality.I have particular taste in coffee.  I like it strong, and I typically favor dark roasted Indonesian beans.  To get my coffee brewed in this style, I need to set the grind to its finest setting— and to get three cups I need to set the amount to five (not three).  This alone will get me what I need.  It’s been said elsewhere in these reviews that this machine uses more coffee than what is expected.  Well here are some numbers to quantify that:  In 2000 I sent $254.75 on retail coffee.  With this new machine, first put to use in January of 2001 I spent $363.43 on coffee.  My coffee drinking habits were unchanged between those two years. (I have an app where which I log all expenses— and I buy my coffee at the same place— that’s how I am able to provide those numbers). The difference in cost, while certainly not negligible, isn’t the main reason for my unhappiness with regard to this machine though….The REAL issue with this coffee maker is the fact that it clogs— CONSTANTLY.  It has been said elsewhere in the body of reviews that dark roasted finely ground coffee is part of a recipe for trouble with this machine.  That’s what I drink though, and that’s what a lot of people like. Every morning was a drama… Will it clog today, or will today things go smoothly?  It got to the point where to circumvent the anger associated with a wasted pot (due to a clog) I needed to use a flashlight and an oyster shucker tool to painstakingly remove the grounds in the chute between the grinder and the basket. I had to do this every day.  Every. Single. Day.  How’s THAT for the convenience of an all-in-one?I don’t like to waste things.  I spent around $300 on this machine and technically, it still works. For those reasons, I’ve been suffering though this for many months.  It occurred to me this week that every time I look at this thing sitting on my counter my blood pressure goes up.  Finally— today— I caved and bought a new burr grinder. Life is too short.  Not sure what to do with this Breville.Edit: I also have a Breville Barista Express for espresso and latte duties.  Love it.I have a Breville Juice Fountain Elite too-- and I love that.The point of mentioning this is that I think pretty highly of the manufacturer.  This item, however, was a pretty bad misfire."
"This makes good coffee, but the grinder clogs after every pot. The only way I’ve found to reliably grind is to clean it fully after every use. If you want to spend 15 mins a day cleaning your coffee maker, this one’s for you!"
"I bought this because I really wanted a combination burr mill and coffee maker. I own a Breville Barista Pro so am familiar with Breville and expected this to be of the same quality as the espresso machine. It is not.There is no heating plate element. I usually end up just setting it to make a single cup and time it to be ready when I get up, so it works OK. The idea otherwise is that it comes with an insulated thick-walled carafe. However, the carafe design is subpar, and it is essentially impossible to empty the carafe completely, either of the last of the coffee or of water to clean it out with. (This is a lot of why I just use a cup.)Next, the serving sizes are weird and inaccurate. I set it to make a 20 ounce cup of coffee. I consistently get 16 ounces. Based on the tank filling, it also seems to believe a cup of coffee is supposed to be 4 ounces. Also, I have re-calibrated the grinder several times and it ALWAYS needs significant readjusting and thinks it's grinding a lot more than it is.The grounds basket is also not well designed. I just use a paper filter, because you have to take out the entire assembly that the filter basket sits in to clean it. I could see that I was either going to burn myself or toss the gold filter basket in the trash one of these days. So now I use paper, and reserve the gold filter basket for my routine re-calibrations of the grinder.All this might be tolerable if it made high quality coffee. After all, it's Breville, and it was an expensive machine. It does not. I had to turn the grind down to about as fine as it gets, and turn the strength up to maximum, to get a cup of coffee that barely surpasses being outright watery. Plus I get grounds in the cup a lot of the time. I would be embarrassed to serve guests coffee from this machine."
"This product excels at the bottom line - does it make good coffee? You bet! It is also well-made, looks stylish, and is reasonably easy to use. I particularly like how the thermos-style pot keeps coffee warm for hours. You don't have that old burnt coffee stained hot plate like you do with most coffee pots.However, there is some room for improvement.1)  I feel like the unit uses more coffee than when I was grinding my own. I can't really measure it, but it is a subjective impression. Of course, the coffee is good and I might be drinking more.2) The water volume indicator and the amount to brew indicator should register in ounces and milliliters as well as ""cups"". It has that capability in the single serving setting, but not with the carafe. If you have to fill multiple travel mugs of different sizes, a ""cups"" denomination is kind of a pain. Also, the brew indicator should reflect the approximate volume to be delivered. It doesn't appear to allow for the water volume lost in the filter and coffee grounds.3) There should be an overflow warning. We inadvertently put the pot under without it's lid and the filter basket didn't open to let the coffee flow out. It overflowed instead and made quite a mess.4) There should be a low bean warning. If the hopper runs out of beans during the grind, you really don't have a good way to know how much coffee has been ground or what volume can be made.That being said, the unit looks great and makes fine coffee.Review update Feb 2018. While I still like this product, the frequency of required cleaning has become a real negative. Part of that is on me because my preferred coffee is dark and has a higher oil content when ground. The machine does not have a good system for moving the ground coffee from the grinder through a short passage to the brewing basket. It relies on gravity and pressure from vanes in the grinder. That would likely be adequate with a lighter, drier bean, but my coffee will clog that passage quickly and the machine must be cleaned after 3-4 pots. The cleaning process can easily take 15-20 min. so we wind up just throwing some Folger's in the brewer instead. The design needs to include a piston or something to move all of the ground coffee through the passage and into the brewing basket.I would be better off having a separate grinder and brewer rather than this combination unit."
"We were so excited to get this machine. The hubby searched for a long while for a good coffee pot as we got rid of our kuerig machine because they die fast. We went to cold brew and gave that up and moved to a French press. So we were super excited to find this machine. Well that excitement went away quickly. The calibration didn’t work for the coffee bean grind. It was going through tons of whole beans. Then the standby wouldn’t go into stand by and the light would just stay on. My husband contacted breville and no response. Then the door started popping open durning brewing. We feel maybe we just got a bad machine and are going to try again, as there are so many good reviews. So at this point they get 2 stars. Guess we will see if we do decide to order another one."
"Nov-2019 update. no matter how you care or clean it this thing is almost worthless as a coffee maker.  Sometimes anywhere from 1 out of 3 to 1 out of 5 times the grind coffee jams in the slue so you get very weak coffee. Ok so just grinder coffee with a grinder; but 1 time out f 4 to 6 the water knocks all the coffee to one side of the cup and you get weak coffee; just flaky as all not ready for consumer use. The only way to get ok coffee out of it is to use another grinder and use a diffuser over the grounds. Which if I wanted to do that I could of just got a 35 dollar coffee maker. I wanted fresh ground and brewed coffee when I wake up; I paid 284 bucks for this to do it and it FAILED me. Time to move on to something that works. Anyone want to buy mine?May-2018 Update: So coffee strength is never the same between any 2 pots; you have to clean it every single time or else the ground coffee jams in the  chute and sometimes still jams even when you just cleaned it! Pretty much have given up using the grinder. Not a value for 284 bucks!Only on the second pot; haven't even used the auto program function yet -so a very first impression review. I work as a mission controller, so shift work and so far 14 weeks in a row of over 60 hour weeks all Mid-shifts of 12 hours, My Ninja POS died after 14 months so needed a replacement ASAP and didn't even have time to run to Target so bought The Breville 650BSS off Amazon. So PROs: Makes a great coffee, easy to use, grinds good brews, good looking on the counter so the wife is happy, as it grinds it's self grinder off the counter less mess wife even more happy. At 10 cups my usual you can brew at strength 7 taste like 60% to an espresso; at 12 cups - the max- you can brew at strength 6 about 50% to an espresso using my tingle the scalp on first three sip scale. I use the lowest grind a course powder. Less cups you can brew stronger. CONs: maybe too loud to use the grinder for automatic early mornings might get a black eye from waking the wife up. I prefer a finer ground- you won't.  Could be easier to clean, Small opening to fill the water. Is it a value for the ($284.00!) money? Well we will see how long it last, yes if it last until 2027.Update:Almost PERFECT! Only a few misses and a wait for the next 10 to see if it was a value for the cost. One seems that there is no way to use the grinder by itself in advance so using the program function wakes the rest of the house up at 5-AM. Second it really is kind of hard to clean the burr and shoot. Third the craft has a huge 360 degree lip so it's hard to pour out that last 2 OZ of coffee; but the lip helps trap grounds in the craft, Fourth; it almost always drops so grounds in the coffee. Fifth for me it doesn't grind fine enough; you don't get an powder type grind that I like. Sixth for the cost the wife is going kill me for waking her up at 5 AM with this thing esp. as a shift worker I work SAT and SUN AM too an it cost 300 dollars! -I Have owned 11 cars 3 of which cost less. Okay enough complaints;  It works, the coffee taste great, the coffee is hot enough and so far after a month it still works great and looks great. If it last 10 years ($300/10 for $30 per year life cycle cost) I will up it to 5 stars; If the wife hasn't kill me for waking her up with it before then,"
"Well, after two months of quality coffee the machine seems to be malfunctioning. Now when brewing coffee, regardless of the setting, it just grinds all the beans in the hopper and dispenses them into the filter. I've had some super espresso coffee past couple days before I realized what was happening.Troubleshooting steps were not helpful but I was able to determine on my own that the grinder was not properly tightened after cleaning."
Makes really good coffee but the weekly maintanance is a drag.  Nothing says good morning like a hot cup of water because it's time to vacuum the coffee maker again.  Yes...vacuum!  Coffee gets packed in the shoot and needs to be vacuumed out at least weekly.  It is time I look for a different machine :/
"Have owned this machine for 7 months now. Use it daily. Its been a journey. I bought this to get a machine that can grind and brew coffee thinking it would be easier and more efficient than separate devices. I was wrong. This machine is built so badly you work as much as you drink.-SO much maintenance. (Or else..)-If not bone dry there will be consequences in the basket that collects the grinds.-SO expensive-SO many things that can go wrong if you miss a checklist step.-TOO much work when the machine is supposed to be the one doing the work.-More work than a separate grinder/drip machine combo and more expensive than both combined.-You can select from single cup to 12 cups...but who wants to clean and prepare the machine again for just 1 cup of coffee?Parts are really hard to find if anything breaks. The tab on the filter basket is broken off mine now and Breville will offer this part via the Australia/Canada/etc sites but not the US. Do not sell this part here from their own site. There are about a dozen ""fixitparts"" websites that sell this but the price is looking like $40 for this basket when a single customer replaceable part broke off of it. They won't sell the parts to fix it though.I have plenty of money to spend on this...I just don't see the point. This coffee maker makes no sense at this price. Its no better at making a cup of coffee with fresh grind than a machine from Cuisinart that costs $150 and has replacement parts available all over the net.This is my last...and I mean this, last Breville purchase. All the stainless steel in the world cannot cover up  the crap quality control and design you put in your current products. In the past this brand was stellar."
On functionality—the carafe drips all over the counter when pouring. On workmanship—I have had the coffee machine for seven months and now have to send it in for service because the electronics broke. Not impressive for a $350 coffee maker.  Breville has provided a shipping label for service.
"If I could describe the perfect coffee machine, this is pretty much it. It's compact, looks good, has a built in conical burr grinder and the ability to use pre-ground, the ability to brew single cups of any size or a full pot while automatically grinding just the right amount of coffee for any size, while saturating all coffee with water and holding it before it releases it to your cup/carafe.Yes - it does all this and more.But then within 12-months issues began to surface. Periodically, it would not brew, or the water display digital readout would falter and say you have 5 cups inside (when you have more) and then when you add more it would say you are now at 9 of 12 cups... but if you add anything beyond 9 cups, it will leak out (as you are actually at 12 already). Further, it will insist you add more water even when there is 5 cups already inside. A few reboots and it will take care of itself eventually. Until it returns again.But I could live with the water readout nuisance. What I can not live with is the fact that my $300 coffee maker would stop pushing coffee from the grinder to the filter. It would constantly get clogged. Then the motor turning the 'disk' to allow or stop coffee from coming in failed. Now it won't even brew coffee even if I just add my own coffee grounds to the filter (and not use the grinder). It was purchased at the end of 2019, and by mid-2021, it would work maybe 50% of the time. Otherwise, I would get the dreaded 'beep beep beep' where it would try to brew, filling the filter with water but not releasing any and then shut itself off. Then, by the end of 2021, it wouldn't brew at all. I gave up and converted to my 10+ year old Cuisinart coffee maker and it still brews just fine. I then tried again this month, taking it apart and cleaning everything I could think of, watched videos for help but ultimately, it refused to work.Given this, I would not recommend this coffee maker. And, it has prevented me from wanting to buy another Breville coffee maker or espresso maker as I don't want a paperweight in 2-years."
"I've had my coffee maker less than two years. Was making great coffee, then started not making the amount of coffee it was set for. Then the fill tank alarm doesn't work. Now the display light will mot shut off and it reads Standby but the owners manual doesn't even mention Standby as an option. So we called their hot line for help and they said to run descale cycle using their solution. Like that was going to fix computer or electrical problems. With having to keep the ground coffee pathway super clean every week just makes the coffee maker not worth it. Great cup of coffee when it's working."
"Unfortunately I have chosen to return this Breville Grind Control coffee maker. I had high hopes for great freshly ground coffee but I should have paid more attention to the lower ratings shown here on Amazon. I advise those considering buying to read the reviews carefully.The Breville coffee maker is a very well designed, complex machine. I'm a retired engineer, so I appreciate a good machine design. But with the complexity comes high maintenance. I found that I needed to clean the coffee chute every time I brewed a cup of coffee. This takes only a few minutes, but it's quite a lot to do that I've never had to do with other simpler coffee makers. But those coffee makers did not grind the beans.The key flaw is the chute that directs the fresh grinds into the brew basket. The chute plugs up *very* easily, resulting in inconsistent coffee strength. When I adjusted the grind size, I found that my preferred grind of ""2"" increased the chute plugging, so the coffee flavor was even more inconsistent. I had to back off the grind to 3 or 4 to lessen the amount of plugging. But it plugged anyway. I also found that the plug of coffee grinds was wasting quite a bit of coffee each time, as much as a couple tablespoons of grinds; I've not had that problem when using a separate burr grinder.The coffee maker is very sophisticated. It knows how much coffee to grind based upon the size of the cup, the strength desired and the fineness of the grind selected. The coffee maker will make a single cup, large or small, and up to 10 cups in the thermos. It really is an impressive machine.It does a lot of things automatically, such as beeping when the water reservoir is filled to capacity. It won't let you make a cup coffee if it detects there's not enough water. It reminds you to change the coffee filter. It preheats the water, then ""infuses"" the ground coffee and then brews the coffee -- all good steps in the ideal coffee brewing process. A motor turns a coffee grind chute wheel to open it and close it at the proper times. The flow of water is turned on and off for infusing and then for brewing. There are interlocks to prevent unexpected things, like the chute wheel will only open for chute cleaning if the machine detects the user has first removed the bean hopper.But that darned coffee grind chute is the key weakness of the design. I found that about 3 out of 4 brews were fairly consistent, but the chute would clog unexpectedly and the brew would be weaker than normal. Cleaning the chute is quite a process. It's fairly quick but it involves removing parts, then replacing parts to allow the chute wheel to open to get to the plugged chute, cleaning and then reversing the part sequencing. Again, this is not hard to do, but it involves a lot of cleaning steps every day just to make a fairly consistent cup of coffee.I finally concluded that the plugging of the coffee chute was just not tolerable to me. So -- back it goes to Amazon. So sorry.I like the Breville design; perhaps I'll try the Breville Precision Brewer, which has very similar controls but without the grinder. I can reuse my old burr grinder."
"punchline: Who ever designed the carafe has never actually poured liquid from one.I love the fact that you can dial the ground coarseness.  I love the fact that you can dial the strength.  I love the fact that there is no hot plate.  if you want to ""dial in"" on how you like your coffee... this is the machine for you!HOWEVER, you HAVE TO clean the basket after EACH USE.  So if you read the punchline, and you said, well why don't you just make one big cup, and avoid the carafe.  Yup, you can do that and it works great, but you have to still clean the basket out.Rinsing the basket is not a big deal... run it under some water and make sure the grounds cleaned out... let it dry, then pop it back in the unit.  Its really not that terrible... tedious, but not terrible.  Its the price you pay for a good cup of coffee, and I can deal with it.But the fact that the carafe is literally squared in the inside of the top, is terrible.  You literally have to make an extra cup of coffee to actually get the amount you want.And since I am ranting, and you are still reading... the grinder only allows beans to fall in to be ground in the front of the bean storage.  I am forced to make sure there are beans in the front, so they can then fall in to be ground the yield the strength of coffee I want.  What this means, is that if all of your beans are in the back and not falling into the grinder, you won't get enough beans to make the correct strength of coffee.IMO gravity was left out of a couple of design equations.Other than those two things... love this coffee machine, and I guess we will be a couple for a while.PS... the reviewer who stated that you have to turn the carafe upside down to get the last bit of coffee out, isn't lying."
"It makes good coffee, and I don’t have to grind every other day. That said it is a complicated machine to use and tinker with. It requires a fair amount of cleaning each use, and every couple of weeks. That can be a good thing because most coffee pots are pretty gross when you take them apart for a deep clean. Definitely read the directions before using it the first time as it is not intuitive and there are several tricks to making the machine work properly. It could use a good sized water container to help fill the tank as well. For $300 I would expect a simple tool like that to be included. I usually have to search for a jug or measuring cup with a proper spout to fill the tank each morning. It took some experimenting to get the right settings, but once we did it does make a fine cup of coffee. The carafe keeps the coffee hot, but it is very hard to get all of the coffee out of the carafe. In order to completely empty it you have to invert it over the sink. Lastly, this is our second one as the first one had a latch problem with the filter and it kept popping open mid-brew. It didn’t make a mess, and is a safety feature for accidents, but we were using the machine properly and it should not have tripped open. Having 3 or 4 brews ruined in the first month prompted me to get a replacement machine. Breville replaced it without question and the new one seems to be working fine. All-in-all a good machine that makes good coffee. I hope it lasts 10 years for the $$$."
"The idea of this is great.  It's seemingly an all in one easy solution for making nice coffee.  Unfortunately there are some serious issues:1. The hopper is fairly unreliable.  If it's not really full beans don't feed well and you end up grinding air for a while.  The amount of beans ground is measured by TIME, so expect a weak pot of coffee if this happens.2. If you enjoy medium or light roasts you can go a long time without have to clean the chute/hopper.  If you like greasier dark roasts the chute gets clogged regularly.3. The water level appears to be measured strangely - like if you fill it to 8.1 cups it considers that 9 cups.  So the volume is pretty variable (and so is the strength).4. If you completely empty the water, on the next cycle is assumes whatever level you filled it to is the amount of coffee you want.  So if you've been making 6 cups of coffee for 6 months and one day just happen to empty the water and fill it to 10 cups.  You get 10 cups.  Obviously not a deal breaker, but just doesn't make a ton of sense :: shrug ::As a result of the above, I can't really use the automatic features of this and have to hand feed it and monitor it every morning, which totally defeats the purpose of this thing.  And even when doing this, as a result of #3 it's hard to get a consistent cup of coffee.The insulated carafe is great (besides having to do a handstand to get all the coffee out).  It's been very reliable after years of use.  The grinder is generally very high quality, so if you don't have a burr grinder perhaps this is just the thing you want.  But the maintenance cost (in terms of time - not money) is so high that I'm just not sure it's worth it.I have a nice burr grinder.  Looking forward to replacing this with a more traditional coffee maker soon."
"We have been so disappointed in this coffee maker! It needs to be descaled very often. In addition, it is difficult to clean the coffee debris from the mechanism. When this happens the grinding of the coffee sounds very loud and the coffee comes out like light brown water. We have had the coffee maker a year and both my boyfriend and I have tackled the cleaning. It was an expensive coffee maker but when you want a cup of coffee and it is like dirty water, then you give up and buy a different brand. I have never had this experience with other coffee makers."
The grinder stopped working after 6 months and the warranty is 30 days.  Google it first.The brewer has a number of useful options for settings and the coffee brews fine.It also uses a lot of coffee and I had to set on a low volume to prevent overflow of grinds.  My normal 1 bag a week volume was 2.5 x so it add$ up.
Did not use this. My counter to cabinet height is 16.5 inches. The product description states 16.3 inches. No problem. But when it arrived it wouldn’t fit at all and measures a full 17 inches tall.Beware. Make sure you have a bit over 17 inches clearance before buying!3 stars because it looks quality.
"I'd been looking for exactly this device for a while to use as a ""daily driver"" instead of my more time-intensive pour-over morning routine. Looks great, works great, tastes great. Then things started to go sideways.First to go was the cup volume selection function, which stopped allowing me to dial the cup amount down (but would still do up, perplexingly). I worked around this by pouring exactly the amount of water I needed, and the machine would make just that. Still, annoying.Then, the interior basket piece cracked for reasons unknown. Mind you, this piece was always handwashed, never subjected to anything other than daily coffee making. Welp, guess I've got to buy anoth... Oh, what's that? Breville doesn't sell the basket part separately, and I'd have to buy an *entirely new machine*? That was the last straw.I generally hold Breville in high regard and happily own several other of their cooking appliances. And I'm fine paying a premium price for a premium piece of hardware. But the quality just isn't there with the Grind Control, sadly."
"While I like the ability to freshly grind beans and choose the strength of the brew, I have a few beefs with this coffee maker. For the cost, I think this maker should have few flaws.1. You can’t see the amount of coffee in the carafe. This isn’t a deal breaker, but it’s proven to be inconvenient at times.2. It is difficult to completely empty the carafe. It pours a little awkward and you can never get all of the coffee out.3. It is not that hard to make a big mess. The basket has a spring outlet. If you try to fill a mug but forget to choose the mug option, it will overflow coffee out of the basket. The same will happen if you don’t have the carafe top on or get it situated just right.In summary, it’s a good coffee maker and makes good coffee. If I had to purchase again, I would keep looking."
"Requires ridiculous cleaning procedures due to a design flaw in the grounds chute. Also resets the cup setting as you pour water into the reservoir.PROS- Very sturdy and high quality construction. The main body, the switches, dials, panels, the display, everything just feels a level above the other coffee makers I've used.- Consistent and uniform grind, all the way down to very fine size. This is a real quality burr grinder.- Automatically detects and measures out water, so a single refill can be good for up to 2-4 brews (when it doesn't go nuts and reset your cup setting as you pour the water in).- Thermal carafe to keep the coffee warm and flavorful without burning it.CONS- The filter basket is a pain to clean. This is almost entirely due to the grinder chute being horizontal instead of vertical or tilted like in other grind-and-brews. Instead of letting gravity do the work of dropping the grounds neatly into the basket, Breville chose to push the grounds sideways through a wet horizontal chute. The result is a mess in the chute every time you brew, which spills out when you open the basket compartment if not careful, and can collect around the chute door and block it if not cleaned.- Carafe spout is improperly positioned for pouring. You have to almost turn the carafe over to pour the last drop, but not until it's almost empty or it will spill from the lid."
This is a replacement for us.  Not made as good as our original one
"The only redeeming feature of this machine is that it produces a good cup of coffee... which is important. But it better for the headache it causes.The machine needs constant cleaning. Roughly every tenth time I use the machine, it clogs. This requires that you take the machine apart, open up the burr grinder, and clean it carefully and THEN run white rice through the grinder to soak up the bean oils (as I have been informed by the customer service rep). I was informed not to put the beans in the refrigerator, not to use starbucks beans (as they are particularly oily [I am not a starbucks buyer but it seemed relevant for the post]), and that it is expected of customers to clean the machine regularly. I bought the joint grinder/maker in order to enjoy fewer steps in making coffee, not more.Additionally, when the machine is working, it spits out grinds all over the place making a mess.Finally, the carafe needs to be turned nearly completely upside down in order to pour the coffee out. This may seem like a ""who cares"" problem, until a guest attempts to pour their own cup of coffee and, assuming the carafe to work like every other carafe they have ever used or seen or heard about, cannot get the bean juice to flow into their cup as they are accustomed to. You will tell them that they need to turn it more than they think and, doing so, hot coffee pours all over their hand and shoes. It's a great experience.The good news is, the customer service is difficult to reach and rude, so in addition to spending a lot of money on a machine that doesn't work unless you service it regularly, you get to test your patience with someone who insists that buying a coffee machine is much like buying a car and that you should anticipate spending something like $130 every few months to send it in for scheduled maintenance. This is truly a bad purchase. Don't buy it. ... but it does make decent coffee"
"We needed to replace a Bonavita coffee maker and Cuisnart burr grinder and we’re excited to find a combo unit that claimed to make great coffee. We were drawn to the efficiency of a built in grinder, auto grind/brew timer, as well as the possibility of maintaining the quality of coffee that the Bonavita makes every single time.We were sorely disappointed when the first brew was almost unpalatable. While I was surprised at how absolutely horrible this coffee maker could make a cup of coffee, I figured it would take some dialing in, so I wasn’t too upset. Later that day, I try to make another pot and got an “empty coffee filter” message on the display screen. I took the basket back out, rinsed it all out, cleaned everything off put it back in the air remained. The machine was completely non-functioning. As long as that message was on the display. I unplugged it and plugged it back in and it reset, but I had to reset the clock as well. I thought it was probably a fluke error. No big deal. Made the second pot of coffee, a little better, but again, surprisingly bad. Oh, and I know how to make good coffee. That’s not the problem. The next day we went to dial in again, and got the same  empty coffee filter message. Again the machine was completely locked up until I unplugged it, plugged it back in, and reset the clock. Went through this a couple of times and realized there’s a major design flaw here. I reached out to the manufacture, only bit to be told they could not help because I bought it on Amazon . That’s a load of poop. I finally got them to respond, but I will save you the painful details of the interaction as they were of absolutely no help. I have never spent so much money on such a poor product and had such poor customer service.  I’m going back to the Bonavita with an upgraded grinder. At least I know I’ll get good coffee. P.s I can’t speak to the ability of this machine to make a great cup of coffee, as we have been so frustrated with it we haven’t been able to take the time to dial it in. Don’t waste your time either."
"First, having used the Breville Grind Control for several months before this review - I can clearly state that it produces an excellent cup of coffee. Don't get me wrong on that point. Conceptually well thought out, all the proper functions perform in the correct sequence, more than sufficient adjustments to each process where appropriate. However.The carafe was clearly designed by someone with a thorough knowledge of thermodynamics. It keeps the coffee warmed longer than one might expect. However, the thought that someone would actually have to pour the coffee out of the carafe seems to have been left out of the design specifications. After about 70% of the coffee has left the carafe, one must engage in holding the carafe literally upside down, with the coffee dribbling out of the carafe, and not always where is should. Don't even think of serving your guests from the carafe without some strange looks and probably embarrassment. Getting the last 10% of the coffee out of the carafe is somewhat close to impossible while maintaining good manners and controlling one's temperament.Cleaning the carafe becomes just as frustrating as pouring, one must use a towel in hand to get inside, to wipe out the last vestiges of whatever was employed to clean the carafe - as simply inverting the carafe to empty it - is clearly a carafe too far.Similarly, while the filter basket does an excellent job of preventing the coffee filter from collapsing in process, it is not a simple filter basket that one dumps the filter and grounds from, and replaces the filter and moves on. Oh no. One first dumps the filter and grounds, then must proceed to clean an intricately complex filter basket top to remove the old grounds, then dry the basket, and then dry one's hands after the process. This does not even include having to be diligent in cleaning the metal plate that is integral to help seal the transfer of coffee from the grinding mechanism to the filter basket.In summary, if you are seeking a low to more than moderate maintenance coffee machine / grinder combination, I cannot recommend this machine in the slightest.That said, it does produce an excellent cup of coffee, but my word, the carafe is simply ridiculous to the point that I cannot imagine that a well recognized and respected quality firm like Breville would include it in a consumer product.Coffee - five stars.Maintenance - two starsCarafe - black hole.After another month of dealing with this miscreant, I must add that this machine is best for those with very small children, as a small child's hand is the only hand that could possibly wipe the inside of the ""carafe"". I simply cannot comprehend how Breville could put this product on the market, without actually testing the product in normal usage.And now, one year later, it is leaking like a sieve. FWIW, the first machine I received, immediately started leaking and Amazon promptly sent a replacement. This one has waited until the warranty expired to flood my pantry. This experience has turned me off of any Breville product in the future."
"This is my first review of a product since never had an issue like this before.We have some breville products as well as our friends and never had an issue like this.We were  anticipating a good cup of coffee finally but was very disappointed.  The unit looked good  and functioned ok but the coffee produced had a plastic taste.  We did run the unit a number of times(over 5x) with plain water, we used different new coffee beans.  We really wanted to make this work.  We even  put put the plactic component that holds the coffee in solution of baking soda.  That helped a little bit but we did not do that to the main tank which a strong plactic smell came from as well.  We could not get rid of the platic smell.  It got a little better but you can still taste the plastic.  just a fyi we tried the coffee in a k-cup in another unit we had and the coffee was fine so it was not the beans.I did try to contact Breville and opened a case on line as well as called  but it took them a long time to respond and the call back system was not working well(that is another story)  I finally received an email  saying  that it was  uncommon and asked for all the informaiton again that I provided in the case.  I just  find it hard to believe from the  strong smell that I am the only one having this issue.  My co-workers and friends were also surprised as well.We gave it  our best shot since we really wanted it to work. I assume the whole batch of injected plactic they used was bad.  The batch for this unit was 2329.I would be careful on purchasing this unit.  Friends had better luck without the integrated grinder from Breville.If I hear anything else from Breville I will let you know."
"I like several of the features of this product, but there are several design flaws.  First, you don't have the ability to grind and brew later, which is important if you are waking up earlier then others in your house.  Second, the pot design makes it difficult to fill and pour leading to a lot of dripping.  Also, water leaks from the seal between the machine and filter basket.  Every day we awake to water on the counter.  Finally, there is a hole it the back of the machine that is close to the 12 cup mark, which means the pot leaks when you move it."
"This machine is expensive, and I read many reviews and watched many You Tube videos before I spent my money on March 30, 2024.5 months later, it has stopped working and spits out error messages faster than coffee grounds.  Customer support is non-existent.  I have returned it for service and it was promptly sent back.  I tried it for the first time this morning, and the “empty coffee filter” message still appears.  I suspect the machine was never touched and was just re-boxed and returned.If you do not heed the warnings from the many Amazon customers who have purchased this junk, then this will be your experience:1. The machine will operate perfectly for 5-6 months2. Suddenly it will begin to tell you to “empty the coffee filter” which you will already have done.3. You will consult your owners manual, You Tube, and the Breville customer hotline.4. You MAY get this piece of junk to work for a few more weeks5. It will again tell you to empty the coffee filter.6. You will call customer support7. After several wasted hours, they will eventually realize they cannot help8. You will be sent a label so you can mail the aforementioned junk to a “service center”9. In short order, the machine will be returned — it will be dirty.10. You will try to brew a cup of coffee and the piece of junk will tell you to “empty the coffee filter”11. Older and wiser, you will buy a Jura and live happily ever afterHere’s hoping Amazon removes this piece of junk from its website."
"I had high hopes for this coffee machine. After all, it has so many cool features. However, there is one fatal flaw: The coffee chute that delivers coffee from the grinder into the basket frequently clogs. When this happens, you lose an entire pot of coffee, and it takes 20 minutes to finish brewing the current pot, remove the top, open the grinder, remove the grinder wheel, get the cleaning brush, get a flashlight, get something like a martini olive poker to clear out the chute, grab a handheld vacuum to clean up the mess, dump the old pot of coffee, empty the filter basket, and then start the whole brewing process over again.You can never tell when this will happen, and it's very frustrating. It happened to me roughly every 2 weeks, usually when I was in a hurry. I would typically switch back to my Keurig machine for a couple of days until I had a chance to clear the Breville coffee chute. Once this happened to some guests that were staying in my house while I was on vacation, and they were unable to enjoy coffee during their stay, because they couldn't figure out how to unclog the chute.I eventually took this $300 machine to the electronics recycler. I thought about selling it on eBay, but I was worried that I would get negative feedback for selling a broken machine. It's not broken though. It's just poorly designed.It's a shame too, because this machine has many other strengths:• It makes great coffee when it works• It knows how much water you poured in, and doses the coffee grounds appropriately• It's very solid and attractive• The displays are illuminated for use in a dark room• The inlet for adding water is near the front, which makes it easier to use under a cabinetIf it wasn't for the clogging coffee chute, then I would have given this machine 5 stars easily. However, having a $300 machine that completely fails to make coffee once every 2 weeks, and that requires a 20 minute turn-around time to fix is completely unacceptable. Make sure that you search for other reviews with the word ""clog"" in them. There are many poor reviews because of this problem."
"I got this for Xmas '22 for me and my wife.  Honestly, everything about this deluxe coffee maker is a hassle.  I am going to list the cons first: 1) Difficult to fill the water reservoir; the fill area is very narrow and water splashes all over. 2) The coffee bean hopper does not hold much; about two pots. 3) The carafe design makes it difficult to pour the coffee.  4) The grinder jams. Don't ask me how, but something gets stuck and the noise the grinder makes is distinctly different, a lower and slower grinding sound.  No ground coffee comes out.  5) Cleaning the filter container is a lot more work than just throwing out the grounds-filled filter.  It has to be washed, thoroughly to clean out the grounds that get stuck.  6) The machine has to be disassembled to clean areas where steam causes the coffee grounds to get stuck at the grinding door.Pros: 1) It makes good-tasting, fresh-ground coffee. That is largely due to getting good coffee.  I have honestly never had a coffee maker brew bad coffee from my coffee choices.I am going to spend the money to ship this back to Breville, with my receipt and ask for my money back.  Spending $300+ for a coffee maker was a stretch in the first place.  The amount of maintenance this machine requires is insane.  I was trying to be more green and not use Keurig, but this is not the answer."
"Bottom line, the grind control feature does not dispense an accurate amount of coffee each time. First use, it was a terrible cup of coffee. It was very weak on the high strength setting with level 3 grind (recommended for single cup brew). The coffee pot was not ""ready to brew"" out of the box with a good cup of coffee.Reviewing the calibration function in the manual, I followed the procedures. The grinder grinds for  10 seconds and counts up to 24 grams assuming that is what was ground. I weighed the coffee and it came out at 14 grams. I adjusted the dial to indicate difference. I had to unplug the machine and move to a different area of the counter. I re calibrated once I plugged it back in, the grinder went for 10 seconds, counted up to 24 grams, I weighed it out a 10 grams. I tried adjusting the dial but it would not go any lower than 12 grams.I ""cleaned"" the burs and bean shoot hoping that would help but there really wasn't anything to clean because it is so new and has not been used.The coffee pot cannot brew a consistent cup of coffee when the grams or amount of beans is different each time.  I tried brewing a pot (8 cups). It ground almost a 1/4 pound of beans, brewed way to strong and we had to add hot water to dilute. My daughter tried brewing a single cup and indicated it was weak.For the grinder, it does grind consistent in size--- not amount. For the brewer, it does ""infuse"" the coffee. Everything indicates that great care went into the design except for precision on the grounds amount. The coffee pot is guessing at how much it is grinding based on time. You simply cannot brew a consistent cup or pot without knowing how many grounds are going in.I am sending this coffee pot back. I do not recommend buying it. Breville, nice try but you need to add a way for the basket to weigh the coffee and stop the grind when the proper amount has been ground."
"We had a BDC600XL for many years.  It worked fairly well until one day it began leaking from a corroded  connection in the machine.  I tried to contact Breville on two occasions, sending pictures and emails, but no response.  After over three weeks of patiently waiting, I went and bought another coffee maker.  This morning, I finally got an email from Breville apologizing for the delay in their response. They no longer support our machine but offered us 25% off a new machine.  Too late though since I already bought a machine after not hearing back for them for over three weeks.  Therefore, if you are contemplating buying a Breville, be warned that their support and customer service are terrible.  I read this assessment of their very poor support and customer service elsewhere and now concur from our experience."
"I have never bought a nice coffee maker before.  Typically, I purchase the $30.00 Walmart makers until they die, then get another.  Because coffee is one of my only vices, I decided to treat myself with this fancy-dancy burr grinder, coffee maker.  It is very heavy, and appears to be made very well.  The grind feature worked well and the coffee was delicious.  Really, I had no problems with the maker, except one glaring problem; the carafe has a little “lip” inside it.  I guess the lip is there so the coffee does not pour too quickly?  Anyway, when pouring water into the coffee maker, or pouring coffee out of the carafe into my cup, it works fine…… until the very bottom of the pot.  To get the last bit of water and/or coffee out of the carafe, you must tip it almost on its head to get it to come out. The problem with this is that it spills all over your counter, floor, cabinets etc.  NOT A GOOD DESIGN!  I called Brielle manufacturer to ask for a different carafe because the rest of the maker was fantastic.  They informed me that is how the carafe is made for this particular model and the only thing to do is to send it back to the retailer, which I did.  Now, I am reusing my old $30.00 Walmart maker with no drips.  I am bummed the Brielle burr coffee maker carafe was the pits!"
"The grinder only pulls in beans that are in the front 90° of the hopper. Beans sitting in any other section of the hopper won't make their way to this feed area either causing the grinder to run without producing the proper amount of grounds. Unless you fill the hopper COMPLETELY the machine will fail to grind enough beans for a single cup of coffee at the lowest strength. If you want more than a single cup or run without filling the hopper to maximum capacity you'll need to babysit the grinding stage by repeatedly pushing the beans to the front of the hopper so the grinder doesn't run empty. As other reviews have stated, this really defeats most of the Auto-Start capability of the machine.Also, I would not recommend using the stock holding pot. The shape and spout design leaves a good amount of your brew trapped inside. You'll be turning the thing completely upside-down and still have 1/2 a cup or so inside that can't be poured. The lid can be removed but the large lip at the top of the pot still prevents safe pouring of the remaining liquid.Outside of those complaints, I still use mine daily but I'm not happy with it for the price."
The pot is impossible to clean because you can’t take the top fully off. I’ve descaled the machine multiple times when receiving the descale notification and it just doesn’t clear the notification. Leakage is common. Overall do not recommend.
"Update, after a year of use:I'm a huge Breville fan, having several of their appliances. So when it came time to replace my other grind and brew coffeemaker, this seemed like the best bet. At first it was wonderful - no need to measure the beans, coffee was really good, fairly easy to clean. But after less than a year it started having issues. Sometimes the basket door would pop open during grinding (even though I checked that it was secure), spewing coffee grounds all over. Sometimes the basket would overflow (no idea why) and coffee would end up everywhere; the coffee that did make it into the carafe was ""muddy"" with grounds from the overflow.It also seemed to use more and more coffee for the same 9-cup brew and the grounds would be really wet. I did the maintenance that was suggested when problems arose, but these issues kept happening more frequently and without any warning.I've decided to give up on this coffeemaker. I'll stick with my other beloved Breville products (toaster, kettle, fast-slow pro) but this one was an expensive lesson learned! Goodwill can have it. :(Original review, shortly after purchase (originally gave it 5 stars):I've been very pleased with this coffeemaker, but even more so with Breville's customer service! The burr-style grinder on this coffeemaker is much better the blade grinder on the Cuisinart.  No more measuring beans and water:  as long as there are sufficient beans in the hopper and water in the tank, I can just push the button in the morning to start the coffee grinding and brewing.  It's easier to clean and makes more consistent coffee since all the measuring is done by the coffeemaker. I also love being able to brew a single cup if I want to. Can't do that with the Cuisinart!Now for the customer service part. After only 5 weeks of use, the latch that closes the water reservoir door stopped working. The door kept popping open, but if I wiggled the little rubber prongs it would stay closed. I contacted Breville, sent in the required documentation, and they replied right away that they would replace the coffeemaker! Wow! I have several of their appliances, and this is the first problem I've ever had with one. I'm definitely a fan of Breville!"
"We have a Breville espresso maker that we love.  We bought the Breville coffee maker to complete the set. It made delicious coffee when it functioned but after less than a year we've decided to toss it and reverted back to our old Cuisinart.The major issue with this coffee maker is that the grinding output area (that goes into the basket) gets mucky and clogged constantly.  Even with regular cleaning.  Several times the grinder just wouldn't work and you can physically hear it trying to grind but no beans moving in the grinding compartment and nothing physically being ground.  The unit also asks for regular descaling (I'd say almost monthly) and we're using filtered water.  Our old coffee maker has maybe been descaled once a year. Good luck trying to figure out descaling mode.  It is not a button you can just push.  Although the thermos type coffee canister keeps the coffee nice and hot, it does NOT have a heating element so some people who tend to go back for more coffee may not like this.I wanted to love this coffee maker, I really did , but after consistently having issues in the morning with it clogging and not grinding and spending half an hour trying to get it to work again I am moving to greener pastures.  I mean lets be real, we're making morning coffee here and most of us don't have the time to trouble shoot our coffee maker after we push the ON button.  Sorry Breville, but this coffee maker was a big waste of money."
"It's beautiful and easy to use on a daily basis. However, it was several design problems that make pouring Coffee and cleaning the machine a pain. After a couple years it began having problems, such as not using the right amount of water and not griding Coffee. Then, a couple weeks after these problems began, the machine died. It doesn't turn on. I am trying to contact costumer service and the automated answer says they are having technical issues 🤔I don't think it is worth the money."
"I really wish I would have listened to all the reviews I read and avoided buying this machine. It’s truly the biggest pain of a coffee maker I’ve ever owned. I’ve had it for 4 months and it’s not working. The coffee isn’t grinding and I’ve completely disassembled the grinder and cleaned it thoroughly. In fact, I’ve done it twice in two days because it doesn’t work. It’s a really difficult machine to clean overall but I’m at a loss as to what to do. For the price, I’d expect this machine to work for years, not 4 months! Of course the return window has passed so now I’m going to have to work on going through the manufacturer. It does make a great cup of coffee when it actually works, but I would save yourself a lot of frustration and buy a different product."
"I’ve owned several coffee makers over the years, as I’m someone who needs a good cup of coffee every morning without much hassle. This coffee maker initially seemed like the perfect fit for that. However, after using it for about 6-7 months, I’ve noticed the blades have started to wear down. I use it once a day for a simple pot of coffee, and I’ve always kept it clean and well-maintained. Unfortunately, the blades have weakened to the point where it no longer brews, leaving it completely unusable."
"I really wanted to love this coffee maker...I really, really did! It had all the features I wanted- contained bean grinder within the machine that did the calculations for you and also a single cup option. I searched extensively through all the different product options and decided to splurge and go with the Breville Grind Control.The functionality is great. It's a sleek looking machine, lots of bells and whistles. Had the features I wanted. I was pretty excited.Now the bad part- the coffee tasted...well awful. I tried everything- different settings of the grinding, different levels of strength of coffee (1-10), multiple types of coffee beans, cleaning the machine over and over. After a few weeks of this and some soul searching I resided to the fact that this coffee maker just wasn't for me and wasn't worth the cost and I returned it."
"I am a Breville fan and longtime customer. This coffee maker is such a disappointment. I think Breville's big mistake here (among many) is it designed a machine that is far too persnickety for people who, by definition, are seeking convenience and efficiency and space saving. That's why we want a ""grind and brew"" in the first place. There are so many ways this machine can go wrong, from the way the beans feed to the fact that you have to turn the carafe upside down to pour, always (and I mean always) creating a mess. To do the proper (daily or at least biweekly) cleaning, you need some space to work, and you will have a lot of clean up to do.Others have catalogued the various flaws, so I'll just say I agree with them. I suppose the price point reflects aspects of the engineering, but there's little to justify the price when you consider the design issues. I enjoy a good, strong cup of coffee and order my beans from several states away. But I personally can't tell the difference between the cup this machine produces from the one my trusty old Cuisinart grind and brew makes. For far less expense and hardship.Breville, if you're listening, please try again. This model belongs on the junk pile."
"I bought this product about 3 months ago and have enjoyed waking up to delicious fresh-ground coffee...until I woke up to hot water with a slight coffee flavor.  I checked the manual and realized I needed to clean the chute (my old Cuisinart had an indicator that said it was time to clean the chute).  The chute was supposed to open when you unlock the bean hopper.  It took a couple of tries but I was able to clean the chute.  The second time this happened, it took several tries to open the chute and then it wouldn't close!  I did some research and saw that there was a faulty switch.The machine is still under warranty.  I therefore contacted customer service online.  I supposedly received an email that a customer service technician would contact me shortly.  I never received the email, just saw the supposed email in the support website when I checked a day later.  I then called the toll-free phone number.  The answering machine told me that due to a high call volume I should leave a number and get a call back.  Three days later I called again and was informed that I already requested a call back after which the call disconnected.  Another 3 days and still no contact.I really hope someone from Breville reads these reviews.  When a coffee machine costs $300 the company should have a professional team that stands behind their product."
"You'd think that designing a coffee machine with a grinder would be relatively simple, right? Start with a hopper, add a simple grinder, have gravity bring the grounds down into a filter basket, pour water over the top into a glass carafe with a heating element, and you're done.The brain trust over at Breville couldn't seem to get this together. This machine is so poorly designed you'd think it was an intentional prank.First off, Breveille uses a burr grinder about the size of a quarter that guarantees the grinder will jam. And it does - A LOT. Clearing the jam involves a multi-step process (which includes vacuuming beans with my Dust Buster) and complete disassembly of the unit. Typically after cleaning it STILL doesn't work. I typically need to clean it and reassemble it 2 to 3 times before it works again. This is loads of fun when you're trying to get to work in the morning.But the fun doesn't end there, folks! For some reason known only to God, the grounds are not gravity fed in to the basket, they're blown in from the side. This of course jams the shoot with grounds - which means you have clean the filter basket holder with almost every use. Fun times! Sometimes the ground coffee just comes shooting out of the machine and you're left with a pile of grounds all over the carafe (see attached photo).But wait.....there's more! IF your coffee is made successfully it is poured into the worst ""insulated"" stainless steel carafe known to man. The coffee STARTS lukewarm, and goes downhill from there. I've had to buy Mr. Coffee electric cup-warmers just to warm up the coffee. Why Breville couldn't have gone with a glass carafe and a heating element underneath is a mystery up there with Bigfoot.The only reason this machine escaped a 1-star review is that the digital interface and customization abilities are very user-friendly. But what's the point if it's always breaking down?In short - if you want to quit your job for full-time coffee maker maintenance, this may be the machine for you. If not, look elsewhere."
Lastima porque lo hice mucho búsquedas en Amazon antes decidí a comprar eso. No me gusta su café que haces. El diseño de carafe es mal cuando quieres colar siempre hay café sobro. Estoy curioso que Breville va a responder. Más sobre la carafe. It doesn’t keep the coffee hot. It doesn’t make the amount of coffee selected. I have made coffee several times choosing 4 cups for example. It makes at most 2 1/2 cups. I wish there was a way to communicate directly with Breville.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I liked the program features, for the size of coffee and strength. My other drip machine can do the time based part. The grinder is nice and can grind per your preferred setting, between coarse and fine.I hate the cleaning part of this coffee maker. You spend more time cleaning the basket and grinds apartus than enjoying your morning joe.I bought it with the hope of it saving me time and a splurge for a quality of life improvement. This has done none of that.The coffee taste okay, the quality is decent, it's not terribly loud, and the filter works great.Overall it has been frustrating. Planning to return to my old drip coffee maker immediately."
"This is our third coffee pot,  I cannot remove the disk to clean. Coffee not coming out of grinding mode propertyly. This will be my last purchase."
"For how expensive this product is, daily use should be tolerable but it’s not. We’ve had so many issues with the grinder part, it’s not worth it."
"I gave it two stars for the 2 good things about this grinder/brewer.  One, it's well built with solid materials.  Two, the grinder is an adjustable burr type.I didn't give the other three because of the other three poor things.  One, I spent an entire Saturday trying to figure out the best settings to brew a really good cup of coffee.  I must have tried about 50 times, and even with different coffee beans, but not one cup was good.  Alot of very weak cups, even on the strongest setting.  If it brewed a strong cup, it ended up bitter with alot of small grinds going through the filter.  Two, the water tank is not accessible or visible.  If the tank ever gets contaminated with dirt or mold, how would I know, and how would I clean it?  Finally, third, the included carafe looks good, and keeps coffee warm, but due to the plastic rim design, there will be about a cup of coffee at the bottom that will not pour out.  Not a big deal if you're brewing 8 cups, but I only brew two at a time typically.  Also, I can't fit my hand inside to clean it.  I really hope Breville can solve these issues, because I feel like this could have been a really nice machine."
"Like many of you, I was looking for a nice, all in one machine to have in my office at work. Before I bought this machine, I was either using the pour-over method or a $30 percolator; both of which make a fantastic cup of coffee. I always keep my beans in a airtight container and grind right before brewing, so I thought this machine was a nice option.So far my machine is mechanically operating fine. But the problem I’ve had from day one is the machine smells like very strong plastic and that plastic smell and flavor it taints the water does not go away. For instance, if I just brew a cup of water with no coffee, and you take a sip of that hot water, it tastes horrible. I have tried water from several different sources and it all tasted the same. I flushed out the machine many times, cleaned it with vinegar, and it still tastes bad. When I brew it with coffee, it even tastes worse.When I use the same water source and same coffee beans using the pour over method, the coffee is fantastic.I do thoroughly clean the machine and basket between brewings and still the water just smells so bad.I must note that I have a higher end Breville espresso maker and that machine works flawlessly and makes an incredible cup of espresso. I’ve had that for about four years now and use it all the time, so I know Breville makes good equipment. I am really bummed about the coffee machine, it was not cheap.After five months of trying to enjoy this machine, I boxed it up and am going to store it in my closet at work just like the military guys store the Ark of the Covenant in Raiders of the Lost Ark, only to be opened 1,000 years from now by curious coffee researchers.Breville, if you are reading this, please tell me what I’m doing wrong or why the water takes on the horrid taste/smell of bad plastic."
"I've had this maker for two months now and have tried everything I can to get a consistent, flavorful lot of coffee with no success. I have had to set the grind at its most coarse and the brew strength at 1 to get anything better than diner coffee. I've gotten the closest by ""tricking"" the machine during calibration and entering incorrect values to better approximate what I'm looking for but even then the coffee is wildly variable."
"I think freshly ground beans makes better tasting coffee than preground, so I've been buying whole beans for a long time. When I had my son, I decided I wanted to get a coffee maker that had a built-in grinder so that I could schedule the beans to get freshly ground and brewed.I did a lot of research and this Breville machine seemed to be the best option out there, so decided to invest the extra money to get it. WHAT A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! I've now had this machine for about 6 months and no matter what I do I can't get it to make a good cup of coffee. Even when I set the strength to its highest setting, the coffee tastes very watered down. I've called Breville customer service to get help calibrating the machine, but nothing works.I got this machine to help be more efficient with my time, but ultimately it's a huge pain to maintain it (cleaning the grinder, clearing out the chute, cleaning all the parts between brews). So I end up spending more time on my coffee maker than less. If it made an amazing cup of coffee, maybe I'd consider it worth it...but the coffee it makes is garbage.Save your money!"
"This brewer makes a good cup of coffee when it actually works.  Unfortunately it constantly had problems and was completely inconvenient to use.  I made excuses for it for awhile because I’ll really wanted to like it and thought I may have been using it wrong.  That wasn’t the case, it’s just very poorly designed.The machine is a cleaning nightmare.  I wouldn’t mind the cleaning process if I didn’t have to do it every single day, but I did.  If not, the machine would jam, or leak, or get grounds in the pot.  So many mornings were ruined cleaning up coffee from the countertop because the machine clogged and then brewed coffee onto the countertop instead of into the pot.  Or it would jam and you would end up with a pot full of light brown water because not enough grounds made it into the basket.Again, this wasn’t user error.  I watched a ton of videos and read the manual on how to adjust, calibrate and clean the machine.  Still kept having the same issues over and over.If you want a machine that makes a good cup of coffee sometimes and CONSTANTLY frustrates you for the reasons listed above, this is the brewer for you.  Otherwise, save yourself the headache (and money) and get something else."
"The overall idea of this machine is great. However, I seriously wonder if the designer of this carafe ever actually tried to use it. First, the spring mechanism that should shut off flow when you remove the carafe is ineffective. It continues to drip. A lot. There is a cup that catches the drips,  but this is an unnecessary additional cleaning chore. The carafe itself is a terrible design. It requires a steep and awkward angle to pour. As you pour it tends to splash coffee to the side, requiring clean up. If you remove the lid to make pouring easier then the lid drips coffee, requiring clean up. There is actually no way to pour the last of the coffee out of the carafe. You have to turn the carafe upside down over the sink to get it empty. Oh, and the neck is too narrow to get your hand in (and I have thin wrists) so actually cleaning the carafe is a challenge.Perhaps the manufacturer could do some complex research. Use your own product and try to pour a cup of coffee."
"This coffee maker is supposed to have two neat tricks, and it fails at both.The party piece here is that the coffee maker has a built-in grinder, so your beans are ground just before your coffee is made. The ideal scenario is that you set it all up on the built-in timer, and when you get up in the morning you have fresh-ground, fresh-brewed coffee waiting for you. The problem is that this coffee maker tends to poop itself with frustrating regularity (see photo.) Despite daily cleaning, this mess happens at least once a week, meaning that one should not leave the coffee maker running unattended. Scratch scenario one of having fresh-ground, fresh-brewed coffee when you wake up.The other neat trick is that this coffee maker can make anything from one cup to one pot of coffee, and technically this does work just fine. The problem is the aforementioned cleaning regimen. Keeping this thing clean is a lot more work than any other coffee maker I've owned, and one quickly realizes that it's not worth the work for one cup, and so you just end up making full pots of coffee every time.The most frequent cleaning need is the bottom of the grinder, in behind the filter holder. Unfortunately, the knob to open this is inside the bean hopper, so unless the hopper is mostly empty you will need to dig through the beans to get to it. There's also a weird dependency wherein you have to hit the menu button to turn on the machine, open the filter, close the filter and then open the filter again before the knob will open the bottom of the grinder. What's that about?The idea of this coffee maker is really cool. The reality just doesn't live up to expectations. Don't waste your money on this one.UPDATE: There is one pretty good thing about this unit that I forgot to mention... The carafe does keep the coffee nice and hot for three hours or more."
"We are very disappointed with this machine. The carafe is difficult to pour from without making a mess. But most important, the coffee is lukewarm at best. We cannot figure out how to adjust the temperature. Will be returning it."
"After owning our Breville BDC 600 for 4+ years, the water sensor was not reading the water input and not dripping the right amount of water set before start to make the desired amount of cups of coffee.  It was quite a workhorse and we loved it so, but it was time to concede and try their new one (BDC650).  Upon opening this product, it was shipped nicely and packaged well for now breaks or defects to be noted cosmetically.  We cleaned all the parts (as it smelled of chemicals from China) as indicated and was ready to make coffee.This is where the dilemma started.  Upon pouring water into the unit, the sensor that detects water would not register the amount of water I was applying.  I was not able to start the grinder as the unit did not detect any water.  I did this 20 times and everytime revealed the same outcome: ""add water.""  I called Breville and had to wait 36 minutes (thankfully they have a call back procedure) and their response was to return the unit back to Amazon.  I said that I wanted to inform you guys as we were so happy with your prior coffee maker.So I set up the return and asked for another new one.  To my delight, the unit arrived and I was happy to start over, just thinking that the last one was a dud.  I cleaned all the parts again and to my chagrin,  the same thing happened, except this time, the sensor detected water, but would not brew the desired amount of cups that was asked.We are very dissapointed in this coffee maker and will be going back to the Cuisinart as we love the grind and brew feature.  Hopefully Breville reads this review from a (used to be) fan and fixes there defective units.I can not recommend this unit after 2 makers came defective."
"This slick looking and sophisticated coffee maker has some real pros and cons.  Biggest pro: When it nails it, your taste buds will dance in delight.  Biggest con: You never know if it's going to nail it or ""nail it"".  Even calibrated, the quality of your cup will vary wildly from coffee colored water to amazing flavor.  It tends to grind far more coffee than is actually warranted for those delightful tasting cups, and drinking about 20 brewed oz a day I can blow through a 12 oz bag of beans in a week.  My first unit had to be exchanged (done through the manufacturer, not Amazon), and while the process was understandable it took an excessive amount of time (we're talking about weeks, nearly a month) to get a replacement unit.  Frankly, the only reason I didn't return it and get a different unit at half the price of what I paid for the Grind Control is I didn't want to deal with the hassle a second time.  When this unit dies, I'm never going to buy another Breville again.  Far too expensive for a wildly inconsistent cup of coffee."
"Having had this one year, here are the highlights.1. Great fresh coffee for two weeks after each time you spend 40 minutes cleaning the grinder.2. It does not make 12 real cups of joe.  It makes 9 cups (or, twelve 6oz servings) in a world where we need 20oz servings.  So, one 3.5 of those!!3.  We have resorted to using a standalone grinder, making this an overpriced coffee pot."
"After years of grinding our coffee separately and using a traditional $30 coffee maker we had for 10 years, we upgraded to this beast. It’s heavy, has a big footprint and… totally not worth it.It makes sense that combing wet and dry is bound to have problems separating the two. But the issues that have come up for me is that you have the clean this thing with every use at the spout where the dry grounds shoot out into your filter. If it goes not cleaned, next time you make coffee, you get coffee tea nonsense and realize the spout was blocked and your grounds didn’t make it into the filter. Second, when you empty your filter, you carry the whole contraption to the garbage and somehow the grounds at the spout always spill out onto the ground and I have to be very careful it clean grounds off the ground, every. Single. Time. And today, I had carefully done all the steps and today, AGAIN had a dilute tea coffee again and looked into what the problem was, although the beans were still halfway full, they feed through one side and all the beans had piled up on the other side and didn’t not properly file down and make it into the grinder. I am done with this machine and am going to probably go back to my cheap old machine that I am happy I hoarded and didn’t throw away."
"When my Bosch Tassimo coffeemaker died after years of faithful service, a friend convinced me to start grinding my own beans to step up my coffee game. So I found this Breville.  Overall, after about a month, I can say I like this machine, but I don't love it. It does make better coffee than I've had before.  Period. But at this price it ought to be a perfect appliance and it's not. They made a lot of strange design decisions on this one.  For instance, I cannot get my hand inside to wash the carafe, and it doesn't seal so it isn't all that good at keeping the coffee hot. Filling the water tank is also difficult because the opening is very small and a bit inconvenient, particularly when filling from a new gallon jug of spring water. And why do I have to have the coffee basket and filter loaded into the machine to see what the water level is in the tank? Also a puzzle is why the plastic washable parts are not dishwasher safe. It's all small stuff, but it adds up to a kind of clunky, mildly unpleasant experience. Finally, the latch on the  water tank cover, which is spring-loaded, now only works sometimes. So overall, I'm not too impressed. Still, I'm drinking good coffee."
"Too much mess to clean up with all the parts that get grounds inside the basket and the pour spout. Uses lots of coffee too. With only two of us, this is just too much hassle. I’m going back to Keurig and donating this unit to a local community center that may be able to make use of it."
"At about $350, that's $16.70 a month to own this contraption if you factor in California 10% sales tax. Now its in a landfill. So it goes.Good:- Coffee quality is very good, 8/10- I can wake up to brewed coffee without using pre-ground meaning it's delicious.Bad:- Didn't make it to 2 years.- Not easy to maintain or repair despite needing a lot of this.- Extremely loud, worried I'd wake up the neighbors.- Can only make coffee so strong. I always had max strength and sometimes wanted more.- I broke some flimsy plastic thing on the coffee filter holder early on but could position it just so. It fell off a lot. Constant annoyance.On repairability: There is a silver disk separating grinder from coffee filter and it gets nasty and gummed up. You need to take it out, but it's clearly not meant to be removed. You can watch youtube and do it but they should design the pot with maintenance of this disk in mind. Also you need to drain the water to repair it and I suspect that's what eventually caused my pot to die, a circuit board got wet and it started going haywire. Disk would spin and spin.I try a fancy pot, it breaks, I go back to all steel french press, kettle, and Zassenhaus hand grinder. They never break. Coffee is delicious, but time consuming. So I'm back to those again."
"Never thought I would be criticizing a Breville product. My kitchen is full of Breville, all of which are generally exceptional, although quite expensive. However, I would not recommend this coffee maker, particularly if you plan on making a single cup, or small carafe. I find that anything less than 6 cups turns out to be very weak. It appears to be due to the shape of the basket (flat rather than cone). The grounds get pushed to one side and the water just goes through the center. If you try the singleserve feature, you’re essentially just drinking coffee flavored tea. Works well if you make six or more cups at a time, but anything less, this is not the right coffee maker for that.The other significant problem with this coffee maker, Is that you have to clean the coffee chute frequently, at least twice a week. Failure to do so results in the chute backing up, not enough grounds being delivered to the filter, and extremely weak coffee.  A third, and more minor problem, is that the coffee pot is very poorly designed, and you have to basically tip it completely upside down in order to get the coffee to come out. All in all, it was a poorly designed product, I would not recommend it at all."
"Ok, so first up: this thing makes great coffee.  That being said, there are a large number of PITA things with this coffee maker that should be fixed if they do a redesign.  First, it clogs regularly if you don't take it apart and clean out the grinder.  It seems to know when you're in a hurry and need it to work and grinds to a halt on only those mornings.  Cleaning it is a hassle, no way around that.  Second, if you aren't paying attention to how full it is, the water spews out the back about half a second after it beeps at you.  Third, there isn't any way to save settings, so if you find out you like a roast ground and prepared a certain way, you can't just choose a setting that you have pre-saved.  This makes it just not worth experimenting with much after the novelty wears off.  Anyway, we're still using it, but if it was easier to clean and didn't just clog and grind to a halt every week or two if you don't clean it, it would be a vastly better product.Oher minor gripes: for an expensive coffee maker, lots of cheap plastic parts.  I've already had to replace the grounds hopper after I dropped it and it broke.  Wish it could hook up to a water source."
"I bought this machine in October 2017 for $239. When I first got it I used the grind and brew feature but it kept clogging the chute and it used more coffee beans to brew the same strength as ground so I just switched to ground coffee.A few days ago the descale notification came up. I have done this several times before as it’s part of the typical maintenance… However this time at the beginning of the process it gave me an error code to clean the chute.I could not get the chute to open but after several attempts it finally did. I vacuumed out the burr and cleaned the chute even though I had not used this for over a year.It kept giving me the error code but eventually went through the descaling process. I filled the machine with water to rinse it out and again it started giving me the error code to clean the chute and again the chute would not open.I called customer support, she walked me through the same steps and we could not get it to work so she started a ticket for me to send it in for repairs.She told me she could not give me a price for the repair until she had the information in the system…After all that, she told me the charge would be $140.35. I told her that is over half what I paid for the machine and I was not willing to do that. I told her that is ridiculous and I was very angry.Guess I will go back to my old reliable Mr. Coffee coffee maker that didn’t cost almost $300 that has lasted me several years.I hope you will consider this and read other reviews before you decide to spend this kind of money on a machine that has such a short warranty period considering the price you pay.I expected with the company’s reputation not to have a problem like this after only having it a couple years but here I am in this situation."
"You might think this is THE ONE - the coffee maker to brew you a tasty fresh-ground piping hot beverage at a precise time each morning, that you scoop up before heading out the door.  But, I'm sad to say, it's not. And this is from a self-proclaimed Breville fanboy.  I tried really hard to love this thing.  But it's on the way out the door now.PROs- BLING: looks snazzy.  A friend said ""that thing should have handlebars!""- BEEFY: feels solid, as expected from Breville.CONS- UNRELIABLE: too often has a fit and grinds too many beans, clogs itself, and spills coffee and grinds onto counter, floor, and grinds into the coffee pot (nope, you don't even get a drinkable pot of coffee out of this).  Welcome to the next 20 minutes of your morning when you're already late for work.- INCONSISTENT: even when it works ""right"", the strength of each pot will vary significantly without you changing any settings.  Maybe related to the bean hopper not being very good at continuously providing beans to the grinder which you can observe first hand from brew to brew.- LABOR INTENSIVE: lots of clean-up after each brew even when no catastrophe.- LUKEWARM: yep, the coffee comes out just warm, not even acceptably warm.  Sure, the manual says if you soak the pot in hot water it'll be hotter.  But the whole point here is you can schedule your coffee to be ground and brewed in one fell swoop. This is supposed to be a convenience coffee maker, not an ""extra labor"" coffee maker.  If you want to put in extra labor for better coffee, get a percolator or french press or something.- EXPENSIVE: when spending this much, you expect it to work right and work well.  It doesn't."
"What I like about this coffee pot:  Foremost - the coffee tastes good.  Brews to my specifications, etc.  It’s easy to program.  I love that I don’t have the static results of ground coffee from my coffee grinder to deal with.  It’s fairly quiet.What I don’t like:  I get that one should clean the pot regularly, but after every brew?  That gets tiresome.  And like another review I just read, I woke up one morning to a freshly brewed pot of HOT WATER.  No beans went through the shoot.  They don’t tell you anything about having to clean out the shoot that the coffee goes through to get to the filter.  That was very disappointing.  I brew Italian Roast beans from Starbucks - nothing super fancy.  Now it seems like I have to clean that shoot out once every couple of weeks.  Very disappointing.  That’s way too much cleaning per brew.  Am I doing something wrong?I think I might rather deal with the static remains of brewed beans on the counter to clean that then amount of maintenance this machine requires from me per brew.  I really wanted to like this machine and NOT be unhappy with my purchase.  For this much money... I wouldn’t purchase it again."
"First impressions….love it! Once you learn to adjust it to make the strength of coffee you like, it makes an amazing cup of coffee. But, it’s a lot to clean several times a week because I use it daily.  After 6 months….I wish I’d have gotten a grinder/coffee machine that were separate pieces. It’s a lot to clean since I use the machine daily. After 1 year….it starts acting up.  I can’t change the strength setting anymore because the knob only goes one way, up, which means I can’t use pre-ground coffee.  Anytime the time changes I have to reset the machine & start over.  Now I’m 15 months in & it doesn’t want to grind anymore.  I have cleaned it, reset it…I’m at a loss.  Very frustrated because I really want to like this machine, but I’m kind of done. Maybe if I don’t drink coffee every day? Maybe twice a week.  Yea, right LOL!"
"I purchased this product on January 9th, 2022 so my wife and I have been using it for over a year and half at the time of writing. Frankly, we enjoyed using this product as it made brewing coffee in the morning quick and easy.Sadly, I can't recommend this product to anyone as we found out yesterday that the inside of the carafe is severely eroded and rusted. We're not sure what material it is made out of (Teflon?), but we found small traces of it floating in our coffee. We can't think of what could have caused this erosion or when it began.  It gives me the chills to imagine that we've been drinking this substance with our coffee for weeks or even for months...  If the inside of carafe looks this way, I don't even want to know what the inside of this machine would look like right now. It is advertised as stainless steel, but this wouldn't happen to stainless steel.If you intend to purchase this product, proceed with caution and do not plan to use it beyond six months to be on the safe side."
"We purchased this Breville over two years ago and to say it has been an unhappy purchase is an understatement!  For the record, this was a replacement for a very good Breville experience on the same coffee maker that developed a leak in the water tank after years of faithful service without issue.  The concept of preloading beans and water to have freshly brewed coffee every morning is a delightful image…Do NOT Buy INTO THIS IMAGE!  The daily grind, and I am not referring to the grinder on the machine far exceeds the value.We have been plagued with coffee leaks and I have been in contact with Breville support many, many times.  In fact, they replaced the pot twice with refurbished machines.  Cleaning is a pain and is required on a daily basis to even make coffee.  This is not simply washing the pot.  The hopper where beans are stored comes apart for cleaning as does the chute where coffee enters the filter basket.  We have been plagued with water overflowing the basket and running down the counter.  This situation was not a daily problem, but might occur on the day after a complete cleaning and vacuuming of the pot or maybe a week later.  Frustrating to say the least.What did support say?  They told me to clean the pot better, including vacuuming it out.  They told me to buy coffee with a brewed on date.  They told me not to use dark rosters.  The bottom line is that 3 pots have continued to have the same issue and the amount of coffee to enter the basket is dependent upon how well you keep this pot clean.I’m done!  Plugging in the old Mr. Coffee and calling it quiets."
"This coffee pot makes good coffee, however pouring the coffee is very strange. You have to hold the coffee pot almost vertically up to get all the coffee out and some coffee remains in the pot. The design needs an upgrade."
