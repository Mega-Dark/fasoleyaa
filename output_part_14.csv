"This may be of help to someone - They do not sound the same as original Austria built version, particularly the pair I replaced with these, which are built in China. The new ones are not as crisp in the highs, the low midrange dominates a bit too much, causing a murky low end, and I actually had a bass note break up in one channel while playing an L.P. at moderately high volume. By contrast, my old and decaying 240s from the 1980's have really open mid to high end, the bass is punchy, tight and well defined (although by nature, this is a bass-heavy phone) and you can hear a well defined soundstage, which is not as apparent on the new ones. The build quality seems to be the same as the '80s version, so that's a plus. Despite the audio difference to the old model, I would have to say that I absolutely feel like I've gotten my moneys worth; they are good headphones, I'd be surprised if one could do better for under $100.00."
"I had read many positive reviews about this set of phones on audio enthusiast sites, and the frequency-response curves looked decent.  I wanted open-back phones specifically for spatial open-ness, for mixing home recordings.  Unfortunately, although these are called ""semi-open"" phones, they perform pretty much like they were completely closed.  Yes, you can hear room noise through them, but overall the sound is bassy, boomy and overwhelming, like a pair of closed-back phones with a really-jacked-up low end.There was noticable distortion of low bass at ""normal"" listening levels -- specifically, listen to the bass-tom drum intro to the final verse of ""Baby Blue"" by Badfinger.  These phones just couldn't handle it, sounded like someone doing ""raspberries"" over that drum part.The boom made my ears tired listening to them -- and on top of that, while the earpads themselves were soft, the amount of clamping force was way too high (my head measures 25-inches around and over the ears).  As I could only stand these on my head a few minutes, I returned them.I did find that there was good stereo separation.  Vocals, however, I thought were on the boxy side.  Maybe these would be good for people with smaller heads who have EQ for their headphones.  But I wouldn't call these mixing phones."
"These are very comfortable and sound good, but they seem to be designed for standard listening. Not good as studio headphones, when they ""enhance"" the sound you're not getting an accurate representation of the frequency levels. Music produced using these sounds terrible played on other headphones or speakers."
"I got these after the plastic clamps on my dt 770 pros broke, and the screw holes on the 3d printed replacements I bought off ebay stripped. I enjoyed the mid-frequency prominence for a while, but after a while I noticed I wasn't hearing subtleties in games and in music that the dt 770 pros gave me. ESPECIALLY in direction. These things just don't have the panning detail (and overall detail) that the dt 770 pros do. I realized since the replacement clamps I bought were 3d printed, I could use heat to melt the plastic where the screw holes were, and create new ones. I did that and now I'm using my dt 770 pros again and oh boy they were missed. So missed, I was heavily contemplating skipping the hassle of buying more (official) replacement parts and just buying new ones altogether. I will still use the AKGs to reference mixes but the DT770pros are home."
"I picked these up on sale after accidentally trashing my Audio Technica'sQuick breakdown:+Very comfortable+Nice quality, crystal clear sound+Open (can be a pro or a con depending how you look at it) You can actually hear outside sounds.+Won't break easily-Doesn't really have the deep bass like some headphones can get.-Volume is a little too low for my taste-Really long regular (non-coiled) wire can be a bit of a nuisanceVery comfortable, much more comfortable than my previous pair.The construction is such that it doesn't feel like it would be broken easily.Sound quality seems fine. I'm not qualified to really speak about the technical detailsit seems fine to me but didn't really 'wow' me like my Audio Technica's did.My main issue is with the volume, I have to crank up the volume to almost max to even get a decent listening level.I'm not talking extremely loud either, just loud enough so I can actually enjoy the music and hear every little detail,I have to turn it up very high to enjoy my music with these. I have no idea why this is."
"I owned a pair of AKG 240s Headphones back in 2003-2008 and remember loving their comfort and open and clean sound... however, one earphones started to short out after tremendous abuse, and I ended up breaking them to the point of garbage trying to fix them myself (lesson learned).Anyways, I needed a more durable and ""isolated"" pair of headphones for the next few years while travelling and I got the Audio Technica MTH-50s and love them as well.  I still have them working great at 4 years old.Here come the ""new"" AKG 240s.  I was looking forward to that comfort and smoothness of sound.  I plugged them in and things feel great, but sound ""harsh"" in the mid-high frequencies.  Not at all as I ""remember"" them.  Maybe I have too accustomed to my MTH-50s, but there seems to be a very metallic sound in these new AKG 240s.I do not know if this newly perceived ""harshness"" is due to them now being manufactured in China, but they just do not sound as ""pure"" as I remember.Lets see if I can break them in for a few days."
"The AKG K240 is usually praised for it's flat & uncolored sound (as you can see in other reviews on this page). Not so with my pair.There is a massive peak sitting at around 150-200 Hz. I'd say like +10 to +15dB higher than the surrounding area. It's incredibly distracting. I can't see how these would be good for either mixing or casual listening. They sound terrible and boxy for casual listening, and that hi-bass/lo-mid peak would disrupt any accurate mixing in that area of the spectrum.As an aside, there's also no low bass (sub 50 Hz) but that isn't really an issue; it was already expected with these and wasn't really a concern going in. It's part of the nature of open-backed headphones.I know I can't expect the world with cheaper headphones, but they should at least work better than those $20 Sony's you can pick up from Walmart, which are excellent in comparison.Again, based on all the praise that I'm reading about these, I'm gonna guess that I got a rare defective pair that slipped through QC."
"I read these reviews and I wonder?Anyway, again I saw the price reduction and could not resist the deal - $125. Nice box, little bits n bobs in there - a sticker, extra cable/pads. The pads are Cheap! - I have some Sennheiser HD555 and the AKG seem (physically) quite inferior. The sound was good, not great - just good. The phones are clear with more upper/mid range than the Senn's but less Base (and the Senn's are not really Base heavy) - quite a Transparent sound but I didn't find the soundstage to be better than the Senn's probably a bit less captivating.  The fit is not as good when on, as the Senns - because the cups on the AKG's are cheap foam, there was always a gap at the bottom of my ears. I sold them for what I paid 2 weeks after I got them. Of the 2, Senn/AKG - the Senn is my preference but would love to add the upper/mid range quality's to the Base, Soundstage and warmth of the Senn's. Now waiting for some Beyerdynamic DT990, will review them on arrival. btw, an Ipod Touch runs them very well but my other little mp3 did not."
I ordered the gold version and got an open-box or used product. Box had no seal and everything was thrown inside the original box. RIP OFF!
"I picked these up at a great price to replace my AKG k141.Build quality Pros: Extremely comfortable over-ear, semi-open headphones. Very light clamping on the head. Comes with 2 sets of pads and cables.Build quality Cons: Huge size may be a problem for some. Same construction as the k141 which has a cheap mini-xlr jack that is prone to shorts if you don't baby the headphones. (Months of ownership now and I've not had any problems with shorts.)Sound: A little recessed in the lower midrange with certain types of music. Natural, musical bass, however. Good upper midrange but slightly sibilant highs out of the box. I sometimes prefer the k141 and k701 for their low mids on more acoustic based music, but the sound of the 240s isn't fatiguing at all like the k141.Summary: Extremely comfortable. Decent price for good sound. If you're considering these as a first 'good headphone' purchase, then definitely buy them. you could do a LOT worse for the money. Low-end AKG are all made in china now, so ignore the ""made in austria"" badging on the promotional photos."
"The sound quality for high frequencies, as in high notes of soprano opera singers, was a big upgrade from my previous headphones. But there's too much bass. With my PC, before the music starts, there's a low level bass hum, and when the music starts, there's so much bass that it kills the presence of orchestral music. Ninety percent of what I listen to is classical music, so these may be fine for other types of music. They're not uncomfortable, but when I take them off, I get a feeling of relief. Oddly, some other AKG headphones I bought, bluetooth ones mainly for use with my iPod, (AKG Bluetooth Headphone (Y50BT)), produce really superior sound for opera and orchestral music. I've now bought a bluetooth transmitter for my PC and use the Y50BTs for all listening."
"When I bought this product I was expecting a lot from it as I have Harman/Kardon laptop speakers (AKG is a Harman company) which are absolutely amazing when it comes to sound quality. I bought this intending on buying a pair of headphones that would be able to provide good amounts of bass without compromising sound quality, but this didn't do that at all. When I 1st listened to them it sounded like the bass was replaced with treble, it was an indescribable experience and was horrible. As I burned it in for an hour it sounded much better in terms of sound quality, but there was very little bass. The overall sound quality was actually less than that of my laptop's speakers believe it or not, which makes these only worth about $60 at most. The build quality was a bit sketchy which is surprising having seen how they make these on How It's Made. If you're looking for cheap headphones with good sound quality these may do it for you, but you can find better elsewhere."
"If the description pointed out (did not at the time of purchase) that these headphones require an amp to use. Even some of the answer questions advised that an amp was not needed and even someone mentioned that they use them every day connected to their phone. Connected and with the volume cranked, can barely hear anything. Confirmed after some researching on Google, most users of these headphones use an amp. While I'm sure they probably sound good under those conditions, I'm not gonna go spend an additional 100.00 on an amp. But side note: the headband on these headphones is extremely flimsy and feels like it's just gonna fall off. Think twice before buying these if you're gonna use them for on the go or in a nonstationary location."
"I have been doing studio recording for years. I have an old AKG k44 perception headset. It's basically hard plastic and I've always thought it was pretty generic. Anyway, I wanted to get an extra headset due to the amount of devices I have to plug into. Immediately when I heard this new headset, I was disappointed. It sounded paper thin, there is absolutely no bass in it, and I had to crank the volume up on my interface to the max to even hear it. Not to mention there is occasional crackling noises. So I plugged my old AKG k44 in back to back with it on the same device and it was loud I had to turn it down, and it sounded a million times better than this headset does. So I just don't get it? I don't understand why so many people think this headset is so great. I returned it. Maybe the one I got was defective. I don't know. However, I see other one star reviews saying the same feedback. Maybe I'll see if I can find an old old k44 instead"
"I have had these headphones since last October(2013) and the left ear has already shorted out as of March(2014). No problem, I have a warranty right?  The warranty is apparently worthless. I have now discovered, the hard way, that tech support for the US is a guy named Hector who will not answer the phone or email. I elaborated on the merchant, model number, reason for repair, troubleshooting steps I took and what I believe the warranty conditions to be in my initial email. He promptly asked for the same information in his reply and has not answered my reply at all.  Do not purchase AKG anything in the US if you want any hope of the warranty being honored in your lifetime, I cannot speak to purchasing these in the EU.Addendum: Amazon was gracious enough to refund the purchase given the circumstances. I am still less than impressed with AKG's U.S. support, but I have adjusted my rating upward since the headphones were good while they functioned correctly."
"Comfortable, but...The bass is disappointingly truncated, as is the mid-high treble and up.AKG website is a maze of options that you must traverse in _just_ the right way so as to arrive at...... a page that's far less than very helpful.The packaging says to go online for user manual. The online user manual is a moderate quality image of an exploded diagram of one side of the headphones. That's it.Sending them a message is fraught. If you send it to the ""wrong"" part of the company, they reply saying in essence ""This is the wrong place. Go away and try again""On the other hand, when I did find the right place, they told me that they don't sell replacement cords or pads. Seriously. The answer to my other question was succinct to the point of abrupt, but moderately helpful."
"After just a few years with very little usage, one side stopped working.I opened it and it turned out that a plastic thingy inside that holds the cable broke. I could not find the plastic thingy anywhere, online or offline. AKG did not agree to sell me one or to send me a replacement.I gave up on these and bought HD 600 of Sennheiser. Far superior headphones - durable and sound much better (and are much more expensive :) )."
"These AKG 240K Studio open-back phones are generally highly rated as an industry standard, and I found they probably deserve this. But I personally didn't much like the size and fit of their ear pads, finding them just a bit too small and uncomfortable. (Especially when I also wear them with my in-ear hearing aids.) I did try replacing the pads with Brainwavz ones, but the regular size Brainwavz pads don't fit the 240k at all well and they actually have a bit smaller inside opening than the original pads. I now mostly use the lower rated (less expensive) AKG 275 closed-back phones with their larger pads replaced with even larger opening XL Brainwavz pads."
"I've only owned 3 headphones - AKG K271, these, and The Audio Tecnica M50s.  The M50s blow both out of the water.  I was so underwhelmed when I first wore these it was shocking.  I tried to return them a few weeks ago but it was passed the deadline to return products.  These headphones lack clarity, they have no bass, and are extremely overpriced.  For an extra $50, you can have an outstanding pair of headphones instead of these.  Especially if you listen to music heavy in bass, you do *NOT* want these headphones.  Some AKGs have some bass, but these have very little.  They are just uninspiring, and it really degrades the music listening experience.  Get the M50s, you will thank me later.edit: I want to make it very clear that the lack of bass is not my only reason for disliking these headphones.  I found the mediums and highs to be very washed out and unclear.  Additionally, these headphones will not get loud at all.  With my system's volume at 100% AND with a sound boost, at the highest volume setting they were still not very loud.  What I am saying is that with an extra $50 you can buy a much better set of headphones, whether they be M50s or not.  These are just a very poor set of headphones for the money, and I would advise staying away from this model.  AKG as a brand is good, and I liked my K271's (though I prefer my M50s), but these headphones are rubbish."
"Meh, Forgot I bought these.  Buy something else, AKG 361 or spend more on  X2HR.  I own Focal Clear OG, thus can compare the AKG against true S-Tier headphones..IT's the end of 2022, THERE ARE SO MANY BETTER CHOICES FOR YOUR MONEY..."
"I really like these headphones for most things, really comfortable, my ears almost never get hot wearing them and good sound if they are plugged into something with some oomph. If they are plugged into my audio gear I use for making/playing music then they have lots of power and sound awesome, plug them into an xbox controller or a cellphone and they are lackluster. I usually end up using my Sony MDR7506 if need a wired headset instead of these."
"I needed a new set of headphones fast, having broken the old set.  I record audio books and need a crisp, clear rendition of my voice during recording and editing.  The AKG K 240 seemed to be highly recommended all around, and then I noticed that the MK II was available.  I figured it must be worth the extra money, and ordered that one through Amazon.  But I was surprised to find that (to my ears, at least) the sound was muddy and I could not hear any crisp highs or midrange sound.  I went ahead and used it - I was in the middle of a project and didn't have time to send it back - but I was very disappointed.  About the best I can say is that it's comfortable to wear.  I probably should have given it only two stars."
"A good quality pair of headphones with a good length of cord. Has a 1/4 jack adaptor. Just plugging them into a laptop headphone output won’t give you enough volume to work with. They require a headphone amp to get a good output volume. Even with my audio interface, they still weren’t loud enough for recording or mixing. I did a difference test between my old Sennheiser headphones and the AKGs were significantly quieter."
"I have worked in Radio and occasional music mixing throughout the years. The classic AKG design was found everywhere- radio stations, studios, on location, at home. This model, (at least one of its variants) was a fine sounding, highly respected standard in the industry(ies). Evidently, those models were made in Austria. I was hoping the now much cheaper Chinese version was basically the same except for lower labor costs being passed on, and a couple fewer accessories in the box. Nothing could be further from the truth. These are not an exceptionally good value at $66.00, let alone the $160 suggested. I don't know if they skimped on the drivers, or what's different, but these are cold, analytical, no extension at either extreme, OK midrange, fair soundstage with some detail. But poor dynamic range. They are just no fun for work OR play.  I'm baffled at the great reviews, UNLESS, like I'm thinking, this is a different animal then the model masquerading in the reviews starting sometime in 2011. If you notice, most of the fair to poor reviews were done in 2011 and later. That's when something changed. Look at the various Audio Technica, the cheaper Senns, Sonys,or Grados for under $100. ALL will beat these handily AND get your feet tapping. Use these maybe for shortwave radio?So- my best deduction- something happened on the way to China....."
"They didn't have a crisp high end like I was hoping for. Listening to cymbals I realized that they just wouldn't work for me. They sound good but I have Grado 80s and the 240s just don't do anything better than the American made Grados. I have the basic Audio Technica 20s and I prefer them over these 240s also. I think they really lack in the high end. The bass is just ok, they have a veiled sound to my ears. I remember enjoying these in a guitar store and now Im thinking that it could of been the older version."
"I bought my first pair of AKG 240s back in 2002. They had an unmistakable quality build to them and a clean, crisp, open sound that most of the other headphones available to me at the time just couldn't compete with. I eventually vacuumed the cord (shredding it to bits) on my first pair and promptly bought another pair. I remember noticing that they were made in Austria. I kept using that second pair until March of 2013 (almost 9 years) when I bought these, the AKG 240 MkII. I was a little skeptical when they arrived, I immediately noticed that they felt different. Even the colored printing on the cans looked off (it blurred around the edges and didn't line up quite right) But most importantly, they sounded different. They no longer had the clean, flat, open sound they once had. The mids seemed far more pronounced. I decided to let them burn in for awhile. Things seemed to settle after 60 - 75 hours of use. They weren't the same as my original K240s, but they'd do.Now, just over a year later: the left side is no longer working. Upon inspection, I've noticed that they're now manufactured in China. (a country well known for its quality control practices)I wouldn't recommend these. The price/quality ratio just doesn't stack up against the alternatives."
"I wish they said that this requires an amp for it to be good. The audio sounds so low and tinny even over 50% audio on PC with its current audio jack. Look elsewhere if you're looking for average-day headphones.EDIT: It seems like a quick way of fixing the audio quality is to adjust an equalizer on whatever device you're on. The image provided seems like a good average. The audio may still be a bit lower than normal, but at least the audio is still salvageable."
"First of all, the seller sent it on time and the product was as described, so I have no problem or complaint about the seller, is all about the quality sound.I already owned a pair of AudioTechnica but they come with a 1/4"" connector and realllllyyy long cable, so I was looking for another set with the same audio quality but a shorter, more compatible cord. This falls short.The honest truth is that this is not a $100+ headphones, they're good, but not worth the money. On the bright side you'll get 2 pairs of ear pads; one leather and another of a more cushioned fabric, two cables; one flat and one curly, one 3.5mm female to 1/4"" male adapter. So it's not a total loss, but:If you're looking for AUDIO QUALITY, look somewhere else, you can do better with the money."
"From a sound perspective, these headphones do sound amazing. You will hear everything accurately mixed as the recording engineers intended. They have a very balanced sound unlike most bass heavy consumer headphones. These would be adequate for hobbyist to mix and master with. From a comfort perspective, the ear cups are hot, and make my head sweat. The headband does not remain tight, and the ear cups slide out of position with the slightest movement. If you have long hair, beware. Your hair will get tangled in the headband, and this will pull out your hair when you take them off. If the headband were more adjustable and comfortable, I would probably keep them for the amazing sound. The discomfort wearing them is too distracting for me. Sadly, I am returning mine immediately."
"Purchased these for mixing. Sounds great. Nice flat response.  BUT have had them for less than a week, used them three times, and the cable has already gone bad causing the left side to break up. I sit right next to my mixer so I put absolutely no stress on the cable whatsoever.  Giving three stars because I really like the frequency response and sound.  Otherwise, I'd give one star and return them right away. Now I have to buy a cable replacement within less than a week."
"They're well built cans, but terrible for ""studio"" use.Granted I could have a bad pair, but my pair I've received are decently flat from 20Hz-2kHz, but between around 2,200-3,400kHz as well as 4,000-4,500kHz have very high and unpleasant spikes in response that makes these horrible for anything you need even roughly accurate playback for and I would not recommend these for.Samson sr860's (which are also not ideal for studio) are closer to flat than these are, and for nearly half the price."
"Based on over 3000 reviews I bought these headphones. What a mistake. I bought these for practicing playing the bass and I can't turn these up at all - if I do, the bass clips badly at moderate volume levels. My crappy $8 ear buds sound better than these headphones and have better bass response. Plugged directly into my laptop, I can't turn these up more than about 70% before clipping starts playing regular music. I bought my first pair of headphones back in the 1970's and over all these years, probably going through well over 100 headphones / earbuds, etc. these rank near the bottom of all my purchases - especially for the price. If you pay more than about $20 for these you are paying too much. I honestly can't understand why this product is highly rated - they can't all be schills! But are they?"
I like composing music as a hobby and was looking for headphones to replace the $15 earbuds I was using and these were a disappointment at least for what I was looking for. I don't wanna bash them because they may be good for someone else but I ended up buying a $25 pair of earbuds from Best Buy and they fit my needs more than these.
"Good sound, liked the lightweight cable.But too floppy on my head (7 1/8 hat size).Returned and found a pair that fit better."
"You get what you pay for.  Marketed as studio quality, they are totally not.  They flatten the sound and the volume is so disappointing that I was looking around for some dial on them.  Nothing, just weak. They are passable but really nothing special."
"Wasn't bad but it was so quiet and that was even with an amp. I do like bass more than others but even the other sections were so quiet. The construction was okay, don't like the headband much and the ear pads were average. Returned them because I wanted that little more sound that makes it pop. It was just so average and would be okay for 40 bucks, but for 65? Pass, and instead bought Philips L2 Fidelio and they were same price but has louder sound and better quality. Maybe not the name as these but the feel and sound, Philips are so good."
Perhaps I'm just used to closed back designs but these headphones let so much room / ambient noise in they compete with the sound coming through the earpieces.
"I compared these to a bunch of other headphones, mostly bluetooth, Sony's Bose, Palnatronics, Evens, B&W's, Marshalls, Sennheisers, Ghostek, etc, and I didn't hear any difference in sound quality to keep them. Maybe bluetooth has improved enough these days to make lower end open back headphones obsolete? Or maybe my old ears just can't hear the things younger people can. I'm 47. I love music, and listen to a wide range of it, but honestly, just didn't do it for me.."
"I received my order promptly. No issue there. But upon opening and inspecting the headphones I was a little disappointed as to the lack of a quality feel to them. Lots of plastic and almost no weight. What do I expect for a little over a hundred bucks? But the main issue I had, was after wearing them for a short time my ears began to sweat profusely. And the head piece rubbed against my scalp. My hair is getting thinner and thinner, so I need more padding than I used to up there.  I tried to install the spare velvet ear cups but gave up after wrestling with it for about ten min. They sound good, no problem there. But I can't recommend the product for reasons stated. I gave it three stars for the sound quality."
"These headphones suck.1. They have stopped working after six weeks of daily use, under 2 hours per day.2. If you have hair, it will get caught in these. Even after I pried off the shitty raised stickers on each side which were the initial culprit and caused the most hair loss, my hair still gets caught on these and yanked out.3. These do not feel like $80 headphones. They have the same approximate quality as the cheap folding ones I bought to wear on airplanes. And my cheap ones are still going strong after 6 years, unlike these.I wouldn’t recommend these, unless you like shelling out money for stuff you’ll need to replace in 6 weeks."
"Some people enjoy the bump in the upper mids (vocal range), but to me it sounds very artificial. I much prefer the Shure SRH440 or Audio Technica ATH-M50x. Everything else about these cans are excellent for the price. Great for monitoring or casual listening (if you like the sound signature)."
"Bought these to use with a guitar amp, and the sound is pretty decent. No complaints there for the price. Build quality is pretty meh, and they look a lot nicer than they feel.The big issue with these is if you have long hair. It will snag the sides due to how the adjustable headband works. It's a major pain in the ass, and the only way I've been able to get around it is to just tie up my hair when I wear them. Strongly recommend NOT getting these if you don't have short hair."
"Three weeks after purchasing the AKG K240 Semi-Open Over-Ear Professional Studio Headphones, I began to notice a slight static noise would randomly occur any time the detachable cord touches my shoulder or was moved. This static sound eliminates a lot of sound frequencies, most notably the bass. Initially I would simply unplug/plug it back in and everything would work fine for a couple, however, 6 months later (today) the static appears at even the slightest of movement (i.e. turning your head, basically any time the cable moves, etc). What's worse, is there seems no way to fix the issue. I am in the process of contacting AKG to see if they are covered under warranty. It's a shame because these headphones were amazing before all of this began happening. If AKG rectifies the situation and replaces the headphones, I will update this review. Until then, BUYER BEWARE!!!"
"I got this in June to use for listening back to my voice recordings for VO, I never spent this much on headphones, I put them on today Sept 1st and it's dead in the Right Ear! They worked great til now and it hasn't been that long since I got them, I'm extremely upset.Edit: Got in contact with the company and they approved to exchange it."
"I am an electronic musician and synth player. I needed a new set of cans for my DAW and several synths.  My current go to set is the Sony 9506 studio monitors from a few years ago. Incredible bass, great miss, and plenty of highs with good stereo field.  Tried these AKGs and found the build quality to be as bad as the sound.  Tested them on direct jack on my Roland Juno DS where the Sony’s are mind blowing.  These cans are noticeably softer and even when cranked up sound like my childhood clock radio.  Super disappointing.  Going back to Amazon.  Gonna get another set of the Sony’s or top rated AT 40’s.  Not at all sure what the hype about these cans comes from.  Yuck!"
"I wear headphones 5 or 6 hours every day for recording work and entertainment but these AKGs are just not comfortable enough to use for that length of time. The ear cups are made from rather hard foam and they're round so they don't conform well to my head. I've tried the Cosmos velvet replacement cups but there isn't any difference in the way they fit. The sound is biased toward the base end like most consumer grade headphones, but isn't bad for under $60. Another thing that irritates me is that these headphones don't allow you to hold just one channel up to your ear so live sources can be heard, you have to put them on your head all the way.For comfort and convenience I prefer the relatively inexpensive KRK KNS 8400. The sound is not biased and I've come to appreciate the inline volume control they offer."
They sounded good but the right speaker started cutting out after 10 days they are kinda junk
"Straight from the box I liked this headset.  The headband is one of the best I’ve met, adjusting automatically as I eased its ear pads into place.  My ears were warmer than I like but not enough to limit use.  Cable length was ample for my needs.  For comfort and convenience this is a well above average headset.It was all downhill from there.  In all the music I tried, definition was lacking.  I agree with reviews that write of “muffled dead sound” and “like they are covered in a down pillow.”Example: Track 9 from “The Best of Play Bach” by Jacques Loussier Trio, Gavotte in B Minor has a quiet, shimmering cymbal background that a Grado SR325 headset reproduces beautifully.  I didn’t expect the same quality from the K 240 headset but I expected better than it delivered, which was little more than the more aggressive strokes and even they lacked clarity.  Koss SportaPro bought from Amazon recently for $21 did better.In light of 5 star comments such as “…the clearest, crispest, pleasurable to listen to…”, which is what I hoped for, I assume this headset was defective.  I returned it.  AKG K 240 Semi-Open Studio Headphones"
"Not that comfortable, to me. The inner part of the phones touch my ear lobes, which I do not expect and have not usually experienced with other brands like Bose or AKG. These are, however, renowned for studio use because they allow a lot of sound in from the room while providing you with clear, neutral feedback on what you are recording or putting out there. They are not particularly good, however, for music, if you like bass thumbing cans. These ain't them. They are super flat (which is what they are designed to be)."
These ear buds are my first.  The buds do not cancel noise as advertiser.  They cancel some but not much. They fit surprisingly well and are comfortable to wear. They pair up well with my iPhone.  They are worth the money I paid which was not much. For my type of use they are fine but for someone concerned with perfect sound qualities they will disappoint
I have several pairs of Tozo buds. I like the noise canceling feature. These nc3s are a different design but just didn't work for me. I didn't like how they felt and the noise canceling wasn't any Better than my nc9s. Tozo is a great brand and I use the nc9 (newest version of) everyday.
"Earbuds are functional, noise canceling is mostly ok. When listening to frequency or binaural it doesn't completely block outside noise. I enjoy listening to sounds in the sauna and it only lasted about 3 minutes before completely shutting off."
Backgeound noise even when no sound beingnplayed
"I bought these primarily to use when traveling by air both for listening to movies with my bluetooth adapter and for noise reduction.  I wore these for one day and found the noise reduction to be unsatisfactory.  I tested by using the exhaust fan over my kitchen range.  There was only slight noise reduction, maybe 10%.  I tried a different cushion for the ear piece but it had the same results.  I had fatigue/discomfort in my ear after a few hours of wearing.  The sound of music was fine, however.I was hoping that these would meet my needs based on the great reviews despite the bargain price.  Late today I decided to buy the Apple Airpods Pro 2 on a Black Friday special.  These were obviously much more expensive.  Testing for noise reduction showed that they reduced the noise perhaps 90%, very impressive, and they were much more comfortable to wear.  The downside is that battery life will be much less but they are worth the extra price for my needs."
"Honestly not a big fan. The sound just sounds muffled and no matter how much adjusting I do on the eq, it just doesn't fix it. I purchased the crystal pods as well and they had a similar muffled issue, but worse. The NC2 had so much better bass, treble, and clarity out the box. I want to like these but I just cant. Another issue that's annoying, is the app always signs me out and I dont think there is a way to fix this.They only upgrade about these is the anc and transparency is a little bit better than the NC2"
"I bought this unit because of all the positive reviews posted.  Unfortunately I didn't have the same experience.  I charged the battery case to 100% on the day I received it.  I tested the earphones the next day for 30 minutes while waiting in a hospital waiting room.  After putting the earphones back into the battery case I noticed it was showing 98%.  I didn't use the earphones again for the next several days.  On the 5th day when I tried to use the earphones I was surprised to see on my phone the earphones had less than 10% charge.  The left earphones even shut off after 5 min.  When I placed the earphones back into the case it only showed 22% charge.  The battery case had discharged 76% in 5 days.  Additionally the ANC in the hospital waiting room was I effective.  All the conversations, elevator and other background noises came right thru.  In transparency mode the sounds coming thru were the same except it was like listening thru a hollow tube.  It's possible I received a bad unit but not taking a chance and will be returning it."
"As someone who has purhcased a number of TOZO products (and have been generally quite happy), these were an incredible disappointment. Few of the major cons below:- These are advertised as having wireless charging and they do not charge. For what are supposed to be one of their better earbuds (and newer) it makes no sense to have removed this feature- These no longer have in-ear detection as the NC2s did. Again, this was a major disappointment- The app is definitely an upgrade, but this is standard for all of their latest earbudsI purchased the updated NC9s as well, and while those also lacked wireless charging and in-ear detection, I felt those had better sound quality ."
Order these to replace NC2. Yes they support Bluetooth 5.3 added LED charging status and app support for EQ BUT they removed wireless charging. So all of us who have dropped the cord are out of luck with these. Removing wireless charging on their earphones is underway and they are quiet about it on their description! Even the Amazon chatbot was confused with their description.I loved their price and sound but removing wireless charging is a dumb idea to save a buck. Look elsewhere!
"They work fine but instructions so small I had to use magnifying glass to read, very confusing"
Immediately after opening package I noticed a crackling sound on the right ear bud. I tested by using the left ear bud in my right ear or just using left ear bud by itself and I don't hear any issues. It's just this right side ear bud. I reached out to Tozo customer service and it seems they wanted me to clean and recharge it. I did this and reported back that it still has same issue. They did not respond further. I am therefore returning this defective unit.
"Earbuds offer just a decent sound. I could have rated them much higher, if it wasn't for the fact that the seller/manufacturer never honored the promised made while registering the product. Basically, they promise to send you a gift if you register the product within the next 14 days from the purchase. During the registration process I was given a gift option an I chose a wireless charger. It was never sent. They shouldn't lie in order to trick you into registering the product."
"The item does not connect to my phone. 2nd pair won’t turn on. I ensured they were fully charged. I always order TOZO earbuds so I was excited to try these updated ones. However, once received, it didn’t work. I assumed it was just a defected pair, so I ordered another pair… same result.  They do not work.  I attempted to contact the seller, but it direct me back to Amazon.  Wish they worked :/"
"These earbuds do not stay seated well and fell out multiple times while just walking on a treadmill. The touch the bud to do actions is a terrible design. Every time I had to adjust the earbuds for coming loose it stopped the music, skipped the song, or turned on the sound amplifier so all I could hear was the treadmill.  After 30 minutes I got fed up and threw them in the trash."
"Buds fit well. Advertised features and reviews were good. Problem: Buds did not connect. They didn't flash that they are searching. My phone did not see them. I own 8-10 similar buds. Every one, even the $25 pair, connected instantaneously with the phone. Took them in and out of the case several tmes. Nothing helped. Case said they were 100% charged. After 30 minutes I threw in the towel and returned them."
Basically I cannot use these for the purpose I bought them for because one needs an app to control certain features and the app only works when both earbuds are out of the case. The ANC was not very impressive either and I bought cheaper TOZO buds with better audio quality in the past (it's why I went with a trusted brand!!). I wasted my money. You shouldn't.
"They have the tozo T6 which is amazing but for me they only last about 8 months, I decided to “upgrade” to these which are more expensive and have noise cancellations, but the sound quality is honestly quite bad for the price, and they are quite uncomfortable to wear if you sleep with them"
"returned, problem is 'move to next song' conflict with 'voice assistant', when press 2 times to move to next song, frequently it appears Samsung voice assistant. (I use it on S24 Ultra)Besides, the materials is poor. Doesn't worth money."
There really wasn’t any noise cancelation. I read all the instructions and pressed the right parts of the earbud. It would say that ANC was on but the external sounds were just barely dulled.
I haven't even had these for a month and they have started having buzzing in one earbud that is really annoying. Also they don't fit the greatest in my ears. Will be returning.
"These headphones seem to have great fit and finish, but they are way too low and the battery life seems to dissipate almost instantaneously."
Case shows 100% charge but ear buds don't do anything when removed from case.No flashing pairing light. Phone does not see them. Nothing. More China junk.
The sound just cuts out when you’re listening to these. Only one ear bud will have the sound and then it switches. Super frustrating and not worth it
These are not noise cancelling
Returning in order to get NC9. Buttons are so much better.
These have been great so far except when I am on a call and the person on the other end can't hear me well
"I honestly don’t understand how TOZO managed to mess up what was already a great product with the NC3. The older NC2 version was fantastic — solid noise cancellation, decent sound, and reliable performance. But the NC3 is a total letdown.First off, the noise cancellation is far worse than the NC2. I noticed more outside noise creeping in, and the “Hybrid Active” feature feels like a gimmick compared to the NC2’s immersive quiet. Even on the highest setting, it can’t block out the sound of a conversation or traffic, which was never an issue with the previous version."
"I purchased this because water broke my old Bose Revolve+. I don’t consider myself an audiophile, but I do listen to music religiously — 100k+ hours annually — and I can appreciate a crisp sounding speaker with nuance. This speaker lacks the nuance. It’s not terribly loud in my opinion, even on full volume in my small apartment. However, it is durable, and I love that it’s waterproof. Upon further research, I discovered that Bose is actually NOT worth the value for the money — many audiophiles recommend purchasing from another brand, as these speakers can be made for less than $50 and sold for $400+. Initially I purchased the Bose Soundlink MAX and another Flex (product listed here) as well, in hopes of amplifying the sound as well as achieving stereo sound in my apartment.After doing some research, I returned the Soundlink Max and one of the Flex speakers as well. I purchased some ELAC speakers instead for HOME use, and kept one of the Bose Flex speakers for shower use and traveling, as I spend a lot of time on the beach and this is dust and drop resistant. I purchased this on Prime Day for $99 before tax. I would NOT say it’s worth $150 full price. The battery is not great. I can leave it charging overnight and it dies with moderate use before the day is over. Mediocre in performance overall.It’s worth nothing that when I purchased the Soundlink Max from Amazon, the box itself clearly states that the speaker comes from Bose “RETURNS AND REPLACEMENTS.” I believe the speakers sold on sale are probably speakers that were defected or returned by other customers. Keep that in mind!"
A fall off a 48inch high surface broke the insides and it not sounds like a speaker that’s too small and blown out. Reached out to Bose directly for repair and they said they will no longer repair this model and can offer a discount on the newer model ($109 with trade in). The new ones don’t have any attractive colors and I really loved lilac. Just be careful with yours. 💔
My husband really enjoyed this speaker in every room he went and outside on the patio. The sound is very decent for such a small speaker and it has been very reliable: 3 years now.Sadly the usb port  just stopped working (wasn't the cord). Wish it would have lasted longer as I don't foresee a way to repair this.
"After 2+ years, my Bose SoundLink Bluetooth Speaker has sadly joined my collection of broken down speakers. The USB C cable keeps falling out of the charging port making it impossible to get a charge.  If I return it to Bose, they will send a new one for $89. I fortunately kept the box, otherwise it's impossible to make out the serial number on the speaker itself which you will need if sending it back in.  I still haven't decided if I will have the port repaired locally (if that is even possible), or if I will send in my old speaker. It was wonderful while it lasted. Best one yet. I will likely send it in to the company for an $89 replacement."
"Problem 1, be aware that this speaker has NO AUX input! JBL has one. I cannot stand music devices NOT having an Aux port that is synonymous with Music!?!? It's like peanut butter and jelly, some things just go together!  Problem 2 and possibly the biggest problem is the connectivity of the speaker. I cannot get it to connect to my Note 10 plus phone no matter what I do! Troubleshooting says to remove and reinstall the app, which I did... still can't connect (sigh) . Also, when you search for the device using bluetooth, when you click on it...it will say ""can only connect using the App""! So when the app can't find the speaker you're just F'ed! So...currently, I can ONLY connect my iPod to it. Problem 3, there is NO WAY to know how much battery power you have while you are playing it!  I owned a JBL speaker and it has like 5 little glowing dots on it, so you can clearly see when your battery is getting low as the lights go out as the battery drains. On this bose speaker you have NO way to know the battery level if you are not using their cheap stupid app so expect to suddenly look over and see a blinking red light, then you have to scramble to plug it in! BIG issue if you have ever owned a JBL. Speaking of JBL, we own a JBL charge 3. Good little speaker until the charging bay broke and it cost more than the speaker is worth to replace it so we will just throw it away, it seems. Boy I HATE that SO many devices use the crappy USB port to charge. It's Very cheap and doesnt last long.Anywho, so we did a LIVE comparison and as far as bass and clarity the bose beats the JBL hands down. Especially if you put it in the corner...like a kitchen or bedroom corner.....it just turns your walls into a speaker box, sounds NICE. So  nice we bought two Bose speakers! The party mode is pretty cool also when you connect two or more bose speakers and listen to your music in Stereo. Lastly, problem 4 is the Rubber type backing of this dirty little speaker.  Like a little Rugrat... Or that forever dirty peanuts character Linus, lol! Maybe that's what we'll nickname it, lol! They may have thought the rubber was a good idea  BUT I think it's a pain in the ass as it collects SO much lint and other debris! Just look at the two pictures I posted. One is AFTER I clean the speaker with a soft, damp cloth. Before the photo was taken, the speaker was  just innocently rolling around on our bed where it collected ALL of my husband's hair and a bit of dandruff it seems, YUCK. It's like a freaking LINT ROLLER! Lol :) **Where EVER you put it expect it to collect lint and dust**. I clean this speaker every other day as I HATE to see something that is brand new LOOK so TRASHED. So my overall verdict is to buy it! But it's NOT nearly perfect, far from it! Its not ""terribly"" bland to look at but its not ""cool"" looking either. The coolest thing about it is the name of course! I look forward to the 5th and 6th generation of this speaker when all these little annoyances are hopefully improved."
"I had my old Soundlink Mini for 10 years and it was only a few months ago that the battery wouldn't take a full charge any longer. Up until then, the charge seemed to last forever even though the specs said 7 hours. I have no idea how many hundreds of battery cycles it went through over the last decade.  When I needed to replace it, I immediately came back to Bose. I thought the Soundlink Flex would be the best replacement in terms of sound, battery, and size. I have to admit the sound is a little better but it's not worth losing the battery life. The Mini would turn off after 20 minutes if unused. The Flex does not. So, if I leave the room to do something else and don't go back to turn off the speaker, it stays on and drains the battery. Since that's what I'm in the habit of doing, I'm lucky if I get 2-3 hours use out of a charge.  The mini never did that. Yesterday, I turned on the speaker and it announced the battery was at 20%. I played music for about 30 minutes before the speaker announced the battery was low. About 15-20 minutes later the speaker shut off altogether. I plugged it in to charge it, but unlike the Mini, I couldn't keep using it while it charged. My phone couldn't even connect to it. In addition, it keeps falling over: the base isn't designed well enough to keep it upright even when only lightly nudged. Except for the sound, there is nothing I like about this product.I've had Bose products for decades. Never had a problem. Until now. This experience has left such a bad taste in my mouth for Bose. If I hadn't already sent the Mini to by recycled, I'd put up with it's shorter battery life, because even with that, I could use it longer than this Flex. Too bad I can't return it to Amazon since it's past the 30-day window. And I can't return it to Bose since that's not where I bought it. I'll donate this piece of junk to Goodwill and buy another brand."
"I bought April 2024 and loved it.  I used every day on my computer and at night on my TV.  Great sound.  No problems at all till today when it just stopped working.  The same thing happened to my last Bluetooth Bose speaker, too.  It worked beautifully till it just stopped!  Both less than 6 months old!"
I have always purchased Bose. The sound is great and the portability is great. But for $149. I would expect a charging block and a cord longer than a foot long. Short charging cord and no charging block.
"This speaker sounds extremely good for its size.One thing I did not realize is that it will NOT connect the way other speakers connect (including previous Bose speakers I have purchased), which is by just using the bluetooth connect settings on your phone.  Instead, this will ONLY connect if you download and use the Bose Connect app.  That's an extra step that does not seem necessary.  Also, the Bose Connect app will not work unless you turn on location and give it location access.  (Will someone explain to me why a speaker needs to know where you are?)  As long as that's okay with you, this is a great little speaker.  As for me, I wish I had known this before - I would not have bought it.BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE:  When I connected the speaker to my phone, it asked permission to access my contacts and my phone calls.  Now, someone tell me why a speaker needs this?  Of course I denied it, and the speaker worked fine anyway."
The older Boze speakers were much better than these new ones... These new ones are a real pain to try to get to work and stay connected
"It sounds good, its just the battery doesn't last that much :(  I hardly use it now because of that."
"You can't use the Bose Soundlink Flex as bluetooth output on an Alexa - it is never seen, so you can't connect. It also can't be added as a new device - so it can't be part of a speaker group, and Alexa control requires:1) You have loaded the Bose Connect App on your phone (and allowed the app to always be active). Note: I tried loading the 2 other Bose Apps available on Google Play - they aren't compatible with the SoundLInk.1a) The first time you run the Bose Connect App, it will search for your SoundLink. This took around 3 times before it worked for me - but once connected it auto-reconnects.2) Your phone is nearby (... with the Bose Connect App running ... ). If your phone isn't very close by ... the SoundLInk will beep when you press the MIC button ... but absolutely nothing happens (including no voice prompt saying you are too far away).3) You have to press the microphone on the Bose Soundlink - but then ""ask Amazon to play my favorites"" does work.So - I'm disappointed it doesn't behave like a real Alexa-enabled device. However, you can keep the SoundLink close by if you are using it for the pool (like I am). I confirmed that it doesn't disconnect if you float it in the pool. It will disconnect at a few inches underwater, but it is easy to reconnect. I had hoped to use the SoundLink as master control for a regular Echo Dot that is 15 feet away from the pool (protected from the weather). Now the best I can hope for is to buy a 2nd SoundLink and put it in Party Mode (2 are supposed to connect & play synchronously). Has anyone tried this?Battery life so far seems very good. After playing for an hour, and then leaving it off overnight ... it still indicates 100%. I'll update this is I find out battery life stays at 100% until it can't turn on.Bluetooth connection range is very good (30 ft+), and will auto-reconnect when back in range (but you need to ask to play music again).Sound is very good (and clear) at low volume. Bass is way too much when you turn up the volume if you have Normal equalizer settings on your phone. While you can adjust the phone equalizer - there is no way to just adjust equalizer settings for the SoundLink speaker. Why not?Buttons are ""OK"" - what you probably expect for a waterproof button. Not that easy to press (or to know it isn't pressed), but you'll get used to it.Overall, not horrible ... I'm just surprised that Bose couldn't have done better for a somewhat pricey product that was released in 2021."
"I do like how small and portable this speaker is. It does sound great, and the music is very clear however, the only thing that I am dissatisfied with is the battery life that this has. It states it can last up to 12 hours however, it really only gives about 6-7 hours consistently. If I could return, I would and look for a different product, maybe a JBL."
Does not Bluetooth to AlexaYou have to download app to use bose
This speaker has a great form factor and the sound is quite good. The battery life however is short. Not exactly sure how long but it’s a bummer.
"Decent audio quality but the audio cuts out 2-3 times per song with any android device. Could have prevented this problem by including an aux port, but of course billion dollar corporations need to save pennies on their overpriced Bluetooth speakers. I do not have this issue with any of the 30 dollar speakers I have, so why is this one so horrifically bad?"
I thought it would have lasted a little longer than a year and a half brand new but it just died on me won't charge anymore.
"Great sound, easy to connect to my phone but I’m not impressed with the battery life. My JBL clip has just as much sound, is much smaller and  lightweight, and has a way better battery life….for a cheaper price"
I have been an owner of other Bluetooth speaker made by Bose .Unfortunately the clarity of this speaker lacks in comparison to other Bose products I have owned.It is a nice size speaker and is just the right weight to pack on a trip .Bluetooth connectivity is greatBut for the price it did not meat my expectations in regards to the quality of sound.
"For the longest time I have avoided buying Bose products. Average sound at premium prices. I only got this speaker because I was hunting for the best small portable speaker and I saw a lot of praise for this one. So far I would say that my jbl flip 6 sounds better overall or for a 360 sound speaker the soundcore flare 2, earfun uboom, and tribit stormbox are all phenomenal and on par in terms of sound quality. The UE wonderboom 3 which I'm not a big fan of except for audiobooks is the only one i would put below the Bose. At least the Bose has bass. Every single one of those speakers is cheaper than the Bose though.I do like a warm speaker most times but the mids are so recessed on this one that vocals simply don't sound great on this. Bass is pretty good for this size. It's got the same fun mid bass boost most bluetooth speakers have. It has a single mono speaker and two bass radiators. I saw reviewers saying it was magic how a single little mono speaker could sound so good, well I'm listening for the magic and have yet to hear it. You can tell it is coming from one small speaker and while the flip 6 is also mono it has a larger woofer with a tweeter to provide better separation and a wider soundstage. The 360 speakers are stereo with 360 sound so they are even more open and enveloping.It doesn't even have an eq which is dissapointing. Soundcore and Tribit speakers are considered more budget speakers but they compete against and outperform higher priced speakers because of the incredible eq tuning you can do on them. Even JBL has an eq albeit rather limited. Get with the program Bose. Usb C at least, but bluetooth 4.2 was a questionable choice. Limited range compared to some of the others I mentioned but I will say surprisingly the best thing about this speaker is it has the fastest bluetooth connection I have ever seen. By that I mean it takes 1 second to connect vs 2-4 seconds of most other speakers.Overall it's an average sounding speaker at a premium price."
All i can hear is bass!
"I owned a JBL flip which seemed to have either no volume or excessive volume and also seemed as if it was coming out of a tin can.  I decided to go up in quality and read so MANY reviews.  I also listened to the video reviews, however they really don't help much because the sound I am hearing is coming through my computer speakers and is not the same as what is recorded.  I just set this up and I was horrified.  It sounds only a tiny bit better than the dreadful JBL flip I wanted to replace.  The volume has far more range in adjusting, but otherwise I can't imagine why anyone would want this thing.  It is beyond poor.I am mystified by the number of reviews giving this high marks.  I know I have good hearing and excellent ability to detect the ""quality"" of sound.  (hearing someone singing off key literally makes my finger nails itch)  Perhaps there is no portable speaker that will work.  I had also purchased one from Bang & Olufsen and it sounds better for the same price.  I have a Marshall portable one coming also and am keeping my fingers crossed.  At this point I think perhaps I need to buy a small plug in speaker which has bluetooth that is small enough for me to carry from room to room around the house.So my advice?  If you  love music and can hear the differences in what something is played on.....don't buy this one."
"The sound is very impressive but I have to return  it because  they sent  to me the used  one,the seal of the box already  broken and when I open  the box I can see the dog hair on the bose speaker as the picture  above."
"You turn it on, it talks. You turn it off it talks. You connect it, it talks. If you have it connected to the TV & the TV times off it incessantly says ""ready to connect."" You'll have to wake up & hold the pwr button in for a while b4 it turns off. Pretty annoying at 3 a.m. If I'd known this b4 buying I would not have. Good sound and battery life tho. Thus 3 stars instead of 1."
"Bought the Bose Sound link in February, knowing Bose was golden for sound. It didn't disappoint until June. After four months of working beautifully, it starting cutting out. Sometimes I'd get 10 minutes of music out of it, sometimes only 5.I moved or disconnected any other devices, made sure the speaker was a couple feet or even just inches away from the product it was streaming off of, checked every Bluetooth setting, unplugged speaker - turned everything off and then on, jumped up and down, had a serious talk with the speaker, got sad, and finally gave up. Went back to my old tin sounding ANKER and it works perfectly. Reviews seem happier with JB - maybe I'll try that."
"I have the mini bose as well, this one supposedly has 4x the output,  I can't tell it! Also battery does NOT last nowhere near 10 hours as stated, maybe 2.5-3 hours. Very sad, wanted this to be a great product."
"Save yourself the headaches and purchase the competing JBL speakers.  They are slightly less annoying, and they sound nearly as well - and you can join them with the JBL app.These Bose speakers, for their size pack some good sound.  Bose has produced good sounding equipment for most of my life.  It's only fair to acknowledge this.Now for the rest...You cannot easily join 2 of these speakers together.  The Bose Music app does not contain proper instructions and does not support this speaker unit - this should be obvious (at least in my version of the app).  They first want you to login to the Bose Music App - which BTW will yield nothing related to music - Bluetooth does not need the help of this worthless app.  Bluetooth, works reasonably well as it was created by engineers, not marketers. The app does NOTHING for THIS particular device.Now if you own just one of these units, then all is fine, the worthless app is not required.  If you want to Join/Pair two of these speakers (sometimes called Party Mode with similar devices) you simply cannot do it (with ver 6.3.4).  Laughably, the instructions want you to stand on your head, hold this button, press this other button to select language, hold down another button and then wait for part of your lifetime, while nothing takes places.  This set of steps, endorsed, approved and tested by Bose management shows just how a well-known company can burn its long-term reputation.  But I am sure that Bose has some great ""merch"" that would make it all better.Do not waste your time with trying to get two of these devices to pair/join media-wise - aliens will arrive before this happens.This scenario is what happens when engineering is tossed aside and marketing twits and lawyers are held in higher esteem - I assume because they are social media ""gurus"" and they love working close together to screw the customers as much as they can get away with (and we consumers seem to have a very high tolerance for this, so, get used to more of it).  And making it worse, to use the pointless app, you agree that Bose can sell away your privacy, so they can make more products that decline in quality.As long as we worship marketing and social media twits, instead of engineers (and we proudly do), this type of situation will do nothing but get worse.  So all of you Gen-Z'ers, who have mastered the universe already (ha), remember that the things you worship in younger life will set the tone for the rest of your long life.  Social media didn't build the world, engineers did - do away with them at your peril.Have a great time with this speaker - it serves a purpose - great sound, as a limited mono speaker.- A 35-year software and hardware engineer, and professional musician in earlier life, who is happily retiring!"
"Good functions. But it's my opinion that beats pill  are louder , that's my next buy speaker."
I don't like that the button isn't raised. I have to press hard to turn it on.
"Not loud enough and battery could go pretty quickly in my opinion, price point does not match product."
"I was disappointed at the sound quality so I requested a return label and did the drop off at Staples. Well, well, a couple of months later, checking my credit cards, I noticed the money never went back to my account. Sure enough, it was never refunded. It showed the return process was started but not finished. Buyers be ware, always check your returns. Don't trust them to do their job."
There wasn't anything really wrong with speaker. It just wasn't as loud as my JBL which I use at home. But it also wasn't as loud as my LIFEPROOF speaker that I take EVERYWHERE and hangs off of my beltloop. Sounds great but not loud enough and is too big to hang off beltloop. PROBLEM I'M  HAVING IS GETTING MY REFUND.  I was told they received speaker and would be refunded by 5.12.24. Wasn't.  Then by 5.15.24. Wasn't. Now says by 5.20.24. Today is 5.17.24. I will be contacting tomorrow. Not waiting till 20th. I've only asked for refund 1 time and wasn't a problem. This makes me think twice before ordering from Amazon again.
"Upon first listen, I don't think the sound is as good as my 5-year old or so Sony bluetooth speaker. Also, I know how to set up bluetooth speakers. It worked. The next day could not get any sound out of it even though connected. Cleared it of memory multiple times, disconnected, re connected, still no sound. Returned."
"I almost always check the many products I buy from Amazon within the 30-day return window.  This speaker was an exception, so confident was I in Bose build quality.  It never dawned on me that unlike the several cheap blue-tooth speakers I've owned in the past, this one does not have a connection app available to enable me to connect the speaker to my iMac.  Apparently it only connects to phones and pads, neither of which I use for Internet at my home as I prefer a desktop computer with a large screen and a full-sized keyboard.  Besides, my cell gets a poor Internet connection at my home here in the Oakland hills anyway.I tried using Bose's chat support to see if they could help me, but not only was the chat very slow, they would not help me unless I opened a Bose account.  I explained that I had bought this product from Amazon and had no need nor desire to open a Bose account.  I told them that I do not give out the personal information they were requesting in order to open the account.  After wasting an hour of my Sunday on this useless product, I gave up.  Besides, their connection app on the App Store expressly says that it only connects their speaker to a phone or a pad.  Now I'm stuck with this turkey, plus the case which I also bought.  Bose should have been front and center telling prospective purchasers that this speaker will not connect to a desktop computer, since all the other ones I've ever used would do so.  It's a failure to meet the reasonable expectations of a consumer, and a failure to disclose this major shortcoming, combined with obnoxious support policies.  Caveat emptor!Thus, this is a product that is thusly limited accompanied by a refusal to provide product support unless you open a Bose account (and even then they probably would have told me the same thing their website said, i.e., that their app can only be used to connect with phones and pads, but not desktop computers, an outrageous shortcoming, in my view."
"I have had this thing for less than 24 hours and it is being returned. Maybe it is my specific unit, but other reviews echo my same concerns.1 - Why was this so hard to pair this to my phone?? It took me multiple tries and 15 minutes through the app/my settings to get this to work.  It was almost returned before I even got the chance to connect it, when finally the pairing succeeded after multiple closing out the app and restarting the speaker over and over.2 - The battery. I plugged this in as soon as it arrived, and after 3 hours it was charged to 30%. Used it while it was plugged in, so can attest to good sound quality (do wish it got louder than it does). I checked on it again a few hours later (never unplugged) and it was still 30%. Unplugged/replugged, and realized the cord must have lost connection (while it was fully plugged in….) so it had stopped charging. I confirmed the unit was charging with the light blinking and went to bed, to wake up to it being 40% charged as it had lost cord connection again. I’m using an apple usb box I’ve used with many other devises, so that is not the issue.This is so cute and I was really excited about a new speaker, but this is getting returned!"
"Product is of good quality, but has no equalizer. Far too much bass and no way to adjust it."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Color - love it!Size - love it!Bluetooth Connection - connects to both my iPhone and iPad simultaneously! Sweet!Sound - ummm…. You can only adjust the volume or skip a track. There is no way to adjust the audio levels. It seems to me that the bass makes the vocals sound muffled? It also vibrates everywhere when the volume is turned up.  I have had many Bose products over the years, but this one truly disappoints me, even at this price."
"I bought this because I heard it playing placed in the dashboard of someone's golf cart. It is smaller than my Soundcore Motion Boom speaker and sounds so much better. Unfortunately while I usually get 6 to 9 rounds of 4 hour golf out of the Soundcore, the Bose started to ask to be charged after 17 holes. This is at a fairly low volume too. I loved that it sounds so good anddoesn't roll around but if battery life is a 2 star drop."
"I expected more from Bose. The sound quality is great, however fully charged to 100% gives you a maximum of 3 hours of play time. This is having the speaker outside in 70 degree weather while keeping it in the shade. Very disappointed. The durability is great, it connects easily, the charging cable is easy to use. For me it goes back to the battery life, 3 hours of playtime is not enough."
"I don’t dislike the product. But for the price point, I was expecting much nicer. The sound quality is good, and it does get decently loud…. Which for the size, I understand there’s limitations for the volume. But for its price point, I don’t think the sound quality, volume and battery life is there. I don’t think this is true Bose quality. It’s almost like they made it as cheap as they can and then slapped their label and price tag on it and said here you go. I’m honestly returning it cause I don’t think it’s worth $150. Maybe if it was $80-$100, it would be worth it"
"The sound is ok on this speaker, the bluetooth connectivity was touchy when pairing and connecting, and it has to be ""re-connected"" at times,...why? Bose is over-rated and over-priced IMO, I gave them a try because I have had the single square speaker for some time. It has lasted, but the sound, again, is just ""ok"". But the connectivity was good with the older bose. The over-all sound is so close to my old square one, it hard to tell which is superior, even though this one is supposed to be better, it definitely costs more.I DO like that it is controllable by my fire stick remote/volume."
"I saw really good reviews for this product, so I was very excited when I saw it was on sale. When I recieved it, it appeared in good condition. Heavier and a little bulkier than I thought it would be, but not a huge deal. Charged within 2 hours. Connecting it to Bluetooth was very easy, volume was impressively loud. However, the connection had glitches while playing my music. I could not figure it out, and it was driving me crazy. I really enjoy listening to my music without anything interrupting it and it sounding like it's skipping. It's a big pet peeve of mine. I made adjusts, but didn't seem to get rid of it. $110 for glitching music was not justifiable. I found a speaker for $20 bucks that sounded more clear and didn't make a single glitching sound. I'm returning the Bose, but this is also where my experience keeps going downhill. My only free option of returning this speaker is through UPS pick up and I work night shifts. I like the freedom of dropping off at the closest UPS office because of that, but now I have to wait for a UPS driver to come pick up at an unknown day and time. It's so vague with giving 'up to 3 business days' They gave a number to call for tracking but there's no track for a driver coming to pick up the item. I have an order # and a scan code. I contacted customer support for them to only reconfirmed it was only UPS pickup and there was no ability to guarantee a set pick up time but that they could make note of picking up at a more convenient time. 🙄 I don't typically have issues with Amazon, but this is going really badly. You've been warned."
"I bought this to replace one of my Bose SoundLink Color II. I use these for work and have to hear everything clearly. Bose is great for this. But, the Bose SoundLink Flex Bluetooth Speaker does not have an Aux input, such as the Bose SoundLink Color II does. I tried the Flex for an 8hr. shift and the BT connection just didn't hold up. In my line of work I cannot miss a spoken word, not a single one, and so I had to send the Flex back."
"I've had the speaker for a few months. While it worked, it sounded great for its size. However, after a few months, it would turn off on its own. Everytime it exceeded a certain volume, it would turn off. Not sure if everyone else has the same problem but its gotten to the point that i cant even use my speaker anymore. Very unhappy."
The sound is incredible but battery life is not great! I spent a lot of money on this device and will need a backup charger just to take it to the beach. It has maybe 2 hours of play time before it says to charge.I paid 1/5 the price for a cheap unit that will last 8 hours so I’d say if you’re indoors and have access to charge it fine but if you’re looking for something that is for travel - this isn’t the unit for you.
I sent one of these speakers back because i could not get it to link or connect.  The second one i only figured out after the Bose app failed repeatedly. I ended up connecting through my Android bluetooth settings and saw 2 versions of the Bose speaker listed.... My guess is one is used with the app.  But you do not need that to use with your phone or computer.If you're tech savvy you'll figure it out. If you are not- avoid this brand.  I would not buy a second one.
"This speaker is alright. I dropped the money on it because of the brand name, and because I have bose headphones that are really great. I assumed that it would use the same app as the headphones, which give you access to EQ adjustments. But it doesn't.This speaker has too much bass for me. If there was an option to lower the bass even a little bit then it'd be great, but unfortunately there isn't. So I'm stuck with it."
"The sound quality is really good. You get the nice base and treble. My problem is with the battery. They say it can last up to 12 hours, but, I'm getting maybe 5 hours. I don't have it at its highest volume so it is not the cause for the battery going as long as it does. I think from now on I will stick with the JBL, it has amazing sound and long battery life."
"Bose sound quality ranks with the very best as for the battery life on this thing disappointing ,at full volume you might get three hours battery life really for outdoors had I known of this before hand would have opted out and would have chosen something else with a superior battery life  .Twelve hours battery life that's a joke."
I have owned two of these and have loved them until they died. Had them for about two years each. Both had the same problem… they stopped taking a charge. The first one had a problem after taking about a four foot fall. Not sure of the precipitating event for the second one.
"I have a Bose surround system for my tv that sounds amazing but it isn’t Bluetooth compatible so I chose to get 2 of these so I could listen to music.  I bought 2 of them for stereo effect.  I’ve had them over a month now and I am disappointed with the sound, especially for what I paid for them. At lower volume the sound is acceptable but at higher volumes the sound is tinny and not enough base.  I thought I would be able to connect them to the Bose app and adjust the eq but they only connect to the Bose Connect app which has no eq.  Unfortunately I waited too long and can’t return them.  If I were to recommend this speaker it would only be if you needed one that is portable.  Otherwise, do more research for better sounding speakers."
"Bose could've hit it out of the park with these speakers by offering full mobile support for stereo pairing.  Instead, they chose to only support smartphone stereo streaming, which is only a fraction of their customer use cases.The Bose Soundlink speakers are a fantastic option for those seeking high-quality sound in a portable form factor. The sound from these speakers is excellent and fills a room with ease. However, the experience of linking two speakers via smartphone for stereo is sorely disappointing. The linking process is cumbersome and requires multiple attempts to connect the speakers properly, which can be very frustrating.Additionally, Bose chose to only support smartphones for stereo, so these speakers cannot be used to stream stereo from something like a MacBook - my primary want! This is a significant limitation for those who prefer to use something other than a smartphone for their audio streaming needs.Furthermore, on the Apple smartphone front the Bose iOS app is poorly designed and difficult to use. It does not consistently connect two speakers for stereo playback, which is frustrating and adds to the overall poor connectivity experience.In comparison, Sonos and Apple products offer a seamless and intuitive connectivity experience, which is what consumers expect and - honestly - deserve. The excellent sound quality of the Bose Soundlink speakers is significantly overshadowed by the frustrating software connectivity experience. Overall, while the sound quality is impressive, the connectivity experience might turn out to be a refundable violation for you.Bottom line: If you want to stream stereo from your mobile computer, YOU CANNOT USE a pair of these speakers - they will not work with Bose offering customers support for notebook computers, full stop. If you want to stream stereo from your smartphone, know that you'll be forced to sleuth out a step-by-step process involving buttons on the speakers and buttons on your smartphone that pair two speakers - the app isn't smart enough to just connect, seamlessly, every time. Also note that even if you do figure out a process, the speakers can be finicky and refuse to see acknowledge each other, for whatever reason."
"UPDATE: 5.20.2024I tried to like it, but kept having Bluetooth connection problems.  I would get interrupted signals.  I initially thought it was my computer issue, but tried another bluetooth speaker and worked fine.  So I thought it was defective product and ordered replacement speaker.  Same problem.  Returning it.I have several mini or micro speakers, ranging from $35 to $99 dollar, including Bose Micro Sounlink.  What I like about Bose Flex is the richness of the bass and the depth of sound the speaker is able to deliver.  You can really notice the difference if you play this speaker with other micro speakers.  As for other speakers of the same size as Bose, I purchased one for $45 but couldn't tell much difference from that one and my Bose Micro Sounlink.  I think Bose Flex is worth every penny.  Get is when it goes on sale.  Purchased mine for $120."
The speaker doesn’t give out a good area of sound  Disappointed that I paid that much for it
"American manufacturers in modern times love to design items that fail just after warranty expires as a means of selling more product.  This speaker was no exception.  While it worked wonderfully for 26 months, it stopped working entirely (didn't connect to any device) at that point."
Must say it's a great sounding speaker. Clear sound deep base. Only issue is the battery life. At max volume I can only get about 3 hours while I have other cheaper speakers like Ortizan that I can get 8hrs and more at max volume. For the price of this speaker I believe you should of gotten better battery life
not what i expected. Good product just not what I wanted size or Wt
"I got this to replace an older Bose Bluetooth speaker when the old one no longer held a charge for very long. This one sounds almost as good (I did a side-by-side comparison and the old one was a bit warmer). The battery life a year in is still excellent. However, this thing has a real software error: periodically it will act as if it’s connected but won’t play the music from my phone. There is no fix in the manual or from Bose. What to do: hold the power button for 10-15 seconds, until it resets. Then forget the Soundlink in your device’s Bluetooth settings and then connect the Bluetooth device as a new pairing. It’s really annoying and for me seems to happen just when I need the speaker to play for an event…Bose, you used to do better than this!"
"This is a Bose so you know the sound quality is awesome. However, the battery life is terrible! It doesn’t last but a few hours before it needs to be charged again."
"I love the size, portability, and sound quality; however, the charging is a problem. I used the cable that Bose provides with the speaker, but it didn’t work with my iPhone block/plug. I was only able to charge it to 40% overnight."
"UPDATE:I’m disappointed that with a FULL charge, right off of the charger, I didn’t get the advertised 6 hours of use. I took it out on the boat and got a little less than 4 hours. It’s too late to return it. I’m going to reach out to Bose. Maybe I got a lemon?I was on the fence between this one and the standup speaker. We’re active and we have a boat. I’m glad I chose this one because it’s super portable. It has pretty great sound and it can get pretty loud. The only downfall is that I really love loud bass and it gets a little muffled when you have volume all the way up. But for $150 I feel like it’s completely worth it. I can bring it on the boat. Use it by the pool and use it in the house. It’s versatile."
"Sounds amazing for the size, but don't buy 2 thinking you can play in stereo.  Almost impossible to set to stereo mode....the default to ""party"" mode (2x mono) and there no simple way to set to stereo.  Bought a pair and I've been able to set to stereo mode 2 or 3 times, but it depends on the phase of the moon."
"This is my 2nd purchase of the same speaker. Whilst this one was more expensive, the sound quality (volume) is waaay inferior. I can not listen to it at the beach because the volume is not up to the standard I expected. I started an Amazon return but refuse to pay for return shipping so I'm now stuck with this speaker. Now shopping JBL"
"Bose sound and design is flawless but I should have invested in a different speaker for the outdoors. If I am using my Bose soundlink  indoors where a charger is near by it's really good but this speaker does not shiny outdoor. On days I like to be outside, overall the battery life of a Bose soundlink flex is not as advertised. I don't know if I received a bad speaker but after 6 hours of play time I find myself needing a charge and having to carry a portable just to recharge the speaker. Bose soundlink flex is not meant for outdoor activities unless you carry a portable charger which should never be the case."
"I LOVED this speaker. the sound was so amazing! I even reccomended it to several people. I never turned it up very loud, or anything. Then a year and a half later, the speaker mysteriously blew out. Now it sounds awful. It makes a loud, fuzzy noise even when it's turned down very low which is very annoying."
"I was thrilled with the sound of the Bose when I first got it. then suddenly I started getting that tinny, blown-out speaker sound, and so I did troubleshooting and got rid of the Bose app and reloaded the Bose app and reconnected the Bose to reset it. Still no good! I even put on my oldest Bluetooth speaker to compare it - found the same tinny sound but good volume still, the only difference is about a $130-$150! The fact that this older speaker has been the SAME sound for probably 3-5 YEARS, where-as the Bose speaker (if it is a REAL Bose) went BAD within DAYS! I am SO disappointed! I am going to go to a Best Buy local store and try to buy one there and see if I can get my money's worth, but this is ridiculous! I tried another speaker b4 going to Bose that was a little less expensive but supposed to be a waterproof speaker and immediately heard the blown out, tinny, sound and returned it immediately! At least I got 2 or 3 good days out of my 160 plus dollar Bose speaker! What a disappointment! I'm wondering if it even is a real Bose!! RETURNING! UPDATE- went to Best Buy & bought SAME Bose Bluetooth speaker & it's GREAT! Makes me wonder if the Amazon ""Bose"" was really a TRUE BOSE! Get at a Best Buy & BOT on Amazon! Sorry Amazon. I Buy a LOT from Amazon. But HUGE difference in SAME BOSE SPEAKERS! Makes me wonder....? Hmmmm?"
I wish I could give it more stars...unfortunately  the battery  says I'm the description  is up to 12h but not in my case just lasts 4h at most...the sound is really good but that's  a bummer  cuz if you wanna take to the beach you can't  cuz is just last that much...I was so sure that  the product was going to be good cuz of the price and the brand and I trow away the box the very first day..so know I'm stuck  with it and I can't  return  it cuz of that.
Already not working after a year of gentle use. Not charging not powering on.
"Liked the color. The sound was tinny to me and distorted and tried many different genres, settings, old songs, new releases, etc. Of note is that the app does not work on a MacBook Air which is why this was ultimately returned."
"It sounds really good. But is says 12 hours of listening time, I charges it to 100% and within 3 hours it's dead. Maybe I got a bad battery. But its a pain."
The sound is truly outstanding. The base pounds! But the design of the speaker is frustrating. It’s so thin it knocks over easily if I had realized this I would have taken that into consideration in my decision.
"I bought two of these speakers specifically because the ad said they could be paired to create a stereo sound. I am using them to replace wired speakers on an old receiver I converted to bluetooth. I had no trouble pairing each of them to my bluetooth transmitter. Then the trouble started when I tried to activate the stereo. This must be done via the Bose Connect app. I tried every way possible to get this to work. Spent hours on it. I could not activate stereo when they were both connected to the bluetooth transceiver. I tried depairing them from the receiver and was able to pair them together after much effort through the app. But as soon as I reconnected one to the transceiver, they quit working. So now all I can do is listen to them in mono. If you're only buying one of these, it works great. Otherwise I'd buy another product."
"I was very pleased to purchase this Bose product on Prime day. Once I received it, I was disappointed in its sound quality: below average. I was very disappointed in its range: 25 feet at best. But I was most disappointed in its battery life: probably less than 2 hours. We'll see how durable it is."
I liked how the speaker was built.  I liked the shade of blue Bose provided.  The speaker was loud with my IPad but it was hardly loud with my Pixel 8.  Performance would have been better if the  volume buttons worked.
I'm very disappointed with the charge life doesn't even make it full 10 hour work day on full charge not what I thought was going be like I only keeping it cause I need something that is half way ok  for work
"Very high maintenance. Requires an app, not the Bose I remember. Twice I have put this in its box to return, but stop myself. I still have 25 days left to decide. Most likely I’ll end up returning it."
Small and portable.  Pairs really fast and stays paired.  Only complaints are it's overpriced and could definitely use more volume.  Had to buy a larger speaker to get the volume I wanted
I love the color and the sound of this speaker but it took 9 weeks to get it.  Apparently Amazon is advertising items on their site that they don't have in stock.  I could have ordered this item from another business and had it within 7 days.  I will be shopping from more reliable sources in the future.
"I've only had the flex for a few hours but so far I think it sounds good. I haven't had time to test it next to my Revolve but my first impression is positive. I have tried it in several locations and physical positions. So far, upright and ~8 inches from a wall sounds best. The sound coming out of the back grid seems to bounce nicely off the wall.I have a playlist that I use to test speakers, headphones, earbuds, etc.  It seems to handle pop and jazz better than classical. Vocals are present. Bass for such a small speaker is remarkable. I really like a sparkly sound, particularly in certain classical music -- bells, piccolo, harp, high strings. I find the Flex lacks the sparkle for my taste but it's not terrible.So, why three stars? The Bose app is crap. I've had to unpair and repair twice in the last hour. Software is not Bose's strength. I've had struggles with Bose Connect with my Revolve and my Sportbuds, the Flex seems to bring a whole new level of frustration. Maybe it can't handle that I own so many Bose products. Time will tell if the app and connectivity are a deal breaker. Unlike other BT products, you must use Bose's app for it to function; therefore, I cannot separate the speaker from the app."
"This does not live up to the quality I’ve become used to expecting from Bose.  At full volume, it’s about half the volume of the speaker I had before it"
"Not even close to 12 hours. I work a 12 hour shift, by hour 6 I’m at 10%, even charging it for 30 minutes during lunch it doesn’t make it 12."
"I bought it due to a nice price drop; it is quite ordinary honestly in sound. It replaces one that I had which cost less than $30 which sounded about the same (and lasted 2 years). A small design gripe: it is quite thin and topples over easily. Basically any time I touch it to turn it on, I have to hold it so it doesn't topple over backwards. PPluses: Cool light purple color, connects easily and every time to my iPhone, and every time you turn it on, it tells you how much battery charge is left before needing a charge. (e.g. 60%)"
"Lots of folks seem to really like this speaker.  Personally, I'm disappointed with the sound quality.For the past five years, I've enjoyed music from my Bose Soundlink Mini.  I always thought the overall sound quality was excellent, and especially enjoyed the bass response.  When my Soundlink Mini died, I wanted to replace it with the same model, but it was very difficult to find new in May 2022.  So I opted for the (very favorably reviewed) Bose Soundlink Flex.Right off the bat, I noticed the bass response was much worse, and that the overall sound lacked the clarity and fullness of my old Soundlink Mini.  Since my Mini was dead, I borrowed a friend's Soundlink Mini to do a side-by-side comparison.  The Mini sounded  better, it was no contest.  For good measure I did the comparison using both my phone and laptop as sources.  I listened to Pink Floyd ""Animals"",  Verdi's La Traviata (Deutsche Gramophon), and Lucy Woodward ""Is Hot and Bothered"" to hear a range of music.  I'm glad I did this because the Soundlink Mini made the tonal and recording differences very easy to distinguish, just like my home audio system does.  On the flex however, these differences were lost and the selections were tonally pretty similar.I'm not saying the Flex sucks...just that it compares poorly to the juicy sound I've come to expect from my dear departed Soundlink Mini.  My Flex is going back to Amazon, and I'm going to try to find a lightly used or refurbished Mini for my next five years of mobile music enjoyment."
"A nice speaker. Surprised you have to download a program just to connect it to Bluetooth.  Then you have to download another program to supposedly adjust the bass. I downloaded it but can't find where you can do this, yet. I read about where you can do this when I googled to see if I could change the sound settings.  Good Lord! It's a Bose. Supposedly the best. You should be able to do this on the device. My gosh,  the stereo set I had in the 60's had the ability to adjust these settings."
"Seriously.  The first thing that stood out was how tiny this speaker is.  It came in a tiny box that confused me because I know I didn't order anything that small.  OK, so it's small, I can adapt if the sound is amazing.  Which it's not, but I didn't even know that  until the next day because trying to connect this thing to blutooth is like trying to break into Ft. Knox.  You have to download some ""Bose Connect"" app which has a bunch of scam sites posing as Bose Connect, so I had to cancel my credit card after giving it to one of the scam sites.  The next day I got the thing to work and DISAPPOINTED.  The sound is MEH.  Not bad, nothing to write home about.  But the battery life IS something to write home about:  DON""T PURCHASE THIS!  Wow.  It's like Bose ain't even trying.  Sending it back, going back to JBL."
For a $129 I expected for it to last longer but it didn’t I’m kinda upset about it lasts about the same time as my JBL clip 4 smh not happy about it at all
"JBL charge seems louder, only good thing about this speaker is the design"
"Speaker lasted about 6 months, teenage used outside when playing basketball.  Rained on one time and doesn't work, still waiting on Bose support.  Will update once resolved"
"As a loyal Bose customer, I’ve always trusted the brand to deliver top-notch products. I’ve got Bose headphones, other Bluetooth speakers, and never once have I been disappointed—until now. This Bose SoundLink Flex Bluetooth Speaker has me seriously questioning my loyalty, and trust me, that’s a hard pill to swallow.Let me break it down: this speaker has never been wet, so why on earth does it sound like it’s playing my jams from the bottom of the ocean? It’s like the sound is drowning! I’ve come to expect the best from Bose, but this speaker is so off the mark it’s not even funny. Bose, sis, we need to have a serious conversation.This is not the Bose I know, love, and proudly recommend to everyone. This speaker? It’s a hot mess. I need a replacement or a refund, pronto, because this is a terrible representation of the brand I’ve been loyal to for years. To anyone thinking about buying this speaker, I’m telling you now: run, don’t walk, to another brand—this one’s a hard no-go.Bose, what’s going on? Fix this, and fix it fast!"
"I’ll charge this for 8 hrs and the battery is dead after 8 hrs of listening. My JBL jam box will take an 8 hr charge and last  a week without needing a charge. Though the Bose look is sleeker than the JBL jam box, the JBL has better sound in my opinion."
"The sound quality is very very good. It pairs with my tablet, however, unfortunately, no matter how much I tried i couldn't pair with my Samsung galaxy s9 without the app! I downloaded the app when I got it but did not like the fact that the app tracks all of your information.  If you don't mind corporations tracking your info then this is a good product. Trying to use it without tracking is very difficult. I was sad to send it back but when I pay 130 bucks I dont want to download an app that sends 3rd party information out. I have been a loyal customer for quite a while (I even have the original q3 headphones from '98 or so and a sound system from way before then) but I just can't justify this. Also on Amazon it says that it can pair with Bluetooth speakers... it does NOT say that it only pairs with other Bose speakers... boo. I was hoping it would pair with my other Bluetooth speakers. Just wait a couple years until BT 5.0 is more regular. Don't waste your money until then."
"The Bose Connect App really doesn't work reliably. Bose support slow, terse and not helpful. Bose Connect App failed on Galaxy S23. Can connect direct via bluetooth but instructions with speaker imply that Connect App should be used. Support just blames your phone and user error if doesn't work and suggests you try bluetooth direct. Bluetooth prompts from speaker do not distinguish pairing and connect which is confusing."
"Got this to play spotify and Bose app keeps telling me doesn't play audio from apps. Wont work . Not supported well what good is it then. A expensive paperweight.  Have no idea on sound as it wont play music .returning .totally useless. Did connect with my phone though . UPDATE, finally got it to work on my spotify somehow but battery life is only 4 hours . Tested 3 times .sounds great though"
Sound is not as crisp and loud as the wireless image we bought ten years ago.  Our JBL wireless speaker of our daughter has better sound.
"Dang it Bose!  This speaker, configured in a pair, is so close to being perfect.  Size is fine, weight is fine, sound is very good, etc.  BUT, it takes me several minutes and many tries to get two of them paired.  It is EXTREMELY frustrating.  If for some reason you need to temporarily kill the connection, let’s say for a quick phone call or something, your guests will have to wait for five minutes in silence while you reset everything and curse the garbage app that doesn’t want to let you connect both speakers and pair them.  The next fatal flaw is the weak Bluetooth connection.  These are the most finicky, easily disrupted BT device I own.  The range is garbage, there can’t be ANYTHING in between the speaker and your phone/iPad, and sometimes for no dang reason one or both of the speakers will lose the signal.  WTH Bose????  When they work it’s great but these things are higher maintenance and super temperamental.  Probably going to return.  Sad."
"The sound is great.  Just what would expect from Bose.  However, the charge runs down too fast- not like they advertise.  And yes- it is charged properly.  You would hope that for the money paid you could use it for at least a 6 hour work shift before having to re-charge it."
It was my go too for out in the garage.Great sound.Then it just stopped being able to connect to any device.
"I've purchased this and a JBL 5 Bluetooth speaker. I had the chance to compare them side by side. Bose has better sound quality; it's deep and authentic. On the other hand, the JBL is a little louder, but it doesn't offer the same sound quality. It's not as immersive as Bose. However, I returned it because mine had Bluetooth connection issues. It had trouble connecting, with the Bluetooth not working properly. There were pairing and connection issues; it kept breaking up and such.Overall, Bose has superior sound quality, but be aware of the potential Bluetooth problems that may accompany it."
"We love these Bose speakers BUT they are SO hard to connect. When we got it, we easily connected one phone. Yay. But then, traveling, we used that same phone to connect to a different Bose speaker. When we got home, nothing would make the original phone connect again to this speaker. So frustrating."
