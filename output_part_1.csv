"Okay, so full disclosure.  I'm a computer repair technician and I bought the base model (Ryzen 3 w/4GB of RAM and a 120GB SSD).  As a technician (meaning someone who can upgrade and repair computers), I'd give this a 3.5/5.  As an end user however, I really don't know who this is supposed to be made for.  It's woefully underpowered and comes with a crippled OS.  If you don't mind those things then there are a lot of cheaper options.  If you DO mind those things then I hope you know what you're doing because it's going to take a LOT of time and effort to get this thing usable.First off, S mode.  It's basically a Chromebook in S mode.  Again, you can get a Chromebook (or even another S mode device) for much cheaper than this so I don't know why you'd choose this one.  Putting that aside however, most people say that you can just get out of S mode and you'll have a normal computer, right?  Well, in THEORY that's true.  In practice however, Windows 10S likes to randomly and inexplicably revert to S mode without warning.  As a technician I see these S mode computers all the time that have reverted back to S mode with no way to go back to Windows 10 Home except to do a complete wipe and reload of the OS.  If you want to PERMANENTLY get out of S Mode, you have to get out of S mode, then download a copy of Windows 10 from the Microsoft website and make a USB flash drive with Windows 10.  Then you have to open up the flash drive, go into the Sources folder and add an ei.cfg file with the following parameters:[EditionID]Home[Channel]RetailOnce you do that you can boot from the flash drive, erase the drive, and install Windows 10 Home from scratch.  If you don't add the ei.cfg file it will just reinstall Windows 10S again.  This is not something a normal end user would be able to do, but it's necessary if you want to be able to feel secure that the thing isn't going to just randomly revert back to S mode and become unusable.Secondly, the specs.  4GB of RAM and a 120GB SSD?  Seriously, Acer?  The last time 4GB of RAM was standard on laptops was like 2012.  I could see if this were a $150 computer, but at $366 it should have at LEAST 8GB of RAM and a 250GB SSD.  I upgraded mine to 8GB of RAM, a 500GB NVMe SSD, and a 2TB 2.5"" hard drive.  It's been close to a decade since I've personally owned a computer with a hard drive but it's nice to have that ability.  I also appreciate the fact that they include the mounting hardware and even the screws in a separate bag.Third, the screen.  The screen is okay, but there's a major flaw that took me a while to figure out.  The screen will dim if you unplug the charger and run it on battery.  That's normal, right?  Well what's NOT normal is that AMD has a setting called ""Vari-Bright.""  If this is turned on and you unplug the computer, the display doesn't just dim but it also loses contrast/color.  It's hard to describe it but it looks like crap.  Unfortunately the AMD Radeon software doesn't get installed through Windows Update and it's not on Acer's website so you have to go directly to AMD in order to download it.  Unfortunately that also means that AMD is going to install the latest drivers on your device, which haven't been tested and certified compatible by Acer.  Chances are it will be fine, but it's always best to use the latest driver from the computer manufacturer (in this case, Acer) rather than going to the chip manufacturer.  There are a million and one potential compatibility problems with new drivers, which is why they need to be tested by the manufacturer, who may update other drivers to compensate.  This isn't possible if you want to turn off ""Vari-Bright"" because you're forced to install the latest drivers from AMD.The next problem is with the keyboard backlight.  It turns off after 30 seconds and it won't turn back on again if you move the mouse.  You MUST touch a key on the keyboard to turn it on again.  There's a setting in the BIOS to disable the keyboard backlight timeout, but it doesn't have any effect.  Speaking of which, this computer shipped with an older BIOS revision (1.10).  I upgraded to the latest BIOS revision (1.11) but it didn't fix the keyboard backlight timeout problem.  Looking online it seems that a LOT of people are having this problem and not only with this model of Acer.  Apparently, Acer doesn't care about this problem.  I almost want to return it for this reason, but I really need another computer so I guess I'll keep it.  If I hadn't been able to resolve the screen brightness problem this would have been going back.The final issue is the battery life.  If all you're doing is reading articles this MIGHT be able to get you 4 hours of battery life.  If you're watching videos or you have a lot of stuff open, you'll be lucky to get 2-3 hours.  I mean, all manufactures overestimate their battery life to make their products look good, but this laptop doesn't last much longer than my 10 year old HP.In conclusion, I stand by my initial statement.  I truly don't know who this computer is for.  If you add the cost of the base computer ($366), plus the 500GB SSD ($60), the RAM ($45), and the 2TB hard drive ($80), you're left with a total cost of $551, and there are a lot better computers out there at that price point.  There's an 11th gen i5 15"" HP laptop on here for $599 with over TWICE the processing power, a 250GB SSD, and 8GB of RAM.  It also has space for a secondary hard drive if you need to upgrade that in the future.  If you're okay with an underpowered laptop (4GB RAM, small SSD) with a crippled OS (Windows 10S) you can get one for $150 and save yourself $200.I mean, I wouldn't call this thing a ""nice"" laptop.  It only has a single USB 3 port (the other two, including the one on the RIGHT side are USB 2.0 - that's right, a technology that debut in April of 2000 which means it's even older than Windows XP!).  It feels cheap/flimsy.  Battery life is mediocre.  It's basically a disposable laptop at a non-disposable price.  If this laptop was $150 - $200 I wouldn't be so critical of it, but whether you're looking for a cheap Chromebook type laptop or you want a real laptop that you can upgrade yourself, you can do so much better by going with something else.  I'm only keeping it because I've put so much time and effort into it and it's easier than returning it and starting over.The only person I can see that this would be suited for would be someone with a very limited budget that wants to be able to upgrade it over time vs. spending the $550 upfront.  But if they knew how to do all this computer stuff, chances are they'd have a better income and therefore a higher budget.  Maybe a student or someone just entering the workforce?  I dunno.I must say though, I'm really liking having a secondary drive in a laptop again.  It helps if I need to wipe it out because I don't have to worry about backing up the data since it's on the second hard drive.  But again, there are other computers with this capability.  If you can afford it, the $599 HP with the 11th gen i5 is a great buy.  I haven't personally purchased that computer but after doing all this, I wish I had."
"So here's the thing -- I love the Acer Aspire 5. So much so that whenever it inevitably ends up with a critical failure of some kind within 1-2 years I just buy another one because I love it that much. So I've had this same laptop, just replaced every couple years, for like... 5, 6 years or so. It was time to replace my old one so I went to the order detail page which states ""Purchased x amount of times"" to reorder the Acer Aspire 5. Amazon is out of them I guess so it went through a third party. Which is totally fine, I don't have anything against third parties, I actually like going through them for refurbished/renewed products since you save a lot and the performance is usually almost as good as something new.I'm not sure what I got today. It SAYS Acer Aspire 5. But as stated before I have been using this laptop for a good 6 years or so now and this is definitely not the same one. Now -- not a HUGE deal. I'm a fan of this one. Not more than my precious Aspire 5 (legitimate). The Acer Aspire 5 (possibly newer model? idk?) is nothing to shake a stick at, though. It's got pretty good performance. Though not really what I was looking forward to. My Aspire 5 (legitimate) was quick as lightning, over and over, I rarely had to wait more than 2 seconds for something to respond. However, this Aspire 5 is occasionally getting hang-ups -- I've counted a few times now where I've had to wait 5-6 seconds for a button to respond, and I just got the computer this afternoon. Web pages are kind of slow to load despite being on very decent wifi (I work in a hotel building so wifi is never slow here). The chassis is a little strange, not anything like my old Aspire 5s, where they were nice and slim like the picture, this is more boxy and utilitarian. Sort of the thing you'd expect a middle-aged businessperson to be using because they don't really care about the aesthetics. Not ugly, just not the slim and beautiful Aspire 5 I'm used to (although one of my favorite things about the Aspire 5 is its beautiful sparkly cover and this Aspire 5 does have that! Which is nice).I like the keyboard a lot. Buttons are very responsive and don't clack but also aren't absent of all resistance. Right in the middle, which is very satisfying. No backlight however which I believe the other Aspire 5s had if I'm remembering correctly. Not a huge deal but I do love a good backlight so it was a bit disappointing.So... honestly, mixed bag. I do wish it had been my Aspire 5 that I'm used to. I don't know why it's not since I ordered from the exact product detail page I've been using for years. And I wish the performance was faster. It does feel refurbished whereas with refurbished products they almost always feel completely new. But you can tell this one is refurbished. Which isn't great. That being said, it's going to get the job done, and I don't hate it, or even dislike it... just wish it had been what I ordered, that's all.If you're on the fence, I'd say probably go for it unless you're beholden to the aesthetic. If that's the most important thing for you, I'd buy it new to hopefully make sure you get the right one. But if you're looking for performance and don't need it to run a billion programs or use it for online gaming 24/7 I think you'd probably like this one. It seems to mostly be an Aspire 5. Just off enough that it's noticeable and the performance does leave something to be desired. But as long as you're not asking too much of it and you're a little patient, it should be fine.EDIT: I have to take off another star, unfortunately. It has only been a few days since I received the computer and the charger has already stopped working optimally -- it doesn't charge anymore, just keeps the laptop on when it is plugged in but as soon as you take the charger out, the computer immediately shuts off. Disappointed with this purchase. Usually it takes months for problems like this to start appearing."
"This laptop has been pretty good for me as a new college student. It performs pretty well and can even handle playing some games good. However the one thing that has really bothered me about this laptop is how loud it gets. I hate opening it in class because even if I just open one tab on Google, the fan goes crazy. It's incredibly embarrassing at times to use in class because of how loud it gets. I sometimes end up just turning it off and doing the work at home because of how loud it is. I don't know if it's just mine, and it's not like I have programs running in the background or anything like that, this can happen anywhere from when I first open the laptop to sitting idly on a blank Google doc with nothing else opened, it doesn't matter. But it's just unbearable to deal with sometimes.Another comment I have is originally I was expecting to get the gray laptop as advertised in the pictures, but when it arrived it was a navy blue. I'm not complaining though, it's pretty.Overall though I think it's a pretty good laptop and it does everything I need it to do. For the price it's great, and i think this laptop really excels at home where you're not worried about the constant noise it creates. It's not incredibly powerful, and I sometimes wish I spent more money to get a better laptop, but It's good though 👍"
I got this laptop for my little sister. So far it’s been over a week and no problems have occurred. EXCEPT when you read the title you will see something called “S-MODE” OH MY GOSH. S-MODE IS A PRISON CELL. I could not figure out how to turn it off even tho it tells you and brings you to the app. The app wouldn’t load and microsoft store was being very annoying. I handed the laptop off to my brother and he said he went to the registry and took it off there. I forget some of the things that he told me did but yea he went INTO the laptops registry and was able to take it off there and he restarted  the computer and it was gone! now it runs fine but you wont be able to do much of heavy gaming which is what i bought for the laptop for in the first place! because it wouldn’t run any of the games i was trying i decided to use shadow. literally the best app to ever be created literally she can run anything from minecraft with high end shaders and loads of mods to sims 4 also packed with cc! so what im saying is if you buy this laptop to play games shadow is a GREAT thing to use it makes it so the laptop basically runs like a gaming pc. the games rarely lag unless she’s connected to our weaker internet! Which is why a ethernet cord would be so AMAZING if you are using shadow on the laptop
"I purchased this laptop on Amazon in July or August of 2020 for use as a student laptop. I upgraded the RAM (as suggested by others) to 12gb immediately after purchase. Approximately two years into owning it is when the hardware slowly began to fail. As of December 2024, the built in camera, the speakers, and the built in keyboard have all stopped working with no success on various solutions relating to potential driver issues, etc. All of these had to be replaced with external hardware. Additionally, the laptop experiences a blue screen crash about once every two months. The screen still looks great. Overall, the laptop performed adequately the first two years but the questionable build quality leaves concern for future Acer products."
"Overall this laptop is fine. Mid. 5/10. I'm glad I didn't have to break the bank to buy it BUT it's thicker than I expected and feels clunky, there is no way to log-in with facial identification or fingerprint authorization, and it does NOT have a backlit keyboard even though it says at the top of the product page that it's one of the special features of this product. Later on in the product description it DOES say that there isn't a backlit keyboard, but why would they say that it does at the top of the page???"
"I wanted an affordable laptop that didn’t have a ton of bells and whistles that was at a good price point. I settled on this one after looking at reviews and once I got it started up I quickly realized that in order to download whatever apps you wanted onto it that were not Microsoft apps, you have to switch the computer out of S mode. I’m not a super techy person and I didn’t even know what S mode was, but I quickly googled it and realized that it is a freaking pain in the butt To switch out of. Microsoft makes it next to impossible to do this. After searching several online forums and trying multiple things that people suggested I finally was able to switch out of this mode and have the ability to download whatever apps I want. For example, the cricut app and chrome browser app cannot be downloaded while in s mode. All the time I spent trying to get out of S mode took probably three total hours. In my opinion this is an insanely stupid feature and had I known this computer came ith S mode or even what it was For that matter, I probably would’ve gone with a different one. However, aside from that I think the computer is great so far. I have had no issues."
"Pros: large screen size, compatibility with most accessories, light weight, battery life, low priceCons: slow processing, takes long time to turn on, open application, even slows down the internet (all other devices in our home have fast internet access, except this computer)."
I operated for 3-4 days. Overall did not find any problem but battery performance is not as what is described and specified. This is one of the major drawback. After full charging just last for around four hours and that too worked only on word and Excel. No gaming or no any other activities
"Overall, very disappointed in this purchase. I should have done more diligence, and read more reviews on YouTube and other sites before buying this particular model laptop (the A 315 24P in the 7320U configuration). It's slow, sometimes freezes up with basic programs, and you can't upgrade RAM, which really hurts. Very misleading descriptions and advertising for this product. There are several similar model options, be very careful when comparing.Pros: Cheap, which is the big selling point here. Easy initial setup, boots quickly, lightweight, display quality is not horrible, decent battery life.Cons: It's slow...like really slow. I get stuck waiting to click on internet links, navigating back and forth between pages, and when using software programs...waiting for the computer to respond, and occasionally having to reboot. This is with plenty of space on the hard drive, also. The fact that you can't upgrade the RAM is really frustrating,the 8gb dual chips are soldered on, no way to change or upgrade.There is no backlit keyboardor touchscreen toggling, despite what the Amazon descriptions might lead you to believe. Sound quality from the onboard (tiny) speakers is horrible, even with my very low expectations for that. Super ""tinny"" and low volume.Overall, very disappointed. Make sure you read eveything very carefully before purchasing, and research the exact model elsewhere besides Amazon before buying."
The keyboard was NOT backlit as advertised.I was satisfied with everything else I was looking for per the advertised specifications.
"I'd like to start off by saying for those that say this device has excellent RGB color output, please and I mean please GET YOUR EYES CHECKED! We as humans can distinguish colors from a pretty young age, so when I saw the orange coloring of everything that was supposed to be red, I figured I might've gotten a dud, a bad apple if you will. Then when I received the replacement, I was shocked to see this brand new ""ISP"" display still had the same color inaccuracy the first one had. Now my previous computer was the Acer Aspire E15, the predecessor to this descendent of the new Aspire series. I compared the two to see If I was really being that picky in terms of color sensitivity, and the results were shocking. Not only does this display have a hard time correctly showing red, but it lacked the ability to show the vibrancy of green, purple, and even pink. Now those are colors that didn't automatically come to my attention, but it was interesting to know the amount of dullness these screens have in comparison to older budget models. Now for those that argue that this is a budget computer, the computer's ability to display color accuracy (Standard colors like BLUE, RED, and GREEN) is something that should at least be set for the general QUALITY of the display. My previous computer, also a budget laptop and an Acer Aspire (see above) had substantial vibrancy in the RGB output. The colors are saturated and the best part is I KNOW WHAT THEY ARE. For those that want to test the color accuracy of their screens (correctly) Find a Windows 10 computer or any monitor..pull up ""Choose your accent color"" scroll down and see the color pallet and ""Custom Colors""...compare those colors to the ones on this laptop, or plug an HDMI cable to another monitor or TV, if the color or the reds are Orange in comparison to what is on your monitor or laptop, you'll know my struggle. Again this is not an issue of colors being a different shade (reds being lighter or darker) this is the inability for the correct color to show up entirely. Now if you're not color sensitive, like I am, and don't expect this ""IPS"" screen to have color accuracy like I did, then this laptop is the perfect machine for you! Functionality wise, I do see the necessary need for the RAM upgrade if needed for anything other than streaming 1080P videos on Youtube. It can be an excellent tool for school, or work (other Photography or media use).  A quick note for Acer: Downgrading elements for functionality and available features are necessary for ""budget"" laptops, but you've taken an ""ISP"" feature and provided an sRGB output and color accuracy that is no better than an Aliexpress laptop! What good is the ISP definition if the colors don't correctly display? ....Also there are no CAP LOCK/NUM LOCK notifications, but turn on the Sticky keys sounds and you'll be fine."
The audio and brightness isn't great & it's quite slow like it was used or refurbished
"I bought three of these computers and two of them were delivered without an operating system. That is the message you get, there isn't a product key. The little paper you get on the top of the laptop says that if you have issues to contact Acer directly before calling amazon but i wouldn't waste your time. They told me that i could wait a week so they can verify my purchase although i had given them the serial number off of the laptop or i could call amazon and get a replacement. After getting off of the phone with Acer I called amazon, that wasn't that much better. I did get a replacement however I was charged another $377 or something for a new laptop until i returned the other one. the third laptop was purchased on her account, this is where the second laptop without an operating system came from. Before my wife's laptop arrived it wasn't shipped out until about 4 days after purchasing it. she called before they shipped it out and asked why she hadn't gotten an email about it shipping and they said they had a lot of orders which is believable. about a day or two later she got an email stating it shipped but we never received it so about a week went by and she called again. they told her that it had gotten lost in the mail and they were shipping a new one. Five days later a here it is, a laptop without an operating system. So of course the wife calls for the third time and they said that they will arrange that UPS comes out and picks up the package BUT they can not ship her a new one because they are coming from a different vendor now? I'm assuming its because when we purchased them they were $364 and now they are $385 so amazon doesn't want to eat the extra cost. This is the third order amazon has messed up for us in 2 months so we are just going to start paying a little extra at local businesses.As for the laptop, I think it's a good laptop for anyone that needs a better than budget laptop for a budget price. If you leave all the programs on it like microsoft edge instead of google chrome it runs great. it can multi function well. its a little sluggish if you are used to fast computers at work or something then you use this for home browsing, you will definitely notice the difference. I would tell someone that this is a good product if you don't run into the same issues i did. It's just not worth my time to have to call them and ship items back since the 3rd laptop is the second one I am sending back and not even getting a replacement."
"A year and a half ago on Prime Day I picked up the Acer Aspire E 15. Wiped the storage and installed Linux. All was well with the world. When holiday time came six months later to get a laptop for a family member I seem to recall Amazon pointing me to this model as the newer version. I had to spend the better part of a day getting the Windows 10 rolled out, saying 'no' to its various information and identity harvesting options. Then I had to disable 'S Mode', a Microsoft ""security"" implementation which prevents you from installing any non-Microsoft browser or search engine. Or any other software that didn't funnel through the Microsoft Store monopoly.With everyone was working and schooling from home due to covid, a shared laptop was problematic so I just did a repeat order of this affordable model, the Aspire 5. I was already aware that storage was in short supply, with only a 128 GB SSD in place (about enough to hold Windows, Office, and breathing room).And unlike the Aspire E 15, this model didn't include an optical drive (spun by marketers as ""it's a benefit, it's super slim!""). But since my wife uses more storage than the kid, I figured her Christmas gifts would include both this laptop and a large SD card to compensate for the shortcomings of this model. This was when we discovered that this model includes no SD card slot. Instant buyer's remorse.I'd already planned on spending a bit more to replace the internal SSD with a 512 GB or 1 TB to prevent the problems that come from installs defaulting to a barely existent C: drive, leaving 0 MB of space on your system drive.Already knowing what her gift was going to be, my wife bought an external DVD drive for around $20 to compensate for what this model doesn't have. And external storage, since this has no internal hard drive for user storage. But having to add on an external SD card reader as well to manage photos from her camera is, as they say, just a bridge too far. Having to compensate by adding all these components after market is turning this thing into a Frankenstein.I like Acer. Unlike the HP laptops I've had, this model and the 15 don't have issues with overheating. As performance goes, this is fine for typical home use but as you would expect, this would not be appropriate for gamers. With the limited number of USB ports, and components no longer included that need to be added on, you could probably expect also to have to buy a USB hub if you ever anticipate using an external keyboard or mouse. But your best bet is probably to just spend a little more and get a different model."
This is literally the most frustrating laptops I’ve ever owned in my life (at age 41). I regularly have to turn the laptop off because it won’t wake up from when it goes into sleep mode. I’ve set up all of the suggestions to stop this from happening and I’ve also tried all of the tricks to get it to wake up. I’ll likely replace this within the next couple of years simply because it is not dependable. This is the first time I gave Acer a try and I hate that this has been so disappointing. Otherwise it works like a dream!
"I liked the big screen and it seemed to be fast, but I could not get it to get on the internet via WIFI.I searched and searched the internet for ideas (tried them all). I logged into ACER for help. Nothing, nada. I tried every trick - No luckThe package was taped and in a UPS box, Don't know if it had been opened before."
"This laptop was at the top of my list as far as cost and processing speed, but there seem to be a lot more things to be irritated about than excited about.1. No CD-ROM/DVD-ROM. I have no idea how I missed this. I went to install my printer software and realized there is no drive to do this. I thought it was so common-place that I never even considered a laptop being sold without one. How very bizarre. This means no DVD burning capabilities, no installing a game disc, nothing. Wow. Now maybe I'm old-fashioned since many things are done digitally now, but geez. My bad on not paying attention to the product description. I always back up my photography to disc, ALWAYS. nope, can't with this laptop. Fixed by spending $50 more to buy a used external drive.2. Why do modern laptops use one single mousepad for right-click, left-click, and moving the cursor? I can't tell you how frustrating that was. I can only use this laptop with an outside USB mouse, otherwise, I would be pulling my hair out every time I touch the thing. I attempted to adjust the sensitivity but with no way of feeling a right or left click, you end up clicking somewhere in the middle half the time.3. The sound on this thing is terrible. I had to buy a USB speaker so I can even hear some stuff. Speakers on the bottom of the laptop, wow. You can cup the sound to try to hear what you are listening to. What a joke. Speakers I bought were also crap so spent at least $40 trying to get audible sound for this laptop.I would rather a laptop be slightly bulkier for better features. I feel that I downgraded from my previous laptop that is at least 5 years older. My last laptop had a larger screen, a mousepad that had separate buttons for right and left click, sound I could hear, AND a DVD-ROM. Wow.Why I gave it two stars? The processing speed is ok. Still, it is no better or worse than any other new computer or laptop I have ever bought, it is just less bogged down with junk when it is new. I almost thought about returning it numerous times, but it sucks to have to delete everything and start fresh again on a new system. I also think there is a restocking fee since it isn't technically broken. Too bad because I would pay more for a system that was more functional. Since I bought the speaker and have the mouse, at least I fixed two of the issues on my own.Hell no to playing video games. I tried playing Cloudpunk on Steam and it lagged so bad I gave up. Sure, you can play games, just not higher quality ones.Lastly because I just can't stop. Why does my backspace key make a weird high-pitched sound? Weird. I do NOT recommend this product and would not buy it again.Edit: Now my ""L"" key isn't functioning properly and I have to hit it harder or twice to get it to work. This is by far the cheapest laptop I have ever owned, and I'm very disappointed with it. Saving money did NOT work out this time. I am still a student so use my laptop quite frequently. This will surely agitate and slow me down and now I'm wishing I had paid more for a better laptop. It hasn't even been a year of ownership.. BUYER BEWARE!Second edit: less than two years after purchase.. I didn’t expect to need to update this again, but now my battery is dead and it barely held a charge for most of its life. I knocked it down to one star. I have an older laptop that still holds charge and the battery still works. The quality of this product is very poor. Still one of my biggest regrets since laptops are extremely useful for school and I’m not finished yet. Do I buy a new battery and suck it up? This laptop will cost $500+ by the time I’m done buying new parts, and still will have issues. I sure wish companies would build quality products made to last… made to last at least 5 years."
"This is a great laptop, it’s not slow and does everything i need it to do. The sound is low, but audio boosters easily solve that problem. Everything was going great until my touchscreen stopped responding. The first time i happened i panicked but just restarted my computer and it was fine. I don’t have a huge need for the touchscreen so i haven’t used it in a week or so. Now i try to use it again and its not responding- even after restarting. Tried trouble shooting and there is not even an option for touchscreen under the human interfaces devices tab. This is mot a huge loss to me- but i also want what i paid for."
"wanted to return this item, but missed the deadline by day. Because of the 10 keypad feature on the right side, the central keyboard is offset to the left, making laptop use awkward for your hands plus the volume button is way up at the left as opposed to down towards the right as I used to.  If you want a simple computer, this is not the one for you"
"I didn't realize S-Mode meant anything at all until I bought this and couldn't get out of it.  If you are buying for someone that you don't trust with computers and they really only need apps from the Microsoft Store, great. But I needed to use other software, which meant I needed out of S-Mode, and following the instructions it gives you did NOT work, which I quickly learned is common. As other reviews I didn't notice until too late alluded to, absolute nightmare to get out of.  Once I finally got out, its a perfectly good inexpensive laptop."
"I had this laptop for about 4 years now and I slowly started noticing problems with it. First thing I noticed was the battery didn't last long enough I had to charge it after 45 mins of use, just 1 year in with it. Secondly, it was becoming slow and yes, I do keep up with updates at all times. I rarely use it unless I'm applying for jobs or use the search engine to something important. So not so long after that my charger was not charging due to the core having some type of internal wire damage (not sure how that happened) when I don't tie it up. I had very high expectations but nevertheless I didn't give up on it. I do like how light and thin it is, the HD feature is really nice and looks crystal clear. The keyboard lights up so nice! At the end of the day, it does what it needs to do, I just wish it didn't have these problems when I barely use it."
"I bought this laptop because it was cheap, yet many reviewers still raved about the quality, especially after a couple hardware upgrades (RAM & memory), which I also upgraded. Well, lesson learned: Don't cheap out when buying something so important that will be with you for years to come.While this laptop isn't too bad per say, there are just too many little nuisances that make it annoying to use. The main problem is the laptop's lack of precision. Certain keys don't register unless your really press them, and the trackpad is temperamental. Often times I'll click the trackpad and it will register a right click for no real reason. I can only assume my fingertips are wide and trick it into thinking I hit the pad with two fingers, which equals a right click. (Note: I don't have fat fingers, I'm just a big guy (6'1"").) When opening a new tab on the browser it will more often than not seamlessly drag the tab into new window, which is super annoying. If I'm browsing the net and not paying too close attention, the next thing I know I have four different browser windows open with multiple tabs in each one, which makes it very confusing and frustrating. Also, lately Youtube has been pausing for no reason.In sum: serviceable laptop, but far from great. If you are looking for a decent cheap computer, this will suffice. However, if you have the money, just get something more top of the line. If you do get this computer, I would recommend upgrading the memory on your own as it's easy to do and the laptop as is needs more memory, but I wouldn't bother with the RAM unless you're really going to push this thing. I upgraded the RAM and honestly couldn't see a big difference between the upgrade and the factory setting. That said I mostly use this for writing, surfing, and watching Youtube, so if you're using this to game or something, more RAM may benefit you. The conservative user probably doesn't need more RAM."
"Got this for school.  It runs Office, Chrome and websites for school without issue.  If you want a gaming laptop, this isn't for you.  If you want to write papers, watch Youtube, do college crap this will work for $300.  OH you can't upgrade the RAM on this thing, so that knocks off 1 star.  If they let you upgrade the memory this would be a 5 star review.  You can upgrade the SSD however."
"This laptop lasted me about 3.5 years. As soon as I purchased it, I realized that the sound was very quiet, so I have to use speakers or headphones. The touch pad stopped working after 3.5 years and I have to use a mouse. I haven't had any other significant issues."
This is my major complaint and it's important for many others to know that this has nowhere to plug in a ethernet.
Had to change settings to get Google chrome and other apps.
So I would like to express that my issue could be an isolated incident or mabey just something that happens as part of production. Nothing is perfect all the time …. However my laptop would get very hot at the bottom and at first it would just shut off and come right back on ? Very annoying trust me I know I would be in the middle of a serious school project and it would just shut off NO WARNING ! Then it got so bad it wouldn’t even let me in the computer ACER is a known brand ( yes ) but if can spend more money don’t be cheap can cost you like waiting a extra two weeks becuase you have to send there mistake back to them and the only thing for your waste of excitement and time you get in return is ( FREE SHIPPING )
"I would not recommend buying this.  I purchased in March 2020 to prepare for working remotely.  Everything was fine- it all worked as it should.  Now the built-in camera has stopped functioning properly.  It looks like it is working but there is only a black screen in the image window- for both camera and video.  On zoom calls, it looks like the video is working but there is nothing but a black screen. Open up the camera using the camera app- same thing.  Updating driver shows that the current driver is installed.  Resetting the app does nothing. Resetting privacy settings does nothing. Troubleshooting does nothing- all diagnostics indicate that everything is ""working properly"", no issues. One day it worked fine.  The next day it did not.  Searches on both the Acer community forum on their website and google in general show multiple users all reporting the same exact problem- and following all of the same steps, with absolutely no resolution. Chatting with Acer technical support- the best they can offer is ""try a factory reset"" and if that doesn't work, send it in for repair.  Which of course is impossible because the laptop is now my office for work since my company is still working remotely for the foreseeable future. So in order to send this one in to be repaired, I would need to buy a new one anyway in order to keep my job.  I've had multiple laptops over the years- HP, Asus, samsung-  all worked for years.  This is the first (and hopefully only time) that I've had one stop functioning in less than 4 months after purchase- with no viable resolution offered by the company.**EDIT-  Factory Reset fixed nothing and just made re-setting up everything that was removed a pain in the butt.  Camera is still non-functional.  Acer tech support and customer support useless.  No solution offered other than sending the laptop that I rely on every day in for repair- despite the fact that you can easily google and find the same issue reported by multiple users going back to at least 2018.  Support rep that I spoke to the second time claimed that on their system, they don't show that there are any reported issues with the Aspire 5.  SMH. Worst customer service ever.  And I'll never purchase Acer again.If I could make the rating no stars, I would . Not only did the build-in camera stop working with no apparent solution, a plug & play webcam won't work either.  Uninstall the built-in webcam and it aumotically reinstalls itself.  The P&P webcam works fine on a $200 5 yr old laptop that my 8 yr old has tortured- but won't work on this 9 month old laptop.  Whatever is causing the problem with the built-in camera (that Acer claims isn't a recognized or persistent problem on its machines despite pages of forum posts )  prevents any other camera from working as well.Edit #2-  finally gave up in the constant fiddling necessary to use this laptop. Plug & play camera I bought when the built in camera stopped functioning only works part of the time because the laptop won't recognize its plugged in.  Wifi drops without any cause (only happens on the laptop). Speaker quality has degraded to the point where I have to use headphones or a speaker to hear anything. External areas of the laptop are coming apart. Two weeks ago it wouldn't boot up- then it did and seemed fine. A few days later, opening anything took forever- browser windows, internal functions, couldn't get the shutdown menu to pop up.  Happened again two days ago. I gave up and drove to best buy to buy a lenovo. Within 15 minutes of turning on the new laptop, I realized just how terrible the Acer has overall functioned from day one.  I don't need high-end functionality- not a gamer, not a graphic designer, not running a business. I've had a number of computers from desktop to laptop that have lasted for years. This Acer was barely functional for web browsing and email.  Forget using it to stream any shows/movies/music."
"Not a bad laptop,Just an extremely short battery life"
"I purchased this laptop in late February. Everything was fine and worked as expected. After about one month, I noticed the unit was not charging. The issue is a very poor connection from the charger to the laptop. Once you see the icon that the laptop is in fact charging,do not touch it! Do not bump the cable, the laptop, or whatever tabletop it may be sitting on. The slightest little touch breaks the connection from the charger to the laptop and the charging stops. That’s the first issue.The second issue, the fan motor is loud. As with the power connection, this issue developed after the first month or two.For these two reasons, I rate this laptop with a subpar three stars."
"Decent machine.  Boots up a little slow but then again I am comparing it to my laptop at work.  Sound is a little low, could be because of the placement of the speakers.  Good speed when surfing the web."
This is a frustrating laptop.  I know it is a lower price point but I don't ask it to do much.  It is super slow doing any web browsing.  It randomly freezes for extended periods and it also loses its ability to connect to an outside monitor.  I have a much older acer e5 which is great so i thought this one would be at least ok.  I am writing this review while waiting for this laptop to reboot.  I would give 1 star but it is priced accordingly.
"I'm sorry, I'm going to have to demerit the ratings a bit.  I purchased three of these PC Laptops for my clinic (external use; not for patient data).  It took me TWO HOURS to set them up.  I put all three on the countertop and just went from one to the other. This is what I always do.  There's always irritation to work around with setting up computers but these were the worst ones yet.  You have to ensure you don't connect them to the internet during setup because if you do ... YOU MUST ABSOLUTELY sign in with your Microsoft account (or create another one).  They have completely removed the ""create local account"" (the traditional way to log in).  If you entered your wireless network info, you have to (a) unplug your modem and (b) restart the computer and start the set-up all over again because there is no way to ""back up"" to the network entry section.  So terrible.  Because they removed the option to choose a local account, their reasoning for this is simply to control you and your computing experience.  For personal use, this may be okay.  For corporate use, not a chance!  The security problems are incredible with this setup.  You're going to get sued!  So -- after this ordeal, windows is set up.  First thing I ALWAYS do is install Google Chrome and then make it default.  Well, MS made that practically impossible too!  There's now a standard ""Windows S Mode Edition.""  This is purportedly to prevent you from installing unauthorized content to save your computer.  This is nonsense.  It's a way to ensure everyone uses their crappy MS Edge browser.  Their browser always sucked.  Their browser currently sucks.  Their browser will always suck.  That's why people get rid of it.  But they force you to use it.  You have to now download some app that turns MS S Mode off (that MS makes and publishes).  That would be fine, but now Windows uses a digital copy instead of a key and the digital license ... you guessed it ... could not be verified.  Yep, several restarts, updates, and other bologna and finally I was able to install the S Mode bypass so that I could download Chrome.  Then there's the bloatware.  There is so much packaged into windows that bloats it!  I don't want my employees to play any number of games or waste time on unproductive processes.I have yet to really dive in to the computer but superficially, it looks fine."
"Great laptop for several years until abruptly it wouldn't start. Blue and orange lights flashed in a pattern that apparently no one has deciphered. Occasionally it would boot and I would frantically upgrade drivers, BIOS, etc. But when I needed to reboot it was almost impossible to get it to start again. Hardware was replaced, Google (and Bing!) consulted but it was not to be. This isn't an uncommon Acer condition, either- read about it. Anyway, I take daily backups so I said goodbye to Acer, bought a Dell, and restored my system to a new, hopefully more reliable laptop."
"By itself, this is an excellent device.  However, due to terrible support and shady practices, it's been wildly cheapened by Acer.1. Acer installed their own adware on my device without my knowledge or consent.  Worse, they created unchangeable notification settings, buried the installation files in a hidden directory, abused the character limit to hide it from the program removal tool; either hid it from the registry with deceptive location and naming, or used a scheduled executable and won't provide the information necessary to determine whether simply deleting the files is safe.2. People who have deleted the files are reporting either a failure to completely remove [meaning the files bounced back] or breaks caused by the removal of the files.  These breaks include loss of data, boot looping, massive decrease in system performance, and registry errors.3. Acer has provided no tool for removing their bloatware.  One must blindly trust a third party tool for the ""safe"" removal of the software.4. The tech support doesn't know how to remove the software, instead redirecting me to other resources that either don't address this specific issue directly or don't provide a solution.  Windows cannot detect and remove software that has a name longer than 60 characters in the registry.  The removal must be performed through the registry.  Because the identify of these files in the registry is not published, it would take hours - days to find and remove the software via the registry.  This method could result in the aforementioned breaks, especially if done incorrectly.  For example, an accidental removal of a vital system file could occur.5. After waiting well over half an hour in their support queue, being as how I got in before they closed for business, the support team left for the day while I was STILL waiting for support.  The chat support agent doesn't open after hours.  I have a screenshot of the agent being open, meaning I made it in time for support.  They simply didn't care and left anyway.I bought this machine for work and have to deal with interruptions because of this adware.  I haven't owned this device for even two whole months yet.  This wasn't an issue until this week, when the adware went active.  During some automatic system update, this was enabled.  After the last automatic system update from last month (March 25, 2020), I took advantage of my Windows Pro privileges, looked up the proper way to disable automatic system updates, and then promptly did so [this cannot be done through normal Windows system settings without setting up a metered connection, which I'm unable to do because I telecommute for work and it would interfere with the systems in place with my employer].The hardware is EXCELLENT for the price, however, the experience with Acer is a NIGHTMARE.  I won't suggest missing this device.  Buy it, buy and install Windows 10 Pro, find out how to turn off automatic system updates via the Group Policy Editor, disable automatic updates there and in system settings [to be safe] AS SOON AS it this laptop boots for the first time, buy and install your [secondary] 2.5 inch SSD / HDD / hybrid drive, and buy and install your RAM upgrades [up to 32 GB supported].  If you do that, you'll have a wonderful experience with this device.  If you make the mistake of trusting Acer not to compromise your system through updates after you purchase, you'll have a pretty bad experience trying to fix what they sneakily do to it.  Once you're loaded with dozens of GB of data, it's not nearly so easy to just start over.This rating is justified by this company policy.  The company did this to my laptop.  Before they did that, I would have rated it five stars."
"At first I was so excited to receive this laptop due to the massive amount of amazing reviews, however upon receiving this laptop I had already noticed some not great things.If you like big laptops this is definitely the one for you! I’m personally not a big fan of the size, it also wasn’t very slim. It was extremely difficult to fit in my laptop bag even though the bag was made for a 20 inch laptop such as this one. It’s very bulky in my opinion. When I turned it on it was already having issues. The noise from the fans is INSANE!!! If you want a quiet laptop for school I do not recommend this at all. It was super noisy. The other issue I had is that the computer was CONSTANTLY using half of the ram and due to the computer having 8gb of ram, that only left 4gb for anything else you need to do. Opening up browsers or really anything was super slow. It wasn’t easy to use at all. I ended up factory resetting it twice and it helped a little bit but not much. Pretty much the only thing that was good about this laptop was the keyboard. It was pretty nice and had a quiet sound. The laptops condition wasn’t great when I got it either. It had scratches in some areas. I ended up buying a refurbished dell laptop and it worked so much better.If you want to try this out for yourself go ahead, but I personally did not enjoy a second of the headache this laptop caused me. Returning wasn’t easy either and I found out this store is a third party store so the only way to return it is to print out the shipping label and wait for UPS to come by your house. You aren’t really given a time they will be there either and they definitely aren’t willing to work with you on it. So be prepared to stay home all day.On a good note it did come early!Edit: Forgot to mention, the computer comes on something called “S Mode” it basically blocks anything and everything that isn’t Microsoft based. So fun right!! No, I found a way to turn “S Mode” off but it’s a headache. I don’t recommend this laptop at all…"
"I've had this laptop for maybe 2 months, and it's been a constant problem. Not only this one, but the same model that I bought a relative has been acting up in the exact same ways.Is it Windows? It is Acer? I don't know, but it's absolutely ridiculous.What's happening: Refuses to stay in Sleep, and if you check the battery usage - it shows that it just had the screen off and was not actually sleeping. So, I've been manually putting the thing into sleep, only to see that little blue light turn back on again later - and once again the darn thing isn't sleeping.Plus, sometimes it'll get stuck with Screen Off - but Computer Awake, and you can't get the darned thing to turn on the screen until you put a paper clip through the hole in the bottom to disconnect the battery from the computer to force a complete restart.Oh, and DO NOT place this in the cushioned bag that came with it. Because these things keep turning on no matter how you tweak the settings, these things will heat up and threaten to burn up. The only time I placed mine in the protective case, I came back an hour later to find my computer smelling like hot plastic.If this is what Acer is now, or maybe if this is what Windows is now since this is the new Windows, I don't want it.I'm going to save up for a Mac."
"I don't think this laptop is going to last me long.  I bought this to replace an old Dell Latitude, and I have mixed feelings.  When it works, it's great.  But the plastic frame is super flimsy and easily broken, particularly around the power cable connection.  I think the plastic around the hole was cracked within a few weeks, and now I have a big crack running all the way to the Esc key in the top left.  I had this problem with an old HP laptop, and after a couple of years it was just crunchy with cracks, and I think this one is going the same direction.  Even sitting with it on my lap, I can see the plastic flex and the crack widen and narrow depending on how I'm holding it.Performance wise it is good 90% of the time.  I can play a lot of the sidescroller Steam games, like Salt & Sanctuary and Child of Light.  But it is prone to odd slowdowns every now and then.  Which is really frustrating since I upgraded the RAM to 16 GB.  I still haven't figured out why it has these slowdowns, but it seems to be related to the power cable. For example, if it becomes unplugged while gaming, the performance crashes instantly.  And since the plastic around the power cable port is cracking and breaking, it's not always a snug fit to know if the power cable is connected in such a way that it is actually feeding power to the device.  Being unable to charge the laptop without pushing the power cable in just so is what ultimately led me to junk my old HP, so I'm sad to be reliving the same silly defect 15 years later.Anyway, I'll use this until it is impossible to do so, but I'm also thinking I should have stuck with the Latitude series from Dell since they build more robust laptops.  If you plan on leaving this on your desk, it's probably a good deal.  but if you plan to use this on your lap and take it with you places, it's probably not hardy enough for that life."
"So I ordered this Acer and I ordered a Asus to compare. Both about the same price and both in windows S-mode.  I'm only commenting on 2 things.  Between the Asus & Acer, setting up the thing was less stressful with the Asus with far less questions and monopoly from Microsoft.  Setting up the Acer took much longer and was forced to set up with a Microsoft account which can be changed later.  2nd thing, going through the process to get OUT of S-mode/Microsoft control was much easier on the Asus then the Acer. I'm not going to lie it was bordering brutal to get out of the S-mode on this Acer. And a comment on my favorite feature which is why I wanted to compare the Asus v/s the Acer was for the backlit keyboard on these cheaper laptops.  Again the Asus tops the Acer. The Asus backlit keyboard stays on longer, comes on if you tap the touchpad or move the mouse if you use a mouse.  The Acer (this Model) goes off quick and will not come on if you touch the touchpad, will not come on if you move the mouse and this model does not have a setting to set preferences for the keyboard timeout. So for me YES I would order the Asus again but would not order the Acer again. Oh and for anyone wondering about speaker volume? Both the Asus and the Acer were horrible! turn the sound up to 100 and couldn't hear either one of them. Had to plug in extra speakers for both!"
"I got this laptop as mostly just something to use to take online courses and browse the internet, with hopes of being able to play a few less power-hungry video games. It handles some games ok, such as League of Legends. However, the cpu is very poorly cooled. Although I believe it has a boost clock of 4.3GHz, good luck maintaining that as it starts to thermal throttle within a few minutes. I also couldn't find any information on whether or not this laptop had upgrable RAM slots prior to purchasing; it does NOT. However, previous versions did, which is why I took the gamble. So I'm pretty upset that I'm stuck with only 8GB of RAM. Don't expect to do much with this laptop other than browse the internet, write papers, or make presentations. Even the webcam is lackluster at a grainy 720p. The battery capacity it ok, but drains fast if your doing anything more than web browsing. Had the CPU been provided more adequate cooling and the option to upgrade RAM capacity to at least 16GB, this would have gotten 4-5 stars."
"I asked Amazon:Can I run Ubuntu on this laptop?Yes.Does this laptop have wifi?Yes.Did not ask Amazon:Can you connect to wifi while running Ubuntu on this laptop?Answer: No, the network card I does not support Ubuntu so it needs an external wifi adaptor. But other than that, no issues. Maybe once I get connected I can update the drivers? We will see."
Pretty good budget laptop 300 bucks gets the job done kinda slow but gets the job done i just use it for 3d printing files and basic stuff IT TOOK ME ABOUT 5HRS TO DEACTIVATE S MODE (cant download anything thats not on the Microsoft store) i followed all the youtube videos and nothing what finally worked i did a hard reset delete everything like windows and it finally worked when i clicked the disable S MODE . Before it would keep saying something went wrong try again later.
"So I got this laptop for work, had it for like 20 days and then out of nowhere the sound driver went out.  Spoke with acer support, went through all troubleshooting and solutions and it is a hardware issue.  Have to literally send back so they can repair it, no monetary compensation or replacement per the warranty.  Just have to suck it up and have it repaired which will take most likely a minimum of two weeks.  So yeah, I’m not very happy.  Brand new laptop is already broken.  Cool  👍"
"I had to purchase a laptop because my last laptop of 21 years, finally gave up & retired. Once I opened my my new acer laptop and let it complete it's mandatory software update, it left my computer with zero internal memory (116 GB used), this is a major issue and I even uninstalled a large majority of apps not required to run. I have an external 8 TB connected and anything new saving on as well as installed 16 GB of internal RAM which has helped the processing tremendously and is rather fast. My extreme issue is nothing else can be done...no Micrisoft Office, nothing but literally check my email....if I try anything else I get a message there isn't enough internal memory.......Argh......very frustrating. I've purchased an internal 1TB SSD that should arrive soon and I'm hoping this fixes this constant issue I'm experiencing. In addition, I've purchased an external dvd HD drive for watching dvds if possible but currently no internal memory allows nothing but email as of right now.I have mixed feelings on this laptop as it's my first 1 in 21 years and am leaving room for learning but I do know it shouldn't be like this. A rather expensive tasking to make a laptopwork....I will post more once I install the additional memory. Thank goodness this laptop is built with the ability to upgrade and maybe that's the goal of the company...nevertheless less; I supplied 3 stars for screen quality, user friendly set-up, once the RAM upgrade was completed it's very fast and the ability to customize the laptop with tools for reference (you tube videos).UPDATE: I reset the computer back to factory settings and the remounted the additional memory and it's working very well as it should. It's definitely faster than my old Toshiba of 21 years however, the motherboard and processor on this seem to being fine (I only do minor things no video games). Excellent image and crisp images. Just be sure to purchase some additional memory and it's a good device so far."
"This is a good Laptop for a young Techy  I hate it.  Ive had an IPad and a MacPro but could not afford the cost of another Mac  Thought this would be a good alternate.  I have an awful time using it  I often use my cell phone rather than the this Laptop  It's probably Windows i dislike  There's nothing wrong with the Acer performance, it was a poor choice for me and now i""m stuck with it."
"The laptop has been great for the price. However the first day I had the laptop I had to do a fresh install of windows 11 to turn off S mode.Someone who's not as tech savvy would likely be unable to find this solution as I did it as an act of desperation. If people wanted a limited OS with decent hardware, they can get a fantastic chromebook for the same price."
"For the price point, this is a basic laptop that is NOT touch screen. I'm not sure why this laptop appears as part of a search for touch screen, and why it's listed as an option to be rated.Things I like:- Start up is fast. Turns on and off with ease. Cheap.- Fairly light, big screen. Keyboard is great. Backlit keyboard.- Battery life seems ok. About 3-4 hours so far without needing to charge.Things I don't like:- The volume is horrendous. My phone plays music and shows louder than this computer. Use headphones/earphones or plug-in speakers. Has a bit of a muffled quality with the speakers being on the bottom of the laptop (at the two corners of the laptop).- Backlit keyboard doesn't stay on likely to save energy, but I prefer the keyboard to stay on. I haven't been able to find an option to change this setting.- Camera quality is terrible. It's so pixelized it reminds me of a computer I had in the early 2000's. Don't get this laptop if you plan on having video calls or anything to do with video.- The touchpad is doing something odd where it'll minimize my browser and I'll have to re-open the browser when I'm scrolling or using the touchpad. I've looked at every possible setting.- Tried to edit some docs and it started highlighting things on its own.- Hinged laptop: Every computer I've had in the past where the screen is hinged has over time broken off, became loose, or doesn't work properly.There is no fingerprint reader. There was a review that mentioned this, but I don't have this option.This computer is touted as lightning fast, but it lags if I have more than 2 tabs open. The microphone occasionally fails, oddly where if you test the microphone it works, but if you use anything requiring the microphone you get an error message. I've had to reboot this thing twice now.I needed a computer in a pinch for general browsing, but I would honestly pay a bit more for better quality. I bought this for the screen size so I can watch shows while traveling, but defeats the purpose if the sound is muffled."
"This is a nice laptop for the price, and it's very easy to upgrade the ram and add a second hard drive. Converting from Windows S mode to Home is also very easy. If you decide to order a second hard drive to upgrade it, be aware that you MUST order a drive that is 7mm thick. I originally ordered a 1 TB mechanical drive to install, based on an Amazon recommendation, and it was a 9.5mm drive. On the Acer website it clearly indicates that this laptop only supports 7mm secondary drives. I ended up installing a 7mm SSD and an additional 4GB of ram, and now it's blazing fast. I highly recommend this laptop.Update:Not as enthused as I was originally about this machine for these reasons:1. Although it has a keypad on the keyboard, the system HOME, END, Page Up/down keys are tied to the keypad which means if you use the keypad on spreadsheets a lot, you can't jump around using Home and End keys - a real bummer if your job involves lots of spreadsheets like mine. IF I had known that I would have passed on this laptop.2. I installed an extra 4 GB ram, but the system kept reporting only 5.9 GB Ram is usable. Defective Ram - I thought. Went ahead and slapped 16 GB Ram into it, but now using Speccy and Windows reopt only 13.9 GB is usable. Apparently, this is a known issue on Acer laptops with Ryzen and AMD graphics. The system seems to reserve 3 GB (give or take) for graphics and other stuff. To me, that's unacceptable and if I had known that I would have passed on it. IT is a nice machine. I like the build quality, the graphics are very good, etc. but this Ram issue is a bummer. If you are considering buying this machine, paste this into your Google machine:Aspire A515-43 usable ram less than installed - and see for yourself. It's a known issue and there isn't a real fix for it. Now I have extra memory I don't need adding another $30 to the price of this machine.Caveat Emptor leads to a 2 star deduction. See images for Windows system Ram report."
"I bought this as it was mentioned #1 on a site listing best Under $500 gaming laptops. I was given pause that it had such low RAM (4g) but it looked easy enough to upgrade so dropped another $50 on a 16G ram set.The laptop itself seems OK...everything worked. I didn't have super high expectations at the 350 or so price point.The ram upgrade was not too bad. It could have been easier. An access panel for such an obvious upgrade would have been preferred to having to take the whole back panel off. But all in all, acceptable.The screen seems not terribly crisp to me. It is OK but..meh. I haven't tried too many games to really put it thought its paces yet but what I have tried ran well.My biggest complaint is the keyboard. If I would have looked at this closer I probably would have passed on the purchase. The keys are tiny and flat. The number pad is all jacked up with keys that are traditionally on the far right placed up above the num pad. Anyone that uses a num pad will quickly be annoyed as your traditional typing is not possible. Also in order to use the F1-F12 keys you have to hold down a FN key..otherwise those keys default to multimedia functions like volume up and down. I read this may be able to be adjusted in the bios but i have yet to check.  For me...the keyboard is just to small and awkward. If you are wanting to use this for gaming or work that is keyboard or typing intensive you may want to look elsewhere.My gut feeling is this was made to be bare bones no frills laptop with above average CPU and graphics power for the price point knowing it was ripe for upgrading (take out of Win S mode and RAM). As it is, pretty week, but if you are willing to upgrade the ram the guts become pretty solid. Everything else about it is kind bleh."
"I was so psyched to buy this computer and just as disappointed when I got it. New computers always take time to set up granted, I had a lot of trouble with this one. It could be because I haven't had a computer computer in five years but things shouldn't have changed that much. I had thought it came with an anti-virus and anti spyware and all that stuff apparently it comes with a window defender? But that did not stop a fake security scam from attacking me within the first 3 hours of setup? They froze my computer and told me I had to call a number so they could tell me how to fix it claiming to work for Windows / Microsoft? The dude wanted me to spend $500 for the next year to keep anyone else from doing that hacking into my computer. It was quite a scam and it took me three or four weeks to straighten it out and change all my bank information and every other thing because I didn't know the extent to which they hacked into my computer. Found out that my internet comes with a Norton security suite so I called them up and they help me to install it and even in that case for the next week or two I was still getting warnings at least from the Norton sweet that someone was trying to HACK in again and kept identifying it's the same fake security scam.I had no choice but I had to stop using it and I rarely use it because I'm afraid to do that I don't want to be hacked.The computer came already loaded I think it's called s mode but I didn't know how to use that so I got rid of that and quite frankly to try to maneuver around without pop ups who knows what else is going on I'm uncomfortable using it I don't think this is a particularly good by even though it didn't cost the whole lot I think computers need to just evolve into better tablets or something different like that I never buy a laptop again ever. I was so excited but now I'm so sorry."
I bought an Acer Aspire 3 July 6th 2023 and it was doing good then in April the touch pad stopped working. I called Acer support and they said it was no longer under warranty.  Even though it has a 1 yr warranty  the Acer support said it was out of warranty in March.  Therefore I had to pay for another warranty and they didn't even help me. My laptop worked with an external mouse and after they got done with things to try my laptop doesn't even work now.
"This has Windows 10-S & I hate it. So I registered this laptop thru Microsoft & then turned off the ""S"" mode for good on this laptop. It comes with Microsoft Edge as its built-in Internet browser....better than prior MS browser IE. I also installed Google Chrome as my 2nd Internet browser too.. 15.6"" monitor....good picture quality. Horrible sound quality. This is the first time I had a SSD drive like what's installed in this computer & it's small in capacity also at 128 gbs. It's not a old-fashioned mechanical or newer solid state hard drive, but a very small newest type of hard drive that connects directly to the mainboard with no wires or cords. It's about the same size as laptop RAM memory. This computer is very fast operation-wise. I had to buy external units on both for this laptop. Why Acer deleted the DVD/CD burner unit & SD card reader on this device is beyond me since they are rather thin in nature on laptops anyways. Lit keyboard...stays lit for maybe 15 seconds.....interesting feature and wished it stayed lit all the time. Needs at least 1 more USB 2.0 or 3.0 port. 128gb Solid State HD.....makes it speedy to power up. Only 4 gbs of memory.....which I order two 8 GB SODIMM RAM for more memory & speed for this device.PROS:Great picture quality on the 15.6 inch screenSeparate numerical keypadVery fast laptop [due mostly to the small SSD installed on this laptop]Lit keyboard [only stays lit for maybe 7 seconds tho]CONS:NO SD card readerNO DVD player/burnerOnly 3 USB ports [could use 1 more USB port]Cannot add 2nd hard drive inside laptop for added storageSmall 128 GB SSDComes with Windows 10-S modeIF Acer could have put in a 520 GB SSD, added 1 more USB port, added a SD card reader, add additional 4 GB of DDR4 RAM [to make it with 8 GB of RAM total] & somehow shoehorn a DVD player/burner into this laptop....you'd have a winning Acer laptop that's still rather thin/slim. But as it is now, I'd rate this laptop 3 of 5."
"It literally is the worst sub 500 dollar laptop I have ever purchased.  Charges slowly, IPS screen is okay, has pretty bad battery life, but other problems exist...the wireless system is so bogged down and I do not know who to blame for it.  Microsoft or Acer.  It just can't handle anything I throw at it with any speed.  My ten year old Lenovo Carbon (which is a second gen i7 w/16 gs of ram) and a 80 dollar chrome book can run circles around it.  I turned down everything as far as specs go...I own some AMD stock, so I gave them a chance.  Bad choice.  I might go to the dark side and just buy a Macbook Air.  I bought it for a christmas present for my aging father, and yeah sure it's pretty, but I think I need to send it back.  I've installed basically nothing on it.  However, I think a loaded R5 processor that was introduced in the first quarter of 2023 should be able to kick some booty.  Six hours of battery life is a dream...an illusion.  Wireless stinks and I'm running Nighthawk routers.  Looks great on the outside, but drives like a Pinto or gremlin.  I was expecting at least a Camry.  Like I said I'm not sure it's Windows 11, but I'm not going to format the hard drive and go back to 10.  If anybody knows what I'm up against, let me know if you have had similar problems.  I would really like to enjoy this thing.  I dislike APPLE with a passion, but Micro stinks is falling down the same path.  Just my two cents."
"Recently received my Acer Aspire 3 A315-24P-R7VH. Amazon shows a backlit keyboard as one of the specs and a major feature point for me. This specific laptop DOES NOT have a backlit keyboard as advertised. I will keep the product since the performance is as expected for a $300 budget laptop but very disappointed in the false advertising by Acer/Amazon. Will definitely affect my purchase choices as I prepare to purchase a higher end laptop for business use. Just beware if the backlit keyboard is one of your must haves, this item is falsely advertised as having one."
"I learned with this purchase that any computer that has s mode will be a nightmare of pain and frustration. NEVER again will I buy anything that says s mode. I’ve spent hours going from one solution to another and putting the computer away to keep myself from throwing it against the wall. What makes it okay to wall away all my favorite apps and leave behind nothing but junk I don’t want? I could say so much more but then they wouldn’t post it. I want a laptop and now that I have personal information on it I feel trapped into keeping it, so I probably won’t return it, but it also might end up collecting dust in the corner because I can’t get it to work right.-Update- It is now free of s mode. The same function that failed to work dozens of times allowed me to exit and all is working correctly now so I’m adding stars. 4 star product.-Latest update- The Q button and number pad enter button have stopped working. At this price you have to accept short battery life, small amounts of memory, and a bit slower processing as getting what you pay for. I would, however, think that the product would work properly. I bought it July 14th of this year (it’s August 13th) and have used it almost exclusively for writing and online research. Nothing has ever been spilled anywhere near it. I don’t eat while I’m writing and the built in keyboard has already failed. S mode blocked my browser choice in the beginning and now I’m quite quickly out of Q quips. Back to one star."
"The specs on the item I ordered clearly indicated a back lit keyboard, which is what I ordered. The one I got does not have a back lit keyboard. Otherwise, it's a nice laptop. I needed it for work so I did not return it."
"Good points...very light weight, easy to use. great if you just going online for amazom, emails or browsing LOOKS really really nice but... Took me 2 years to do this review I have ""been around"" with desktops & eventually lap tops since before windows 95 lol so there that.Not happy with it...( ok I actually hate it) just use for amazon and VERY light gaming..like a solitare program..it is by no means a gaming computer..i have a real one. I read reviews before i purchased and yes...definitley get a better memory card.Its is small and slim and sometimes translates to not so good. The charging cord is a piece of junk! I had a feeling it would not last. Ultra this ""bendable charging cord which is now so messed up I have had to tape it in such a way so that it actually charges. (im used to the old, well made, really heavy lap tops that I have had for years. Only thing I ever had to do for them was get a new battery. Never mind the fact the charging cord is on the left hand side of the computer which just does not work for me....maybe it's a ""right handed thing""?  never the less, I expect my charging cords to last for years! This is just a very thin easily ""gonna go on you eventually"". Just recently the fan on it is acting up and making noise which eventually goes away. My conclusion: gets great reviews, I went by them....it's ok for just ordering things on amazon,(sometimes as my security is high & amazon ""drops"" on this computer..ugh) it good for email if u still do that; instagram, facebook & browsing..lol and light weight enough to tote around if needed; but at the very least get a better memory card...adds to cost of buying it. Just my picky about computer opinion."
"Although the specifications note that the keyboard is backlit, my laptop does not have a keyboard that is backlit. I have tried multiple times to get the keyboard to light up, but to no avail. I’m waiting on the live assistance to help."
"Had the check mark to filter only touchscreen but it is not, check closely the spec the query for the database is not correct"
"So I bought this machine because my previous laptop died after several years of service. I needed something ""cheap and quick"", but I saw all the great reviews on this.  I was expecting to be pleasantly surprised with a value packed computer - but no, I got what I paid for.The display is good, the battery life is decent, and I appreciate the backlit keyboard.  HOWEVER, there's four major problems I cannot overlook:Wifi speed - I can usually get 250-300 Mbps easily.  This barely gets 80.  I have tested this repeatedly vs. cell phone speeds, and other laptops in my house - and something is limiting the wifi in this machine to go full speed.  This is unacceptable.  (And I know 80 is in the zone of ""decent speed"" - but it's a downgrade from what I was getting on an 8 year old laptop)Audio - The sound is terrible and there's a lot of crackling/popping.  For someone who loves music and watches a lot of youtube, this is also unacceptable.Trackpad - not very responsive and consistently sees a ""right click"" near the mid-line of the trackpad as a ""left click"".  This is more than likely me getting use to the trackpad, but it still doesn't work as well as it should.RAM use: I installed another 4 MB of ram as suggested - and even then programs like Firefox, etc.  still run a bit sluggish.I will continue to troubleshoot to see if there's something wrong.  But I am not a fan of this computer in it's current state.  Next time, I will not be buying an Acer computer."
"This is a different look on ""same"" Acer make & model I've had...power cord very bad...it's a puny nozzle that gets super hotit broke down the power cord after only 4 monthsThe screen wouldn't turn on today-- I almost had a heart attackI spent my saturday on the phone with Acersupport for 2 hoursLuckily, it's a sensitive laptop power cord and not some other major hardward problem, Acer would send me a replacement for free to get in 3-8 business daysThis ""same"" as I've ordered from my order history, Acer, also has a differerent look to its laptop hinge in this make and model I bought in November of 2023, maybe someone can enlighten me if it's an upgrade? I ask this because I ordered this most latest one in November 2023 after the ""same"" Acer make and model's laptop hinge totally came apart."
"The laptop runs as expected for the given specs. Pleased with how it runs and performs so far. Only big complaint is the listing states the CPU is 4.3 GHz, upon inspection it is actually 2.8 GHz (see screenshot). I'm pretty disappointed with that deception, hence the 3 stars. Upon looking at the CPU specs on AMD's website, the CPU base clock is 2.8 GHz and the max boost clock is 4.3 GHz. the real question is under what conditions you can use that upper range beyond 2.8. Maybe some settings in BIOS, an AMD performance management software, or maybe it's automatically managed?  Not sure, but I will have to investigate it further. (See other screenshot for general CPU specs from AMD's website)The only other annoyance is the touch pad seems a bit ""loose"" at the bottom of the pad. When tapping (not clicking) the pad for a mouse click, the pad makes a tapping sound as if the bottom is tapping something underneath it... Not worth returning over in my opinion."
The laptop is ok but windows 11 is horrible. Tried to downgrade and so far haven't been able to.
"I run Debian 12 on this little laptop and it works great; however, their is only 8gb of ram which is not upgradable so beware."
"The laptop itself is sleek and stylish with a fairly decent light-up keyboard. I had to upgrade the ram in the laptop and change it away from a version of windows that can be changed to normal for free. (Look up a walk-thru on Youtube if you need help.)The plastic is flexible and the only part that is made of metal is the part behind the screen.Here is where the However part comes in.The cheap plastic is too weak. The plastic around the screen has come undone at the hinges of the screen since the hinges themselves are fairly stiff and stronger than the plastic holding them in place. I have never had this problem with my previous laptops.The longest i had a laptop was 3 years, a Toshiba Satellite. I've had this one for 1 and the problem started 3 months ago.I want to like this laptop but this hick-up makes me a little uneasy choosing the same one when this one inevitably starts to have hardware problems because of the cheap plastic holding it in place.Who knows, maybe I just got a defective one."
"I looked for a computer for Seniors and this was the most recommended model.  Its bigger than my previous computer but other than that I can't find anything that is Senior friendly.  I don't dislike it but expected more of it. It just seems like an average computer, except for the larger screen."
Found better price on best buy..
"For the money, this device is very nice. But the Windows 10 S Mode was the reason why I give this three stars even leaning to two, however.I wanted to dumb this laptop down and get the right programs for my 90 year old relative so that she is not required to enter her account multi times, and to be able to use her laptop without crap being bombarded at her. She will be using it for Facebook and the browsing the web only. She will not be a heavy user of anything else. One would believe that S Mode would be perfect for this situation. But I wanted he to be able to choose the Antivirus and the browser (I work in IT), I felt was best for her and that the MS app store does not allow this. It's their crap or the highway.This device was sold indicating that S Mode could be disabled 'easily' by going through options and ultimately ending up in the MS app store...etc. (yup, i did everything recommended, and then some crazier stuff) The only option I ever got was to purchase Windows 10 for $139.00.After hours of agonizing and attempting to install Linux on this, I contacted Acer directly. The online chat tech was very helpful and assisted me in getting a full version of Windows 10, no charge. Now I will need to somehow figure out how to get the Boot order fixed, so that I can load the USB. Currently the only boot option is Windows Boot Manager, yes, I also tried getting that worked around.Buy this device if you are not caring about the S Mode crap. Otherwise, if you don't have an IT geek in your household WITH PATIENCE, you will not be happy with this device.I will keep you updated as to how things turn out. Hoping for the best, prepping for the worst."
"I had to take off the S mode to be able to download an app to be able to take the SAT.  It was not easy.  The site recommended by Microsoft had a button to click and it would not work.  In conclusion, I had to update Microsoft 11 first to its latest, then I was able to click that button to take off S mode."
The touch screen does not work no app in settings to enable something to think about when ordering!  Had I known that I wouldn't have ordered it.
I bought this laptop one year ago. I followed all the review advice and did the hard drive upgrade because I need the space for my job. Technically it has performed great. About 6 months in there was rattling inside the computer. I opened it and there was a random screw loose (not from when I did the upgrade). I fixed it and then realized screws kept randomly coming loose. A couple months after that the bottom of the case cracked. The computer hasn't been dropped or handled rough so I'm not sure how that happened but I put duct tape on it and carried on. Right at 1 year I was closing it one day and the frame cover snapped off the hinge (pictured). I hope it's covered in warranty but if not I'll have to super glue it. I didn't think the plastic would matter initially but metal casing is much better. This computer has been in a padded case or on a desk since I've had it I can't imagine what would happen if I so much as bumped something with it. Otherwise technically it has worked well.
I just got this laptop and I can't even use it how I want because S Mode is stuck on. I can't get it to turn off and have to troubleshoot for hours just to be able to install any app I want and not be stuck in Microsoft's padded walled garden they want to trap you in. It's seriously so frustrating they do this.
Have had for a couple days. Overall the laptop runs nicely. Just has a horrible graphics card. Not meant for gaming even though the description and acer’s website says so. Also very very disappointed in the size of the internal SSD. Barely even enough to install one game if that.
The cursor keeps jumping across the sentences causing you to type in the wrong words.  You have to then place the cursor back where you need it to be before typing again
"I'm giving this item one star only because zero stars is not an option. From the moment I unboxed the device, I encountered significant issues that rendered the laptop unusable.The primary issue was that the laptop failed to load properly right from the start. Upon booting up, it would either freeze on the startup screen or get stuck in an endless loop of restarts. This made it impossible to access the operating system or complete any setup process.Another major problem was the keyboard, which simply did not work. No keystrokes were registered, making it impossible to type anything or navigate through any initial setup screens that did manage to appear. This is a fundamental flaw, as a functional keyboard is essential for any laptop.While the build quality seemed decent upon initial inspection, the severe functional issues overshadowed any potential positives in this area. A laptop that doesn't load or register keystrokes is essentially a non-functional piece of equipment, regardless of how sturdy or sleek it looks.I immediately contacted customer support to address these issues. The support team was unresponsive and discourteous, they were unable to provide a solution that resolved the problems. As a result, I had no choice but to return the laptop.The Acer Aspire 3 laptop failed to meet even the most basic expectations. With severe loading issues and a non-functional keyboard, it was clear that this device was not ready for use.If you're in the market for a reliable and functional laptop, I would advise looking elsewhere. The Acer Aspire 3 did not deliver on its promises and resulted in a frustrating and disappointing experience. Never again!"
I ordered this laptop in February 2024. In 6 months I could no longer control the cursor. I bought an external mouse but in just three months the laptop no longer recognizes it. So I got 9 months use out of this laptop _ DO NOT BUY!
"I'm not complaining - facts: I bought this as a backup to my aging Dell and it sat for 5 months. I decided to use it today. It won't install Windows. It goes through various iterations and fails. I called Acer. YAHOO. Its under warranty. But read the reviews of the Acer repair shop (which happens to be here in my home town).Acer is cheap so what do I expect?.Update: As I said, I hand delivered to Acer which has a nice large facility locally. A day or two I got it back. Same problem. Apparently they never turned it on. I called tech support which is offshore and a mess. I documented the issue again and got no satisfaction after a long confirmation of the issues and finally escalated to a supervisor - of course none were available - I demanded level 2 support and then got a fellow in the States at the repair facility. He was sympathetic - I took it back to them and within 36 hrs I had it back. This time I demanded a senior tech look at it. Apparently something in the solid-state drive ? or memory was failing. DAH! It may be a fine inexpensive unit now but the pain to get here was dismal. I can't recomment Acer."
"In the market for a new laptop. Wanted to keep it under $500. Had never used an AMD processor, before. Let's just say that I will NEVER buy another laptop/PC powered by an AMD processor, again.If you only need a laptop for word processing, emailing or just general use, then this will do. This is NOT a gaming laptop. You will want to upgrade to at least 8GB of RAM, to help mask the performance drop you'll experience, when running multiple programs/videos.I purchased this laptop in April 2021, so I gave it some time to see if it got better after updates/hotfixes. It didn't. I put it on the market and got a laptop with an Intel chip. This laptop was not for me.Pros:-Decently priced for what you get-SSD > HDD if you enjoy speed/efficiency-15"" vibrant screen-Backlit keyboardCons:-AMD Ryzen 3 3200U processor will regularly hit 70 degree temps when handling multiple tasks-AMD Radeon Vega 3 integrated graphics card has an ongoing issue with washing out black colors (in videos and pictures). Had to tweak a Google Chrome flag to bypass this. As of this post, no fix is available from AMD. Also struggles (frame drops) to play 4K content in full screen mode. Plays fine in standard view.-4GB of RAM is comical. Even after upgrading to 8GB, the system showed a minimal increase in performance."
"I had bought this based on reviews and the touch screen option. I've had touch screen issues 3 times since June. The first time (august) tech support helped wonderfully, driver needed updated. The next time (oct)they had me look for the updates,nothing. No updates were there all were installed and the touch screen would not work. They told me that I would need to send it in for repair. I shut it off and it magically worked.. Now end of Nov and it is still having issues. I called this time they wouldn't even try to help me install a driver etc,told me wouldn't work if I have had that many issues. I would need to send it in.The problem here is I NEED this computer to work. That is why I did the research and went based on the reviews . SO now I have a $550 paperweight"
"I purchased this for my new small business. I have a good work laptop (my prev real job I still do consulting) that's much more $, so I will give some solid comparisons for why this is an entry level vs a +$1k laptop of same size.None of these are deal-breakers, just comparisons (from most noticeable to least noticeable):- Sound / speakers suck. It works, but speakers are terrible. Especially compared to my $ laptop. This actually would have been a deal breaker in the past, but now we have convenient workarounds like bluetooth and using my smartphone instead.- Screen doesn't get as bright. I work on my back deck under the umbrella and it would be nice to be able to have the brightness of the $$ laptop. Again, it works fine...but would be nice to be brighter- I often have many internet tabs open at once. If I have, say, 8 tabs open and haven't pulled one of them up in a bit, it will have to reload. This is the least of all the inconveniences, but something I've noticed.I'm not unhappy with my purchase, esp for the price. I wanted to spend very little, and it's fine.Update: My modem/router was outdated. So to the internet issue, I think that was some of it. That said, it's still not as fast as my work computer, but it def runs better with a better modem/router. Screen and sound review the same obviously."
"I used this computer for schoolwork and random web browsing. It ran fantastically, even ran Sims 4 really well! I did not try any hardcore gaming or anything like that, knowing the RAM and storage weren't the best for that type of thing. Then suddenly, less than a week before my final project was due in my programming class, I got the blue screen of death about 20 times in a row. Tried resetting the whole thing, wiped it clear and reinstalled Windows. Still dead.I'm hopeful my proof of purchase gets approved so I can submit a warranty claim because as of right now, the date the warranty is based off of was manufacture (10/6/23), putting me literally just outside of the window to submit a claim. I'm heartbroken at the loss of all my files, and as a low income full-time student and full-time employee, I can't afford to simply buy a new computer. But I may have no choice.I've been loyal to Acer for over a decade, but if this is how they make them now, I'll pass."
I am disappointed with how low the speaker volume is. It's not something I really think about in a laptop before purchasing but realized when trying to watch videos/movies that without connecting external speakers it is not an enjoyable experience.Everything else worked very well and if you don't care about speaker volume then this would be a great budget laptop.
"I bought this laptop to use to learn how to code on the go, but the quality of the mouse pad is very, very poor and so I am going to return it. When coding, you frequently have to move the mouse to highlight specific pieces of text to do some sort of edit in your code. Unfortunately, the mousepad on this laptop is not accurate or precise, and when trying to make fine movements with the mousepad, the mouse moves in very, very small skips instead of a smooth, consistent glide. This makes it impossible to move the mouse quickly and precisely, because when trying to execute precise movements, you have to slow down and course correct several times when you get the mouse close to where you want it to go (instead of being able to quickly move the mouse to the precise location you intend). This lack of precision is very frustrating, and makes the user experience so slow that I am going to return it. I purchase laptops for at least 2 years of consistent use, and I just don't want to endure that kind of frustration every single day as I'm trying to give all of my attention towards building a technical skill. For those who appreciate speed and accuracy with the mousepad (just like with a mac laptop if you've ever used one - nothing too crazy, just very smooth and controllable motion that follows your input perfectly), I would advise you not to get this laptop, because I think you could be very frustrated with the user experience.As a final note, this laptop also had issues running Ubuntu 18.04 - whenever I closed the lid, the laptop would suspend (this is totally expected; ""suspend"" is just means ""sleep"" for linux), but whenever I reopened the lid, the laptop would not resume (turn back on) and I would have to force shut down and restart it (every single time). I could not find a solution to this issue after scouring the internet and trying a bunch of different fixes for about 4 or 5 hours. Some linux distributions have small issues with certain laptops, so for whatever reason Ubuntu 18.04 and this laptop just did not work well together. This issue was also frustrating and made for a very diminished user experience, although I may have been able to find another distribution that would have worked with this laptop. But for both of these reasons (very much mainly the first reason, the mousepad), I am returning this laptop. Don't want to deal with an issue like that for 2 years, rather just spend a little more money. Hope this is helpful."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I bought this computer because it says it has a backlight on the keyboard, but it does not. It’s obvious because the letters are solid and I tried every single suggestion to no avail. It is a nice laptop and we already set it up so we’re keeping it , but the light thing is a bummer!!!"
It has a lot of reviews. I read some of it. I was tired of researching for a laptop and this seemed good. I got it today. It says on here special feature -backlit keyboardNope. I’ve searched online and nothing. I checked the reviews on here and others have said the same. That’s my biggest deal.What a disappointment.
"I should have done my homework before buying this computer.  First it comes with Microsoft Windows 11 S.  I think that the S is an abbreviation for SCAM.  This operating system restricts you only to applications from the Microsoft store.  So, all of those wonderful applications from other providers will not run on this computer unless Microsoft Windows 11 S is replaced by Windows 11.  The conversion is not as simple as touted by Microsoft.  The second problem is the audio.  It is very low volume and very poor quality.  Granted this a very inexpensive laptop but I have another inexpensive laptop that is much superior to this one."
Nothing to write hone about
"I was initially very satisfied with the purchase.  The machine is great looking and the screen is very nice.  It was the perfect balance of price and capability for my needs.It comes with Windows 10s which can be changed to regular Windows 10 Home if you choose.  I did because I did not want to be limited to only dealing with MS.Everything was flawless for the first two weeks or so.  Then a Windows 10 update came in and it all went downhill very quickly.  I won't bore you with all the specific details but it got to the point where the machine would not even boot.  I want to emphasize that these problems were software NOT hardware related.  The machine itself was great.Long story short, I contacted Acer and they gave me a no hassle return process.  I just sent if back yesterday for them to repair/replace/whatever.  Good thing I do not need it right away.I learned through all the repair efforts that switching from 10s to regular home puts it in the 32 bit version of 10 and when 64 bit updates come in, problems can ensue and it seems to be the case for me.  If it comes back with the 10s version, I will probably wipe the drive and install a fresh 64 bit version of Windows 10 and wait until Gates and company can create some new version of pain to inflict upon us.Bottom line - great machine that is saddled with ill-prepared software from a company that should do better."
"To summarize, you get what you pay for. I was not expecting to run into so many problems right when I took this out of the box.1. Immediately I heard something loose inside the laptop that was rolling around when I pulled it out of its packaging.2. The sound is so bad it's like buying a pair of earbuds in the the dollar store. The speakers are also under the laptop which makes it worse for the sound quality.3. Loud fan when it gets a little warm when using.4. Scratching sound quality when using multiple tabs. I had about 5 tabs open and while watching youtube videos I noticed the sound would cut out or make scratching noises when it is trying to process all the programs.5. Customer service from both Acer and Amazon makes it difficult to fix your/my issues. I contacted customer service the same day after I received this laptop and also the day after. After telling them all of my issues they suggested to send it to Acer but it will take around 20 business days to have everything fixed.6. Possible restocking fee. Wanting to return this item, even though I barely used it the first 2 days, customer service told me that I cannot send any pictures or videos of the laptop and they would have to inspect it BEFORE they can tell me whether or not I will be charged a restocking fee. If you don't like being surprised by restocking fees, don't buy this laptop so you won't have to return.7, I was recommended to use a separate speaker to fix the audio problem (basically to spend more money just so I can hear sounds without it sounding like a broken audio file.8. Screen quality is definitely not good. I would give it a 6/10. The color difference when using a decent another laptop or monitor, the difference is super noticeable.9. 4gb of ram will not be enough trust me. You would have to buy another ram if you want this to run better and you're basically forking more money just to make this laptop a little bit more usable.I know this has good reviews but don't be fooled by it. I was swayed when I was going through the reviews but after I got my product, I was highly disappointed. I wish I had spent more money to get a more reliable laptop. This one is not worth the regular price. I would say with the issues and quality of this laptop, the price should be around $250."
"Over the last 3 years I've used this computer sparingly. 3 years is ridiculous for a computer lifecycle. Especially if I'm writing this off of my 2013 laptop that I've essentially run to hell and back. I barely used this computer over the last 3 years. I've kept it up to date, taken care of it, and used it enough over time to keep it going. I just recently started using it more for work and an online class. 3 weeks into using it daily and the backlight went out completely. There's no use putting money into it now to fix it. I wish I would have just returned this in 2021 to save myself the disappointment."
"I've always liked Acer's laptops. This was my 3rd one. I wanted to like it, but it crapped out on me 14 months later.  I will be disposing of it sometime this week.I purchased Acer's previous ~$350 laptop and added an SSD for the OS and a 1 TB HD for the storage space. That worked well until the laptop hinge broke, forcing me to buy a new laptop. I thought this new version of the ~$350 Acer would work just as well as my previous one, but I was wrong. It was relatively slow from the first use, but acceptable, and further slowed in performance in the following weeks. I occasionally got periods of unresponsive clicks, nonresponsive webpages, blue screens of death, freezes requiring cold boots, and such.I figured I could tolerate all of this since all I needed was a machine to get through my graduate school work: browse the web, open multiple adobe PDF files, work on somewhat large Microsoft Office documents, and sometimes stream HD videos on YouTube/Netflix. However, this machine still struggled to process some of these applications one at a time! I made sure to keep it clean and scanned for malware/viruses regularly to make sure I didn't have bugs slowing it down. Further, it was frequently louder than HP's typical ""airplane mode,"" with the fan blowing hard to cool the laptop down even when it idled with no apps open.I tried multiple times to reinstall a clean version of Windows 10, but came across some error everytime, and Google was minimally helpful. The last time I tried it, my system got erased and I was no longer able to boot the computer.I have decided it belongs in the trash (recycling).Would give it 1 star in general, as I've only listed some of my main complaints, but give it 2 because I did think it looked nice, had a nice surface that was anti-fingerprint marking, and was physically satisfactory. Looked good on the outside, was crap on the inside."
"Had this laptop for a couple weeks and already had corrupt file so it wouldn't turn back on when it was asleep so I always had to do a hard reset and loose any unsaved worked.  Called support to fix it, and the fix only last a couple days.  Started not awakening after being asleep again.  This is a cheap computer for a reason. The first one I had the space bar didn't work, had to return it.  And the designers for some reason put the power button where the delete button is on every other keyboard so if you want to delete something you're just going to turn off the computer.  Pay a little more to find a better laptop"
Laptop came without a Charger. Would've been good to know. Still running around trying to find one
"On a scale of 1 to 10, I'm about a 4 in computer knowledge. I bought this laptop for personal e-mail and to play games I have on Steam. I didn't know you can't download any games other than Microsoft Games in the standard Windows 10 S mode. The Amazon / Acer help line did a good job in helping me change to Windows 11 and download Steam. However, the graphics in the actual games in Steam (Order of Battle, etc.) all look terrible. The opening screens are fine, but game play makes me feel like I'm on a Commodore 64. Anyone have a solution? I wouldn't recommend this computer for gaming now, but hopefully that will change if the problem is resolved."
"I bought this entry level Acer as an extra to have around and wasn't expecting much for the price.  Everything about this computer is very good EXCEPT for the low volume of the sound.  I'm not talking about quality of sound but the actual volume. I wasn't expecting BOSE quality, but I was expecting the volume to be loud when on 100%; it isn't.  Here's what I did, checked drivers, opened the Realtek to confirm all were set at 100%.  Upon researching other reviews, I noticed similar low volume issues; it appears that this is where Acer skimped. (I have an entry level Toshiba that has horrible quality sound, but it is loud.) I need to Blu-tooth an external speaker just so I don't have to bring my ears to w/in 8"" just to hear.  Of course, it doesn't help that Acer put the speakers on the bottom, yes, the bottom of the unit. It's a shame that Acer did so much right for the price, only to mess up on a incredibly low volume!  Would it have really been that more expensive for them to make the sound louder at 100%?  The answer to my rhetorical question is no, but they did anyway.Overall, I would have given the unit 4 stars, maybe even 5, but the horrible max volume of the speakers rates this unit a 3, at best, unfortunately.My take-away is that I won't buy another Acer without hearing the sound first."
"The laptop was unable to ever connect to a network, which was necessary for initial setup. Several different networks were attempted, including different routers and hotspots, but it was never able to connect for initial setup. Tech support advice from Acer did not fix the problem, so they suggested the laptop be sent in for repairs. Separately, the power cord is absurdly flimsy; the power connector to the laptop is loose, and feels like it would break easily. All in all, I had the laptop for about 4 hours, all that time spent trying to fix it's problems, before I decided to refund it."
"Got this laptop a couple years ago. I'm happy with the software side once I got it off of the S mode (don't remember being a hassle or anything, so that wasn't an issue for me).Mainly just writing this to warn people the the hinges on these are absolute trash in my experience. Had the right hinge go bad on me just within the warranty, so I sent it in, no big deal. In less than a year the same side hinge went bad, and within that year the other did too. Tried to tape up the bezel and such to add support but after all the wear and tear in a year's time, the hinges just completely broke off the screen side. Idk what it is with these hinges, but looks like they seize up bad after a bit in my experience.That's really my only main complaint, and it is enough to knock 2 stars from the review I'd probably give instead of this one because everything else has been fine in the 2-ish years I've owned it."
Laptop is ok for the price...the sound is horrible. Had a 30 minute Google call and could barely hear. Gave it another shot by letting the kids watch a movie and even turned the sound all the way up and could barely hear.
Battery life is absolutely terrible have to charge it multiple times a day. Closed the laptop last night at almost full battery went to bed woke up it's dead. Battery dies even when not using it. Debating whether to send it back.
"Laptop was a good price but the laptop does not allow me to download Zoom.I haven't tried downloading other apps, I hope not the same issue."
"So far, this computer...is....slow. kind of bummed about it"
It's a bit slow to open the applications and to turn on
"If you're gonnaa use this laptop for anything other than doing homework, you're all set but if you stream, multitask, make music, play game; the lag is, not even exaggerating, unbearable."
"It's in just slow. No two ways about it. I am not a gamer, all I do is surf the web and sometimes order from Amazon. I can run 3 open windows, a fourth will freeze up. Probably needs more RAM but why should I have to add RAM to a new computer that I have had less than 90 days? Also short battery life, don't plan to do any work from your lunch break!"
"i’m not sure if it’s an error on my part, smth i did while setting it up or if it’s just how it comes but it’s really laggy and i can’t play majority of games on it bcs of how laggy and slow it is. otherwise works like normal."
Its kind of slow no matter the wifiIdk it gets the job done if you're looking for a college laptopI can watch movies sometimes and get my school work done
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The look is extremely sleek, very nice. Screen quality is crystal clear. Boot time is much slower than my son's IPhone. The value for the money well, just say you get what you pay for. This is not for DJ equipment or gaming. When using Spotify, my son talked to me about the numerous problems he had while using the app on this device. The quality of the audio wasn't very clear, and it seems that the mouse rubber bands across the screen whenever something is being done. Overall my son said that this made the device unappealing to him and that it isn't good enough for what he uses it for."
For the price not bad but if you are looking to do more then just write papers on word I would recommend something with more Ram
"Processor was too slow for what we needed it for.  Very light weight, which doesn't mean that it's bad, but it just felt ""cheap"".  I was afraid that if I set something too heavy on it, it would shatter.  Probably good for those who want a cheaper computer, it just wasn't for me."
It’s a decent system. Win11 plus a year of O365. 4GB of RAM does not provide enough if you intend to use this for 7-9 hours. Requires reboots but still for the value it’s good!
"It show 2.8Ghz and it runs at 1.1Ghz , rest is ok.  It is basically laptop functional but processor speed is not correct"
"The setup took an hour because it was so slow. I only had it a few days for emails and internet browsing and everything took forever to load. I returned it for a laptop with 16gb ram and it is 100 times faster. If you’re ok with waiting, it’s ok. If you need speed, buy something better."
Gift for my mother
I haven’t had a laptop in awhile so I thought I would use it to test my knowledge of a newer Microsoft Windows product. Turns out it’s very easy to use and I may get a better quality product later
"Buyer beware, this thing comes with S mode and you can't disable it without a Microsoft account*. After an hour of work I was able get around setting up an account, just search ""disable S mode windows 11 without account"". But seriously, what a PITA just so I can download essential software that isn't found in the app store! Why not just get a Microsoft account? Well, I have non-nefarious reasons that I won't clog up the review with. Anyway S mode is obnoxious in many other ways too and it's clear that Microsoft is really trying hard to corral users towards certain kinds of use instead of using these machines for their own purposes. Boo Microsoft. But now that I've got things the way I like it, great machine so far. The key font is kind of ugly and I wish the trackpad had buttons too, but it was cheap! Wish it had a USB c charger."
"Feels cheap too. Don't anticipate it lasting very long. Purchased it for school. Hope it lasts through the term. It seems like its warped, bows up in the middle and the keys seem recessed on the outside edges - doesn't seem to be affecting functionality."
It does the job for light online class work but does not have enough RAM to stream tv shows or video games.
I got a used return one because it was cheaper I should have returned it. The batter needs changed every time I use it no wonder it was returned
"I’ve had several HP laptops.  This is the first time I’ve had an issue with any HP product It was fine at first but then the issues started . I bought from a private seller on Amazon has many issues. It doesn’t keep time and day correctly. It doesn’t update correctly all the time it shuts off after a couple minutes, many tries for it to come back on."
Couldn't get it to turn on obviously without the cord.
"It’s very slow, even if you uninstall everything on it, it will still say storage full, making it hard to get any type of schoolwork done but it keeps closing things out, and after 3 months of having , it finally shut down , it won’t even let me do a full reset on the computer to get it back working"
After just a month or so the keyboard just doesn’t work and I can’t return it now
"I bought this device to download Kindle books to listen to, because Kindle devices are more expensive and difficult for me to use. My vision is very poor and challenged by the initial panel on Windows 11-driven devices of this size: the pointer is miniscule, and settings cannot be reset for user accessibility until the unit is set up, which I cannot do because I can't see where the pointer is... The issue with the size of the pointer iss worsened by the white screen against which the laptop presents text, and, again, that cannot be changed until the unit is set up (repeat cycle). HP's site provides user guides for its devices. Unfortunately, when I try to enter the device model number, halfway there a screen slides into the window asking for feedback regarding the site, and porevents the user from continuing--this I had to do from a desktop computer with a virtual magnifier and high contrast. I do not use computers for gaming or streaming: I am a writer and a reader who would like to enjoy books despite my disability. Some day I may get this laptop to operate the way it would be useful to me. Today is not that day."
The unit worked fine when received. After normal use the audio is not functioning. No sound.
I bought this computer to try to help with online schooling and it is terribly slow. It took forever for the updates. It could’ve been just mine being defective. I would not recommend.
"Well doesn't hold much, isn't capable with certain websites or games either. Not much memory and I will be in the future ordering another laptop for more functions."
"Its a pretty laptop but it’s extremely slow. I got this for school, where I can study and do my online proctor exams. Well, it’s basically impossible to do that with this laptop. I noticed red flags the first time I opened it. The second time, it was clear that this needed to be returned as there’s no way I’d be able to use it."
"The laptop model is not what was delivered. It advertised a specific model of the computer and I got another that did not have the keyboard backlighting which I really needed for my school work. As for what I did receive the processor is way slower than expected. The display and overall function are okay, but it is not the best compared to other HP laptops of the same series."
I bought this laptop just to use for class. I can’t even use the computer during class because edge locks up continuously. I’ve updated the computer several times. The last thing I’m trying is switching out of S mode so I can download chrome.The computer definitely runs painfully slow. If it doesn’t improve I’ll be returning. As I need a functioning laptop for class.
"This is a shockingly terrible computer.  The look and feel is extremely cheap.  The thing felt incredibly flimsy, and the entire keyboard could be pushed in without much effort.  Awkward feeling keyboard feel and layout too.  The screen quality was awful.  If you weren't looking at the exact perfect angle, the screen would appear faded out and the color would change.  It has an extremely narrow range of viewing angles.  I could never adjust my eyes to the color, and photos would look simply terrible.  My Chromebook has vastly superior color rendering, and the screen looks good at a wide range of viewing angles.  The resolution was purported to be 1080, but the pixels seemed very large and most things appeared ""blocky"".  But the worst part of this computer was the performance.  Unbelievably slow!  Web pages would take forever to load, text would come in, and a bunch of white boxes would appear on screen until each image would load.  It is not my connection either, as I ran this computer right next to my Chromebook, which had none of these loading problems.  This computer was so slow that it would literally hang up while I was typing!  I would start to type a sentence, and nothing would happen on screen, then a few seconds later, the words would start to show up.  I closed everything but one web browser to compose an email, and I could not write simple text without the computer lagging behind.  It was beyond terrible to the point I may have just gotten a lemon.  But if this was not a broken machine, it's the worst computer I have ever used.  Returned it less than a week after using, I was fed up!"
"The product worked great at first and I was pleased with it. I bought it may 11th and it quit working by June. We contacted Amazon and they were very helpful. They suggested trying one thing and if it did not work to contact the manufacturer about it. They gave us the needed contact information . When the first solution did not work, we contacted the company. The company refused to respond to our emails."
"Installation instructions are essentially just how to turn it on, turn it off, and connect to the internet.There is a tech support contact listed but it costs money to use.  I took it to a local computer repair shop, even they could not get Outlook email to connect, just goes into a long wait cycle and loops back to entering email address and password.  A brand-new computer...set up technical support should be free and easy to reach a real person.EDIT to Add:I did call HP and talked with a tech.  He said HP requires a $79.95 service contract for technical support (almost half the purchase price of the computer), the warranty does not cover trouble shooting, only repairs or replacement once they identify the problem...which they won't do without a service contract!"
nice computer but my granddaughter said it its given her the things she need like my acer that she continue to still use mine which is a problem.
It's an ok laptop but a little slow when opening programs the battery life is not good I have been using it for not even 3 hours the battery was at 73%  and you just kept going down so fast I can't believe it that's a big problem for me
I would not use this for much else. There is very little storage & runs about as slow as you would expect for a laptop this price.There is one minor flaw with mine.. the mouse trackpad feels like it’s broken. It works. But feels weird when clicking like it might break so I use an external mouse.
It is sooo slow wish I would of paid attention to the return policy bc it’s so not worth it
Very basic computer. Good as a backup but not suitable for hard use...
"The only reason I gave this laptop a 1 star is because I had to so I could write this review. It is actually a 0 star.I really did buy this computer and tried to use it.I do not recommend this laptop if you plan on doing anything on the internet, including email. I can do an internet search, but cannot load any internet pages.I live in a rural area so, I thought my internet was not good enough. I tried to use the internet at a friend's house and still I could not go to any internet pages including amazon.com, Gmail.My son works in IT, I called him for help. I showed him the laptop, he told me,""this computer is wildly underpowered for a modern computer."" and "" This computer specifications are the system requirements to just run the operating system.I learned a lesson, I should have asked for help BEFORE I bought a laptop."
"Idk what happened. It looks like new. Booted up on day one. Day 3, no power, light, sound, dead... Nothing happened either. Sending it back."
It is a cheap laptopBut you get what you pay forThankfully it was for my son.
It’s kinda slow. I bought the 64 gb one for more space and the system itself took a bunch of it away so I barely have any left.
This laptop is way too slow. I do not like the fact that you have to pay in order to access Microsoft Word.
Runs a little slow but other than that it’s good.
"I only had this computer a month. I only use it for work, which is not often, maybe a couple of hours during the week, a day. And as soon as I passed the return window, it stops working. The key board is unresponsive, it’s glitching all the time. Wasn’t worth the purchase."
I wasn't expecting anything amazing for $200 but I was definitely expecting it to be faster. Desktop Computers in the 90's were faster than this thing.  May be returning.
Very cheap feeling and laggy
It's slow
"While this laptop was bought 'on the cheap', it's proven to be almost too terrible to even use! It's extremely slow. It only has two USB ports, which isn't an issue unless you choose to use a wireless mouse/keyboard - then you're down to only one availble USB port. I've recently gotten into 3D printing, which admittedly, this laptop wasn't purchased with this in mind, but it's really showing its processing limitations now. A widely used 3D slicer program barely opens in this laptop, leading to many failed starts. Once open though, the laptop can manage to process all exectutions. I can't help wondering if a better laptop could do it faster though. Once again, I bought this 'on the cheap' and know that more often than not, when it comes to electronics, you get what you pay for. Caveat emptor."
"The laptop does half the things I need it to do and they billed me twice. My bank account is now negative. The laptop won't install NetBeans. I bought it as a back up to use NetBeans. I am now forced to use Visusl Studio. The Microsoft monopoly in full effect. I would say more, but because of the negative bank account just before I was headed to the supermarket is making my blood sugar drop. It's hard to write reviews when your so hungry tgat your stomach is touching your back"
"This laptop is good enough for school projects/ research projects and online shopping, watching netflix. it is not very loud and the speaker is on top right by the keyboard which i dont like. It's not heavy, small and easy to carry around. Battery does not last 10 hours as they say but its good enough for the price."
"Well, went and bought another refurbished HP - UGH!THIS particular laptop is SOOOOOOOOOOO SLLLLLLLOOOOOWWWWW!!!!!!Absolutely unacceptable!!Click on something ...wait ...and nothing happens.  Sooo, it's clicked on again - but, by that time, the laptop has 'caught up' and the screen you wanted comes up - BUT, you've clicked on it that 2nd time and the screen goes away just as soon as it comes up.Sheesh!  It's ridiculous trying to accomplish anything.Hate, HATE, HATE this HP laptop!"
"This is probably one of the slowest starting computers ever, it works for about 10 minutes then becomes slow and stops letting you click the mouse pad."
Too many installed apps make it seem like the computer is too slow.  And it is. I deleted more than half of the installed apps (Xbox etc) and now works fine
First thing I had to wait 10 minutes just to get It on second anytime I would try to open A app it would crash or not open third it was laggy dont buy not even worth for 30$
ok but I would suggest buying a different one.
"Online shopping while listening to a YouTube video and checking email causes the computer to freeze, or crash."
"I never leave reviews but I will save you the trouble. Product is horrible. Will not allow me to download ring central, Netflix anything. The “s mode” but be removed however after TWO hours on the phone with HP they couldn’t help me either. Unless you’re just trying to browse the internet. Save yourself the trouble!"
I returned the computer. It wasn’t right for me. I could not figure it out. It’s already been returned. Thank you.
"This is so slow it is nearly useless. Spend a little more for something with more than 4 GB Ram. Note to self: you get what you pay for, and this was a waste."
"So slow, sometimes it connects to the Internet but usually it doesn't. Bought for my daughter as a Christmas present and it started presenting issues right away but I just assumed it's because we were used to the Google setup. Took forever to figure out how to get it to connect to the internet because it didn't do it automatically constantly have issues with it staying connected to the internet and it's so slow can't open the Microsoft edge web browser half the time. I kept the box just in case I had to return it but I kept giving it the benefit of a doubt thinking we'll get it figured out but my daughter uses her sister's laptop and hasn't touched this more than twice in the last 3 months so I decided maybe I'll take it over so I can actually get some use out of it but it's so frustrating I'd rather just use my phone. It also doesn't support apps like kids messenger fyi"
"My daughter uses this for school. They use slack for communication and many other online sites. If you have multiple tabs open it’s slow. If you look at it the wrong way, it’s slow. Unfortunately did not live up to expectations.12/9/24 UPDATE - pretty much useless for her. Her school uses Slack and it is extremely slow. Anything she tries to do on it is slow. Very frustrating. I wish I never would have wasted money on this"
"I figured I would go ahead and get this despite the negative reviews, that’s my fault. My issue with this one was the touchpad stops working only minutes after being on. The one way around this is to use a usb mouse which might as well use a desktop at that point. Granted this is refurbished, so every device will be different. But one thing all these buyers seem to have in common is something will definitely be wrong with it."
"set up instructions left out critical information. you can't use a land line phone number. you must have a cell phone that receives text messages. locked me out of everything trying to send me codes which i could not receive. The best reason i purchased was for the fingerprint reader, which was not operational."
"The ""free"" suite of apps is next to impossible to activate. Trys to give just a few days trial.  Slow and takes forever to set up. Buy any other item."
Small and lightweight but barely works. Junk. You get what you pay for. It is extremely slow and has graphics reminiscent of the original Nintendo.
It's slow and dull screen
Bought two and have to return them. These computers are so incredibly slow it takes ten minutes just to open the settings app. Save your money.
They breakdown and can’t be fixed
"I wanted an inexpensive laptop to perform very simple tasks like storing personal documents and using basic programs like word and excel. This computer is not the answer. It takes at least 2 minutes to wake up, every program I use takes a long time to start, and websites load at a snails pace.I'm talking extremely basic laptop functions are difficult for this machine...Do not buy! Looking for a refund"
"Want to look at your apps? Yeah go ahead and wait almost 2 minutes just for it to show. Want to download a new browser? Yeah well good luck, because every time you visit a website; ""this page is not responding."" And i am 100% certain it was not internet related. The whole machine itself felt cheap, manufacturing wise. Glued together by pathetic plastic. It pissed me off so much that not even within 30 minutes of trying to get this thing to work as intended. BAM the fastest jab of all time right into the kisser, the screen couldn't withstand my power, and immediately shattered under the pressure. In all seriousness I spent 200 dollars on this thing and broke it because of how infuriatingly useless it was. Do, not, buy."
I liked the product but it suddenly stopped working in less than 6 months. Bummer!!! Can I return it???
"I bought this laptop as a gift for my mother in law. Looked brand new. But once I logged on & tried to set it up for her, it kept showing someone else’s name. I reset the laptop & tried again & it was the same result. Will be returning this weekend. It just sucks cause I was so excited to give it to her but now I have to find her a replacement"
This computer is so slow! I got this to replace a broken computer my daughter needed to finish homeschooling. All she needs to do is access one website to do her lessons and it takes forever. Going from one website to another or toggling between a website and a word document is awful. I wouldn't waste your money. And it's not a touch screen.
A defective was delivered by amazon. I Iattempted to return the defective item. I was told the only place I could return the defective product was miles from my homeThey could deliver the product to my home as they were paid. Pickups generate no income. Something to think about. Although this will be my last trsansscartion with amazon
The laptop has froze up since the first day I bought it. The dates never update and the power doesn’t always turn on. Not worth the money. I have more issues than good experience
will never buy a HP product again...
"I have used HP laptops for awhile and I am usually pleased until I received this one, and the bad thing about it -is I bought 2. It takes a long time to load when you turn it on and it shows page is not working alot. But I need a computer for now so it will have to do. We will make it work."
Won’t let me factory reset at all! Or delete my info off the computer
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            its a very pretty and neat laptop but if you are looking for something to do any type of office or school work then don’t buy this. You’d think it would be capable of simple tasks but its not.
When opening an app other apps will open up
"The packaging and the shipment was good but the laptop itself is not fully OK it’s still had a little glitch to it, but it would still function"
Nice size and all but it runs super slow.
"if you close the laptop without going into the start menu and shutting it down op selecting sleep it will lock up every time, have to hold the power button down a long time to force shutdown then restart and hope it will come up, sometimes takes 4 or more times doing this to get the computer to start up, really frustrating."
"I received the computer and did not use it right away. I started using it on 9/18. I started to notice that when I used the shift key it either did not work or that it remained stuck. Either way, there was a constant pressing of the shift key to get the function to work or turn off. I would not suggest this computer for working at home. Not good due to the buttons not functioning properly. Disappointing."
Very cheap keyboard and slow processor.
"This laptop won't wake up from sleep mode without doing a hard reset. I contacted customer service and their fix was to try to get me to buy a $40 usb OS reinstallation, not covered by warranty. So I have a defective computer that they won't fix without more $$. I also had to tweak keyboard settings, as it was randomly turning on CAPS lock as I typed. All in all it's a cheap, basic computer with a terrible warranty."
"This laptop is beautiful, but it does feel cheap. I don’t mind that too much, but what is absolutely atrocious is the fact that is embarrassingly slow. It takes forever to load anything. I might have to return this."
The battery broke down within one year of purchasing
Not what I had in mind...very slow
"THIS LAPTOP, WHILE GOOD QUALITY, SHOULD BE PURCHASED WITH MORE THAN 4G MEMORY.  IT'S VERY SLOW WITH 4G BECAUSE IT HAS SOO MANY THINGS RUNNING.  IT'S BETTER TO SPEND ANOTHER $100 OR $200 AND GET THE BEST THAN TO SAVE MONEY AND GET SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE UNTIL YOU UPGRADE IT."
This is an absolute disappointment. I've had it less than 2 months and I am completely locked out of it with no way of getting in. Total waste of money
"It’s really just in simple terms— a sucky laptop. It takes FOREVER to load anything and sometimes some of the applications don’t even load. Before you say anything, I deleted all of the unnecessary apps too and it still was slow AF. Do not buy this computer I beg you. I bought it because my original chrome book died out and I was in a crunch for college. 200 dollars for this is crazy because it sucks. I tried completing the FAFSA form on this too and I had to restart my computer 5 separate times. Please just save your money. I’ll be returning this for a 175 dollar Chromebook.Edit: I actually got an iPad with a keyboard case. Again this computer is absolute donkey crap."
I was going to use this laptop for school but I would not allow me to save or install anything. It always said the storage was full.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It says it ships from Amazon but read the small print as these are actually sent to Amazon from a 3rd party. Received the laptop and within a matter of days we were having massive issues. This was only used to try and complete an assignment in word. It was constantly freezing and in some cases as you can see in the video it didn’t matter if I was hitting the plus/Equal sign or the plus sign and shift - it only put out the plus sign. This made it unusable since hitting the number 7 would only give the symbol and not the number. Then we noticed the laptop was registered to someone else - so they are clearly selling used laptops as new. Avoid at all costs.
the computer is bad  locks up 2 to 3 times a day and sometimes it will not turn on
"This laptop is not compatible with windows updates. I get a blue screen EVERYTIME it updates! It takes me a day to recover. Sometimes, I'm just lucky that the 12th time I restart the PC, it comes on. This is only 3 months old to me. What a waist of money! I would bet 1 $ this is why this PC was turned in. It should have been destroyed as there is no fix in the works coming from Microsoft."
They don’t get any stars
The screen was smaller than what I thought it was going to be when I played my game it was choppy. Then I returned it and got charged $35 restocking fee. I could have bought it at Walmart and returned it for nothing. I'm done with Amazon
"Everything about this laptop is fine, except for the fact that the WiFi will just randomly drop requiring a restart.  And if you close it, then reopen it, the chances of it reconnecting to the wifi again are less than 10%.  You pretty much need to get used to the idea that you will constantly ne restarting this thing to keep it connected to your wifi.  I do like the shade of blue on the back of the screen though."
Bought to be able to run silhouette off of  and it requires Windows's but didn't realize this Chromebook only ran off of chromeOS and even using Parralle to get windows it wasn't compatible with computer. But seems to be great for anything else.
So far so good. It says backlit keyboard but there is none.
"Everything was okay, but the laptop is slow even with just a few tabs."
This replaced an old Chromebook I already had that was super basic I didn’t need anything special I paid about $200 for my original that was about 10 years ago maybe more so I decided it was time for an upgrade. I ordered this one this is quite literally the same exact thing only blue and it’s a little faster but that’s about it. I don’t remember how much I paid for it but if your looking for super basic this is it.
Touch screen not always as responsive as it should be.  Battery life not as long as posted.
"I just received this Lenovo Chromebook and things from the initial setup did not seem correct. For starters the wifi kept disconnecting and the files I have on Google like videos were slow to load or did not play at all. Mind you all I have another less expensive Chromebook which does not go through these glitchy hiccups. There's also several websites that I have to manually adjust the size and despite the default with this particular Chromebook to view webpages is at 100% it seems like it's zoomed to 250% by default of how distorted the page looks.I also saw wax paper as covering for the keynoards and that's something not on Lenovos laptops when you buy them. The box also looks like it's one of those extra ones they have laying around and they just put some unofficial stickers to it. All in all it seems like this has been used and returned, so I might have to return it too. Folks be careful and only buy from Amazon and shipped from Amazon. Thanks."
"The Amazon listing for this item is incorrect, either as a result of incompetence or fraudulent advertising.  This laptop does NOT have a backlit keyboard.  I confirmed this with two phone calls to Lenovo, whose tech reps stated it most definitely does NOT have back lighting, never has, and never will.  I purchased this particular make and model because I wanted an affordable Chromebook with back lighting.  I have invested too much time and effort switching over to this laptop to return it and start the shopping process all over again.  It is a decent Chromebook, and otherwise functions well.  After checking the reviews (too late!) I have learned that I am not the only customer to be fooled by this.  It is frustrating and disappointing to see that Amazon has still not corrected the serious error in this listing, and continues to sell the item under false advertising."
"It’s extremely slow and freezes constantly. Sometimes I just give up and to the task on my phone. For the price point you’re probably getting what you pay for, but I wouldn’t recommend this for anyone but a child"
"I thought the whole thing was broken. When I first got the laptop it would not turn on. I tried different outlets, making sure the charger was plugged in correctly, everything I could think of. It wasn’t working, I tried a different type c charger I had lying around the house. Not a laptop charger whatsoever but as soon as I plugged it in, it turned on. So it was just the charger. I would’ve returned the whole thing if I didn’t try the new charger. I will see if they will send me a charger for free because I don’t want to have to go buy a charger when it should’ve came with a working one. But other than that the laptop works great."
This is a wonder laptop for a student. This definitely is not for business purposes. All of my zoom meetings keep dropping and it cannot handle all the things I do for business. Do not misunderstand. I will give this Chromebook to my daughter for school because this may serve her better
I have had this computer for a little over 2 months and have used it regularly. If you have more than 7 tabs open it is almost in usable. This makes it very difficult to get much work done. I am disappointed with this purchase and expected better.
It works fine when it actually works.  Will not connect or stay connected to the internet.  Have lost too much information to continue using.
I would like to enjoy a stable screen. This one moves to much without assistance
"The vote is still out.  I mean, why click alt +backspace when you can just have a delete button????"
Honestly not enjoying the experience. Definitely regretted this purchase. The computer is quite slow and doesn’t have windows applications and it just doesn’t work too well. I was warned about this but I didn’t listen. A good hp is definitely better.
It came with some sort of school or business account locked on to it that I couldn’t get rid off without administration. I bought it for my dad to use for his business. But luckily I was able to add a new account.
"I use it for art exclusively, decent compatibility with a wacom tablet.sluggish when opening apps but no in-app lag after.Rare app crashing."
I have had this for a couple of weeks.  This is my 5th chromebook and I have never had trouble with any of the others.  This one keeps freezing up on me and I have to close it down so I can start over.  I rarely return anything but I did want to return this.  Just to be aware that if you buy this piece of junk that you have to return it in the original packaging.!!!!!!  Who keeps packaging for a week or 10 days?  I will just toss this and think before  ordering on Amazon for electronics.  I will get a new one at best buy or somewhere else.
"Got online with product support and after a difficult and unsuccessful process trying to get it to reboot, and needing to use a magnifying glass to find the serial number, we were told to request a replacement. It has been two days and we have not gotten any sort of response about our request. Buy another product. There is certainly plenty of competition."
"My daughter's new Chromebook for school this year will not charge any longer. It has to be plugged in, to turn on. You can not communicate with anyone from the store I bought it from or even message them. It is impossible to find customer service with Amazon!! And the Lenovo customer service number no longer is a working number. I'm trying to find out the warranty and how to replace it., and they are trying to hide this imformation. So they are getting a horrible review from me. 0 stars, no 1 star (I was forced to do that)!! Do the right thing replace this faulty Chromebook."
"Just got this in August. It’s mid November now. It’s been glitching badly. Won’t let me type, will click out of pages or options/actions. Will choose a different option, etc. Power washed it twice to see it’d fix the problem."
This is a terrible product and I am insensed that I paid this much money for it. Despite trying everything to improve processing speed the computer lags horribly and the touch screen randomly stops working. Don't waste your money.
I try to get on my email and it keeps syncing and it never does get done from syncing. Not happy with it at all at the moment!!!
"No apps will work on this, websites like google maps do not respond well, and it often takes about a minute to wake up from sleep mode. My cheaper Acer chromebook I bought 7 years ago works much better than this. Only reason I bought this is because I lost the charger, and figured it was time for an upgrade. Guess I'll just buy that charger now, and use this as a paper weight."
"Lately when I attempt to join a video meeting,  I see a pink ball as seen in the picture I uploaded. I'm very disappointed as this is a fairly new purchase. Seller, please let me know how to proceed, thank you"
"When I first received this earlier this year I was very happy with this chromebook for browsing.  But recently it has become despairingly slow, reports no internet (other devices continue to function at the same time), and crashes fairly often.  The chromebook I had previously aged out, no updates, but did not have any of the maladies mentioned before.  I don't know what changed between then and now to ruin my experience but that's the way it is now"
"If this is supposed to be Lenovo's flagship Chromebook, I hate to think what their standard version is like - endless hardware and software problems and limitations of all kinds. True, it's not expensive - but it shouldn't even exist."
"I liked the laptop. However, when it told me I could not access the Amazon website.  I was done."
"Overpriced, no backlit keyboard. Best Buy & Costco had it on sale for less expensive!"
Keyboard stopped working after a few months
"Bought this due to my last PC crashing on me. Only needed personal computer for Job applications and personal documents. Low bandwidth items that don’t require a lot of PC power or memory.It is extremely slow toggling between tabs and frequently crashes on me. Often times when I Goto a Google doc, the entire page is buggy as showed in the attachment. Only after I highlight the area will it appear on the page. I would advise to pay more for a better experience. I’ve owned this for about 10 days and am extremely unhappy with my purchase.I don’t really use the touchscreen- but have had no issues with that thus far."
key pad does't work most of time now it is frozen up
"I'm a big fan of chromebooks but this one is absolutely horrible. All chromebooks I've bought have been $300 or less so I'm not comparing this one to more expensive ones. This one is beyond slow. Like, it's actually alarming how slow it is. Every chromebook I've owned has been pretty much identical in its speed/capabilities. Because they do everything through the web, 99% of stuff has only the lag associated with regular web browsing. This one somehow takes twice as long to load pages and even freezes which is unheard of with my other chromebooks. If I wasn't so lazy I would definitely return this."
The screen glitches sometimes. I have to restart the computer every morning because it will say it's not connected to my wifi when it is. Don't buy it.
Most apps does not work well on it (slow and shutting off) ---  frustrating
The whole reason I bought this was for school but when I sign in I click the I agree button and nothing happens. Waste of money
"I wanted to purchase a chromebook for my father, and he requires a backlit keyboard. Despite the product information specifically says ""Special Features: Backlit Keyboard"", it does not. That is extremely misleading and we are returning it immediately! Adverstised wrong!"
It only lasted like two months then it just stopped working 1 star
"Would not work with common educational programs like Clever.  Screen flashes when games are open. Tried to troubleshoot, but happened on both we bought, so sending them back now."
It's a google product and requires you to login with your gmail and then verify on your phone and is a huge pain in the a.s!!!
Chrome book worked fine for a month and a half.  Now it will not charge and the return window is closed.  Very disappointed in this purchase.
"I bought this and wanted to return it but missed the return window while traveling. This machine says ARC failed to load, and I have done everything to get it to work, and it will barely load Chrome to browse the web. This is hands down the worst lagging computer I have ever owned."
"I have only used Chromebooks for many years, so I know what to expect. This is the ""flagship"" chromebook? How? This is SO SLOW. It is unusable. I have six tabs open and it is absurdly slow. I'm not gaming, I'm not overloading this with dozens of tabs.I like Lenovo and my past 3-4 machines have been from them. But this is a bad machine. It is literally unusable."
"OMG what a waste of money I thought in 2024 ANY computer could handle having 6-8 chrome tabs open at once. But I was wrong. Even with no other apps open, chrome was not functional."
It seemed like a good chromebook at a good pricepoint. But the `h` on the keyboard is defective within a month of usage.
I ordered a chromebook and it was broken  when I received it. I never got a shipping label so I could send it back to get a refund.im so mad about this.
The most frustrating Chromebook I have ever purchased. It is so slow that my grandchildren won't even use it.
Thing glitches the first day I got it. Not worth $50
"Arrived dead, did not come with the accessories. Slowest computer ever. I have a 10 year old acer that runs faster."
I returned the defective item and still have not received a replacement. I have contacted the seller multiple times and have gotten no response.
They gave me a defective computer then only refunded me $18 when I paid almost $200! Do not pay this company!
Laptop only worked once. Laptop doesn’t turn on
Chromebook wouldn’t charge. Battery Test said it had no battery.  Disappointing.  Returned for refund.
"I got this ""laptop"" for College as I needed a device that was able to use work, excel, etc. This laptop freezes on me if I have more than five tabs open, and the lags on me if I move it even a little bit fast. To open up a file, like a word document, you have to go through about 3-4 different apps, and pop-ups before getting to the document. I bought this because I searched ""good laptops for students"" and this popped up. It seems the reviews don't explain how this is completely different from any other laptops, and makes any type of work outside of google difficult. I would not recommend this to ANYONE. It's only been 2 months and I am beyond sick of it. If you want work done, make sure you have a lot of time because this one crashes under pressure."
Bought two chromebooks and both cases cracked near the hinges just from normal opening. Only buy metal cases.
The audio was completely messed up and had a constant cackle in the background. This laptop came fresh out of the box. It only has 1 USB port and NO hdmi port. I guess I should have looked into it more. This is extremely bare bones. Would not recommend.
Very disappointed in this Lenovo Chromebook.  Frequently got messages that I had to 'wait' for the new page to appear.  Liked the touchscreen but very disappointed in response time.
"got this for college and the first issue i had was the touchpad randomly deciding it didn’t want to work one day. nothing happened, went to like 3 different customer supports and all i got was that it was permanently stuck in touchscreen mode and the only way to use is with touchscreen. second issue i had is it just doesn’t charge? charging port is clean, i know the charger works since i use it for my ipad and apple pencil. im literally in college the last thing i need is waking up to my computer refusing to turn on and then finding out its dead after its been ‘charging’ for over 12 hours"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I just came here as this thing reboots for the third time today and I've only been awake several hours but when I purchased this I was swayed by the reviews and influenced to buy it. So but it doesn't handle a multitude of functions very easily at once and definitely if Apple developers are practicing with your devices personally and you're aware of it do avoid purchasing this machine because you'll be going up the wall and may throw the device out the window, thankfully my window here has a screen and cannot fully open so I'm pleased to say the flying lesson was a 90% success since after that the camera didn't work completely somehow, something internally seemed to knock loose and come between the camera lense and glass protector, oddly, something I've never seen a computer do. Or anything. Kay. If you have a short temper I do not recommend this one in any measure.Calculator type of tasks is what this is cool for."
"Love this computer so much - except I have to tuck the cord underneath the front left corner to hold the power cord in place so error message doesn't pop up constantly. I reached out to ASUS support and they had me change some settings, etc. but nothing has helped.  Very frustrating because the battery life isn't great and you really have to use it plugged in.I suspect the only thing is to send laptop in for repair, but don't really want to do that, so stuck using it 'set on an angle' due to power cord tucked under it...Otherwise it's been great, play a lot of Steam games, Final Fantasy XIV, etc. and looks and sounds absolutely great.  Very fast, but bought add'l RAM to upgrade."
"When I needed to look for a new laptop, I considered going back to Windows since it’s both cheaper and less nuanced than using a MacBook Pro. I saw this on Amazon for sale and thought to myself “this could be a great fit for me.” I was wrong, however.When going to set up everything, there were two things that made me want to give up on making this my new computer.For one, editing things was a pain. The RGB lighting, which I was a little excited about, just wouldn’t change without something that plagues every gaming laptop ASUS offers; Armory Crate. This is needed to edit the lighting among other things. It constantly needs to update which was not my cup of tea. I managed to get rid of it, but couldn’t get anything to change the lighting.Also, I realized that I didn’t need all the excess materials that came with the computer. The i7, bloatware (besides armory crate, and windows 11 being painful to deal with (making an account, editing a lot of GUI so it doesn’t bug me with news and weather widgets) all made me want to go back to getting a new MacBook Pro over this contraption.If you want a good laptop for gaming without all the fuss, try looking at Lenovo Legions instead. It also runs Windows 11, but doesn’t annoy you as much while being more cost effective (even being some of the best of the best if you’re looking into that type of stuff).Don’t let deals fool you into getting a laptop brand you don’t know about. Do some research first!"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            First of all, this thing has great specs for the price.  Unfortunately, it's not for me.  I wanted to like it but all the lights are a bit too obnoxious for my liking.  I'm sure they can be turned off but there was no flash card in the box that told me how.  It's probably a simple combo keypress.  Anyway, I set up Windows and rebooted after the first round of Windows' updates.  It booted into the bios on the section for flashing the bios.  Weird.  I didn't interrupt the boot process.  It did have a message to plug in the laptop even though it was 95% charged.  I exited the bios and powered off/on.  Same thing.  I decided to plug it in and powered off/on again and let it along.  After 10 or so minutes, I see what you see in the video.  Seemed like it wanted my attention so I press a key and there's Windows.  Ok, that looks good.  But why is it flashing like that?  Windows had been updated and loaded.  There was nothing that told me I needed to do anything.  So I let it be and after a minute or so, it went back to the flashy process in the video.  I pressed a key and logged into Windows and everything was fine after that.  I'm not sure why this thing had to flash like that just to tell me Windows was ready to log in to.Aside from that, it seems like a great machine.  It's built like a tank without being too heavy.  Screen is pretty.  The few games I tried (American Truck Simulator, Euro Truck Simulator, Mars 2030) played beautifully.Anyway, maybe that's a silly reason to give it 3 stars.  The laptop itself probably deserves 4/5 stars but I had a 3 star experience."
"Touch pad is garbage.  The press only works 20 percent of the time.  Usually it pulls up the right click menu, no matter where you press the pad.  Every time you type, the cursor is somewhere else, as the pad is positioned right where you rest your hands to type.  It's like not a single person at Asus has actually never used this laptop to see if the ergonomics are ok.There is no sd card slot of any kind as well.  Stupid on a machine like this.  Yes, I should have read the description better, but in 2024, shouldn't all computers have a memory card slot?"
"This laptop is decent I guess. The charge does not hold very long (I mean like it only lasts maybe 3 hours at most without the charger). If you like having sound while playing I don’t recommend this laptop bc the sound quality is absolute TRASH. All in all I’m going to keep it because those things aren’t a huge deal for me, but I know more serious gamers than I would probably mind. The speed on this is mediocre as well. Let’s just say I’m glad I got this thing on sale or I would be sending it back. Even with the it being on sale I’m sure I spent more than what it’s worth."
"Overall, this laptop is great, and it's already been serving me well, there's just a few problems with it. I've seen this stated elsewhere in reviews and I too have to say that it has rare stuttering issues where a game or other program will freeze suddenly for about a second or two before resuming. It isn't major but it's still an annoyance, and I hope it gets fixed with a software update eventually.The larger problems, to me, are that the touchpad is absolutely massive, way bigger than my old laptop, and I have to keep it disabled constantly because it's way too easy to accidentally press when typing, and that the screw for the second M.2 SSD slot cannot be removed. I don't know who or what tightened that screw down but it's down so tightly that I cannot move it at all, no matter how much force I try to apply, to the point that I'm absolutely certain that the force required to remove it would be impossible without stripping the screw and also damaging internal parts around it.It's kind of mean to sell a laptop with a second M.2 slot that has a nonfunctional screw. I plugged in an SSD anyway and am just using the laptop case to hold it in place, which has a risk of it popping out, though said risk is lessened by me not taking my laptop with me outside anywhere so there's very little chance of it being jostled."
I works. But the keyboard is so low quality that if you type any faster than 40 words per minute it'll skip letters. I've also found that the machine would crash when I plugged in headphones but that's only happened about a couple of times. The graphics aren't ad but the set-up is intrusive getting to the point of trying to force you into subscriptions until you've gone through the entire process.I don't regret buying it but it's reaffirmed why I have been avoiding Asus computers. Can't say that I would buy it again.
Heavy and battery life isn’t great.
"My first ASUS Rog started failing to boot up in first 2 weeks of using it and needed to be returned as nothing worked to fix it. My replacement unit has had a couple of blue screen events and a few boot-up failures. It mostly works, but has more failures than any of my other windows devices."
"initially, I was impressed by the design of the laptop then almost instantly started noticing problems with the screen where some parts of the screen became black for a second then it went away and it wasn't a big deal then 3 months later out of nowhere the screen had lines all over it and gets worse over time to the point I can't read the screen I just bought a monitor to keep using it.The second thing was the audio where the volume went up and down even after I tried every solution possible and contacted the support and still the same problem and one of the speakers was not even working.The last thing, shipping which was the worst part, I had to make phone calls every day to UPS for them to deliver my laptop when the laptop was already in my country MOROCCO and it took UPS almost a month to deliver my parcel I think Amazon should stop using UPS for shipping parcels to Morocco, DHL is so much better.I still believe it is a good laptop very powerful and the design is very nice and you can play any game on it but it has many issues that Asus need to fix I think a better alternative is Legion 5 pro at the same price range but I haven't tried it yet"
Headline pretty much says it all.  Cooling is subpar and fans were such garbage they gave out in under 2 years and  to replace them is anywhere from 70 to 100 dollars depending on shipping.  Crappy little fans must be made of gold to cost that much . . .
This computer is great but even as I just try to type this it freezes.  Everything else is pretty good for the price.  The freezing is livable but annoying.  Not sure how to get support aside from shinanaghins with customer support online.
"I received the laptop around january and all was going well, i loved the laptop. There were minor bugs but nothing worth wanting to return the laptop. I downloaded Nvidia Control Panel to customize the integrated settings the computer has set automatically. The laptop for its specs was running poorly to the point i had to set all settings to performance and even then it didn’t feel like a 4060. The laptop’s performance varied from day to day and i scoured the internet to find out why. When the laptops return date closed the laptop started performing horribly. I’m talking random spikes of fps from 300 to 60 to 40. Constant stuttering and the wifi getting worse. The laptop is fine for anything but gaming and i feel that’s pretty ironic. I did buy it for gaming hence it is a gaming laptop. I’m trying to figure out what i can do to get another of the same model because this model gave out on me and this was NOT advertised in any video i watched regarding the laptop or reviews i’ve seen. I expected to get the best i mean 4060 13th Gen i7-13650HX… 16 GB of ram there is no excuses for bad performance. I honestly want to hope i just got a bad model because i spend a lot of money just for this to be a great laptop to a disappointing one. I also payed 200$ for a 4 year warranty but the company is making it really hard for me to contact them."
"First the next day delivery didn’t happen and it was 8pm the following day when this arrived. Outer box and inner ASUS box and packaging were fine. However the display cable or connection to the system board gave me the screen pictured. It powers up and the opening audio plays perfectly but that’s all I can say. A complete weekend wasted waiting on a new unusable laptop. Very frustrating and becoming more common with Amazon. They just don’t care anymore. I now have to wait up to 30 days for a refund before I can order a new laptop. I may venture out to brick and mortar stores and I’m leaning toward not renewing Prime. It’s gonna go up in price again and continues to go down in value. The laptop looks and feels nice but it’s useless without a functioning display out of box. Once upon a time, quality control was a thing, but it’s being phased out to save money and shove products out."
"Well, the unboxing was nice. I let it sit on charger for 3 hours. Finally got to boot it up, as it was doing its set up the screen went black and no troubleshooting could solve it. I was forced to do a hard shutdown and start over. So, horrible impression out the gate. I am worried something is wrong with the machine within 4 minutes of turning it on. I hope Customer Service and my warranty are good because I have a horrible feeling about this.Update, Buyer Beware! I was shipped the 2023 model and only found out after hours and hours of set up and downloading programs. Really unhappy. My receipt says the 2024 model, but when I compare specs on this buyers' page they are exactly the same. This seller has the 2023 model, though the price is not bad, it's false advertising. I got a Rog Strix G614JV_G614JV (2023 model), not the 2024 Model promised, Rog Strix G614JV-AS74. Really unhappy about all this. I hate that every unboxing video I watch says ""make sure you got what you paid for"" and that I really had this issue."
"It was fast and ran stuff like Star Field on max at 35-40 fps. Ran everything I threw at it and even connected with the Meta Quest 2 for some cool VR stuff.The bad was that I returned it for 2 reasons. It ran very very hot! Maybe something was defective on mine because even with the fans on JET Engine manual mode the processor was still reaching dangerous levels. You also don't want this laptop on you lap guys if you ever want kids. The other issue was the keyboard. While it was really cool and blinky colors, you can't see the letters on the keys. The light basically bleeds through the entire key not just the letters. Not a issue for the people that don't need to see them, but at night I had to use a external keyboard.My issue with the processor heat may be within ""spec"" but I know heat kills electronics and the more heat, the lower the life cycle. Like I said... it was blazing fast and never melted down but I would strongly suggest a cooling pad."
"The screen is the downfall of this computer and doesn’t even justify the price during intel gamer days. Asus claims 300 nits, but this hardly seemed like 250 nits. The rest of the computer is fine but since you buy a laptop for the portability which means you need to use the screeen, this computer fails. Other brands like HP and Lenovo advertise 300 nits or 350 nits in similar priced computers and their screens are usually even brighter than their specifications.The returning of this computer has higlighted how poor of an experience it is. It was purchased and shipped from 1st party, UPS had it retuned but even now my account says “return started, we are waiting for you to send it” after several chats and calls this can not be resolved. I dare anyone to try and get past the AI chat, ha! Never again knowing this return lack or process will I purchase any item of value from here. I will stick to big stores that I can return in person."
"Laptop runs like an absolute champ, but arrived with a dent in it. Not too happy about that. Really powerful machine though great value."
"Labtop is amazing but months after taken care of it never dropping it, no kind of impacts or over heating, got a random line down the center that changes colors or disappears, depending on what's colors are on the display"
"The laptop felt OK for the most part and the high refresh display was nice. I did constantly have questions about it dropping keyboard inputs in some games -- something I literally never felt in the same games on my desktop.And worst of all, after the warranty was up, there is now a permanent horizontal line across the middle of the screen and a vertical one that shows up sometimes. I've googled it and it seems like a common issue -- care if you buy any of the rog strix series of laptops because it seems to inflict all of them. As far as I can tell, it is a hardware issue with the screen so it will probably never get fixed unless I shell out half the value of the laptop."
Fan stopped working.  Don't buy extended asurion warranty it just sends you to asus.  Difficult to file claim or contact support with asus also.
The laptop came with bad packaging. When opening the box the laptop came almost opened? like it was previously opened before?? Keep in mind that i ordered this laptop new so it’s almost as if the package was resealed and was opened before selling to a customer which is quite ridiculous . The laptop had other major issues such as the boot not loading at all when turning on the laptop u would see the “ROG” loading screen with the dead pixels “the horizontal lines i was talking about” which i had to watch multiple videos to figure out how to get past the bootloop because the laptop had an error called “inaccessible_boot_device” not to mention the other major issue it had with the laptop screen.. The Amazon laptop link advertised the screens refresh rate being 165hz and the laptop was displaying “64 hz” when i managed to fix the bootloop was talking about earlier making this laptop completely useless to be fair. This laptop also didnt come with wifi which is kind of surprising considering this cost me 1200 $ + not including tax so u would think they would at least add wifi support so u can see other networks but no. ? also considering the fact that other and cheaper laptops have them installed?? unless it was just my laptop that didn’t come with it ? taking into consideration that my package looked like it had been previously opened before i received it(came with no plastic wrap on the laptop covering it and came with no manuals ) (i am currently in the process of returning this item so hopefully i don’t get charged or deducted any amount i paid dude to there not being any manuals or plastic wrap on my laptop i received. ( I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS LAPTOP HAS MAJOR ISSUES)
"So I bought this laptop and asus apparently has a really bad issue with the boack screen of death. The only fix is only a temp patch where you shut the computer off, reboot it and hold esc for a few seconds, then press down arrow and enter. The screen will come back on but do any updates that require restart, shut dowm your computer, or let it fall asleep it will black screen so ... If you do buy make sure to set it to never turn off display. When its on amd running its great but the black screen of death issue asus refuses to fix Id say get a different brand."
"The laptop worked fine for the first couple of weeks but then it started suddenly overheating, asus has been having crappy cooling solutions as this is my second time purchasing this exact model. I’m pretty sure it’s with the Liquid Metal not being applied correctly by the machines"
"It started doing what it was supposed to and not even a year later the batter completely died. Won’t charge, won’t come on at all. So disappointed."
"The product arrived with a defect - understandable, as quality issues sometimes happen. The pc made a periodic buzzing sound that drove me crazy. I sent it in for a warranty repair and it was shipped back to me without the issue being fixed! When I called to inquire about it, the operator was unintelligible and simply started a new warranty request rather than pull up any information from the old one.Good product, bad support/repair system. Shame, since I have been such a fan of ASUS products in the past."
"Great laptop for the two weeks I have had it, but as I was shutting it down last night the power supply shorted out with very loud frying noises. Currently waiting on the warranty department to contact me backMine is the 2024 model"
"I've play test with some games and music making and works like a charm with buttery smooth frames, but only issue that brings this down to a 4 star is that whenever I continuously play for a few minutes like 5-15 minutes, the game freeze for a split second with somewhat minor frame drops and it gets annoying to deal with and cause my gameplay experience to not be so good for the most part. I don't know it's a hardware or software issue and my old acer predator never had this issue. But as much as I want to return this laptop back and that I don't have the back that it came with anymore, oh well. I hope a software update would fix this issue or otherwise I'll have to deal with it."
"The first impressions of this laptop were not good, crashed multiple times when trying to set up windows 11, and the bottom left of the trackpad makes a loose sound when you click it. i was able to overlook this due to how well it was performing, running apex at 144fps hogwarts legacy at 60 on high settings, and 60 on elden ring max settings. but after a few hours the buzzing started, it sound like there’s 10 bees stuck in my laptop, and it’s non stop. it happens if the screen is on, there doesn’t even have to be an application running, if the screen is turned on the buzzing starts. it gets much worse when you start a game, and if you bring the laptop closer to your head there’s also a whining sound that’s going on even when there’s nothing running. it honestly sounds like it’s 10 years old and about to die. the only reason it’s not a 1 star is because of how well it performs. i will keep it for a few weeks to see if it fixes itself and if it does i will update review."
1 Very small display listing got me i should have researched. 2 HDMI out has low support will not use the GPU on many monitors. 3 Windows 11 just a bad OP i didn't know how bad. I would not recommend and regret not returning it i tried giving it a chance  many better options out there 1+ it dose run well just runs to hot size is to small for good air flow
I made it about 55 minutes playing niar automata. Extremely disappointing
"I recently bought this laptop and is very powerful, fast and has a good sound quality also nice looking, but playing some game I noticed this light spots on the bottom on the screen I don’t know if is something normal or not. Somebody knows???"
"I found a problem with my laptop so I called ASUS and after 5 calls they finally agreed to take it to the lab after 2 weeks of waiting for them to take my pc because they mark the pc as taken my accident and another week to get it back the problem wasn’t fixed so I called again they told me to send them video proof and after I sent the video the support guy blamed the problem on the application so I told him that I fix computers as a hobby and he told me to fix the computer my self even when I told him that I don’t want to touch the pc when it has warranty and he still told me to fix the problem myself , then I called again and they said that the call earlier wasn’t found in their system ."
"I'm so frustrated with this seller, the first laptop I purchased from them was the 2024 model with the 4060 graphics card, i7 processor, well the laptop arrived, but anytime I turned it on or opened it up, it would take 15-20 minutes for the screen to actually turn on so that I could use it. After several days of trying everything I could think of and everything support suggested to fix it, I decided to return it and get a different one.No cue my real anger, after the replacement arrived, which was sent via UPS and was a hassle to get, I open the box, boot up the laptop, and immediately notice that this replacement looks different and has different amounts of USB ports, HDMI ports, etc, so after I pull up the about info, they sent me a laptop with a 3060, not the 4060 one I paid for, and with a worse processor, smaller SSD, everything was worse. So now I'm initiating a second return.All this to say buyer beware, don't make the same expensive mistake I did. Stay away from this seller."
Im returning the product after trying to play a few games and the laptop sounded like it was trying to take lift off. It seems this computer had more time spent making it look edgy than actually functional. An Ill be honest RGB lights and cool designs all over the machine are kind of cringy. If you buy this laptop beware of the tremendous amount of bloatware that comes installed on it. The only positive I can say about this laptop is that it has a nice screen.Anyways I hope nobody spends money on this computer.
"After only a few months of using it for work purposes, the ""D"" key fell off.  I'm not a heavy gamer.  For my this is a business computer and I needed good video card capabilities.  After going around and around with outsourced customer service, they told me that in order to just replace the key, i would need to send it in and it could take 4-6 weeks to get it back.  I need this laptop for work.  very poor customer service."
"I was really happy with many aspects of this gaming laptop. However, I discovered there is on extreme flaw with Asus gaming laptops. Apparently, when they go into sleep mode (step away for a while, or close the lid after use) there are background programs that cause pretty extreme CPU activity, resulting in massive hear buildup.The first time this happened was the first time I used the computer, then closed the lid to go to a movie. Came back about three hours later and the laptop was easily over 100 degrees. Opened it up, logged in, and the fans kicked on and cooled it off promptly. Happened a second time the next day, when I was working on it, then stepped away for lunch. This time I didn't close the lid, but to same thing happened when the screen timed out.I called Asus support, and their response was ""it's a gaming laptop, so they just do that."" When I explained that this was a known issue (found redditors talking about this issue as long as 2 years ago) the rep said ""yeah, we know. You just have to shut it completely off when you're done with it.""Completely unexcusable design flaw. Luckily I was able to return it to Amazon."
"I don't like to be false advertised, if you google the model number it is incorrect. it's a good laptop just wish seller would be better about this"
When it runs it runs good.  Plays games up to par without issues when it wants to.  My main issue with this laptop is that the USB (C and A) drives decide randomly to cut out and you cant get them to work again until to restart the laptop.  Can be very frustrating.  I deleted the drivers and reinstalled them with no avail.  Also another weird thing is when im using my headphones for gaming the sound card screws up sometimes and i hear sounds in the wrong ear until i unplug and re plug in my headset. sometimes even that doesnt fix it... i know its not my headset because on my tower i never have that issue.  im fairly conviced that its a mobo issue pertaining to usb ports.  also very frustrating. AND THEN after x amount of hours using the pc just starts running slow as dog and practically almost freezing.  i originally thought it was thermal throttling but i checked the temps and it happens sometimes when its not doing anything graphically demanding...  overall i wouldnt recommend im sending mine back.  do yourself a favor and grab an acer predator lmao
"Don’t even waste your money. This thing will struggle to play basic games, gets crazy hot playing low quality steam games. The ram is a big issue. It runs half of it just sitting idle with no programs running. The machine can barely run discord + a game.Quiet but super hot."
Everything was perfect except for the backlight bleeding. It was untolerable but i am afraid to ship it back maybe i will get more worse bleeding on the next.
"The product failed within a year of purchase, and the warranty service has been disappointing. Rather than addressing the issue, customer support keeps repeating the same responses without any real assistance. There seems to be a lack of coordination between the product supplier and Amazon on resolving warranty claims, as Asus customer service won’t accept the Amazon invoice."
Boot drive was bad upon receipt. Kept booting into bios with no drives detected. Asus support was of no help and suggested I use an 11 OS install usb (which I have and tried to use) despite being informed of the issue.
"Got this laptop recently, and just now I found some dead pixels on it’s screen"
"I don’t know if i somehow set up wrong or something, but it often doesn’t follow commands. The only hot keyvor whatever that works consistently is ctrl-esc. None of the other buttons meant to serve one Pepe work consistently, and they certainly don’t work as they’re supposed to. Besides that the mic makes no sense. It recs through your laptop regardless, and there’s no clear way to change it. Regardless of its a windows problem or this laptop brand etc, this isn’ta starter gaming pc, im adept at general pcs, but this one’s ridiculous."
"When I first got it I had some trouble getting it to work right, it would power on but the screen would stay black. I was concerned about this but turning it off and back on seemed to do the trick. It is now a few weeks latter and no amount off restarting will get it to work. After doing some research it seems this is a common problem with Asus laptops and there is no good solution. So yeah, get something else."
Not a great laptop. Disappointed in it for what I paid for it. Not as fast and snappy as I would expect for a laptop with this power. Takes a long time to turn on / wake up. Does OK running some moderate games.
If I could give this no stars I would. Not only did I receive a laptop that won't work but I wasn't even able to return this item. I was given the runaround for weeks. This has been the worse experience ever and now I'm out money. Not even the manufacturer will help me.
Stay away from this. Received it last night and since then I've only been able to boot it up a couple of times. 99% of the time it boots to a black screen. Upon looking into the issue it seems that it's very common with this and other Asus models and has been happening for a while with no official solution.
Booted it up and immediately saw lines streaking across the screen. Must be why its on sale. Now I have to deal with the returning process and wait for well over a week to even see this money come back. What a let down.
Computer getting hot where the battery plugs in at. Melted a bit. Still works for now.
it's not as fast as my last computer and it's very glitchy so no I'm not happy
"Bought Friday, arrived on a Sunday. Looked perfect externally, but started it up and the display looks fractured. It must be something internal because outside it’s fine, no physical damage there. Return process seems straightforward, thanks Amazon. This will be my first and last experience with ASUS though…"
This laptop is total garbage.  I’m not even running games. Just simple programs and it either locks up or completely crashes.It does this 3-4 times a week.  It’s gotten where I’ve got to constantly save my work or risk losing it when it crashes.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS JUNK!
"Monitor was defective upon receiving the laptop. Majority of the screen has horizontal lines across it that do not go away no matter how many times i reboot it. This is either a factory defect, or drivers being too rough with packages."
"The screen has faulty panels, something wrong with the screen. I just got it and what a big disappointment. I try to contact ASUS store for a replacement, but their customer services just hang up on me before I can even speak, extremely bad experience first time buying ASUS laptop and receiving ASUS customer service. Update: the set up page not responding at all, I can not even finish setting up window system. I need to use the laptop, but now I have to wait the process of returning. Worst experience ever, and the Amazon customer services says no replacement only return. For those who see this message, don’t buy asus and don’t believe Amazon replacement policies."
"Amazon delivered defective laptop won’t replace unless I pay another 175$ on top of already paid. Horrible customer service, wifi won’t stay connected for more than 2 mins. And because of their screw up sending me a broken product to get a replacement since it we bought on Black Friday they want me to pay even more than I already have for the same item that arrived defective in the first place. Not sure if I just got terribly unlucky but I won’t be buying another Asus laptop for a long time. Wifi shouldn’t be so horrible hours after unboxing. Not for 1300$."
We bought the laptop in July. After the last return date it started overheating and shutting down every few days. No refund and no reliable laptop. Not happy.
sadly no hdr and no numpad :(.Performance gaming is great!
"As the title says, the computer came with no graphics card."
Packaging great however I keep getting stuck on loading screens or errors and restarts itself
"Build quality seems good, but the processing sucks.  Frequently I have to click 20 times over 30 seconds to get it to respond.  I replaced a 5 year old 503 model because one of the screen brackets broke.  It's way better than this model.  I think I'm going to have to switch brands after being happy with my 4 previous ASUS buys."
loud speakers not working . verry poor online assitance . not efficent at all.
"I got the laptop because my other laptop got damaged . Laptop arrived next day . I set it up, and loaded all my apps on it. Took it to work the following day and it shut off and won't start back up. Now I have to send it in to ASUS to repair or Replace . I needed a laptop right away that's why I spent $1300 on it. Now I'm sure it will be weeks before I have it back. What a disappointment!"
Please do not buy this product. The laptop has manufacturing problems and Amazon is refusing to issue a return label for the faulty laptop.  It has been 1 month since I am waiting for the faulty laptop be pick up at my delivery address. The Amazon Chat Customers Rep are of no help I keep getting the run around.. To think you spend soo much money and cannot be refunded for a faulty laptop. Again DONOT PURCHASE!!!
Ehhh it was ok
It's been not even a half year but horizontal lines started to appear on screen. Worst product
"It has been working well for a few days, then idk why but there are horizontal lines on the screen and you can not fix it, I already tried it, but nothing works. Now I’ll try to get a refund but it says it will take like 30 days or more, I recommend avoid buying this"
Didn’t realize how bad windows 11 could be.
"At first startup, went straight to BSoD with ""internal power error."" Unable to fix, returned to Amazon."
"Shut laptop lid after use and opened next day to a black screen. Keys are lit up, fans are on, but nothing ever comes up on the screen. Even tried connecting to external monitor, but nothing. Frustrating to buy a $1,400 laptop and have to send it off for 2 weeks to RMA shortly after a month of ownership.Runs most games okay from the limited use I had with it, but the bottom is EXTREMELY hot."
This computer started over heating and Asus asked us to bring it in to a nearby microcenter. The device was working when it was brought in and when it was returned it has a blue screen and rebooting loop. I spent hundreds of $$ for this device and I'm very disappointed
I couldn’t find SD card slot
"This computer is sweet, but I gotta give it a 1 star because it is false advertising to sell a product with features on the image of the product but don't actually come with the product. It is a bummer because one of the deciding factors to buy this was because of the touchpad numpad which doesn't exist on this model."
The screen went black less than 2 months into owning it.Super sad. it was a nice laptop overall
"I use Asus for routers, and I needed a gaming laptop about a year ago, so I bought it. It's very shoddy, the finger print reader works about 2-5% of the time, it's honestly meant for one thing, playing games.it does that quite well. It would be significantly better if mine could charge off 240v usb c, instead of its custom ac adapter, but this could be changed in the future."
"Terrible customer service, product arrived months later and they didn’t accept the returned item.  Lights in the keyboard computer makes even a younger person dizzy!"
"Had for 2 days before when screen display went black spent an hr on support for them to tell me to return it. Bad product, bad support, do not purchase any product from Asus"
Laptop died after 1 month and a half. If you got it for a discount like Black Friday beware they sent faulty products .
"The laptop suddenly had some horizontal lines, I restarted it and nothing. According to it, it is still under warranty. How bad Asus, menus that have been in use for a year."
Very disappointed that this gaming laptop couldn’t play games 😭😭😭
Ssd dead less than a month
Good product but Amazon customer support is utterly useless.
"Screen edge warped upon arrival.  I am communicating with Amazon re remedying the situation.  No love so far, though."
This is not as described. It is a Chromebook.
Why is this model nonexistent on the asus website? I ordered this and went to the website and can't find it to download the manual. Warm fuzzies fading...
"ASUS literally the worst computer brand I’ve ever purchased the first laptop. I got with these guys the Internet stopped working three times. I had to send it in each time to be fixed when I got home. It only worked for a short time and then Broken again, then Best Buy replaced the laptop with a brand new ASUS And within three months, the Internet stopped working twice. I spent hours driving back-and-forth from Best Buy talking to text support with.ASUS And currently my laptop is being fixed after they wanted me to pay $120 for shipping. No, it’s not my Internet at home. The router is fine. My other device is work fine the technician said he’s seen this happened before I just think the company is got unbelievably poor quality control. If you value your sanity and you don’t wanna blow your money steer clear of this company, absolute nightmare"
"Purchased Asus recently, motherboard went out within a year. Just barely out of warranty and Asus charged me 160 for diagnostic and shipping and then wanted another 1000 dollars to replace mobo (mind you I bought the laptop for 1300). Don't do it. Stay away from Asus gaming laptops. Even better, stay away from ASUS."
I took the bait on a similar deal and have had to battle processor issues the whole way.
This cheap Chinese $400 computer with Windows 10 will not run the simplest interface software for recording which is what I it bought it for. The owner's manual is so small most of it is in Chinese not impressed at all should have returned it when I had a chance
The computer felt great for the cost. That said the computer included face scratches on lid and also came pre-installed with a password protected user account. Worst part about it is that the previous owner didn't leave a sticky note to tell me how to get into their old computer. Sarcasm aside I received a used laptop. If I wanted a used laptop I would have gone on craigslist or eBay
Good computer for typing papers andresearching websites. Good storage. Bad sound quality and the mouse pad stopped working a month and a half in.
"Bought this received in the middle of June,  easy to use , but I'm not sold on the quality. Touch mouse pad is already non functional.  Messaged the seller , no response!!"
"The mouse pad stopped working after just a couple days. Ordered a wireless mouse to replace it. If that works I'll keep the laptop, otherwise I'll have to return it. Everything else seems to be working."
This laptop is so laggy.Other say that it works fine with games but it doesn’t at all.I can’t even read the  manual.I returned this thing immediately.If I could give it a 0 star I would.DO NOT BUY THIS.
I bought this last October as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She didn't even start using it until she opened it Christmas day and last week it quit working. I had someone look at it and the charging circuit on the motherboard stopped working. They are unable to find a replacement part because of the brand. Now I am out the money and a laptop. I would not recommend this laptop at all.
The charger stopped working and I bought a replacement charger with 13 different plugs and none of them fit the charging port. The guy at micro center had no idea what kind of plug it was and couldn’t help me. Lost hours of work. Waste of money.
It locked me out completely.  Now I can't even get back on there not  even to reboot.the system. Terrible. I'm disappointed.I won't buy. Anything  from this  seller. 1 year and already  sucks. Mother board burnt out
"It starts in Windows 11 - great. But it doesn't take any Windows cumulative updates. Upon review on the Microsoft website, the processor is not compatible (not compatible with TPM 2.0). Also, the Wifi is cripplingly slow but alone that is not a big deal considering the price point.I found another PC on Amazon at the same price that outperforms this in every way."
Since the moment I purchased this laptop it has dropped internet connection no matter where I am or what I am doing. In order to even make a google search I have to reload the page more than 5+ times and hope it loads properly on one of these attempts. It has made doing any actual work impossible. Do not buy this horrible machine
Computer has almost no volume at 100 % I purchased it to stream tv shows live
"Laptop was alot slower than I expected. Looked at the package when I got ready to return it and noticed it says ""15.6 inth"". If this company cant even spellcheck the box that they put their product in then I can only imagine what else gets by them."
Absolutely terrible sound quality. Felt cheap. Return process took a very long time
Very cheap product and wouldn’t charge at all.  Dead
"Update: 8 mos in and it no longer connects to WiFi. Changing our review to 1 star.Overall, it works well but even with very gentle handling the touchpad is dead. What a disappointment."
6 months totally done . Took it to repair  nothing can be done. The tech did not know the parts that made up the computer
"The sound turned up to 100%, you still can hardly hear if you're on Zoom.The fact it's not touch screen 😒 the build in mouse is hard to fine on the device hitting the right click.I'm returning it for a better name brand computer."
Defective laptop.  The keyboard was lacking in build quality to start and has been acting up after use of only 1 month.  Keyboard and trackpad failing.  Have performed a factory default reset.  Had to save work data.  Still acting up after minimal use.  Not sure how to contact manufacture or even see about warranty replacement but am very dissatisfied with the product at this time.
"This laptop sucks doesn’t work , I bought insurance for it and it needs to be returned!!"
can not get the touch pad to activate at all!!!
EDIT TO ADD:: This computer sucks. The battery died after 8 minutes repeatedly after fully charging!!!! Returned
"This unit is identical to the ECOHERO laptop I purchased from Amazon.After running the Windows update function, I found that Windows 11 Pro will NOT update to the version 23H2. The updates STOP at version 22H2. I checked the list of approved Intel processors and the Intel Core i3-5005U is NOT one of them. Something is not right. Who would have thought that Windows 11 could be forced on a non-compliant computer.I do not want to risk running a computer that will not accept the latest Windows 11 updates. I will be returning the ECOHERO computer as it is not as presented. I am a retired IT professional and do not appreciate being ""snookered"".Again, this BITECOOL laptop has the same processor as the ECOHERO laptop."
"The Intel i3 5005U is not supported for Windows 11 which means this was put on this computer using a registry hack, and it also means that you will not be able to automatically update/upgrade to the next Windows 11 feature update - Check Microsoft for supported hardware - only 8th generation or later intel i processors are supported and this is 5th generation."
I have worked on one of these systems for a customer. The system has Windows 11 Pro installed on it but the processor is only a i3-5005U (5th gen Intel). The cutoff for Windows 11 is 8th gen or newer Intel processors. This system will run for awhile but will not receive any cumulative or feature updates for Windows 11. It is basically stuck in the same boat as if it was running Windows 10 that is losing support in Oct of 2025. I do not recommend buying this system as it will be out of date pretty quickly. I'm surprised it was even sold in the first place.
"Firstly this laptop's battery life is complete filt, didn't last a good 4 hours on a full charge. After a few months of literally using this laptop maybe once a week if do much the keyboard just stopped working!!! Just like that! It was still basically new. I thought it maybe there was a software update issue but that didn't help. The next morning when I tried turning it on the screen had completely gone black! This laptop is a piece of trash, would NOT recommend buying. Buy at your own risk!!"
"I hadn't heard about this S mode before, which basically locks you into safe programs from Microsoft. You can't download anything from other sources. Not even Chrome, for example, which the computer insists you don't need, with a pop-up admonishment. ""For your own good,"" as your mom might say. To get out of this took research. You can't even use REGEDIT in Admin mode (which it considers not to be a Microsoft program!). For someone not very techie or computer literate, S mode is probably very useful, but for me it was quite a hindrance.When I found the steps, the mouse would not click the button to get out of S mode. After two days of madness, I was ready to return the laptop, but then tried plugging in an external mouse. With the external mouse, I finally turned this S mode off. This is a permanent change, no going back.Now it's nkta bad machine. But when I tried pair it wirelessly with my new Fire TV, it could not complete the pairing, though the TV recognized the device. After 20 plus attempts, I've given up for now and bought a long HDMI cable.  Possibly there is some setting I can change to make that work, but it's quite disappointing. I use my TV as a large external monitor when home.Battery life is fair. The plug is huge, and won't fit in some strips. I don't even see where the battery might be. I hope it's not the kind that requires a tech to replace.Though it's large (which I like for the screen size), it's fairly light. It fits into my large backpack, which has a padded computer compartment.  It's light enough to carry around, if unwieldy.Because it's solid state, it usually is ready for me pretty quickly, but longer if it was fully powered off.  I'd give it 3 1/2 stars, but the annoying S mode thing made me choose 3 over 4 stars.For the price, it's not bad. I bought it thinking it was this huge Amazon sale, but I've since determined the price is similar everywhere, or even cheaper."
"I bought this laptop to work from home.  I have two additional monitors that I had attached to my MacBook, but the Apple interface is a pain.  Anyway, the only output on this laptop is an HDMI.  You can use an HDMI-to-USB converter, but once you are inside a VPN, you can’t really download the driver.  It’s reasonably quick, and nice looking, but useless if you need dual monitors for work."
"I wanted to get another Lenovo because my last laptop was pretty decent and lasted me 4 years despite the top part becoming detached from the keyboard and needing to be held together with duct tape in its final months. I've had this new laptop 3 days and it took several hours to set up to the way I want it. Had to watch youtube video on how to turn off S mode so I can download programs from the internet instead of the app store.  My thoughts so far:The screen isnt that great, it doesnt appear to be HD, text is almost blurry. It kind of bothers me. My last lenovo was a much higher end model than this. And the battery does not last 7 hours. Maybe 4 at best. I have to use the arrow keys a lot for a computer program and one of the arrow keys is already making a sad little sound, just after 3 days. Hopefully it lasts a few years. Send prayers yall."
"I've bought this computer multiple times over the last 2 years for my business. I was great. This time around,12/10/2023, the computer is now a gunmetal grey and was very hard to program. The Microsoft platform refused to download Google Chrome, where all my presets are located. I had to figure out how to work around that block. which turned out I had to turn off ""Safe mode"" to get it to accept the download. The computer locks you into only ""Microsoft approved"" apps if you don't, which apparently excludes Google products. This computer comes with built in training wheels which are hard to get rid of. I don't want to be sucked into the Google vs Microsoft turf war. I just want a computer that will let me have my presets and download from the cloud backups when the last computer broke. This was way harder than it needed to be, which I resent."
I really liked this laptop until the LCD went out after only 9 months of having it and not using all that much. It’ll probably cost more to repair than I paid for the computer.
"So, its a cheap laptop loaded with windows 11....Laptops are generally underpowered and over priced. For the price of this laptop I could have purchased a pretty awesome mini PC and forked out a bit extra for a portable monitor and powerbank and even a AC to car lighter power adapter for on the go....And got like triple to quadruple the power.As a professional in the IT field I no longer recommend laptops. Unless its a company provided one for travel. But honestly companies need to just provide miniPCs to people who work from home."
"I received what felt and worked like a flimsy laptop, though for the price, I shouldn't have expected more. The laptop I received is 14 inches while it is advertised as 15.6 inches, which is a big deal for those of us who have vision issues.When I registered the laptop with Lenovo, I was informed that the 1-year warranty began in September, 2022, though I purchased the laptop and received it in late February, 2023, nearly five months later. I was able to get the warranty backdated, but that was a red flag.The processing is lousy and the computer makes a loud swishing noise while it's processing which is not normal for a ""new"" computer. This model's processing capacity is not fast as I've come to expect from Lenovo laptops. I don't know if it's just the laptop I received or the case for this model, and I would barely give it a fair rating. Needless to say, I am returning it and buying an HP."
"Used it, screen quality is very bad/ hard to see almost like it had a glare"
"I own small IT company which has been in business for over 20years. I have bought Lenovo products for many years. I have never had to use the Lenovo support for any problem till now.I bought this laptop for a customer with simple needs - Email, Text processing, Internet. Customer wanted to use some apps not supported when PC in ""S Mode"" - e.g.  Firefox.This was my first PC which on I wanted to get out of S Mode in Windows 11.I have removed S Mode from Windows 10 a number of times without any problems. On this PC the process would start and say ""working on it"" but it would never complete. Talked to Lenovo support - not their problem - told to call Microsoft. Called Microsoft - not their problem - told to call Lenovo. After 3 Hours of calls - mostly waiting, I Googled the issue and tried all the solutions including re-installing Windows. Same result. Called Lenovo again. This time, if I pay $129 they could help me. PC brand new, still under warranty but software not covered. Decided to return and buy another brand. First instance of using Lenovo support - not impressed.Please note that the Amazon Description is not accurate. S Mode not mentioned in the description or in detailed spec unlike other products."
"I'm really disappointed with what's happening to me.It's been a month since I received my pc, and when I try to open it, the machine works but doesn't display anything. I contacted the service, they asked me to return the product without any assurance that it would arrive safely and on time. I looked for the solution on the spot by myself, the problem came from the ram card which when I remove it the pc works correctly. I then had to buy a new ram card, but unfortunately the same thing happened: black screen.Now I'm confused because I've lost 4GB of ram, even though it was because of the amount of ram (8GB) on this PC that I agreed to pay for this machine."
"I bought this Laptop in March in preparation for retiring in May.  I use it mainly for personal use, but a little bit for a side business that I own.  After using it for 2 weeks in May, it began freezing every time I moved it. I contacted Lenova support and they instructed me to send the machine back to them for testing.  I use this machine every day and don't have a backup.  I stated that I would prefer a new machine, but that was not granted.  They then kept the machine for 3 weeks and would not offer me a loaner.  I got the machine back and they stated that they replaced the keyboard.  I noticed that it still froze up every 5-6 days when I moved it.  I reopened the ticket, and they want me to send it back to them for more testing.  I asked why this testing wasn't done before the machine was shipped back to me, but the rep could not answer that;  the phone reps know almost nothing and cannot respond with any information other than the canned answers they are given.  So this machine is going back to the shop to be repaired by the same people who had it for 3 weeks in May-June.  Since my retirement in May, they have had it as much time as I have had it.  My wife bought an Acer a year ago.  If I had to do it over again, I would definitely do the same."
"I got this computer at 50% off the original price. I bought it about 3-4 months ago specifically for work. The battery is pretty awful, i feel i cant leave it unplugged for more than an hour before battery saver comes on. The touch screen is cool but i wish i didn't buy one with the touchscreen because the quality is considerably lower for it. However, the computer runs strong i don't have any issues with it slowing down and the touch screen is smooth and responsive. The screen and keyboard are nice and large the computer feels a little heavy but it's very thin and fits great in my backpack and it seems durable as i toss my bag around here and there. Over-all for the price i paid its fair i suppose- but i would NEVER pay full price for it."
"This is not a $959 computer marked down, this is a very inexpensive laptop and I am not sure whether it is even worth the $400 I paid for it.  Don't get me wrong, I am a huge Lenovo fan, but this was not a good purchase.  It appears to have been reconditioned.First, it came with Windows 10s and not Windows 11, which means it is the nearly free version, you have to pay another $90 to make it the Home version.  Second, it is a laptop which I would guess should be more in the $200 range, if that.  It is cheap feeling, the screen is not very bright or clear, and just feels flimsy.  It is disappointing as I have two Lenovo laptops which are fantastic, just not this one.  Also, you can see the connections at the bottom of the screen frame where the frame has partially separated from the actual screen.I read these sorts of reviews on other products and my first thought is 'just a bad shipment' and do not pay much regard to the less then 1%, so I hope you receive the actual laptop in the order screen.  I have returned to Amazon for a full refund."
The screen is not crisp. It looks like there is a filter over it. It is disappointing to have a brand new computer with such a low quality display.
"I bought 4 of these computers and they came locked in what Microsoft calls ""S Mode,"" presumably short for ""stupid mode,"" which means it can only download and use microsoft-published applications. There were two official solutions to this:• Wipe the hard drives, and install Windows 11 Enterprise using using MS-365 credentials• Sign in with your personal microsoft email accounts rather than your work accountsComplete waste of a day!!!!!!  So that you don't waste yours:1. Restart windows 11 in advanced mode2. Disable driver signature validation for this boot (should be option 7 once you get to that menu)3. ctrl+r regedit:4. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Control\\CI\\Policy\\SkuPolicyRequired: 1 > 0"
"My new Lenovo with Windows 11 does not allow installation of Google Chrome unless you remove ""S"" mode. I did figure out how to get Chrome installed, but it sure was irritating. I do not know if it is the Lenovo brand laptop or the Windows 11 operating system that blocks anything that is not a Microsoft product."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I was angry with myself for not reading the description close enough in the first place - it won't work with a pen mouse! But oh well, I bought it, so I started setting it up. First thing: Windows 11 sucks. Looks like all the did was fix a lot of features that weren't broken. Well, eventually I reached the point where you have to install all the upgrades released since it was made. After a couple of them had installed, up popped a message saying I needed to restart, so I did that. And when it came back - what I got was a desktop that refreshed each second or so. I looked online. The only solution I could find was to reset the thing to factory defaults by pressing the ""NOVO"" button. Aha, but where IS the NOVO button? ""Each model is different."" I still have not found it, though I've looked at dozens of pictures on Google Images. I did spend $$$ on the Asurion protection thing but have been too busy to follow up with that. I can't read the serial number because it's on a label on the back in 2-pt type with poor contrast. To top it off, the screen quality isn't good, no way to adjust the contrast, and much poorer than that on my Lenovo Yoga, which is maybe 4 years old. What a piece of trash this is."
"One computer completely stopped working, doesn't turn on, despite being charged.  The other has never been able to download anything through the app store, so it's virtually worthless.  So we now have only 2 out of 4 laptops working after just a couple months.  Very disappointing quality."
"I am a casual user, not a business person and not a gamer.  I like the screen size and brightness, and while I rarely use the touch screen, it does work efficiently.  The speed of operation is excellent and the keyboard has perfect resistance.  All that said, there are some problems that make using this laptop less than comfortable:  It often runs too hot to keep on my lap, the fan is too loud, and on start-up, it emits a high pitched sound (not loud, just high pitched) that is so annoying, I've taken to leaving the room for the first five minutes after turning it on. Probably won't buy another Lenovo, regardless of price."
"After a year of using this laptop it is simply the worst machine ever made. Anytime you touch the screen, pick up the laptop, or anything of the sort, it freezes and the only solution is a hard restart. Do not buy this laptop"
"Everything is great, but I love getting on facebook, etc when my husband is watching sports.  The keyboard does not light up so it makes it hard, if I would have known that I probably wouldn't have bought it."
"For the price I’ve got this laptop for (it was on sale, around $300 at the time) and the retail price being around $1,000. I’ve got a good deal and it never gave me a hard time and I love working with computers and pushing its limits and for my standards of a school and a gaming computer. It works great for both!My only stipulation on this computer is the audio and sound quality isn’t the best but besides that small thing, really isn’t much to complain about. :)"
"The computer itself was packaged perfectly and looked amazing in appearance but the left speaker was broken, it arrived broken and the sound protruding from the computer when I put a video on was absolutely awful, I called the company in an attempt to fix this issue (I did not know the left speaker was broken at first) they barely helped with anything and then the lady I was speaking with went on a rant about how I should change my warranty, awful customer service too."
"Nice looking laptop, however it has it's flaws. Documents cannot be loaded straight from the desktop, you must first upload document to cloud or to google drive before you can attached to an email. Ridiculous. Internet WIFI keeps connecting and disconnecting and a ton load of Lenovo adds keep popping up. Very distracting. I returned mainly because of the connection issue, the  many pop-ups, and the fact that Lenovo pretty much farcing you to put your business out in ciber space. ie. google drive and drop box."
"Cant get any outside app installed, even after recommending to turn off security settings, pc is not much help actually turning it off and chucks you to a random app screen. Heavily influenced by amazon, OS only lets you use the PC like a glorified ipad with a keyboard. Dont know if its real good until i get this os out of here so uh, if you wanna use it like a REAL pc outta the box, im sorry for u. best wishes xoxo"
"I spoiled myself with the Lenovo Yoga which had a 1.1k price point about 5 years ago. This was a third of the price and it's literally a third of the quality. The screen feels very cheap and the lighting disfigures the coloring of everything. The battery life to run Google tools such as Chrome, Docs, and Slides is terrible as I'm using it for very basic necessities for my job. I like how BIG it is, but overall I'm not a fan. I also uninstalled the Lenovo processor in order to get my Chrome/Google benefits."
"Bought this as a gift and I was hoping my aunt would love it since it's i3 11th gen, and she only uses it to websurf and video stream. I reached her over the weekend and casually asked about it, she told me the laptop was becoming slow in just a few months, moreover, it is in a safe mode or some sort that she could not exit out. urrgh, I would not recommend it, it's cheap for a reason."
"I like the computer and the touch screen works alright but I have only had this computer for a couple weeks and I dont use it often. My battery life fully charged and on battery saver mode running nothing but on google chrome looking at my twitter, says it only has about 4 hours of charge time left. On the description says 7 hours which is a huge lie. Other than that the computer is ok. I might have to send this one back if the battery life gets any worse."
Had to bring it to tech guy when first got it to straighten it out!
The machine comes with windows 11 in S mode which will not allow you to open any non-microsoft apps. The suggested methods to switch S mode off did not work. Going in to BIOS and turning off secure boot appears to have worked for me but only after several hours of trying other methods.
"Only giving it 3 stars because it comes with Windows 11 S not Windows 11 home. You can disable S mode and it's only a minor hassle once you know what to do, but figuring out what the heck S mode is took a while. Otherwise great low cost laptop for basic home office use, as long as you're willing to use external drives for additional storage. Pro Tip: S mode is horrible, disable it."
If you need a laptop to do light work on this computer works fine.  It has Microsoft Edge 11 which is in your face constantly. There are many You Tube videos that explain how to work around Edge 11.  The clarity and color are poor and the type is a grey color rather than black.  If you have great vision this won't be a bother but the quality is quite bad if you don't.  It's a cheap computer so just realize you get what you pay for.
"Got this laptop for my wife’s birthday which was in late August she started using it in September and it was fine at first, nothing special but served it’s purpose which was for schoolwork and her photography so nothing that takes up too much memory. Well she uses it about once a week so we are about 4-5 times now and the computer just went black. Google says it’s probably a defective battery but isn’t sure. We has to reset the whole computer losing anything she put on there already which luckily was minimal and now have to redownload all her photography stuff. I spent at least a couple hundred on this and it’s pathetic how quickly this broke. My wife has a Toshiba from2009 that is still working compared to this hunk of junk. Hopefully now that we reset and lost everything it will work now but I will recommend that NO ONE buy a Lenovo product ever unless you like burning your cash."
Ok so the 1st time it did this I ignored it and hoped it was just a 1 time thing but I've had this laptop for less than a month and it's frozen more than once. I just we t to pick it up and the whole screen turned pixeled and purple and then froze it wouldn't even turn off at first. The laptop was slightly annoying to start with especially since it has no backlit keyboard so I can't work in the dark with it (duper unhelpful for me since I have a baby a need to be able to get work done while she naps) and it's a little slow but I was willing to let that go because it's touch screen and pretty large but at this point I'm definitely returning it. Glad it messed up in the return window and not after.Returned the item and being charged a 50% restocking fee on a defective item. Seller reduced it from 50 to 40 but still unacceptable I literally couldn't move my laptop because it would cause it to freeze and I'd have to manually reboot it. I guess I know for next time not to use a 3rd party seller. Would give negative stars if I could.
"A few weeks after I purchased this device, the camera stopped working. It occasionally comes on and I had to use an external camera. Everything works fine otherwise. However, if you are someone who travels a lot, consider a smaller screen as this device did not fit any of my laptop or work bags."
"It's a good computer for college, but don't expect a lot from it.I have a more expensive laptop, that cost me 1300. That was a great investment for me since I do a lot of high-processing work on it. I recommend a more expensive computer to anybody that really wants a laptop they'll love and will last. I got this laptop because I didn't want to risk my more expensive computer breaking.This is good for school but I definitely notice slower processing speeds and glitches."
"For the money it's pretty good, boots up really quick and runs smoothly. The colors are washed out and bland. I expected much more for today's technology being what it is. You also need to have the screen at just the right angle to make it look decent. My work laptop looks great with the screen tilted at any angle. All in all the title says it all...... it's okay."
"If you buy it on sale, you will be happy with it."
"It's a $400 laptop, I got what I paid for. Good battery life (for web browsing), quick response for that type of thing (which is what I bought it for). The screen, I figured in 2023, would be at least decent. It's not. Fuzzy, complete lack of definition. Again, I got what I paid for."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I like the speed, the color, memory, great for homework. Things I miss having a light up keyboard, and a good battery. The battery life doesn’t seem to to go past 4-5hours if I am writing papers and actively doing homework."
"The laptop works fine, no issues there. However the color i received is silver instead of almonds. Since I bought all the other accessories to match the promised almond color, this is a minor, but annoying issue.My bigger issue is that this came in S mode, which is, as far as I can tell, NOT what is advertised. Why do sellers do this?"
This laptop comes stripped down and very basic no frills. The screen quality is good enough but the battery life is terrible. Expect about 2 to 2 1/2 hours with normal usage. The battery also drains down even when the machine is turned off. Shutting it down overnight and turning it back on in the morning expect the battery to drain about 50 to 60 percent. The keyboard is not backlit and can not connect another monitor.
The laptop is unusable due to the slow SATA hard drive. It operates at 100% All the time just to keep up with small tasks. This was advertised with a SSD hard drive. Not the case. I should have sent it back sooner. Now my window is closed. Do not but this.
"I got this laptop for school and personal use. I always use my batter saver no matter what percentage it's on, and keep the brightness low. Yet, a full charge only lasts 2 hours. It's a shame becuase the laptop is pretty much good in every other field, but the battery life is the worst I've ever seen. what a shame."
I received my laptop this morning. I absolutely loved it until I was prompted to update my device and when I did so it updated to the newer version of BIOS and now I cannot get anything to work. It keeps restarting over and over because it “can’t restart properly” I have tried everything and I can’t get it to fully reboot I cannot access the home page or settings in any way. Completely wasted over $420 because the laptop promoted to update. I am so livid right now. I will not buy any more electronics from Amazon because I cannot exchange or return for a refund because the box is open now and because everything was fine until the update.
"About a month after the warranty expired the webcam went out so I had to buy an external webcam.  Now 2 months after the warranty expired, the headphone jack is not working.  Since I use it often for zoom meetings, these 2 items are vital.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!  Parts in a computer should last more than a year!"
"i have owned this laptop for about a year and a half, for the price it is a good unit but not very durable, i ended up having to buy another one due to the shell basically falling apart on me and not being able to afford anything higher quality, the hinged litterally have fallen apart on me, hoping when i get my new 1 i dont have this issue again. i did some research and found out lenovo products are prone for the faulty hinges, its a shame its a good laptop, looks like in a year or 2 iill have to buy another laptop brand and it wont be a lenovo. I had bought a second laptop in December 2023, I bought it hoping it would last a bit until I could buy a better laptop, this 1 just randomly died on me minutes ago, got a warning for low battery plugged it in to the charger then instantly the computer turned off and wouldn't come back"
"Pros:  Very lightweight, screen is bright, Cons:  Way too much Microsoft control over so many features.  Touch screen is way too sensitive- will check to see if can be adjusted.  The key pad is frustrating with “areas” rather than keys.  Works okay with mouse but defeats purpose of laptop which I like to use on my lap.  I would reconsider purchasing this model in the future."
"I bought this laptop off of Amazon warehouse, so I knew it was used but according to amazon they tested it and everything. I don't know what happened here but the set up alone took almost 2 hours, and I still had to go through like a thousand updates which took way too long. After 3 days trying to get this thing set up I gave up and returned it. Bought another Asus, which hasn't failed me yet so I am going to stick with them."
This laptop has so many issues. I had to do a factory reset less than six months after purchase when it suddenly erased my wi-fi out of the blue. You have to constantly adjust the screen brightness because it dims after coming out of a screensaver. Not a satisfied customer at all.
"Good laptop if you just need something easy to use; doesn’t work well with Zoom updates. I am not able to use my apple AirPods with the laptop, they don’t connect."
"I didn’t do enough research, this is basically a glorified tablet…not enough memory or speed or anything for the money."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I bought this computer in March 2023 for my child. He usually uses it for studying. However, after only one year and three months, the screen was completely broken and it couldn't be turned on at all. The warranty period had just expired and we had no way to find the manufacturer. I really doubted whether there was something wrong with the quality of this brand of laptops, or whether the products on Amazon were not genuine. In short, I was very angry!"
This product was less than 10 months old and still in warranty.  Lenovo would not replace a bad motherboard.
"Would have given this laptop a better review had it not been for the faded out colors on the screen. Don’t be fooled by the huge discount offered on Amazon for this laptop.You are not getting a great deal on a $600-$700 laptop. You are paying ~$400 for a so-so laptop.If you disregard this review and buy it anyway, you’ll see what I mean. But make sure to return within 14 days because even though Amazon tells you that you have a month, the “seller” gives you 14 days. From day 15 on they keep 1/2 of your money as a “restocking fee.”"
Laptop was good but it was supposed to be new and the internal mouse pad did not work. Had to send it back but I reordered and hopefully the one they deliver this time will work 100%.
"Before you can do anything on this computer, you need to sign into your Microsoft or Microsoft email account so they can track your every move and harass you with even more marketing materials. Returned computer for this reason."
I thought this laptop was steal for the price until about a month after purchasing it she started freezing all the time. I only use it for internet browsing and basic word functions yet it still seems to be overloaded. I do not recommend.
"Not much used laptop, only when I travel, but got the blue screen of death.  Best Buy's Geek Squad says I need a new motherboard.  What? it's been less than two years with this laptop (got this in Dec 2022).  I don't recommend purchasing this laptop."
The WiFi adapter is not connecting with my home router.  Reason is not clear.  I bought it mostly as a travel computer and as a replacement for my aging HP.
"There's some kind of bug with this where it randomly shuts off occasionally. It's not a bad computer otherwise, but that one flaw really tarnishes the experience."
"They advertise as a 2022  but its a 2021. They insited it was the same as a 2022. The model numbers paint a different picture or just look up at Best Buy. So its still a lie. The $1,000 retail is ridiculous. If you don't know for absolute sure you are going to keep this laptop then don't open it. It came with a single peice of packing paper in the outer box and a hole in the box. Upon sending it back I was charged for the shipping and a 44% restocking fee. They told me the computer was dirty and scratched up and the box was damaged. I wrote them a couple times that this was not true but they just kept changing the story line. I have learned my lesson to never buy from a third party merchant again. They can charge you anything. So don't open the box it's sight unseen and they can still claim damage. These people are out right fruds."
The battery is TERRIBLE! It lasts less than 24 hours. The other thing is when I turn it off and close it and come back to use it the thing is already on. I don't like this computer and most importantly the BATTERY IS TERRIBLE!
"I had written a review on this laptop last May when I bought it. It was a great laptop for the price and I used it for lots of things... note: I have no need for high performance. Most of my work is Word & Excel.  Only a year into it and my screen just died. I didn’t drop it. I didn’t misuse it. In fact, it’s babied. But the screen just did a little dance and it died. I’m beyond disappointed. We buy Lenovo laptops at work and I’ve had my work one for 5 years. One year… seriously???I’ve read multiple reviews from others who have had the same issue. Shame on you Lenovo. Take a chance or buy the additional warranty. Or do what I’m going to do - buy anything BUT Lenovo moving forward. Lesson learned.I will say this - until ""S"" mode was turned off, I had my share of frustrations."
"I am not picky with laptops. I’ve had cheap, expensive, whatever, I usually don’t care. However I H A T E this thing. The battery life is horrible, I literally use it in class to use the internet and it barely lasts a couple hours. The edge of the laptop by the track pad is sharp, it cuts into your wrists. The charger on this thing is so laughable, the plug base is massive and won’t fit the outlets if a table has power ports. Wildly bad design. I wish I could return it but I missed the window giving it a chance. Buyer beware!"
"The computer is buggy and Microsoft Office programs freeze up and require restart frequently.  The biggest issue, though, is that it will not connect to a mobile hotspot.  Lenovo customer support confirmed that this was a software issue inherent to this computer, but that they would require a payment of $99 for their software specialists to fix it.  The unit is still under warranty for another 5 months.This computer is fine for browsing the web from home, but not much else."
This laptop suffers from Lenovo's terrible legacy of very poor screen quality.
"S-mode stands for stupid mode or s***  I can't  delete S Mode! I followed Windows instructions for deleting S-mode and they didn't work. Two YouTube videos it didn't work I called Amazon customer service and they transferred me to Lenovo C/S and we couldn't load the  diagnostic program from Lenovo because it didn't come from Microsoft store. It looks like a nice computer, it came with Windows 11, the keyboard was nice… I returned it the next day. I can't run my apps with s-mode installed. Photoshop, Lightroom my printer,  organizer and Chrome amongst others.  What a waste!"
"This is a simple computer with no bells & whistles but it’s fine for shopping and bookkeeping and letter writing. However, there is a browser that showed up on it that I don’t like and can’t seem to get rid of."
I am a fan of lenovo products because they are durable. I am giving this 3 stars because who makes a laptop without keyboard lights today? Absolute design flaw.
"Based on reviews, I thought I was getting a decent laptop for a reasonable price. I bought it in April 2023. Within a couple weeks of setting it up, light use only, it froze and needed a factory reset. I was annoyed with having to spend the time to set up everything again but thought it was a fluke. I was wrong. The freezing issues kept happening but since I didn’t use the laptop frequently, it was outside the return window. Fast forward to January 2024… I have to fight with it to get it to turn on. I don’t bother saving anything to the machine anymore because I know I’ll lose my files. Next time I’ll spend the money for a more reliable machine so I don’t waste my time on junk."
"I bought my laptop less than a year ago. In December, I had to send it in for service as the screen kept going black and was unresponsive. In January, I began having the same problems and needed to send it in again. This is a huge inconvenience for someone who uses their laptop all day for work. Their customer service is absolutely horrible. The representatives are unfriendly and unwilling to bend even a little when it comes to actually providing service. I escalated the call and still nothing. They wouldn't even consider extending my warranty which will run out in 2 months even though I have now had issues with it twice. It's worth paying more for a better product and better customer service."
The battery was bad when I bought it Dec 2022. I could not spend time with it unplugged for very long. Tried to reach out to the company. It did not show my laptop and the 800 numbers is disconnected. No one should order from this company. I should have had a 1 year warranty. BAD COMPANY. Amazon don't use them anymore.
It is a good computer for price.  I am finding out why you pay more for computers if you want good resolution.  Screen brightness is just not the best.
Had to return it because the screen is so bad it gave me a headache. I tried different visual settings but it kept bothering me. Washed out and poor definition/contrast.
"Since entering my e-mail address while setting up computer I have been receiving 5 to 15 junk e-mails per day, all asking in some way for my Microsoft account password. Thanks Microsoft."
"When I received my laptop I was thrilled. Easy to set up, easy to use and fast.I had been using it, closed it overnight, tried to open up. I thought the battery had died. But I noticed the light wasn’t lighting up.I took it to the Geek Squad. They told me it’s dead. I freaked. I had just moved from Florida to PA, was afraid I’d lose the paper copies of all my stuff. I spent weeks scanning and saving to laptop.I took it to a small Mom and Pop computer repair person. I supplied an external hard drive. I pleaded to get the data from internal hard drive. I could care less about the laptop.I bought May 8, 2023. 7 months and dead.Very disappointed."
It was a decent computer but wasn't what I needed for my business. The screen is not as clear as I would like. And the battery life was not long enough for me. I needed a battery that would last a little longer
Computer: good overall. Screen quality: SO POOR that it looks like something that was created BK in the 1990’s. Have to RETURN.
I seldom use this laptop maybe twice a month and one month out of warranty mysteriously I can only get a black screen which is indicative of a Windows 11 problem Lenovo had me ship the laptop to Houston Texas saying we'll reinstall Windows 11 and when I got the laptop back they had replaced the motherboard but now I still can't sign into the laptop. All you can do is talk to someone in the Philippines and as we all know they don't understand and they just read a script.
"It lasted one year, almost to the dot. After that it started having problems, like it was out of warranty and thus wanted to destroy itself with almost everything I did. I've seen more error messages over the last 6 months trying to get it repaired then I have seen boot up sequences that aren't in safe mode. Would not recommend."
"This laptop comes with windows 11 and the basic stuff, but is locked into S mode. I was able to turn it off, but it still will not let me download apps unless they're through the Microsoft store.I'm not a computer noob either, so I have some experience navigating operating systems and configuring things. I've never come across such an annoying bug. I tried changing the settings in bios and it still doesn't work. You literally cannot open any program you download. Unacceptable scam - this computer is worthless.Buyer beware."
there is NO WAY this was a 950 dollar laptop it would have better speakersand perform better and faster how the hell can they get away with false claims onthis item well the tricked me that is for sure i thought i was GETTING A REAL DEAL that isnot the case here. Overall i like the laptop but its just okay again i was fooled to think i wasgetting a 900 dollar laptop for 300 bucks
"when I got it , warrant period consumed a half already, how do I restore a year ?"
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Was working great until a month in the touch screen started acting weird
The camera is not very lasting and the battery runs out power very quickly.
"very easy and simple to use. does feel a bit ""cheap"" but it gets the job done"
"I forgot I bought the extra warranty.  The computer's limited warranty did not coverr the repair.  That is a MAJOR repair in a normally used computer.  We got the same brand at work...lots of problems. Hopefully, Leveno is working out their hardwear issues!!"
The computer is not real clear on the screen husband not happy with it.
"Well, this product had great reviews. I ordered it and received in a timely manner.Well, the screen was washed out, and the colors were pale .I sent to lenovo for repair. the first time didn't work. Sent it back. They returned it to me ""repaired"" but the computer was inaccessible and had other problems. Sent it back. They returned it... I could open it, BUT the screen was still screwy.It turns out that the laptop was originally a Best Buy item, and a third party sold it on Amazon.What a mess.Apparently, Amazon will refund it, but I haven't received the return email yet.When you're buying equipment MAKE SURE IT'S NOT FROM A THIRD PARTY and that it's from a reputable dealer."
"The lap top works but hangs up /  freezes to often , I am not impressed with it ."
"As other buyers have indicated, the brightness and color quality of the screen just isn't up to par. Other than that, I'm lovin' it."
I love everything about this computer except for the battery. At 58% it said I had about an hour left. And of course you can't replace the battery.
"Faster than my last cheap laptop, I guess that’s all I needed."
"I really like this laptop for the price. I LOVE the touch screen ability! Only negative is the battery life. After 4 hours of use, the battery shows low. I was expecting a much longer life."
Hate the info stealing apps.  Took hours to delete or shut off the apps.
"not sure if I'll be returning this computer, sounded like a really good computer and a very good deal during Prime Week. BUT if came with windows 10, not windows 11 as it was advertised. came with instructions, how to upgrade to windows 11. So far i have spent 3 hrs. trying to upgrade following the instructions, that came with computer. tomorrow i will have my computer guy try. Right now i am very unhappy knowing that i have to pay someone to load something that was supposed to already be loaded on the computer."
"Wrote this a month ago: A great little computer. Feels very sturdy, and is small. Will be good for traveling.Update: After 4 weeks wifi disappeared (works on other computers in same building). Spent MANY hours over the last 2 weeks on the phone and on ""chat"" with support people from Lenovo and Amazon (mainly Lenovo). Several different support people tried to fix it remotely. Next step is to have a technician come out. What this will end up costing Lenovo is no doubt much more than the laptop is worth. The wise thing would be to send me a new one. But no, because the 30 days return window has passed. Meanwhile I've wasted many, many hours. And still don't have a working laptop. I must say, however, that all the various support people were very nice, and did their best. The problem is the return/exchange policy, when the thing breaks down just after the return period has passed! Will I buy Lenovo again? Depends if they fix it next week. New update: Lenovo sent a technician over who fixed it. Apparently it needed a new wifi card (why a new laptop needed that, I don't know). But it's all working again."
The Good.  The laptop was better the expected. Out preforms my older one. Great computer.The bad!!  It does not come with the IST Pen.  That will cost you another $50 plus to get one. My computer arrived with the warranty already started. It was started May 2 2024. I received the computer 3 week in November. That is almost 7 months lost warranty. Then found out that the computer is no longer in production by Lenovo. The description listed as it is.The seller is miss representing the product in the description.  I would not buy from this seller again.
"It's laptop is lightweight and durable, and can folded screen back into a tablet configuration.  Those are the best things about it.  It has trouble running multiple programs at once, and is overall very slow. I'd still say it's worth $300 because laptops are so expensive these days, but don't expect smooth performance.  It can handle 3D modeling surprisingly well, but good luck using any other apps simultaneously.  Oh, and the keyboard feels very cheap and terrible."
"Love the durability and size, but the 8 gb RAM is very slow and unable to upgrade to a higher RAM because it is soldered in.  Who does that?  If I could have upgraded it, I would have given this a 5 star review because it would have worked wonders for my needs - but is very limited now and sorry I purchased it."
"left my chromebook, because they quit giving updates and websites wouldn't work on it anymore. even though it still worked completely fine.  so no more chromebook scams.  This lenovo is everything I expected except for the lack of battery life.  great buy at $330+tax"
"If you look this up elsewhere, it will show a pen that pops out of the front corner.  This product does NOT come with the pen!  The port is capped and Geek Squad says the internal charging port isn't even installed.  So buying a pen won't help, as they don't come with an alternative charging option.  I have yet to find a bluetooth pen that is compatible.  So I'm back to a basic ""dumb"" stylus.Also doesn't come with Microsoft Office.Otherwise, it's pretty good. Does what it should and is definitely sturdy but still lightweight.But I'm pretty frustrated that I'll have to spend more money to make it fit my needs."
"Kinda ugly compared to the pictures, it's not sleek and it supposed to have a pen, but it doesn't, they put a very cheap pen in as compensation.It was pretty slow on the start up and initial use, all this together I decided to return"
"I received this for my son, I got things loaded on it and it quite working in  less than 60 days.  I did not get the extended warranty.  I took it to a computer repair shop and it could not be repaired."
"Despite it being advertised as offering a pen and being pen compatible, the slot for the pen is sealed and glued shut, so you cannot even buy a replacement pen for it. Really unfortunate as I wanted it for drawing."
"Bought this for my daughter for school in March of 2022. In December 2022, it stopped working. Would not take a charge. Tried a new AC adaptor, thinking that might be the problem. Nope. Still would not light up the power port light. Tried a million online ""how to"" YouTube videos of how to get it to work. None were successful. So, I figured, hey, I still have a couple months left on the ""warranty"", right? I'll get it fixed under warranty. Well, the 1 year ""warranty"" isn't from when you buy it. It's from the DATE OF MANUFACTURE. So I plugged in the serial # of the laptop into the Lenovo website...warranty expired in November 2022...ONE MONTH BEFORE IT DIED!!! But, I can buy a NEW extended warranty. So I did that, because my daughter needs it for her school, and I figure I can get it repaired before she goes back. OK, so I get the warranty...they have a ONE MONTH DELAY!!! You have to wait 30 days before you can send it in for repair!!!Long story short...my family will NEVER EVER BUY another Lenovo product. You've lost quite a few potential customers. Absolute garbage...and I'm not one to give one star reviews. I now have to buy a new similar laptop...hopefully HP will give me a better experience."
"The laptop is currently a brick on my desk. It can't be unplugged or the battery dies because there is a screen lock activated. I bought the laptop for internet and email use only. There is an additional subscription fee required, but it only asked for it after I began adding my email accounts to the Outlook program. So, in order to make the laptop work as I expected, I have to pay more and continue to pay, and keep it perpetually plugged in. Those two reasons are the entire point of purchasing this laptop; to be mobile and not dependent on a cloud server to host my info. Fail. It is too late to return the laptop, as I already added my personal info to it. Expensive mistake!"
"I wanted a small, simple touchscreen for basic word processing and web browsing. I was disappointed. The keyboard kept losing connection, only the touch screen would work. The device wanted to do Windows updates every single time I turned it on. But worst of all was the AI Copilot. It kept turning on all by itself, opening random windows and running long lines of code. There was no way to shut it off, and when I looked up online how to uninstall, the instructions I found did not match the menu options. It could not be installed! I wanted to like this device but it didn't work."
"We haven't had this device very long, it has never been stored or handled incorrectly. I used zoom one week and it was fine, however the following week I had another zoom meeting and the camera itself looks like it's shifted behind the laptop screen and now 3/4 of the camera is black with no way to fix without taking it in somewhere."
Where is the pen .Miss advertised.
Be aware before purchasing this item. First of all the laptop is very small and if you try to return it you have to go Amazon facility as that’s the only option for delivery which is ridiculous and outrageous. Don’t bother talking to Amazon staff that they are no help and you only get an attitude. They tell you one story and then when you called back it another story.  Once I return this piece of crap I will be closing my account as it’s not worth it. So again be aware.
"Really disappointed from this purchase.Slow pc, bulky with really bad camera.The pen didn't come with the pc (it had a plastic  cover) and when I searched for 1 in Lenovo website,  it's not available...Really bad purchase."
"I absolutely loathe this machine.  Its my fault.  I had no idea on how it works.  I CAN do what I need.  But so much learning.  I should have spent more for a ""regular"" laptop, not a chromebook."
"I bought this laptop through the Lenovo site a few months ago; after receiving it, I opened it up and immediately noticed it was extremely slow (it was brand new) and after only one use it simply stopped working. Since I decided it was too small for me anyway, I decided to return it; I sent in a request and the website order page said the return request was already submitted. When I followed up a few weeks later, they said I never submitted a request and that now it was too late to submit another one. Lenovo left me with a $300 pile of junk. Used to be a repeat customer and now I'm looking at any other options."
"I was shocked when I was offered to review, as this is a whole laptop. But, that is all where the excitement ends.The laptop has the following specs when looking in My Computer:Windows 11 Pro 64-bit12gb of Ram (4.2gb dedicated to video?)256GB Hard DriveIntel Celeron N4000 (we will get into this later)Intel Dedicated GraphicsBluetooth 5.1.So far, as advertised, the laptop is not lying in the listing, as to what is being offered here. However, while the RAM is quite high on this laptop for the price, the 4.2gb dedicated to what I can assume is video, is worrisome. I don't understand why this laptop needs that much, when it is just to be used for simple web browsing and tasks.Now to get into the Intel Celeron N4000 processor. This processor is quite dated, with the first coming out in 2017. It can handle turning on and loading the laptop just fine, web browsing and simple applications like, outlook and word. What I found a problem was when I was installing Windows Updates. It took two nights and 1 day, to install 25 updates from Microsoft. While checking to see what the problem was, it was the processor at 100% usage. I thought maybe Microsoft's updates were a bit heavy, but no, it also took 1 hour to install Microsoft Office. Which, on an even older laptop from 2016, it only took that one 10 minutes at most. Then I install other applications I used like Audacity, Adobe Reader, iTunes, Skype, Zoom, and my label making software Labelife. iTunes crawls on this laptop, taking a full 2 minutes for the window to even pop up and then I have to wait around 5 minutes for it to eventually load in full. The problem lies within the processor, as this processor is mean't for lightweight Operating Systems like ChromeOS.It is sluggish when looking at YouTube videos, open one more tab, and it will skip and freeze. Not good when the video was only set to 480p.Transfer speed of files was average, at around 10mb per second from USB drive to the SSD.The laptop screen is crisp and clear, amid a bit bright, but that can be fixed by lowering the brightness in the settings. I was quite surprised at how well it looks.The Wifi works like a charm, connected right away to my router with ease. I would expect this in 2024 anyway.The keyboard is your typical laptop keyboard, nothing special, it gets the job done just fine.The trackpad is a miss. Even one small brush and it will go crazy. I actually had to use a mouse when testing this laptop for this review.For the price, I would recommend getting a Chromebook, as you can get one with much better specs, nicer screens, and overall better performance. You can even get a Windows laptop at Best Buy or Walmart at the same price with better specs.I would skip this laptop overall and find a better suited one."
I don't know why this is part of the TUF gaming series. This is laptop is built with some of the cheapest materials you could possibly put on a laptop. The GPU performance and the battery life on this is almost non-existent a full charge will maybe get you 45 minutes worth of gameplay. For this price range I was expecting something a bit better. This laptop should be priced around the $300 mark. It just lacks in absolutely every regard. You would be better off buying a non-gaming laptop in this price range. It would probably perform as well if not better.
"Love this laptop but hate how the wifi icon disappeared after only 3 months of use. Since this is my work laptop, I was unable to ship it to asus for repair. Only way I can connect is via ethernet."
I use this computer to game and the battery life is horrible. i only run one software at a timeand not for a long time at all. maybe an hour. My macbook battery lasted days this GAMING pc battery  doesnt even last an hour straight !
Half the time and won’t fix its self obviously something has been wrong with this thing got it usedWhen it crashes it’s right after turning it on it says theirs a problem and It has to run a repair on its self all I could think of was a windows reinstall nothing worked im all around disappointed I bought this it can’t even run skyrim without glitchingRemember got it used
So far it’s ok but it does get hot quick and is a little loud
This thing is pretty flimsy. Screen is really thin and will probably break at some point. Needs another 8 gb of ram. Runs some games pretty well. Good entry level laptop. Would give it 5 stars if it wasn’t constructed so cheaply.
"Good afternoon Amazon and Asus companies.I’ve just got the most expensive one on 3050,feels like ram sucks or smth wrong with it,just the system processes load the ram for 50-65% .What can I do ?"
"Hello, I bought this Asus Tuf A15 model and the specifications say that the screen is FHD and I find that it is not like that, instead the screen is HDR and I see that in their official store they also have it like that."
The Wi-Fi NEVER stays. It cuts off every five minutes. Audio can't be heard it's too low.
"Computer graphics and everything else in the screen is awesome except battery life, i got it for my 10 year old daughter as a birthday gift she only plays roblox and Minecraft, from a full battery she only gets about 1 hour before the laptop shuts down, no other apps are open."
"I bought this laptop for my college-aged son. He can be rough on things and this claimed to be more rugged and durable.It. Is. Not.He was away this summer working, so the laptop we bought on Prime Day sat around in the box for a month or so. We got it out and set it up when he got home. The screen nearly immediately cracked along the diagonal when he opened it. He didn’t drop it. He didn’t step on it. He just opened it. This is clearly a manufacturing or design issue but Asus support noted it as customer induced damage, informing us that we can send it in, but that there will likely be a charge to repair the machine. They suggested we just return it to Amazon, since we had purchased it so recently.We called Amazon on day 31. There was a 30 day return policy on this. We were SOL.Amazon and Asurion (we bought the extended warranty) both suggested the issue should be covered by the manufacturer warranty.Separately, What A Scam! Asus said to just return it rather than stand behind it. It’s a joke.We got the RMA and sent the product back. I got the $200 bill yo repair the computer today. Of course, I paid it because the kid needs his computer and disputing it would likely take weeks. That said, I will be reaching out to them to see if maybe they will pay me back. I’m not hopeful, though because they think this repair should be covered under the original manufacturer warranty. (I agree with Asurion, by the way.)Anyway, the product is garbage and Asus is crap. To say their support stinks is an insult to smelly things. Overall, a garbage product and experience."
"Works well for school, rgb kinda cool, WiFi card slipped out leading to connectivity issues.  Had to open the laptop and seat it well. Heavy, pretty durable, Fans are noisy but that’s expecting from gaming time."
"At this point everything uses usb-c for power. Not this laptop. They decided that using an old school power adapter was a GREAT idea. We're you hoping that the usb-c port onboard would allow it to be charged? Sorry, no such luck.What an unforced error."
1 month and the slats/ vents are already breaking. The computer is smooth running but it will look beat up after a year or so.
"It pushes a ton of bloatware on you, Asus Laptops used to be no nonsense, durable get things done type of machines. This whole thing looks like a shiny giant gaming mouse that is made for 7 year old Roblox addicts by 11 year old Fortnite veterans. Those kids can already afford couple of thousand dollar machines. Please think of the poor adults too."
"ngl i had a good time playing on this laptop only issue is that it died... i don't know why i've been using it for b very causal and normal gameplay, now the rgb will turn on but the actual display will not, i probably will not purchase a computer from amazon so beware..."
I love this laptop and enjoy so much about it but with the amount of money invested in this. I'm a bit let down on how it can't process at the lowest quality and setting on Cyberpunk 2077. Literally every minute I lose FPS and can't enjoy the game even at turbo setting of this laptop.
"All in all this thing seems to be a great deal for a fairly robust computer. Easy to get access to upgrade components. My only issue is battery life is horrible, even for just internet scrolling it lasts 1.5 hours tops. Not sure if I got a defective unit but would strongly consider something else if you need more time between plugs."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I got this laptop August 28,2023. I started using it September 11. Upon using it it was not giving me any issues I played games like fortnite on it which are very demanding on the OS at 30 fps and it ran decent. Now I have issues from time to time where the screen goes blank, or it gets dark and takes a while to start. If my laptop is closed and i am  trying to access the laptop the login portion takes a while to appear for me to logon to my laptop. As seen in the pictures it is very non responsive and disappointing for such a laptop that is claimed to be 'new'. Too many tabs open does slow it down as well i do not have much apps installed currently but it behaves like a dinosaur already slowing down. I would give this laptop a 3/5 it would have been a decent budget gaming laptop if it did not have so many faults.EditToday my laptop crashed and went into what is known as 'the blue screen of death' it claims to will restart on its own after collecting enough data but I have been here waiting for the past 15 minutes. Very disappointed with my purchase my rating has now gone to a 1 start shame it can't be zero"
"For the most part, it works well enough. But sometimes, completely at random, its like it forgets how to manage its temperature. I've done a few tweaks and managed to reduce the frequency of this happening, but every now and then it will start burning hot, running super slow, and the fans aren't even running. And I know they aren't clogged, because they do run at times, and boy does it ever eject heat while they do.I bought this laptop because it advertises solid construction, which is important to me because I game on the road and my last two laptops lasted barely a year before they just stopped working; probably some kind of a power break inside. So far, it seems as tough as advertised, but this temperature problem is terrible. I probably won't buy another from this company."
"I bought this because I enjoyed my last ASUS TUF gaming laptop (2020) despite the nuances of the last one, one being that it only lasted me 3 years before it stopped working mid Windows update. I highly doubt this one will last that long and I worry it will also do the same thing considering that I am already getting the blue screen that other reviewers have also mentioned. I only just bought it in August. It is a fingerprint smudge magnet, I was able to do a workaround by buying one of those laptop stick on background things, and put it on everywhere I touch. Anyway, I would only buy this on sale if you are considering it because it is not worth it full price."
"Definitely upgrade the memory as others have said. It’s fine. I use it for digital board games (gloomhaven and a few others) and it’s great on that. Hogwarts legacy runs fine but only after the memory upgrade. If you do *actual* gaming, do not get this. It’s fine for my board games and light weight games like the sims or Hogwarts (again, both only after the memory upgrade) but I would not use this for anything beyond those levels."
This came in S-mode which won’t allow the user to use any apps other than Microsoft or windows apps. Not cool. Couldn’t get rid of S-mode and tried at least 20 times over the course of a few days. Not cool at all. We returned it.
"i'm used to using apple products, so it's not entirely clear to me if windows is just this bad, if the hardware is subpar, or if it comes preloaded with scamware, but this machine is unbearably slow. i got it a few months ago and literally do nothing on it but play a video game created in the 90s, and it can barely handle that. typing in my passcode to unlock the machine or clicking the system level tray while doing nothing else frequently results in a second of lag before any ui updates. when i need to look something up quick on the internet, i typically will just grab my macbook and do it there, because changing machines is faster than loading edge and dealing with all the system lag. it's so unbearable at times i've considered just throwing it away. terrible product."
"I had this product for about six months and everything seemed to work fine. Then out of nowhere the screen stopped working entirely. I searched through articles to see if there was a solution or if it was something I had caused, and eventually I called the ASUS support line but they were not helpful. The screen came on again for a couple days about a month later but went back to nothing afterwards. I still don’t know what the issue is and I am now trying to get it fixed or returned since it is still under warranty. Was pretty decent when it worked but the lack of a screen makes it unusable."
"Im an IT guy so I'll try not to be too harsh...BIOS is neutered. Battery life is atrocious, fans are excessively loud even under no load. Just sitting idle at the BIOS main page, the fans ramped up to 4900rpm, stayed there and drained the fully charged battery to 64% in about 20 minutes. Also, this thing is a finger print magnet.This laptop is a kids toy. Had to return it."
This product is listed as having 5600 MHz RAM but the laptop I received only has 4800 and I did not notice this until I started having issues with the laptop. That was over a month after purchase and ASUS says they cannot do anything to make this right by me. I am furious at being taken advantage of like this and expected better of this company.
"The mouse is missing. I bought it new and at a new price, not used so as not to bring a mouse. Why???"
WiFi goes in and out for no reason. Also battery life is two hours tops.
You look down and the Battery life is at 50% as soon as you open up a game also hets way too hot to be sat on any surface
"Pretty much the whole thing is in the title, my guess is the laptop heated up so much it fried the hardrive chip."
"The computer might’ve been great…had they sent me the correct one. Ordered a TUF A15…received a Chromebook. And Amazon was no help at all!!! I love asus, but do yourself a favor and buy from asus directly. Avoid Amazon at all costs…I am!"
"Wi-fi adapter bricked. Noisy, clicking fan. Battery lasts less than an hour. All these sorts of problems develop around the time the warranty expires. Shysters."
i have this for only two months i don't over used it and its connected to the charger only when i turn on a online game after tw9 month the motherboard went bad now its unable to fix
Laptop died less than 1 month after chargeback option expided.  Product of poor engineering from a failing chip manufacturer. I will never buy anything made by asus again and advise you the same. Buyer beware.
"Bought this for my son. A key came off within the first few months, the warranty did not cover this and they do not sell any replacements.  Customer service people were rude and dismissive."
"I bought the 2050 video card model and this model was buils very nicely the whole caeeinf the rng keybored amd all was nice, but unfortunately the 2050 can't even play games from 2010 above 30 fps, this laptop is basicly useless, unless for basic task and nor al use of a computer shouldn't be listed as a gaming machine  if it can't do 1080 lowest settings and get 60 fps"
"This thing froze numerous times watching Netflix , only game you can play without freezing issues is The Sims ! Don’t try any multiplayer games ! Not a gaming laptop at all. No call of duty no apex no good Graphics games can be ran on here !"
Laptop arrived basically DOA.  Will turn off immediately if I unplug power cord.
Worked perfectly for 1 year. Now screen won’t turn on and it it won’t connect to Wifi networks.
No reason to keep it. Only needed for streaming off my PlayStation and the ps remote appor the laptop itself doesn't have any volume output that works at all. Beyond disappointed.
"The Wi-Fi continues to disappear. Can’t even find the Wi-Fi icon.  Even downloading new Wi-Fi drivers hasn’t completely solved the issue, because it continues to happen randomly.A new computer that is only 6 weeks old should not be giving me a headache already."
"I loved the price and the look of the labtop. It runs great , unfortunately I had a problem with the battery. When it was plugged in it work fine, but when unplug it would turn the screen black and cause it to restart."
It's one of those laptops where the display is weird and everything is a barfy yellow. Don't buy it. I can't believe they did that to the display and thought that would make it fun. Jesus.
Computer did not last. Less than 3 months old and the screen cracked when my son touched it. The screen has different bright colors and now he can’t see anything /
"One month after using it. Laptop got very laggy, It has to be plugged in order to work properly. I use it manly for college and fortnite probably 5 times. A"
I liked it but I couldn’t get it to program because you didn’t enclosing any documents: directions on it. So I had to return it.
"It constantly overheats, it can’t even handle Minecraft, and it’s extremely flimsy. Don’t get this, it’s a waste of money."
I purchased this as a gift for my son. It was not opened until after the return window passed. Amazon will not allow me to return this defective laptop.
Over heating issues...CPU running at 95c then crashing with no apps running in background...BEWARE!
Crashes every day with a blue screen. Only had it for a week
"I got the laptop (a15) on October 18. Unfortunately, it has started typing letters different from those I type. For instance, if I type f, type the computer type r. Is there a way to fix this? It doesn't happen all the time"
Do not but anything from asus. They will send you faulty products and fork you over when you try to make a claim for it.
Do not waste your money.
They won’t tell you this cause the seller Amazon and manufacturer love to hide this fact. The GPU has its own dedicated ram besides the computer ram. The GPU ram is 4…. 8 is the minimum for decent gaming. On top of that 8 gigs of ram for the computer? A stick of ram is super cheap how cheap is asus? All that for a 2050 or 3050? This is high way robbery this laptop is going to be trash if you want it for anything besides light games like Minecraft or Roblox. Also you can get way better for a similar price on Amazon and elsewhere.
"When I ordered this, it was broken. Screen detached from the main keyboard. It says on the keyboard, ""military grade,"" but judging from how it couldn't survive shipping, I say otherwise."
This is the glitchiest computer I've had in the past 25 years.It won't remember any settings. Whether it's the keyboard lights (which revert to the seizure inducing default flashing pattern every time you turn it off).Or the battery settings. If you set it to charge to 60%....It will either charge itself to 100% or discharge itself to 0%.
"Can confirm the other negative reviews that state the TUF has a faulty wifi card. It is by far the most annoying issue to have your wifi disconnect or drop so frequently. Typically a restart will fix this but sometimes the card remains undetectable for an indefinite time. Search up ""Asus TUF wifi disconnect issue"" and you'll find a good number of people who have similar stories. It's unlikely that all laptops of this model suffer from this issue but there is a portion of them that have been purchased that do, so it's up to the buyer's discretion."
I bought this for my daughter and the basic games are laggy! We called customer service and it was a joke! First of all you get all machines helping you then nothing! This laptop is trash! Customer service - non-existent! I would give them 0 stars if it was an option!
"I purchased this computer in May 2024. It's a computer a rarely us. Went to turn it on 10/21/24 and it was getting caught on BSOD with a dma verifier violation.Customer service said I needed to do a USB recovery.Settings need to change in the bios which a Microsoft code lock to engage. Now needs a whole new install of Windows 11.I asked for some kind of instructions from seller to get some direct insights since I'm new to this issue and didn't want to spend hours googling.They just suggested contact levono support even though they the seller ""allegedly"" built the computer.Avoid this seller. 5 month old computer and nothing can be done great."
"Microsoft has taken a good and easy to learn and use program in Windows 7. Each so-called rendition of Windows has down-graded the product quality and now Windows 11 is about as low as it can go in taking away useful programs that require addition steps to get to or accomplish the same task. Case in point: removing the ability to move, copy, or otherwise  manipulation of files, folders, and photos. This will be my last Windows PC: Hello MAC."
"I ended up returning this computer because the screen hurt to look at, no matter what brightness I used. Even if I lowered it, everything looked too white/bright, and I couldn’t stare at it for more than a few minutes without my eyes hurting a TON and for a long time.Power wise, it was a bit annoying to set up? At least, it lagged terribly when I tried to install Opera Gx and run it, but that might have been the browser itself, as it did the same thing to my normal and rather powerful PC.Regarding the eyes pain, I think it might have been the anti-glare coating, but I’m not sure. I have NEVER had this issue with other screens, and I don’t have particularly sensitive eyes. For all I know, this laptop is amazing, it was recommended to me by a friend, but I think it just wasn’t a good fit for me particularly. I didn’t see any other reviews mention this, so I am leaving one here so that hopefully people can at least know this before buying."
"I really had high hopes but maybe my standards are too high for the price of the product. I will say it is super fast and lightweight but the screen quality is quite lacking. It’s like there’s a haze over the screen which gets worse around the edges or it it isn’t at just the right angle, no matter how I adjust the settings I can’t get it to a crisp bright picture. If that doesn’t bother you then the price is right. I have had it for about five days and still debating if I will return it and go ahead and spend the extra money for a brighter screen resolution."
I’ve tried several times to attach a video and photos but it won’t work. I purchased the Lenovo idealpad 3 December 2022. I have used it for about 30 minutes. July 2023 I needed to use it and when I opened it the screen looked like it had black ink poured over it. I contacted the seller who told me the 30 day time return had passed and I needed to contact the factory.  I contacted the factory that told me the day they shipped the computer to the seller the warranty began. The factory told me to contact the seller.  The factory said the computer was purchased January 2022 and I purchased it November 2022 (Black Friday). So by the time I purchased the computer I had 1 month warranty left. Seller now says the computer was sold used. I was a computer teacher and know computers I would have never purchased a used computer from amazon. The seller keeps saying the 30 day return window has passed and referred me back to the factory. I contacted customer support for help and I’m now waiting for an answer if it will be fixed or replaced. It was hard parting with the money to buy the computer and now I’m out my money and no computer. This seller is not a good seller to buy from.
"Great Laptop with a defective microphone.  I've followed all possible solutions found on-line and neither the built-in microphone nor the added external microphone works.  The most I get with the external microphone is 33% despite the volume being set at 100%.  It may be related to drivers, although I also get the message that I have the latest.  Thus, I will send the laptop to a computer repair person.  MOST INCONVENIENT.  An additional expense I was not counting on.  The laptop was shipped overseas, and therefore returning the item is not an option."
Battery life for less than a year laptop is not good
"Machine works as expected so far, but on 2/9/2023 day of arrival in what appeared to be an unopened Lenovo box, Lenovo Advantage utility says laptop Warranty is expired, started 9/22/2021 and ended 11/20/2022, but offering to reinstate it for a small fee effective 30 days after purchase.  No mention in the add that device is anything but new, but suspicious it may be refurbished."
the computer did what it wanted when it wanted.
"My organization needed a cheap Windows laptop mainly to run a web app. This one, as described, fit the bill.  However, the screen is pretty hard to read with any type of bright ambient light (ceiling light, sunshine, etc)"
"Just okay. Nothing spectacular about this product. Especially the screen, it may be a touch screen but the visuals on it absolutely suck. You have to have it at such an obtuse angle that you have a hard time seeing all of the screen for a clear picture. Visuals suck, the battery only lasts for 4 hours unplugged, and it isn’t a great computer. I’ve had better in the past. Buy an HP or a MacBook. I’ve had better luck with both."
This is a beautiful computer with an incredible keyboard and screen but I returned it because the battery would not stay charged
"I don’t recall it saying this computer was refurbished or previously owned but it is behaving as if it is. This computer has no battery life. None! I charged it to 100% as soon as I got it and the battery ran down within 1.5/2 hrs. I will charge the laptop and it says 5hrs or 6hrs battery remaining use it for an hr and it’s basically dead, in power saving mode to prevent it from shutting off. Yes the price is good but the grief it will give you is not worth it at all."
"Seems like it is hard to read, not a sharp display"
I like the touch screenDon't like widows 11Don't like battery life
"I'm happy with my Lenovo Think Book, but this is not the same, nor does it indicate that keyboard is unlit.  Have to send it back which is time wasted.  As Lenovo says whether the unit has a touchscreen or not, it should also indicate the keyboard light or its absence."
"Eh... It's below average.  Will stick with HP moving forward.  Needed a laptop quickly for work and this was a quick delivery option.  You get what you pay for.The screen is very dark and it cannot be made any brighter.  It is also a matte-like finish on the screen, I like the high resolution/non-matte finish of the HP's.  This is a pain to read/see."
"It is a good computer, no bells and whistle but from the first time I bought it, the keypad and screen froze"
"Not as advertised, keyboard is not back lite as advertised. Poor supplier. would not buy from again."
Was directed to this laptop for my son to be able to play some mild gaming like minecraft.....horrible it lags constantly to the pint its barely playable for him very disappointed could jave bought him a regular pc for just a couple hundred more dollars
This computer was advertised as having a backlit keyboard; it does not
It’s a nice laptop but the one I received has a max battery life of about 1:45 and thats in Power Saver mode and most of the MS and Lenovo bloatware turned off. Nowhere near the 7hrs that is advertised. I’ll be returning it and find something else.
The laptop came without charger..I don't understand why..can someone explain me please....
"This laptop functions properly. The battery life, however, is completely inadequate. I've been using this laptop for about 2 months for basic internet access, email and video watching. The battery only lasts 1 - 2 hours! When I initially used the laptop, it lasted about 3-4 hours. Batter life has steadily deteriorated ever since.  I feel ripped off! If this system had advertised that battery life was only 1-2 hours, I would have purchased a different product. ...Time to go recharge the battery!"
"ALL OF A SUDDEN, WHILE UNDER TWO MONTHS THIS LAPTOP'S MICROPHONE STOPPED WORKING, THE CAMERA HAD ISSUES OF DARK SPOTS ON THE PICTURE AND WHEN BUYER CONTACTED, I WAS SENT A LINK TO TROUBLESHOOT MYSELF.THIS WAS NOT A FIX OR HELPFUL AND I FELT FOR MY HARD EARNED MONEY, THIS WAS A SHORT LIVED LEMON OF A SALE AND I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND BRAND OR SELLER EVER AGAIN.  I WANT A REFUND NOW!!!!"
"The description says Windows 11Home. It actually came with Windows 10 in S mode. I don't mind getting 10 instead of 11, but S mode is a rip off."
I find that the computer is not user friendly. The pad is super sensitive and you have to touch it in a particular area in order to open anything. If not touched in that particular spot the computer will not function properly therefore it limits productivity.
the computer would not program
"It’s been 5 months since I got this laptop and now it does not connect to wifi, the mousepad does not work and it just underperformed all around. I’m very disappointed and I wish I just spent more money on a better one."
computer sucks. barley works. costumer service sucks. a computer should work more than a couple of months. costumer service says to talk to amazon because i bought it from there and won't help. i want my money back but they just wont help. amazon either! also bought warranty and no help there either. nothing but thieves.
The laptop is a disappointment. The display is something from the medieval.
"Turned on once. Never again after that. Unfortunately I was out of the 30day range to return when I tried it the second time, but it was hard to get to start up even the first time. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
Not backlit keyboard.  Returned and received no refund
"The description clearly indicates that this laptop has a touchscreen.  It does not!!!  I know this is a quite inexpensive laptop, but that doesn't justify incorrectly identifying its capabilities.  I'll be returning this purchase."
Worked great until it wouldnt power up one day and gave me the flashing power button of death. Disconnected the battery.  Did a hard reset. Nothing. :( not happy.
Everything was great for about 10 minutes and the mouse pad and touch screen have stopped working  5 times in the past hour.  The battery life doesn’t last even for the evening so I can do my homework.
I was so stoked when it arrived it worked great for 6 days and then I shut it down went to sleep woke up tried to turn it on….. crickets. We tried everything to fix it but seems the mother board went bad. So back it went and we will see
I ordered this computer and less than 30 days it stopped working. Sent it to get fixed and it is still broken. Customer service was no help.
"Aside from basic product performance details, this item was specifically chosen based on arrival time. The day after order with a Friday arrival, shipping email reported new arrival date that was later than advertised."
It looks nice in the outside. Won’t to connect to a wireless printer - and recommends a printer that costs $555.00! The camera is low quality. Can’t do anything with it - frustrating !
FAKE seller. never refunds your money despite returning the defective item within a week
USELESS COMPUTER I can't log in
"After only 9 months, laptop turned off / went blank and won't turn on. Lenovo support won't help. The warranty is useless. Absolute nightmare."
I had this laptop for 7 months barely used it and now it won’t come on … please don’t get this laptop!!! It’s affordable but defective!!
"These are great little units, if you want to use Google suite of services. Works really well with Google Docs, and all the other Google apps that are available online for free. I only give a three stars because they’re very inexpensive and not really fantastic computers. But for the price, you can’t beat it."
HP site doesn’t recognize the model # printed on the case or the serial number. Can’t register Chromebook. Thought it would have touch screen like my previous it does not. Outside of that it works fairly well.
It's ok but not as good as the samsung.
Can’t see the gray keys.  Not a good color for an elderly person. Didn’t pay any attention to it at purchasing time.? So I can’t use it as often as planned. Used a couple times since purchased.
"sound was not good, so I returned"
"I have had many HP products over the years and this model by far is hard to work with. For example, the built in mouse is awful you spend way too much time trying to click on what you want and it is hard to navigate it. I bought it for work, and it is just not as user friendly. I may just return it for a better model"
"The laptop works well other than the keystrokes. From the moment it came out of the box, letters are randomly doubled while typing. I was hoping maybe it was extra sensitive because it was so new and that it would sort itself out, but it hasn't gotten any better. This issue is only highlighted as the laptop is now being used for the school season."
"I purchased this item in April 2024. Here we are December 2024 and the charging port has stopped working. It will cost more to fix this than replace it. The hp website states that my 1 year warranty is expired. I can only assume that because I bought this 3rd party they will not honor my purchase date but only the 3rd party buyers. Buy straight from the source if you want your warranty. Aside from that, this product gets 1 star due to the lack of longevity."
product has a large awkward power supply compared to a simple one on my old Samsung
"Good for just the basics. It feels cheap, no weight to it. Mainly all plastic. Keyboard doesn’t light up, not the best picture quality."
Just a regular notebook it doesn't Worth the money that I paid for
"Disappointed, assumed it was a touchscreen. Nice other then that. I should have figured it out before I ordered"
"This is a basic ""use the internet only"" laptop. Weighs way too much to carry. The chromebook is grey, the keyboard is same grey, you can't see the keys. Cannot register with HP, they don't recognize the SN or Product number. In this case it is you get what you pay for"
My daughter used this for homework. One the hinges locked up and when my daughter tried to open it the back part and the screen plate starting breaking/tearing away.  Reached out the SA customer service and sent pictures right away. All they can say is it was damaged and not covered under warranty. Lasted 8 months.
Very good value. key board hard to see
cannot reach websites that I use often without getting error code 403 forbidden
Will never buy a Chromebook or anything like it again.  Extremely hard to navigate if you're used to the standard keyboard.  Absolutely do not like the feel of it.  A younger child will probably love it if they've never experienced a good keyboard before.
Description says it’s the ‘latest’ ChromebookHowever the laptops that arrived had serial numbers like this..after googling to try to find covers we discovered we were scammed and sold old modelschromebook 14a-na1093clThe na series is old
I don't recommend anybody to buy this item.
This is a piece of junk it can do nothing unless you just want to check your email if you have Gmail because so many sites you can't get to because it doesn't support it and if you're a gamer you can load it but most the features don't even work in the game even though it's through the Play store
quit working after 2 days so the product was bad ut the seller seems worse. The return was sent on Aug 28 and on Sept 12 the UPS tracking shows it still hasn't been received by the vendor so they are living on 🤒 ill-gotten money.  Feels like a scam. Beware.
"This would probably be nice, if only it would connect to Wi-Fi. It does not show any available networks, I've typed my network in, entered my password, and the only thing that happens is it tells me it is a bad password. I can assure you, it is not a bad password! And what's up with it not even showing the available networks? I've attempted to get it started, as has my friend who is more computer knowledgeable than I am, but nope! No way to get past the setup screen. Beyond frustrating, and extremely disappointing!"
I had to return as it has no instructions
"The product, an HP Chromebook laptop computer was not properly listed.  The laptop was manufactured in 2013 which doesn't allow me to get operating system updates any longer.  I purchased it on February 26, 2024.  Apparently the seller, Emma's Market, did not want the buyer to know when this laptop was manufactured so that they could get rid of old merchandise.  As a long-time Prime member, I am VERY dissatisfied."
Item was sent broken to us sent it back and was charged a restocking fee on the broken chrome book.
"Purchased March 9th of this year. About a month after receiving the cord stopped working and laptop died. We came back here and found a return was not an option,  so we Purchased another cord. Same thing happened yesterday. Now the laptop is useless unless we buy another cord and go through the same in about a month. Not worth the money or time! Reached out to Amazon customer service and they informed that they would reach out to seller. No response from seller even though customer service said that we would"
"This chromebook repeatedly shuts down unexpectantly, and now today after only a few months of use it will not connect to wi-fi—very disappointing and unreliable. Avoid this seller and only get HP products from the HP store."
"It was ok for the price. I thought it would be fine as a backup laptop while I was saving for a better one but the camera STOPPED working within TWO days of ordering the thing. I used the laptop for some video chatting and that is it!! Dont buy it, its not worth the money."
"Worst purchase of my life. Set up a Google account to use laptop, then next time I signed in, would not verify it was me after 10 or 12 attempts using the captcha feature. This a truly a waste a money and the return process was not effective either."
Viewing angle and resolution is terrible on this one. It looks very dull and pixelated. The opposite of vibrant. I very much regret buying this and wish I could return it. If I were you I would skip this one and get a 1080p screen chromebook.
"The first problem with this Chromebook was the camera. I couldn't use the video chat because the camera on my end didn't work. Then a few days ago, the system shut down while I was typing. I waited a few minutes to see if it would restore itself but nothing happened. Since then it has repeated the shutdown at least once a day. I could have put up without the camera but shutting down is my limit. Who knows what problem will manifest next? This is going back!"
Did care for the screen!
Came never worked paid for return and never got my postage money back !
"I received my new laptop today and it doesn’t connect to my wifi.  With this laptop HP Google OS, you can only sign in as a guest. Very disappointed with HP and Google. I will be returning this laptop."
Had to return it
"Operating system requires to much to get online initially.  It is focused on google and gmail only, otherwise must operate as guest.  My AOL email would not be accepted.  Chrome seems built as an advertisement portal."
"Bought in March, used very little, now dead in August... worthless waste of $275"
"This item does not work properly,I am disappointed with HP response to my question."
"The computer was picked up on July 13, 2024, and by July 24, 2024, it could not be charged past 1%."
"I really thought I was purchasing a great laptop not knowing that it only does Google (Dumb me ). If, I wasn't living in another country, I would return this item and get my monies back, and order a reg. laptop which I thought I was purchasing. This chrome book won't even accept my jump drive what I use for work. Horrible purchase on my part. NEVER again!!!!!!!!"
"Trying to do the initial configuration and start this up and encountered yet again, on this model, a factory error that will not allow the machine to finish configuration and link to my google account. I get an error regarding connection to the internet, even though the machine is connected to my internet and allows me only to log on as a ""guest"". Have had it trying to fix this."
"Just returned my HP 2023 Chromebook Laptop ($194.80) because after 3 days of futility I could not get it to work with any network. Networks refused to activate. Was told to go online and find a solution but that was a waste of time. Gave up. Then came a second kick in the teeth: Amazon subtracted a “restocking fee refund deduction” of $103.03! So I paid Amazon $194.80 for a Laptop Lemon and got back $107.23.  Some refund, eh?"
"I strongly disliked it. I was unable to get online except as a guest. I've never had problems like that.  Should have stuck with my original choice, HP. Much better."
"Even when fully charged computed not turn on, try another computer"
"With this laptop HP Google OS, you can only sign in as a guest. That means you cannot store bookmarks,apps, or files. Very disappointed with HP and Google. I am staying with Windows OS!"
First computer had to be sent back because it came with a bug that wouldn’t let you log into it.  Second had to be sent back directly to HP which was a big inconvenience.
It wasn't a laptop but the HP Chrome Notebook. The color in the displays were foggy. I gave it to a granddaughter for training use.
Very disappointed in this purchase.
Only allows me to sign in as guest.  Guess you get what you pay for.  HP is the worst!Should be zero stars!
I received the laptop yesterday and it doesnt connect to wifi. I see a lot of bad reviews from other consumers complaining about the same wifi issue not connecting.
this thing just died exactly one week after the return window. Waste of money and being shanghaied by chrome was not a great experience.
The item did not work and was used. Sent back immediately after opening it.
This computer stopped working one month past the last day to reurn. Need I say more?
"When there is a update needed (almost everyday) video players will not work and other apps as well. There is extremely limited functionality across the board. Saving documents, photos, and other files is extremely confusing and good look finding what you’ve saved. I can say this is the worst laptop I’ve ever owned by a mile. I will never purchase HP anything ever again."
The laptop was delivered in a plain brown box with no customary HP lettering. The plastic Chromebook was wrapped in plastic and loosely taped and the cords were in plastic. There was NO customary instructions or warranty.
"Fast great display ran very hot the fan never turned off and didn't seem to cool it much went dead in less than 2 hours very hot.Other than running crazy hot it was ok the keys feel a little weak and had to be pushed hard. The mouse it comes with is made so lightweight I couldn't get it to work, but of course that was nothing compared to the hot keyboard surface and loudly racing fan. I sent mine back right away for a refund.  Now I still need a computer, one that doesn't run sizzling hot."
I've really enjoyed this laptop and it works well for what I need it for. But the charger has gotten so hot it's melted both sides of the adapter and I can't buy a replacement charger because it's an atypical charger port.
"You do not have fine control of the cursor if you want to just bump the cursor up or to the side a few more pixels it’s hard to make it creep just a little bit.Lots or ram for nothing, wouldn’t use to edit photos or videos unless you only use a mouse.Forgot to submits this review but Update!!I went to update the laptop hoping it would improve the cursor and laptop shut off on update and refuses to turn back on even after being plugged in for a a full day! Good thing I hadn’t saved much work to it! Wow garbage"
"While this computer is certainly an upgrade from my last computer, it isn't the best in quality. This computer can run my Adobe Premier pretty well, so there's that. However, the functionality of the computer is not great. First off, the battery life lasts maybe a couple of hours and takes twice as long to charge. Another problem is the keyboard. I type relatively fast and for some reason the keyboard has a hard time registering keys. Like, I'll have letters missing from my words and I have to go back and edit what I typed because I type too fast. The sound is also terrible. I'll have the volume turned all the way up and I'll barely be able to hear anything. However, the biggest problem is that the computer gets HOT underneath, almost to the point it's too hot to touch. I wish I was exaggerating. So I will be getting another computer in the future to replace this one. Hopefully sooner rather than later. All I can say is that this would be a decent temporary computer."
The keyboard is not standard. Easy to hit the wrong numbers on the numeric pad. Power button hides on the top function keys on the right. Only use it off line in my work. Would not buy again.
"After several months of use, the laptop plug - which always ran hot - started smoking and then made a loud pop noise. BHWW is not listed anywhere online - they have no presence. I wrote them over a month ago with no response. Amazon - the only place to sell this laptop - says it is not their problem. I asked for a manager who hung up on me. DO NOT BUY."
"This laptop is good, but not the best quality for color."
"I bought this on the first of Feb 2024, to use while my HP was being repaired.  Horrible choice, even for a temporary set-up.You have to type slow and be sure to push each key all the way down - this includes the space, enter, etc. - or it won't respond.The speakers turned all the way up are incomprehensible.  It sounds like the computer is across the house, in a closed room, with pillows over it.Fully charged battery lasts 2-3 hrs, takes half a day to charge, and the USB-C charging port is only there for looks. It's serves no purpose at all.Please don't waste your money."
"The charger for my laptop stopped working. There are no details about where to buy a replacement at all, nor is there any information regarding what type of charger this laptop uses. I bought one on amazon and it doesn't fit correctly. I need to contact the seller but it does not allow me."
"Bought this and was delivered 2/20. It is 6/29 and this laptop will not hold a charge and died. Yes this laptop is cheap, but I could have bought one that would last with the money I spent on this one and a replacement (obviously from a different brand)."
"I got this laptop and set it up, seemed to work fine but then it shut down by itself, and would not restart, and would not charge. I contacted Amazon customer service and was able to return it for a full refund. I’d also like to tell you that the speakers are crap, volume is slow low you can barely hear it."
"Listen, I’m not even the type to write a review but being that This was a big purchase for me on Amazon for my new work from home job and being that I am a full-time employee and have to work eight hours on this laptop and it dies every three hours is ridiculous"
"This laptop started off well, but has since crashed 31 times since I purchased it.  Yes, we've kept a log.  Very disappointed in it.  It is only used for emails and web use."
I was excited only to be let down. I am starting college on Monday. I ordered this laptop and it came ON TIME ONLY TO FIND OUT THE 10 KEY DID NOT WORK. I immediately returned. Now I have to scram to find another.. Yikes
"It constantly closes screens while I’m working in simple apps like Word, it also needs to restart at least every 40-60minutes, it will drop revisions randomly…super frustrating"
Not even a good paperweight.  All it does is hang up.
"The world is filled with these off brand, entry level (read: no frills) laptops. Integrated graphics, mobile processor that conservatively sips battery power, but also lacks umph to do heavy processing.  I frankly wasn't sure why this one is listed at $399 (now $319 as I write this with 20% off).  I can get dozens of oddball brand laptops with similar specs for about $270.  Heck, I can get a similar HP for $369.  So why is this one almost $400?  Having played around with it, the answer is, I don't know.I really bought it as a unit to sort of play around with Windows 11 (all my others Windows machines are still running Windows 10, so I wanted a chance to kick the tires of Windows 11 without messing up one of my other systems with the ""upgrade"").It's pretty thin - maybe that's its selling point?  It comes with a wireless mouse.  It comes in a fancy laid-out box that feels very Apple-like in its presentation of the unit as you open it.  The touch pad is nice and responsive, and they keyboard has a pretty good feel (for a very thin laptop - I personally am willing to trade more unit thickness for a more tactile keyboard - but I type just fine on this one).  I'll grant that it doesn't feel cheaply made (though I have no experience with similar off brand computers to compare it against).I guess I'm not sure this all adds up to $100 more of value (or $50 more of value if you buy it today)."
"Pros: Purple color is nice, light up keyboard, numeric keypad, external mouse included, keyboard cover included, Microsoft already installed, light weight, screen can lay flatCons: it's SLOW - creating on Canva is torture, camera is terrible without bright lighting, sound is tinny, very short battery life, keyboard cover is missing the comma and period (present on actual keys), wifi reception is weak, not touch screenOverall, this laptop is not worth the money. I know you get what you pay for but there are other options at this price point that have to function better. I don't see how this can be advertised as a gaming computer when it's so much slower than even my ancient work laptop. It functions, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone and definitely wish I hadn't bought it. I wonder at those who gave it such great reviews and what their experience was with laptops before this one. I suppose if you've never had one, then maybe it wouldn't be as bothersome.  If you're used to a decent laptop, don't waste your money."
"This thing is so weak, it can't even run PowerPoint without crashing. I was 5 slides into a project for a class, with no pictures or graphics, only words and I tried to drag a slide to change the order when it just froze. I thought it was just a one time issue, so I restarted it and opened PowerPoint again. It took 3 minutes for PowerPoint to start, then I opened what I was working on before and tried to move the slides around. It froze again. This time Chrome and every other Microsoft office program froze with PowerPoint.I uninstalled and reinstalled and the issue is still present. It's like they intentionally made this thing wrong.I'll be returning this thing when I get home from my trip. I'm so disappointed with this thing. I should have just brought my laptop. It's barely bigger, but it can run everything I need and all sorts of video games. AND it barely cost more than this thing. Saying I'm disappointed is a huge understatement. What a joke this thing is.My phone is able to run programs better than this! I don't understand how this thing made it into consumer hands unable to run a program that can be run on a toaster.If this thing starts working properly, I'll change my review.Tldr;Get a regular laptop. This thing can't even run PowerPoint without crashing. 0/10 would not buy again."
"Update:  After a year of use, I wanted to follow-up earlier review.  Unfortunately it has not lived up to my expectations. The Acer chrome book I had earlier is  both cheaper and had fewer issues.  My major complaint is how frequently it freezes and none of the suggested fixes work automatically.  When this happens I charge the device and try much later. So far I have been successful in eventually getting it to work with the same troubleshooting recommended fix but it may take a day or more of numerous attempts to actually fix the problem.  In the meantime I am left without the chromebook.  As it has ended up being used far more often than my larger laptop this is a big problem. The volume could definitely be louder and I purchased a speaker. In general it just doesn't compare to my earlier and far cheaper Acer.  I also purchased a device to plug in as there are insufficient ports.I think because my Samsung tv's and phones work so well, that I was influenced by the name brand. In this instance it has failed to live up to the anticipated quality.The pen which is stored in the device is a plus. Unfortunately it has broken twice while being used in the normal way.  The first time it was under warranty and Samsung replaced. It took a few weeks for the warranty claim to be processed and the new one to come in the mail.  I am now looking at purchasing one myself for around $25.00.Would I purchase this one again?  No, unfortunately I would get an Acer. The Samsung has a superior build appearance which is not reflective of the actual quality. Taking it down a couple stars in light of my use in last year.Initial review:After turning over a gallon of water on the outside lid of my Acer R11 which killed it, I decided to try the Samsung Chromebook primarily because of the screen quality upgrade and additional memory.  As I was very pleased with the Acer Chromebook this review is somewhat of a comparision review then one which doesn't look at the item standing alone.The Acer Chromebook had two 3.0 Ports and both a micro SD and regular SD card reader.  As my camera runs on the larger card and I do a ton of work with photos I had to purchase a doogle to expand the number of 3.0 ports and to add the larger SD card reader.  (I found one that has three ports as well as both types of card readers for a reasonable cost.) The issue with the doogle is that it effects portability as it hangs off the side of the Chromebook.  The cord is only a few inches long which is perfect for my needs and the doogle itself is narrow and long.  I do move alot with the Chrome book and I anticipate that I will knock it off while changing location and forget to eject the device first.As the old Chromebook had only 32 mg of memory I had purchased a Samsung  FIT Plus USB 3.1 Flash Drive 128GB - 300MB/s .  So I stored my thousands of photos and coloring book downloads on that drive as well as video files.  This worked well since I was able to remove the Fit plus and install it in my big laptop to transfer a copy of the same data keeping the two computers synced.  Unfortunately the Fit Plus was damaged by the water and all my files are not retrievable so I will have to copy the info from my primary  back into the Chromebook (and will loose all the data I added since I last synced the two devices).As the Fit Plus was critical to my use, I was very pleased to see that this Samsung had more memory eliminating the need to put as much on the Fit Plus external drive.I had a major issue with the Samsung Chrome software not opening the downloaded Etsy files.  It took about 4 hours to figure out what the issue was.  I found that Samsung 's customer service was of little assistance as they insisted that Google would have to provide the support as it was an operating system error.  I found this really strange as I purchased the Chrome book which only uses Google Chrome and that was installed by Samsung.  When you purchase a device I expect the manufacturer who installed the operating system prior to sell, have done so in a working manner.  (One customer service rep insisted I had to download an extension to open PDF files.  Having had the Acer device I knew that was incorrect, but the customer service lack of knowledge was disappointing.)The last customer service rep was more helpful but I don't think it is an unusual expectation that a device work straight out of the box!  Customer service is frequently an oxymoron!  It was very difficult to understand the  customer service reps, as they all had accents and English was not their first language.  If you think you will need technical support in using any Chrome book, you should keep this in mind.I searched and searched to find a Google ""live human"" or even a human I could chat with online without success.  Basically their customer service is the troubleshooting information and the community site online.  If your problem is not one listed on the trouble shooting pages and/or has never been addressed in the community you are OUT OF LUCK!  I am a very good researcher and this was the first time I have been unable to find a phone number for help that leads to a real living human being!!!  Again this is something you should consider regardless of whose Chromebook you purchase.The Samsung keyboard is larger than the Acer one and it is so much better to use.  I found the micro keyboards to be a pain in the rear as I was always hitting the wrong key when typing.  Samsung has a great sized keyboard that feels very similar to my big Windows laptop when typing.I tried this last night as a tablet streaming a documentary.  It is really too heavy and bulky to use as a tablet  The old Acer R11 performed much better as a tablet in that regard.  The Acer also has an imprinted lid that creates a bit of texture making it easier to grip when carrying it opened.  (I tend to move from room to room if in the middle of a good documentary)  In general as a result of weight and material, the Acer R11 wins in comparing that feature.My other use was for video streaming.  I m not a big tv watcher, but I love documentaries and programming that can be streamed.  In addition I frequently watch how to You Tube videos on a lot of subjects.  This screen is far superior to the  Acer screen.  Not only is the quality superior, the aspect ratio is more like a standard tv screen so you get a larger picture size than I did with the Acer screen.  I have Samsung tvs and they seem to do an excellent job in this area.  If you are going to be watching a lot of videos, this is without question a noticeable improvement.Both devices have good batteries that are similiar in how long you can go before charging.  Some of the Acer models have a waterproof protection feature and an impact resistance which is better than the Samsung.  If children or adults like me are using the device that aspect should warrant serious consideration. (I doubt either would have been safe from accidentally pouring a gallon of water onto the top!)  I have arthritis in my right hand, a damaged finger on the right and loss of sensation to the ends of three fingers on my right (dominant) hand.  I like the weight and keyboard size of this one far more but I will have to take more care as it lacks the ruggedness of the Acer.In conclusion this is a great Chrome book which is worth the extra money if memory, screen performance, keyboard size and build quality are most important.  If you are using the Chrome book for just web browsing with minimal streaming use and want to have it access effectively as a tablet and also need one more resistant to breakage and spills then the lesser cost of the Acer R11 or Acer Spin would be the one I recommend."
"I purchased this item spur of the moment during a lightning deal when then price was dropped to $329. Normally I don't make impulse purchases at that price range, but within ten minutes, the deal was 98% sold out, so I just took a chance and went for it. and boy am I glad that I did. I'm upgrading from a Lenovo C330, which I also like very much (especially for the sub $250 price I got that one at) but you're getting a lot more bang for your buck with this Samsung machine.** Just as a heads up, this is an updated model of the Samsung Chromebook Plus V2 than was what was launched a year ago or so. (There's a video on Youtube that explains the differences -- which is not much. This is a lighter silver color and not the sleek, darker grey.) **I'll break my review down by features:- display: For the price, this display is incredibly sharp. Like, surprisingly nice. My other computer is a 2017 Macbook Pro and I can honestly say that this one is almost on par with the retina display on the MBP. For me personally, display is always the most important single item on a working laptop as low pixel count, resolution and bad colors can lead to severe eye strain and fatigue. This machine doesn't come with Chrome's Night Light feature out of the box, but you can activate it (search on Google). In the past, Chromebooks were known for being very cheaply built computers with low quality components, but I'm very impressed and equally happy with this computer's display, especially for $329.- keyboard: This is where Lenovo and others have Samsung beat. The keyboard is fine, but the keys themselves feel quite small and there's too much space between keys. I feel like I have a much quicker and accurate typing experience on virtually every other keyboard. In terms of layout... It's just your standard Chromebook fare. I will say this is probably my only real disappointment with the machine. The trackpad is also fine. It's nothing spectacular, but doesn't feel particularly cheap. All gestures and two finger scrolling works no problem and there's a nice solid (and quiet) click when pressing the trackpad.- battery life: The battery life is pretty bonkers on this machine. After a couple of console prompts, the battery capacity is shown to be 39 watt hours. This is a huge bump from the Lenovo C330, which already has incredible battery life. My guess is the larger, higher res display necessitates the additional battery capacity. I've not been through two full cycles yet and have been using the machine all day for work during the day and then Youtube/Netflix in the evening. I think it's safe to say that you easily get a full day's worth from a single charge even with lots of video and graphics-heavy use.- speakers: They're not that great. Most computers at this price point have downwards-facing speakers, and this one is no exception. The speakers don't ever get that shrill or rattle, but in terms of overall volume, they're not very loud. I ended up using headphones for a couple of video seminars I had to do today because the speakers were just not loud enough.- cameras: I haven't tried them yet. I don't really use webcams on computers and don't see myself using the cameras on this one much.- build quality: This is a tough one to measure for a few different reasons. It appears that the slate gray Plus V2 has an aluminum/alloy case, but this one is all plastic. It feels sturdy enough, but definitely has that plasticky feel. The keyboard in particular is where it feels especially cheap. But even with a full plastic build, there's really no keyboard or display flex, and the computer feels solid in my lap or on a table. The screen hinges are also pretty sturdy and stay put when you're banging away on the keyboard.I've got to say, even at $400, I still think this is a solid buy. If you're able to grab this during a flash sale for $350 or less, then definitely go for it!EDIT: After only using the machine for a couple of days, the GPU/CPU/internal graphics went completely haywire out of nowhere and the computer became completely unusable. Trying various resets didn't work and opening the display to tablet mode and back didn't help either. The replacement machine is also flickering, giving me the impression that these newer silver models have a major issue with the stability and reliability of the graphics and display. There are a few others who've posted similar issues in their review of this computer here. Still debating on whether to keep it or not because I really want to like this computer but am worried about what happens after the return window and warranty period expire."
"I do not like this one at all. I have another but left it. Glad I have one with me, but this is too heavy."
"I was looking to upgrade my Chromebook to take advantage of the new Gemini AI, which is what the Plus models were created for. To run AI takes a minimum of CPU RAM AND MEMORY. This machine doesn't come close and I think Samsung just slapped the Plus designation because they liked the way it sounded.I liked the size and 2 in 1 capability but no better that the older Chromebook I already have.After extensive searching I've ordered an Acer 514 Chromebook Plus spin."
"Updated Review  9/12/2020My old review is below. This is an update, I only wanted to use this for basic homework (using google sheets, docs, slides, and One Note), and internet web search, but honestly, when it comes to take notes and all it just goes crazy, can't handle much like if I turn on the bluetooth and using One Note, it gets all frozen up.Better to invest on a 2 in 1 laptop, with a decent processor than can give a better performance than this. Also, if you wanna play Roblox, doesn't work really well. I attempted to give this away to my niece but even her smart-phone is way more powerful than this Chromebook.---------------Previous ReviewThis is a good average 2 in 1 Chromebook. I have a Macbook pro that by 2020, has 11 years old and works better and faster than this Chromebook.This Chromebook works well for light and easy processes such as the basic text writing, internet viewing, watching videos and so on.Children tested playing roblox with both, my old laptop and this, both lagged a bit but the Chromebook lagged and stopped working at a given point.This is a tablet with some laptop features that are convenient to do some work on the go.Be warned that if you prefer to download all the apps to have at hand reach you'll use some memory you can save.  For instance, I don't like the Spotify app for android, so I opted to use the web-player and save it as bookmark. Same can be done for social media or other apps that work better as web pages.As per Microsoft Office software, I use the cloud base but only to work on One Note and it lags as well. So I ended up using all the Google software (Docs, sheets, notes, mail, slides, and so on) to work and had been very convenient cause I can access to my documents throughout the devices. Yes, you can do the same with Office cloud, thing is, my experience with Microsoft is that it always lags, freezes, or just stops working.It really depends how you wanna use it and what you need it for.I'm currently taking some college classes where I do nothing but read, write, and get into webinars or zoom meetings. So it works well for basic stuff and for $500+ you pay for this, I'm pretty sure you can find something cheaper.Now. If you're a college student that need to render animations, edit high quality videos, and need more sophisticated software, definitely you're looking at the wrong laptop. There are apps that can work wonders and im sure you could do it all with this Chromebook, I guess you should invest in something that will save you some headaches and won't waste your time.My analogy can be silly but this is ""the snack"" of the gadgets, you can munch on this every now and then with delight and enjoy but in the long run, your hunger and thirst will make you seek for more powerful features as the updates require.I hope this won't turn obsolete too soon or breaks,  cause I really want to enjoy it, like it, and make the most of it as much as I can.The touch screen by using your fingers may not be quite precise but it has the advantage of having its own pen, so there's no need to seek and buy extra pens for this 2 in 1.The sound is definitely not the best but when I plug a bluetooth speaker or a headset, works really well.It has the advantage of reading out loud, dictation, and assistant... but up to this point, every gadget allows this.The screen and the visuals are beautiful, sharp, and your pictures would look great.Sad thing is that I wasn't able took claim the 100GB memory space from Google cause it said that someone had claimed it already and this was supposed to be unused... but I don't know much about this.And to conclude, the battery is not robust. I find myself charging once or twice a day after continuous use while I read, study, write, and have music in the background. I'd say, after 3 hours of continuous use will need to charge it again. I've work with donde Dell laptops that are also 2 in 1 and the battery lasts longer, about 4 to 5 hours."
"I love the size compared to my larger previous laptops. I thought I would miss the number pad but not as much as I thought. No frills, which I don't need anyway since all of my work and info is web-based. The processor is *painfully* slow. I work with multiple tabs being opened at the same time. I don't know if that's the cause, but even when I close out of some, there's a delay. I'm not a patient person combined with ADD so when the chromebook is processing slow, it causes me to move onto something else that can be done on another device, hindering my workflow."
"It took me a while to get into it but I managed to learn some things about the operating system and its potential.  The screen, although having a resolution display, seemed muddy, like you were looking at it through sunglasses.  The touch response had a noticeable lag and moreover, would blank out for not apparent reason.  This matters got more interesting when I'd have it in tablet mode for use of the stylus.  The screen would go black or large portions would reverse to negative.  I'm assuming that there was a loose wire somewhere.  I called Amazon and they were quick to offer me a refund.I'll try again with another."
"Purchased this notebook that arrived in the Arabic language making it impossible to set up!  Returned after a time consuming chat with Amazon rep.  Second one arrived & while setting up the notebook it flashed a security warning.  It had just come out of the box & was on 4 minutes when it locked up.  There was no issue with our WIFi as a desktop & a tablet were working.  Returned & will not purchase another!  Very disappointing, never saw the pen that was supposed to be with it.  I thank Amazon rep for helping me clear out my Google acct!"
"When my original Samsung Chromebook (XE303C12-A01US) was dropped from Google support, I started looking for a more up to date model (I guess that's why they have an expiration date on the units). I was expecting something about the same weight that I could use while watching TV. The unit isn't that. It's heavy enough that you always know you have it on your lap. The unit is also about twice as thick as my old Samsung Chromebook  The screen is great with 1900x1200 pixel resolution. I haven't used it for the stylus as I expected.As long as you expect this to be more like a laptop experience than a tablet you should be OK."
"Heavy, small, lacks memory and it's quite limited."
"This laptop died on me in under just 3 years.  It lacked some of the functions you would be used to on a traditional WIndows laptop, but for basic stuff it worked just fine.  I dropped it a few times and it was very sturdy.  I don't think I would buy another Chromebook again, but this one represents a decent value."
"I averaged out what I would give for MY Chromebook versus my roommate's Chromebook, which never worked successfully. I sent it in twice to be repaired and nothing worked. I was supposed to get a new one after calling them for the third time. That was RIGHT before the pandemic started and I waited and waited. They were supposed to send me a new one and I never heard from them. MINE works great, but when I buy 2 and only 1 works...well then.So, I guess what I am saying is...best of luck."
"Caveat Emptor: The Chromebook arrived on December 1, 2022. Discovered the device will only get software and security updates until Jun 2024 -- its Auto Update Expiration (AUE) date. Only 19 months of useful life!"
"Please note the Auto Update Expiration date for this device is June 2024.  Having purchased it in January 2021 I feel a little short changed, instead of the usual expected 8 years of Google support these devices will lose all upgrades and support in just over three years.  Samsung should flag this in the description!All Chromebooks have an expiration date, Samsung need to be more up front about the short time span of these machines."
"I ordered this tablet because I was excited about a 2-in-1 that I could use for work and home design projects. It came with a built-in tablet pen like the Galaxy Note 9, no charging needed and had a convenient slide-in holder for it too. Unfortunately, you CANNOT install Adobe programs on this unless you can find them on Google Play. So, no InDesign, Illustrator, or Photoshop.Very disappointed and let down, because I thought I had found my perfect tablet for a phenomenal price, but I guess you get what you pay for."
"A beautiful chromebook but has trouble with staying connected to FIOS TV app and that is the primary reason I bought it.  Constantly freezes and says ""no internet"" when WIFI is full strength.  Never happens with my Asus laptop."
"After numerous attempts to properly connect to wifi and scouring the internet, found this answer on chromebook help page: ""There are some models that shipped with a WiFi bug that made it into the Stable channel, I'm afraid. This is compounded by a bug that also prevents updating using the terminal app in Guest and running ""autest"".Not knowing how many units are affected, will be returning and finding an alternative option."
"Researched this more after I got it. There's something about the hinge being attached to the glass and a lot of people saying it breaks within a year or so. You go to open it and you end up having the hinge stay down with parts of the screen. Not taking a chance,  plus shipping box was pretty rough. No padding for the laptop box."
"Since this product is advertised specifically for school work and projects, I purchased this product for that reason. Unforetunatly, this product does not support the software that is required in my school. If your school requires a Respondus lockdown browser, do not buy this laptop. I am really disappointed that I spent so much money and can not even use this laptop. I wish I was aware of this before purchasing. Especially since I'm currently going to school full time, working full time, and supporting myself off of a minimum wage job. Also, Microsoft apps on the Chromebook are not the same, harder to use, and do not have the same features as a Microsoft operating system. I strongly suggest buying a Microsoft or MAC operating system."
"Edited Review:I originally purchased this laptop in 2020 and it worked quite well for a long while. However, as of a few weeks ago, it has stopped working so smoothly. The LED indicator flashes red whether the device is plugged in or not, and I have tried various chargers (all rated accordingly) with no change. It still just flashes red and won't turn on.Original Review:Sleek design. Battery life has been impressive so far. The touch screen works quite well and makes the track pad almost pointless.The stylus is an awesome addition. I wanted a computer that I could also use for drawing and this is exactly what I wanted. It's like drawing on paper, not choppy and is very responsive."
"Good product overall but it's been less than a year since I received and the battery life is not great. After 4 months the battery started to die quicker and though it isnt baaaad, it is surprising that it doesn't last as long as they claimed and I am not a heavy user of the chromebook."
Thankfully I was able to return it as it completely stopped working. The laptop had full battery & I had only used it 2c before it happened.  I spoke to amazon & samsung tech guys & bright could hel so I was advised to return it. Aside from that this laptop is overall great for on the go & fast start up & browsing...
I really enjoy this Chromebook. It's the first Chromebook I ever purchased for myself. It works great. I really like the stylus. I just think the battery life should be much better especially with an attached keyboard. I have to power off the Chromebook whenever I'm done using it or the battery will drain. The battery drains even when it's sleeping.
Every time I try to log in it tells me that my password is incorrect and I have to re-enter a password every single time that I try to log into my Chromebook makes it very frustrating it makes it so I don't want to use it
"what I disliked about the chrome book is that you have to use shift + alt to do too much when you are using chrome book for work and personal purpose, that slows down the time of getting things completed."
"I thought this was a good idea until it came in and I used it.  It's a very nicely made computer but you can't do much with it and for the price, you can get a windows computer with lots more memory and options.  This is not hardly usable for me."
"The price is nice, but it is painful to use on a daily basis. Simple tasks like loading a web page, opening a new web page window, or clicking in a text box are noticeably slow and delayed. I don't recommend purchasing this because of its poor performance."
"Purchased 2 for remote learning for my kids. The touch screen isn’t bad. The pen that came with it is already broken. The battery life isn’t the best, but will do and one of the charging cables already had a short in it and it hasn’t been 6 months."
Bought this as an educator trying to do online learning with my students. I had to send it back (took a week to ship) because the brand new Chromebook was faulty. They received it and now I have to wait 2 weeks for a refund. That makes 3 weeks i am unable to do my job because this company decided to send out faulty equipment. Other than that this chromebook is a good product and works very well. There were 2 bought and my husband took the other and likes it very much.
first 20 minutes that I'm useing it  screen is nice dont now what to say the screen is like an ipad  . from 1 to 5 I say a 4  cheap very cheap  kinder garden cheap
"****** UPDATE!!!!! I AM FURIOUS!!! I go to start working on my project and it keeps starting over!!! The system keeps saying, not responding!!! The laptop won't stay on unless it's plugged into the charger, and won't turn on either!!! Why did you guys send me a refurbished laptop!!!??? 0 stars!!!!!! Do not buy and waste time!!!!! My project was due and I can not even get this thing working!!!!!@!!I purchased a new laptop, I was expecting for it to be in a box with new instructions, and new charger. This looks refurbished. If I didn't really need this laptop, I would send it back!!! Don't charge full price for something that has been used. 2 stars for packaging being unprofessional, and for my laptop being scuffed up out of box."
"Not worth I asking price. The specs aren't impressive enough for the price tag and the device itself is wonky difficult. Sure, it works and I wouldn't call it broken, but it's just not worth 400 bucks."
Computer is great. Good quality screen everything functions as it should. The reason I left only a 2 star review is because the device was delivered in an already open box and had obviously been returned before. We were under the impression that we would be receiving a brand new device. Luckily my husband was able to reset the device and it had no issues that we can see as of now.
"*** BUYER BEWARE *** This item came in the original and sealed Samsung packaging, but with a couple issues. As you can see in the photos, there are additional, aftermarket stickers applied. There are 3 over where the Samsung model number is listed on the original packaging and another showing the model I ordered. The first sticker applied over the REAL model number is the same as the one you can see with the model I ordered. 2 blanks were then applied on top, effectively blocking out what's actually in the sealed package.I'd like to give the benefit of grace, but this is just too blatent to believe that it was a mistake. The actual model received is older, not touch screen, smaller, and less memory. Luckily Amazon is sending a replacement, but I'm wary of what will come."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            So I was pretty excited cause I bought this chromebook as a gift to myself on December of 2019 and now, today March 22nd 2020 (3 almost 4 months later) im feeling really disappointed cause the screen went completely blank as if the computer was turned off. So I was watching Netflix and had to go to the bathroom so I paused it and went as I would normally do but by the time I got back the screen went on sleep mode as it has before except this time it wont turn on. Maybe it's just this one computer or maybe it's an on going issue with all like this one. Be wary of this chromebook, just thought I'd put it out there."
"Hi I just got the product yesterday and I've been charging it on and off for pretty much 24hrs but the laptop is still blinking red and the charger itself is blue, so I know it's on. But every time I press the power button, no matter how long or short, the screen doesn't turn on. Am I missing something? It only came with a quick guide manual and didn't go into detail. I would like to try to figure out what to do before returning it please, thank youUpdate: returned it, which is a bummer, hopefully next paycheck I can get another samsung chromebook, since this is the first time I've had issues like this at all with Samsung."
"Charging cord was very inconsistent.  Very difficult to connect with a customer service rep and when I did, they told me the chromebook was out of warrenty even though it had been purchased less than 3 months ago.  Redirected me, to another department that would take 3 days to verify that it was under warranty despite me sending them an invoice with date of purchase.  Very poor customer service from Samsung and will probably never purchase another product from them."
"Received the cheaper 32gb silver version instead. Works fine. Runs smoothly. The pen is the best feature of it. Wont advise getting if you dont have a strong internet connection. Would have been happy if was sent the correct version. Check your device carefully when you get it, some versions have subtle changes in features."
"This product was not touch screen, and even though it came with a pen, that didn’t work either. I’ve already had it crash on me and the time is messed up. I believe it was refurbished and labeled as new. It’s serviceable, but falsely advertised."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                My first unit arrived with a broken track pad so i requested a replacement from the seller. Just over a month after receiving the new unit the screen is now broken. It will work for a few minutes then the screen shorts out, flashes black, gets covered with green lines then goes cloudy. I now have to send the unit to Samsung to be repaired since its outside of the return window. The Chrome OS is awesome, this computer might not be the best."
"I used this device as a simple mobile platform for documents and images, at home and on the go.  It had so little memory that I dedicated an SD card to provide adequate file storage, and I always struggled to find ways to make the Google apps perform as I needed.  But after almost precisely 1 year after purchase, the screen went bad, displaying interference patterns and locking up the device.  I was never able to use it again after that.  For a $400 product, I expect much longer and better service than dying on its 1st birthday.  Avoid this product."
"Yea, I've only had this for less than 3 weeks and all of the sudden my screen keeps blacking out and restarting the system I have been continuously needing to go back and find what I was looking for on the internet or if I'm writing essays and such. Need to rewrite from the beginning. I use this mostly for school.i want to be sent a new one or refunded"
Did not meet my expectations. Battery has short life.
"It will not turn on, only a black screen.  I googled for advice and none of the suggestions worked.  I tried the Amazon chat and ""I'm all set"" was the only option; I was not able to write in a description of the problem.  My advice to anyone considering buying a Chromebook is ""Don't"", at least not from Amazon.  Evidently many others have had a problem with turning on Chromebook because there are many suggestions online on how to do so, but don't count on finding one that works."
We like these Samsung chrome books in our house but the model we purchased here was bulkier and heavier than expected which was disappointing.
"The unit arrived quickly but 48 hours after I set everything up it froze. Simple forced reboots don't work, had to factory set. After having to do this 3 times I called and Samsung agreed its an issue.bi sent it back, they received it. It's been a month since they received it. Over and over they promised to send a replacement. After weeks of this, and getting the tin around, they finally said they would refund my money if I could provide a receipt. I did. And a week later still no word it's been issued. Nightmare experience."
"I bought this on sale brand new and paid for a 4 year warranty after six months it quit working so we sent in for warranty and they said it was unrepairable and refunded cost not warranty, we said we wanted computer with no refund and they would not send our computer back. All computers are repairable and they can’t tell me they didn’t keep computer and resale at full price witch is twice what we paid at sale. We would like our computer we paid for and or a replacement keeping our computer seems like a scam at least."
"I bought this laptop a year ago because I needed something mobile for work that could easily work with G Suite apps. As a tablet, this would be an OK product, but I definitely wouldn't call it a laptop. Apps freeze and stop working all the time. I'm really only using it for emails (which I constantly have to check on my cell that the messages actually send and don't just get stuck in the outbox or disappear), Google Sheets & Docs, and the web browser.Overall, I'm very disappointed and would advise everyone considering this to look elsewhere."
I love Samsung products and bought this because my tablet I have had for years finally quit for good.  Day two the pen broke and it was the main reason we chose this one. It's broken off inside the device so not sure how to get it out and if we can even replace it.  BOOOOO
"Using a chromebook is completely frustrating.  You will realize that you have taken much for granted in using a computer or a tablet/smartphone.  For example, opening a .pdf, not so fast, you cant do it half the time.  Easy file management, nope, not happening.  Easily switch between windows, nope once again additional steps in between you and what you are trying to accomplish.  Save the cash and buy a small laptop, you will be much happier in the long-run.  This review was written after 6 months of use."
Can’t move very far from a WiFi signal.
My only disappointment with this computer was that I could not put my iTunes  Acct on it
"Within the first 6 months the battery died and we had to send it back.  Now the the new battery won’t charge after being replaced several months the later.  Turns out the battery is fine, but the charging cable is no longer working."
"I bought this chromebook to replace a 3 year old one that was no longer able to find a wifi connection.  Four months in, it started having the same problems.  2-3 times a day I have to reboot it.  The only reason a person buys a chromebook is because they need it for internet use.  Which makes this one useless.  Selling crap electronics with a 1 month return window?  I will never purchase something like this through amazon again."
Purchased this for our son and after less than two years the mother board and battery need to be replaced as the computer doesn’t even turn on. Obviously it’s out of warranty so requires a $220 repair. Don’t waste your money.
"I bought this computer on February 14, 2020. I was happy with the product until I started to have small issues right away. The unbelievable part comes today when I am browsing my pictures and I see a picture that I don't recognize dated 2015????? Therefore this computer was REFURBISHED but It was sold to me as NEW!!! I was totally speechless and DECEIVED! I have the picture to show you as prove!I want to know how are you planning to amend this misleading issue!"
"Bought for my daughter, who draws. It started acting 'wonky' at 3 months, stylus problems, not working. Then she lost apps, and we cannot get them back on the machine. Two days ago, it just stopped working. Will not even turn on. My daughter will lose literally hundreds of drawings because we cannot get it to power on. Just went to get the return working, and a little pop up said, ""that window has closed'. Very disappointed."
"The stylus is not as sensitive as you would expect not easy to do any sort of drawing on, the touch screen is not very responsive to touch it works decent with the stylus, half the time you can’t use the touch screen and have to flip it over to lap top just to click something, not nearly as user friendly as described, would not pay this price for something of this quality, better off getting something cheaper it will work the same"
"This is my 1st and last chrome book, price is acceptable, but...just don’t get a chrome book, MacBook and IPad are still my favorite, you will know what I’m saying after you use them all"
"After 13 months of use, the Chromebook is not working.  Also, Samsung will charge $75 for diagnosis.  They will not tell you in advance the cost to repair it.  If you think the cost is too high  and  do not want to repair it you need to pay the $75.00 any way.  Samsung quality is not the same any more."
"When I opened this for my birthday it looked nicer than any chromebook I've seen before. It was silver like a mac book, but smaller. When I went to turn it on it wouldn't. Obviously this didn't seem good to me. After reading the booklet it came with, I realised that it doesnt turn on until fully charged the first time. I charged it for a while, then went to turn it on. The screen brightness was on the lowest and wouldn't go up."
Survived just under a year with gentle use. Pretty much only used for email and budgeting. Now it won't turn on and just flashes red.
"Very different, not easy to adjust to the difference."
"I enjoyed this product for the first 7 months. Then the screen started to show random colors and the computer would freeze at random times. Finally, after 8 months, it would not turn on at all."
Terrible connection to internet via wifi. Had this thing 3 weeks and now it barely connects at all. I am having to connect via an Ethernet cord. Also constantly having to shut it down and reboot to correct chrome interface problems. Cheap parts. Don't buy Samsung!
"Ordered this but received a cheap, older model worth half the price, although I was charged for this device. Not sure who was responsible for the mix-up, but I'd be very careful when ordering. I really was looking forward to giving this as a gift to my daughter but was completely cheated by its arrival. Returned the cheap model for a refund."
"Worked great, until it didn’t. If you want something that lasts longer than a year, don’t purchase."
This laptop has the worst Wi-Fi pick up unless you plan on sitting right next to your router don’t buy it if you get more then 5 ft away from your router you have weak signal and it keeps dropping it and saying out of range.
After 4 month the device couldn’t connect the wifi.Called Amazon they shoot me to Samsung.  Still WiFi not working. Waste of money 😞I am not gonna buy electronic device from Amazon anymore.
The device isnt even a year old and will no longer take a charge. I do not know how to contact anyone about this and its frustrating.  It says not eligible for product support. Any device Ive ever bought at least comes with a year manufacturer warranty.
"Bought this for my teenage daughter for Christmas.  3 months later, charger stopped working right unless you want to mess with it to charge it. Called amazon and Samsung and neither were any help. Bought a new charger and still having issues with it turning on. Don’t waste your money!!!"
"Great unit but after 5 months it stop charging .  Samsung Canada can’t help me because the transaction with amazon doesn’t have a serial number on it.  Disappointing , just contacted amazon today we’ll see what happens.  This maybe my last transaction for buying electronics ."
"I got this for my daughter and it broke within a month. She was careful with it and had never dropped or spilled anything on it, but it no longer turns on. Complete waste of money, buy something else."
Screen started to fail the day I took it out of the box. Don't waste your time or money. These drop ship sellers are selling product they don't know the condition of and you might be compromising your data by logging into it.
"Stay away...screen resolution is lacking, it only lasted 1 year, issues with connectivity to WIFI, and glitchy battery. Purchased the Lenovo flex and its awesome. Unfortunately Samsung failed with this one (I usually really like their products)."
"Its a present for my daughter, she received it today, turned it on it worked great for about an hour then the screen went to straight lines and blurry on and off black. So disappointing!!! and now I don't see a return option. even though it was a prime purchase??"
"Really liked this laptop at first & did not use alot, but went to use a bit later,  and now it won't turn on or charge! Wasn't expensive and wasn't worth it anyway"
Less than two years old and already fried. Customer service is a nightmare.
Stopped turning on after 10 months. Waste of money. Charging light just blinks red and won't turn on. Had it in my lap working and it just powered down and won't turn back on
I received the brand new unit yesterday and followed the instructions by fully charging it before use. I turned the pc on and blue light illuminated but display stayed blank and would not change from this state
Only thing I would say..is that it glitched when flipping screen on different  apps. And seen lines through  it. And always through my daughter  out of games she was playing...returned item
dead won't Turn On... I need to talk to Amazon or the seller if possible can fix the tablet.
"Doesn't work right on some websites, drops wifi all the time and I have to restart the laptop.. If I could I would give it a -3 star"
"The product was awesome , only when it would work. It would keep shutting down claiming Chrome OS was missing. Very disappointed since it was so handy to use when it wanted to function correctly"
Should have some information of incompatability with certain models.
Literally used this 10 times - didnt charge it for a couple weeks AND IT DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE IT DOES NOT POWER ONserves me right for getting a chromebook
"I called support about my product I had problems using my laptop, to work I asked for operational instructions.  None came with the product.  I still don't any instructions"
Unstable wifi connection
I wouldn’t know because it seems they sent a used one that won’t turn on and has a scratch on the top!
"Used twice in 3 months, now it won’t turn on at all, support is absolutely zero help, basically you’re screwed when you buy this"
computer did not meet my expectations could not print from it reminded me of a glorified i phone not suited to my needs at all would not purchase another one
After about a month the buttons started jamming has problems transfering data and buttons on mouse pad Broke in the fist week.  This is not worth it in the long run .
Upon receipt the OS did not work. I can either send it back or buy more items to download chrome OS and the reinstall it to the book.
the computer was fine but it did not include the pencil that was to be included with it
I havnt even had my chrome book for four month and just stop working. Won’t turn on and won’t changer. I
My laptop won't turn on I let it charge for two hour hours and it still won't turn on
"After having this computer for less than 3 months and using it in a limited capacity, it would not power on. Since it was under factory warranty for 1 year, I was able to take it to a Best Buy location where they informed me that the motherboard was out (which basically is the computer). They sent it out to be repaired which will take 3 to 5 weeks.  Update: Computer was not repairable and company charged a $215 restocking fee when this computer was returned. Refused to issue a full refund. How do you restock a computer that is not repairable?  I was not informed of this fee before returning the computer. I want to appeal the partial refund and I want the A-Z full refund."
What they don't tell you is that the pc is modified and since it's modified it voided the manufacturer warranty so if you need anything go to the seller
"Honestly, this thing is pretty high performance for the price, but the battery life is just pathetically bad."
"Purchased this computer w their option of 32 RAM few months ago.  Recently had issue w basic system functions not working.  Contacted HP to use 1yr manufacturer warranty and was informed that 16 RAM was highest amt allowed for this computer and that the seller altered the computer by making it 32 and thereby voided their warranty!  And that the issue I was facing was because of the incompatibility with 32. I even gave them the pdf from HP that showed this. Contacted seller multiple times and they don't care - Amazon was no help either because I was past the return window and it was a 3rd party seller.  So I'm left with a new, but unusable laptop.  I'm never buying important things from 3rd parties on amazon again."
"Within LITERALLY 6 hours of starting this laptop, it started freezing & glitching before I even downloaded anything. I had to restart the “NEW” laptop for the screen to unfreeze from a blackout display. About 3 days later which was my 3rd time using the laptop, it died (I didn’t keep it on the entire 3 days and I had only charged it that one time when I first got it. When it was plugged in and turned back on I got a warning/notification telling me that the battery health was low. How is that possible for a “ NEW” laptop that has been charged once and not been used for more that 4 hours TOTAL?Long story short…the laptop “LOOKS” new but there’s no way a new laptop should have this many issues within the first 3-4 days of use. I believe it is a refurbished laptop, and that infuriates me. So, this is your warning, save yourself the worry of purchasing a “NEW” laptop that may bring more stress than actual convenience."
"Great machine!  Much faster.  Bigger memory storage, which is one of two reasons I bought it.  Also for the Windows 11 support.  BOOM!  (Oh, snap!)  That was when it was new.  Update from June 8th to September 8th, a big screw-up with logging in.  I could not and a geek could not get into any repair option. It became whack-a-mole and still wouldn't go to Bios. Frustrating junk pile I just gave to my supergeek brother.  (He gets to keep it.) Fragile and requires extra care in establishing rescue dates and ID."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Battery life is short and I don’t like the graphics on this laptop.
Computer screen flickers on and off constantly.  It then goes black and has to be rebooted. Sending back to Amazon.
"What a disappointment.!! First off, you have to buy Windows 11 software, it doesn't come with it, that's over $100.  The graphics are super dull and you can't change it and the battery life doesn't last at all.  I fully charged it a day ago and just went to use it and it was at 1% battery life - why, I hadn't even used it.  I am so unhappy with this HP laptop!!  I'm only using it for bills (thank god) but still - I am so disappointted with this purchase of this HP Laptop."
"Seller is making unauthorized upgrades to laptop.  HP says that laptop is only supporting 8gb memory and 512gb hard drive.  mother board will not work with this,  and HP will not warranty the laptop due to this."
"So, I bought this to prepare for my web design classes. Less than 12 hours into ownership, the screen went blank. Then it began to flicker. Couldn't do anything to recover it because the screen wouldn't stay. It arrived in a box that looked like it had been opened before. I'm horrified. This was someone's broken return, I guess. I called the number on the box and it went to a full mailbox. This is not acceptable. Do not buy from HP."
"The box holding the computer had been taped and there was additional stickering on the box not from the manufacturer.  I plugged it in and immediately got error messages, including a bad fan.I am returning this item."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                Hello, my laptop is new but the battery indicate no power, no charging, please what i need to do, help me please!"
It would not load windows or Microsoft errors so returned it and got something else.
Computer was not working without cord being plugged in. Refund is taking way to long.
Had to return this within a week. The battery would die in a very short time.
After setting it up I found it the warranty expired over a year ago.
Very disappointed in this computer1) there’s no keyboard lighting2) came with i3 (intel)3) did not have word or excelLook elsewhere before considering this unit
"Absolutely ridiculous. Never had a laptop crash on me so frequently. As I said, this thing crashes more than Texans driving on ice."
"Bought the laptop to take on big overseas holiday, set it up and put it aside to take, went to use it and total fail. Doesn't even open a screen. If I could give Minus ratings I would because I am now minus $800 and because I put it aside I am past the return date. Totally ruined my photographic holiday!!!!"
"The 7 inch fire is lightweight and easy to hold. Screen resolution  is excellent. It works well as a Kindle reader and for reading the news and checking your email. I have had no issues with the refurbished version although I suspect that battery in a new one might last longer.. However it is small, with the usable screen not much bigger than a large smartphone. It also seems slow, even compared to my 10 inch Kindle fire; many websites seem to take a very long time to load. The other serious problem is the paucity of apps available from the AppStore, far fewer than with Apple or Android devices. The proprietary Silk browser works reasonably well but is inferior to Chrome or Mozilla, which are not available. Don't expect performance and features even remotely similar to an IPad or Samsung tablet."
"I don't typically gripe about electronics that are cheap, but this is incredibly useless. You can't get the google play store, which wouldn't be a problem if the amazon app store actually HAD the apps I'm looking for. I'm forced to use their slow and unintuitive browser along with having to deal with several pre-installed apps that I will NEVER touch but can't delete. Half of the space on the device I can't even free up because of forced applications. Even Microsoft gives me the option of using a different browser, so what amazon monkey is making these executive decisions? In summary, I should've bought a Windows or Android tablet, and I advise others to do the same, it'll save you a lot of pain. Now I have this refurbished paperweight that I can't do much with besides maybe watch videos through the not-youtube Youtube app and stare at the endless advertisements.The battery does last 10 hours though, which might be the only positive."
It’s an improvement over previous generation but can be slow at times.  Good enough for what I need .  Mostly for Netflix or watching videos mostly.
"I have owned many Kindles over the years including the very first one. I wish they would just stop trying to make it into an IPad and just let it easily and quickly download books. I don’t need a camera on my kindle or access to all the BS Amazon offers unrelated to READING that makes navigating a horror. This one is just another disappointing mess. Dings for reasons unknown, slow and confusing to open, downloads slow, even page turning is a royal pain. I hate it. So why did I buy it and the last 2 that didn’t last even 2 years? Because Amazon decided to drop the op system on the 1 so I can’t search and buy books with it anymore. And thanks, Amazon, for not making it well known that I could have gotten a credit on my previous Fire that just died out of the blue thus requiring me to buy this piece of junk. Arggg!"
"Audible parental control doesn’t work: with a bluetooth headset connected, downtime stops Audible playback but the headphone  button allows playback to continue, past both downtime and time limits (all night)."
Great for use as a coaster under a drink.  Useless as a tablet.  SLOW AND CANT GET ANY USEFUL APPS!!ZERO STARS.
"It was refurbished and looked fantastic. But kept saying moisture detected on charging port, and was shutting the port down. Then message disappeared and returned frequently. So returned to avoid potential problems down the line"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It’s more or like an I pad. Music movie playing games.good packaging,easy to use,"
"How many apps do you think you have on your phone? 40? 50? how about your phone from 2 or 3 years ago? 15-20 tops? LOL  ah, yes the days when we got excited to get a few free apps or games on our new phones... alas those days are OVER bro! get you a variation of the moto g device family. Out of the box, she is pretty amazing. I didn't have a single complaint really. Super fast, tons of storage, great camera, new updated apps, lots of customizing, etc. JUST WONDERFUL. After a few months it happened, the dreaded update in April I think it was, maybe March, I now have 400+ apps. (I will attach a pic, it shows 399, there have been about 30-40 more that have trickled in since the initial dump, which took about 5-7 days to finish up... and 75-80% are ""system apps"" (bloatware from any and every carrier in fact.... ALL. OF. THEM.) For example, a bluetooth app for t-mobile, & verizon, & sprint, & metro, && cricket. Before you say, ""just uninstall them and move on!"" - I did. I have. I've factory reset twice and they're just BUILT INTO THE phones disk memory. There simply is no ""delete"" them. Some of them, as duplicatory as they are, messing around with them can still brick up your jawn within a few clicks... and before you even start, you are not a dev... so chill, I mean neither am I... but you just stay out of that menu, that app, and that folder. Really, who knows why they name everything in tech sketchy stuff like ""com.sys.IM-WATCHING-YOU-PAM.000"" and ""<%real/secret/23-LISTENER999>... but anyways... JUST PROMISE ME, YOU WON'T GET INTO THAT APP, OR FOLDER.... okay?So Motorola should reimburse me for having to put myself through IT school to teach myself to operate on this phones guts and remove all these garbage apps manually to create the phone I thought I purchased. All you can do is force stop and disable them. Buuut I still feel like they are gathering data, bc, why wound't they be. Its not just this model either, my partner has the moto g stylus 5g and its even worse on theirs. the play store basically never gets a break from constant updates (and then theres the transferring of precious data to the mother ship)yeaaaa we also had to upgrade our home internet plan and router because of all this. We couldn't both use the wifi at the same time doing anything at all. it was crazy. allllllso the apps are gathering intense amounts of data and ALL WANT crazy permissions that have nothing to do with the app itself. like the calculator wants camera permissions... nuts. The sheer number of apps that require making system changes or having total device control... it was too much. I would almost ask for a refund, but from what I see these days most phones are leaning that direction, making money off our god given ones and zeros.... and then still try and look at us in the eyes while they sputter out the retail price of the next generation of your favorite device. can't even hold it down on a free case or something..THEN - - when you finally get a break from force quitting and removing permissions that, somehow keep TURNING BACK on... you might have a few minutes to enjoy a quick photoshoot. NOPE. the camera app it comes with stinks, it just soooo basic.. so then you think, oh, i'll download a cool camera app off play store... NOPE. theres a fricking governor on the camera. That makes it so NO 3rd party camera app will get full usage of ALL THE MEGA PIXELS YOU PAID YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY FOR (48 megs to be precise, which is overkill, but still, you will be lucky to get to use 10 or 12 MP!!)Seriously. And JUST as google starts conveniently implementing the awesome 2 step verification, and authentication keys.... JUST in time for you to have to answer to your wife about why you don't have as much info in your google takeout as she does... yikes... oh and squeeze on some more of that exact same conversation about your FB activity as well.. yaaaaay.So, let me get this straight... I now have to REMEMBER ALL MY UNIQUE PASSWORDS && double log in, && verify 3 ways, all to check a notification thats just a promotional email about the new apps GEWG will put out next week. AND then FINALLY the google security come forward to say they don't trust my log in (bc i've got a VPN) - - - (from guess who - G1 - duh!) and they really cant tell the difference between MY REAL actual login on my trusted device from what it must assume is a HAKKr logging in 3 states away. . . . . . E.V.E.R.Y. LOG - INNNN!at this point i am thinking about a jitterbug and some stress eating of sour worms to relax.but yeah the phones cool, other than that."
"I've been using this phone for about nearly a year now, the fingerprint sensor stopped working and resigering my fingerprint within 6 months of having this phone and the camera is Honestly pretty blurry in general unless you get very close and personal with what your photographing. The phone turns on and works fine for calls and scrolling Instagram. However with games, streaming music, watching YouTube and or texting or typing, it lacks a bit. The keyboard is either slow to react, doesn't type at all, or ""ghost types"" (Registers your typing but you can't see what your typing) or all three. It can freeze up and be stuck on one page for a while too, it can take up to a solid 2 minutes and a half for it to start working again. It's terrible with games that require more then tapping and can crash really easily, same with streaming music and watching YouTube. It can also crash uploading photos to other websites (like profile pictures, things like that) it's a very buggy and finiky phone. The phone works as a phone but it lacks on so many aspects besides calling and speakers. I'll also give it that It holds a charge for at least the full day. But with all the bugginess of it, it's just irritating to deal with to say the least. This phone is quite literally meh. It's a pick your poison situationship with this phone. Not bad but also not good, buy at your own risk I guess. I'm going back to Apple once I'm able to."
"The unbelievable amount of configuring and disabling to get this intrusive garbage from constantly nagging you is a nightmare. I can't recommend this phone simply because so much of this device is geared toward monetizing you, this is definitely how they make their money back. I was really irritated that the Screensaver app called ""Glance"" doesn't even have a [X] to close the nag window that kept popping up, I had to use the navigation buttons on the phone to bypass it and then eventually had to find a way to force stop this app. Its just one of the many horribly intrusive programs that's preloaded and impossible to avoid. Just look up how to remove ""Glance"" Lock Screen. It's unbelievable that not even your lock screen is safe from advertising. GROSSLY PATHETIC. And all the Google settings you have to disable to keep your apps from sending info to google to send you ""SUGGESTIONS"" What a load of crap. I've used cell phones, just like so many people on the planet without google telling me how to use it. I know what a browser is, I know how to use one to find stuff I want, that's where it ends. NO I DON'T NEED OR WANT YOU GOOGLE. F the F OFF. I try not to even use the G-Play Store, I use F-Droid for Open Source Alternatives. And Android makes sure it's difficult to install unapproved apps, but you can still do it with most free software on F-Droid. Honestly if you want to be free of these intrusions you really have to work hard at it. Another thing I found out about this phone is that there is a tiny IR LED that blinks constantly in the upper right hand of the screen, I have still yet to find out for sure why it's blinking constantly, but from what I have read it might have to do with something related to detecting if the phone is near your face or if the phone is in your pocket, but it blinks ALL THE TIME, look at your Moto G Play 2024 phone with another camera and you will see it blinking too. It's disturbing knowing this device is constantly blinking a light. It's strange because it's not a patterned blink it's like a data signal, so would be interesting to find out if this is actually trying to communicate with other IR devices. No clue but interesting. Aside from my paranoia regarding the light, the phone functions for the most part as intended, as a phone and browser and I use it for multiple apps that seam to operate well on this platform. I just don't see myself owning another Android based phone after this experience, it's just more and more obvious that you have less and less control over what your phone is doing. In my ideal world there would be an open source phone where there is nothing hidden from the user. That's not the case here, so many agreements to click through, who knows what this thing is actually doing half the time. I can be certain it's trying to find ways to analyze my usage so it can predict ways of emptying my wallet. Just a shameful digital world we've entered, it would be nice to see an alternative to all this garbage. I'm already looking into rooting and installing a degoogled mobile OS, but I've done stuff like that before and it's just as much a headache but one with less worry regarding apps spying on you. I needed a new phone and the price was right but that is about as far as the compliments can be extended from me. Phones these days are less about the user and more about being used."
"I was very disappointed when I opened my Amazon package only to see the phone box had been already open! The box seal sticker had been ripped and resealed over with a transparent sticker for resale. Even so, I was curious and carefully opened the phone box to see it had clearly been used due to the finger strokes/scratches on the phone's peelable screen cover! (Nothing else in the box appeared as if it had been touched though, such as nothing else was ripped or peeled and the charging cord was still neatly rolled up.) I had bought a NEW phone, NOT a used one, so why was I given a visibly used phone?? At this point though, I didn't have the time, patience or luxury to buy a new one, because I was in desperate need of a working phone and didn't wish to go through the hassle of returning it. It must have been luck, but thankfully, apart from how the phone appeared, it worked like a new product; no slow battery, had to set it up, etc. I do like it now after about a week of usage; I'm impressed with how well it performed for such an inexpensive phone and it's also unlocked for any phone service. This is a great phone if you're on a budget or  a nice starting phone for your kid(s).Anyway, I'm still pretty certain the phone given to me was a returned item and I would be sure not to buy again from here."
"I wanted an inexpensive phone and had the Moto g-play 2021.  The security features (except PIN) aren't reliable at all (touch sensor, face ID, and ""safe places"").  So if you rely on those features, this isn't the phone for you.  It has plenty of memory for the apps I use and I installed a SIM card for photo storage.  I think the 2021 screen features (esp the clock) were more aesthetically pleasing.  One plus - I can SEE THE SCREEN in bright sunlight.  It was nearly impossible on the 2021 model.  Volume control is good (I have a deaf ear), but the phone external speaker quality doesn't seem as crisp as the 2021 model either.  Voice pick-up from across the room is good and the phone receiver is good. I often need to turn the volume down when listening to help improve the clarity.  Camera is fair but I don't take a lot of photos.  Not at all bad for a less expensive phone (but was considerably more expensive than the 2021 version... Like everything else is today)."
"The Moto G Play 2023 has impressive features making it a good value. But the value is compromised by the speed. It sometimes has sluggish response to screen refresh and taps. Sometimes response to a tap is so slow a 2nd tap is delivered thinking the first went unnoticed. But it didn't. Now there are two taps registered and both are executed. I placed an unwanted online order because of this glitch. It uses a 10 year old ARM Cortex-A53 processor which was announced on October 30, 2012. Old and slow I guess. Sometimes frustrating  but a good value for an entry level phone, backup phone or for smart home apps."
"Performance of this phone is mediocre. Touch sensitivity is also mediocre. While the cost of the phone is low, it could be a lot better if they'd improve the touch sensitivity."
"Not the greatest of phones but it shouldn't be expected to be at the less than $100 I paid for it.  There is a noticeable bit of lag at times with scrolling up or down the screen and I have to say even my old Android 7 phone is still smoother than this, a lot of bloatware (of the 32GB you'll end up with about 18GB usable depending on what you remove), and many app notifications that need to be shut off.This still isn't a bad phone.  It's also not particularly great either and leaves a lot to be desired, and also probably not the phone for any power users out there.  The phone is not worth the $180 that it retails for but it might be if you can get it for significantly less."
"Being a senior citizen, I am not totally on top of all things in the phone world. It would have been much better if the fact that the SIM card was not included and the fact that if you have an existing Android phone, your current SIM may work.  Very disconcerting to someone my age!!!"
"I ordered this phone cuz it said brand new unlocked along with a so-called new SIM card well as they're trying multiple times to activate it on metropcs's app and being told that there's another account to this phone and that the SIM card was no good and if I wanted to get it activated I would have to pay another $38 for a new SIM card and the activation fee so it appears I'm stuck with a useless phone huh but I'm in a tough spot right now , a good return it and wait for a refund but I have to wait 30 days Plus however long it takes to get the money back on my card I'm not going to do that again I don't know what I'm going to do I spent over $100 on junk I can't use unless I hook up to my hotspot with use my other phone and that makes me have to dish out more money I guess that would be the last time I buy a cell phone from Amazon if I had known that there was another account attached to my phone I would have never bought it like I said be prepared"
"This is the worst phone I have ever gotten and I have only had it for three days.If your thinking of getting this phone I advise you to look at other options.Firstly, this phone has been designed by someone trying to meet a deadline. At first it looks good l, but if you at any point dig any deeper you will find a ton of errors.  If you try to change the button orientation you will have go on a reddit deep dive because your not given an option in your settings,if you try to change the wallpaper to something you like that's too bad it will go back to the default the next time you close your phone.If you like listening to music on your earbuds that's to bad, it sounds like trash.If you try listening on a speaker that horrible screeching sound plays when you try to adjust your wired headphones that should have been replaced 3 years ago happens. Oh, and another thing if you idk like your apps to stay open when you use your phone this is not the phone for you.I hope you don't have a time sensitive task because you phone will close right out of it. This phone is also stupidly slow.it will process about half of everything thing you do if you try to type in any that was not made by google.Oh and I forgot to mention that your phone will have every product Google has ever made download on to your phone as well. In addition to that, if you idk use wyze it is not compatible with this phone. And btw, if some says that is is happeing because you need to clear your storage, I have over 6g left of storage.So don't get it if you don't want to put up with any of these problems."
"Coming from a high-end phone ( Pixel 8 Pro) it is dirt slow, but I am able to adjust. 5G isnt very impressive in the US anyway, WiFi Performance is fine and I use that 90% of the time."
Phone works good. But this phone does not support nfc so I can't use it to tap for payments
"Samsung has been my number one love.  Motorola is a close second but this phone though it's okay and it does the job, it's very slow and once I added the apps I needed on my phone it has taken up a lot of the memory and very quickly I'm already needing to expand it. I'm hoping that when I do it will add more speed. Otherwise this phone will be replaced as soon as it is feasible and possible. For now it will do and I do like it but it has a few drawbacks that has me a little frustrated which again is in regards to the speed.For what I paid for it which was on sale for $99 I can't ask for more."
"Bought for daughter, phone works fine but it was not a new phone out of box. Had issues because it was linked to someone else's number. Luckily our phone company was able to resolve, but it was sold as new"
I did not like that you had to tap twice and it keep talking. It would not stop talking and I cannot switch it over to my company
"Screen is a full inch smaller than the prior years for the same model.  An inexplicable backward step.We ended up purchasing a refurb 2022 Moto Stylus model from Amazon instead, for roughly half the price.  (Seems to be new, in box, etc.)Love the Moto Gestures and Moto G line pricing, but they make some really questionable design decisions."
"This is a decent starter phone but the description is misleading... The section that states:""32GB built-in storage. Get plenty of room for photos, movies, songs, and apps—and add up to 512GB more with a microSD card""You CANNOT run apps from the SD card. With all of the bloatware and the addition of 4 or 5 apps, that 32GB built-in storage vanishes very quickly. So although the phone has decent features and, yes, you can store ""up to 512GB"" of photos and video (not apps) on a SD Card, it becomes useless very quickly."
"Moto G Play 2023This phone is sleek and handy. Good to use. It's pure stock android. Display is nice and camera is pretty decent.The phone is for basic use and for smartphone beginners.This isn't capable to handle multiple tasks and it becomes slow while you switch or swap between 3-4 applications simultaneously.I tried using Whatsapp, Spotify and chrome browser in parallel and it becomes slow and starts lagging on speed.The camera is nice for daylight photos (attached).Front camera is good enough for video calls.Doesn't support 5G.Doesn't have dual sim compatibility.Doesn't have wireless charging.Doesn't have fast charging."
"Good price comes with side effects.... such as slow processing features. You can touch the icon for an app and it's like hmmmm the phone is thinking if it should open the app. Takes like 4-5 seconds to open then about the same time when using the app. Another issue is with Facebook, when I see something that I want to take a screen shot of, I will minimize the screen to activate the screen shot app. Then when I return to Facebook, it refreshes and what I wanted to take a screen of then disappears :-(  I am currently searching for another better and more responsive phone without all the bad issues. Good luck shopping!!!"
The price was good but I expected more than what I paid for. I think. From the time I first used the phone it was slow running when it came to the internet as well as the touch screen seems to run slow it takes three times me touching the screen for it to finally respond I'm not sure if that is because of the phone or because of the extra glass that got put onto it by me through a recommendation by Google for a phone case it came with the glass. The phone how everything to be running slow and be delayed quite a bit before I even put the new glass on so I believe something's wrong with the phone I'm not sure. I went from having a stylus 5 Moto g 4G/5G to this phone and there's a too much of a big difference between the two I should have got the same phone I had last time then I would be happy with it.
"If you are looking for a phone that take an entire minute to open Facebook messenger, or if you’re looking to wait 10 seconds for your phone to respond to a tap; then this is the phone for you! It is so bad that old apps like Pokémon go crash, and don’t bother trying to get it to track your movement or open up AR features. (Ar doesn’t work, and the motion tracking lags then crashes.) I can not express how terrible this phone is, the UI crashes about every time I attempt to send or respond to a text. When I’m reading articles and things like that it freezes and won’t let me scroll down. It will eventually scroll down super rapidly and crash my browser after about 15 seconds of waiting. I have never left a bad review before, but this phone isn’t even worthy of a single star it is terrible. If you want a faster phone I’d look for something like an original black berry phone or the original flip Motorola razor. I’m telling you this thing performs about as well as the old school smart phones before 4g connections. It is very very slow, and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone unless they were insanely patient and don’t mind waiting 15 seconds for your phone to respond to a tap. In case your wondering I had to put the phone down, and use my iPad because it would probably take around an hour and a half to type out this simple review."
"I know that the content of the title seems like a nitpick, but it's not. This is a missing feature that makes the phone unpractical for anything other than true burner phone use. The phone only has 64GB of storage which is not enough for messengers much less as a practical phone. The SD Card should solve that, but because it's only available for portable storage (and not as internal storage), it can only be used to store files, not to store apps or app data. It can only store app content for apps which support sd card storage to portable sd card storage. afaik that list includes, Youtube, Netflix and the camera app. So it's a total waste of the sd card slot. And as a result, my phone can only hold apps up to to the 64GB, not including the sd card. So there's a lot of apps that I can't install on the phone."
Lags. Don't press too many function buttons right after one another...
I was looking for an inexpensive unlocked smartphone to use for social media live audios. This one for the bill but boy howdy is the performance slow when switching apps or typing in the keyboard. I guess that's what you get for the price.
So I had to return this phone because it wasn't compatible. The received the phone back. But I've been waiting over a month now for Amazon to issue the refund. The phone was brand new. All I did was turn it on and stick my sim in it. Then when it didn't connect. I took it out. Put it back in the box and returned it. Soo what is taking so long.Other than that the phone seems like it would be such a nice phone. I wish it would have worked out like it said it would in the description.
"I only use this phone for the basics: phone, messaging, navigation.  Even with no other apps installed/running, it is incredibly slow responding.  This is simply because it doesn't have enough processing power to run the Android OS.  It is cheap and solidly built, however."
"A great phone, no issues. Does not have enough storage, I can only have a few apps on phone."
Phone is nice...however most websites load very slowly
"Pros:Affordable priceUnlocked and works with most carriersUSB-C charger includedDecent screenFast and accurate fingerprint sensorCons:Comes with a lot of bloatwareFront camera is just okayRear camera is poor, with no image stabilizationMic sounds robotic and tinnyCan struggle with modern appsOverall:This phone is a good option for budget-minded users who need a basic phone for calling, texting, and browsing the web. However, the camera and performance are not great, so it is not suitable for users who need a phone for more demanding tasks.If you are willing to spend some time uninstalling the bloatware, this phone can be a decent option for the price. However, if you are looking for a phone with a better camera and app performance, you may want to consider the Samsung Galaxy A14 5G."
"I haven't even had this phone for a full two months and it will not last a full day. My past two moto phones took years of use to get to that point. The storage is awful. There are a ton of unused apps and processes that I don't know of or want, but I also can't fit the apps that actually plan on using everyday. Let alone storage for photos and the like. My last two phones I was capable of continuously running multiple apps at a time with no issue. Not the case on this one at all. As soon as my phone shuts off, I have to wait for whatever app I'm using to reload every time I come back to my phone. And forget about going back and forth between apps. As you can imagine this makes it very difficult to listen to music or podcasts because they crash as soon as my phone turns off. Very upset with this phone. What a waist of my Christmas Amazon gift card."
"Compared to the g Power, and other phones for that matter perhaps, it functions slowly, and eventually may irritate you. I replaced it with the g Power. Also a pretty weak battery, needing to recharge throughout the day."
It is well worth the price and does everything I desire a phone to do.  The only negative I have is the screen is somewhat difficult.  I have had to touch an icon as many as a dozen times before it reacts.  I have not installed a screen protector.  Otherwise it is fine.  I have had prior issues with this brand  delaminating most likely overheating when recharging.  I am now trying to only charge 80% or less (which it does quickly).  I have yet to have a problem but it is likely too early to know.
I had put off switching out my old phone. I didn't think this new phone would be glitchy with video. I can't really enjoy video on youtube or any app because it starts to turn green with the video and glitch out. I'll never buy a phone off Amazon again. Bait and switch on quality.
"I accidently ordered the 32 gb and not the 64. Totally my fault. I decided to keep the phone anyways, but now have found the battery takes forever to charge and then barely lasts the day. I will be upgrading soon."
It works for a temporary phone but definitely slow and vattery last like 2 days with me playing on it all the time so if u left it alone it would probably last 3 days
"I ordered this phone for my dad, the phone is perfect for a old person, just the problem is with the software.he just want to call and see videos, the thing is the HBO, Netflix and Pluto is not connecting to Internet over WiFi, just over data, but he always are in home. I expect this problem get fixed for moto."
This phone has very poor design.  it's too big and heavy.  It does not respond well and frustrating to use.  Touch screen has serious issues in terms of responsiveness and getting you to right destination
"I bought this phone for myself and have used it as my primary phone.Its honestly great in nearly all waysits light, pretty, and plenty fast.HOWEVERit seems to be MORE glitchy than the older Motorola g power 2021 phone it replaced.Maybe this is android's fault?I don't knowAll I know is that when I'm using Maps or Messages, about once a week it will freeze up and I have to reboot it.Technology is so helpful :)**possible sarcasm"
"I paid the price for a new phone and instead received a refurbished phone with someone else's videos and apps installed. Very misleading, if I wanted the refurbished phone I would have chose that option for the lower price. Instead I paid more only to receive a used product. Very disappointed."
"I just started using a Pixel 7 Pro, to replace the Moto G Play that stopped working properly. The interface on the Motorola runs rings around the Pixel -- try activating the camera flash or the self-timer on both phones; simple and easy on the Motorola. Many things are easier on the Motorola: three-finger screen captures. Unfortunately, a good phone should also last longer than five months. The G Play stopped holding a charge for more than a few hours of use, and took longer and longer to charge, making it unusable. The money saved from buying a G Play isn't really any saving when the phone is only working correctly for a short time. My phone previous to the G Play was a G Power and it still works fine, even though it's now a bit slow."
Phone doesn't always charge due to broke and missing prongs in the charger port. Happened not long after purchasing but haven't had a chance to write a review
Not at all pleased with this phone. I use the phone a whole lot less than anyone I know or see others who use theirs alot. This makes it just thru 24 hrs then have to charge. THe picture quality is not wonderful it will just do for average picture taking.
"My favorite phone was the motorola ecruise. I loved that phone. Sadly phone phone died and I had to replace it. I bought the moto g play and I expected it to be similar. I paid 60$ for the ecruise in 2018 and 120$ for the moto g play in 2023. I figured that this updated one should be slightly better even though it was still at the bottom. It is not better. Now in Feburary of 2024 (~6 months later), the phone is impossible to use. I don't have that many apps on this phone but it is running so slow I can't use it. It takes minutes for the keyboard to pop up so that I can simply send a Text! It's glitchy and slow and slow and slow. I have a lot of patience for phone since I typically just buy the cheapest one but my 5 year old e cruise is  space ship fast compared to this 6 motnh old moto g play."
"The only thing that I dislike about the phone so far, is that it freezes up and I have to restart it again, because the other person on the other end  can't hear me."
"It's ok but the storage space is bad and it takes all day to charge. Plus it is only a 3/4 day charge, not a 3 day."
"Phone manufacturers have once more decided to boldly go backwards! Making products worse than they did two years ago!I got a motorola phone a couple years ago and it served me well, but it was slowing down and finally got finished off by some water damage. So I decided to replace it. Turns out the newest model doesn't have expandable storage. It says it does, but it doesn't actually expand anything. You cannot put apps on the expandable storage, so the tiny internal storage is all you get. I thought 32 gigs was fine because expandable storage would make up for the shortfall - NOPE! Because motorola decided to make an ""upgrade"" worse than the previous model.Way to ruin a good thing."
"For $79-99... to be frank its a decent value, just don't expect high end performance from it for modern apps/games/etc.I misplaced my mainline apple iPhone 14 on a trip and needed an urgent temporary business phone until I could get my replacement original phone. This phone fit the bill for less than $100.Some pluses:+long battery life+good for general purpose usage, playing music, chat apps, tik tok, phone, text, email.+headphone jack+big screen+cheap ""brand name"" phone++ oddly enough the best finger print scanner I've used, the little motorola logo on the back instantly picks up my finger print every time immediately unlocking the phone.I recommend getting a otterbox defender basic case with this unit.The bad:-Old processor in a new package, it's a 3-4 year old processor in the unit.-Motorola shovelware installed on the phone.-Setup took a long time to patch even on a fiber connection. Took 2-3 hours before the phone was really ready.-I think there's only going to be another year of OS updates for this phone and then it will be abandoned, maybe some android super tech guys can figure out how to patch this to remove the motorola shovelware and get vanilla android on it and extend support, but its a sub $100 phone so I wouldn't expect that much.-Some lag/delay on UI on some apps"
"I purchased this phone to use with spectrum wireless. when I attempted to activate the phone it told me it would not work with spectrum. Issue a side, the phone quality seems in line with cost of phone. Definitely not a premium phone feel."
"The phone drops calls,slow opening apps, have used this brand for years,am looking for replacement after 1 month"
Will not work if you have more than 3 things open. Extremely slow.
I could make a sandwich by the time this changes screens. I've never experienced a  Motorola that runs this underpowered. A ton of bloatware. I could get this out of a $50 phone
"Aesthetically beautiful, charger chord complete trash.  Takes about a day to fully charged. I purchased it to only play pokemon go for the God kids and it is deathly slow.  Returning."
"I did like that this phone is close to what I had, so no learning curve.  The sound is very good also.  But it has been a big disappointment in the battery department.  I have charged it several times, in 3 different ways to make sure it wasn't something I was doing or my charging methods were bad.  But it has performed the same in all 3 methods of charging. I did a test, started the charging process at 9am at 58% battery life, by 9pm it had only risen to 62%.  That's 12 hrs. of charging and it will not charge to 100%. Not sure how long this phone will last me."
Cannot create folders for albums - got to rely on GOOGLE - my SAMSUNG A71 can
"75% of of the memory is used by unremovable bloateare and operating system apps.  Due to the low memory, it does not operate well.  Of course, when you get a customer service ( that term is used with prejudice) you get a body in another country.  Horrible connection every time while talking to them overseas.Phone drops calls and will not work with WiFi calling.  The touch screen is frequently unresponsive.Called and got the worst customer service.  3 reps, 30 minutes, 0 help and finally just no response by the last representative."
"Genuinely bad product, extremely slow, and does not include enough ram to perform basic internet operations like keeping a webpage open and submitting a captured image to it without hitting an out of memory errorHonestly. Be better motorola. I've been using Motorola for over 7 years, and I'm baffled they could release this garbage heap labeled as a 2023 model when it doesn't have enough ram or power to perform light non gaming internet business and workloads that phones 9 years ago crushed just fine.Motorola you deserve to be punished for even creating this option and selling it under a 2023 label.Shame on you."
"I absolutely love this phone. The other reviews complain about battery, it last like 2 weeks for me lol. And complaints about prop 65. But that is any phone. My only complaint is that it doesn't come with a battery charging block. Just the usb-c cable. They used to come with that block but now they don't. I have been buying all motog phones for years. And I must say this is the best one yet. Thanks!I still love the phone. but the major issue is that if the battery drops below 70%, it wont charge unless you restart it. Everytime. not just once. Every time it drops below that percentage, I have to reset phone to charge it."
For being a phone from 2023 it is super slow to load anything and swiping or opening apps is terrible and feels almost glitchy
"I have never had such a terrible phone. I'm an honestly shocked that they would let this phone hit the market. It actively tries to make my life more difficult. It has done harm at work, in my personal life and at home. It is crap that the return window is so short. I want to throw it out a window on a daily basis. This phone should be embarrassed to call itself a smsrt phone"
I definitely would not buy this phone again as it's a poor quality phone.  There are a lot of things it won't do & apps it doesn't support. Phone is extremely slow. Not enough memory & has 1/4 of the memory that my old phone had. The touch screen is not sensitive enough at all & you have to repeatedly touch it to get it to register it. It flickers when you first book it up.
Phone is slower than the speed of smell. Lags freezes unlocks half way. Aggravatingly slow trying to load a GPS or download files. What kind of phone comes with only 30 gigs of memory? Just the operating system on the phone takes a third of the phones memory. 5 apps and and 200 pictures the memory is full already. Didn't even bother with the fingerprint reader because the screen can't figure out where your pressing anyways. Battery last 3 days if you don't open the phone for 3 days. If you actually use the phone it won't even last a day. Camera is ok I guess it takes pictures but you will have no memory left to save the pictures. Sound quality is ok which it should be it's 2024
Side buttons are really hard to click or push.  Screen icons are very slow to react.
I liked it at first but after a few months (3 1/2) it has become very slow. have to delete apps for updates as it has extremely low storage. I want my money back as now I am seeing options a million times better for $50 more. My major complaints is the storage and freezing. Battery life is fine. Difficult when you are outside doing side gigs and it starts freezing up. Happened to me the other night and I was in the WORST NEIGHBORHOOD. I need to check the warranty if there is even one.
"As far as I can see, there is nowhere to adjust the timing of when the lock screen activates.  It is set to one minute and it can be pretty frustrating at times."
"I am not picky when it comes to phones, but I will say this is my most disliked phone. I'm too lazy to want to set up a new phone right now, and this phone at least takes care of my basic needs. I knew the storage wouldn't be great from the description, but I didn't realize how bad it actually would be haha. I try deleting so many things but haven't been able to get the ""storage running out"" notification gone since 2 weeks after I got it (that was 4 months ago, even with an SD card for photos). I am sure it is a reason contributing to why the phone runs slow. The keyboard is also super glitchy. Not super impressed, but I guess you get what you pay for. I hope to get a different phone in the near future."
"My Moto G has been a frustrating experience. It's performance is below expectations. Slow loading, slow response, often it takes multiple taps for the phone to acknowledge what you tapped on. Very bad at switching between tasks. ""Smooth"" will never correlate with this phone experience. Realistically, how high could I set my expectations for a cheap phone? My expectation was for it to be equal to or better than the Moto G7, the phone it replaces, which I think is reasonable. It is comprehensively markedly worse. In my experience with several G7's (both Play and Power models), the G7 had better performance, smoother experience, and even a better camera. Ouch. I would buy another G7 if I could, but there are no reasonably priced new ones available since they've been discontinued. I will not be using the Moto G for long."
"I have bought Motorola phones for years, but unfortunately Motorola has lost its way by flooding the market with different models. Although this one in particular has memory and space, in other aspects it is even worse than the entry-level Moto E models. Its camera is terribly slow and when it comes to moving images they come out blurry. After taking a few pictures, the camera freezes. It does not have NFC, something that is essential to incorporate these days."
If you're getting for your kids think again. The only way to uninstall is settings>apps>select app>uninstall.If your kid downloads a bunch of apps you are going to hace to go through these steps with each and every one instead of simply selecting the app and uninstalling like every other device is capable of.
I like the new G6s features and controls but the older versions snapdragon processor is much better for my aspects. It doesn't pause when you want response like the octagon processor in the newer version.
Bought this cheaper phone to get my by for a few months. It will not run any app and will glitch out constantly. He battery life should be 6-7 hrs total. Also for an 100 dollars there are way better phones then this one in that price point. Do not buy. POS
Ok I guess but it arrived without a SIM card
"Battery not holding charge.  Considering I've had the phone for less than a year, very disappointed.  Updated review:  took phone to repair place, something in the board is bad.  Not worth it to fix, so I'm purchasing a new phone.  Extremely disappointed in this phone."
"It crashes randomly while playing higher intensity games like guardian tales, sometimes glitches when using simple apps like YouTube and Google chrome, and god forbid you have auto-rotate enabled. Overall, this phone isn't the one for you"
"I bought this for my work phone, and was getting numerous alerts about shoe sales and postings on how to ""mindfully"" do this or that.  IMO one key to being mindful is to shut down all the alerts.  Once I shut down the built-in shopping alert app, another app stepped up and started delivering the same junk alerts.  I had to disable alerts from 5 or 6 apps just to get the noise to stop!Also, YouTube is continually running, and you can't shut it down. (I wonder how much Google paid for that feature.)  Just swipe to the right, and YouTube is already pre-loaded for you (and any active app can track you as well).  The Recent Apps list doesn't list YouTube, so you can never shut down the app!If you want to be a tik-tok-head and spend all your days watching how everyone else ties their shoes, then you'll love this phone.  Especially if you want perpetual distractions to give your life some meaning.  However, if you want a phone to assist you in living your day the way you choose to, then stay away from this junk."
Don't buy this.It's slower than my 1998 cellphone.
"Overall ok, but it is quite slow phone. Only for basic stuff you may use it."
"Was excited to finally escape the apple user club, so I bought this phone to give android a try. BIG MISTAKE! This is by no means a top line phone, but good LORD. The neverending GOOGLE UPDATES chew through data faster than you can believe. This morning, my plan renewed for a month and within the first HOUR of data availability, this piece of CRAP has used an entire GIGABYTE of overpriced data without me using it for anything... what a let down. Back to apple and their rigged to fail phones. The money it costs to buy a new phone every other year will surely be less than the expense of wasted data using android (GOOGLE)!"
"I have never had a problem with any phone I've owned but in just 3 days of using it, it has frozen up a couple dozen times and glitches to the point it won't do anything."
"This is a "" faulty product that  Amazon refuses to replace."" Phone does not hold a charge and crashes constantly therefore is not usable. Trying to contact the manufacture is a joke. DO not buy this is a complete rip off to customers and Amazon refuses to replace or return these"
Don't buy this model not enough internal memory to run more than about 4 apps.
"A budget phone that would be just fine, except that these morons weigh it down with bloatware apps. Some can be uninstalled - but who the f&*#! are you to install Tiktok automatically for me?? - but most CANNOT be uninstalled. There is a metric ton of junk ""system"" apps that run in the background and cannot be uninstalled, including YouTube Music (?!?). This makes the already-spartan processor slow down regularly. Keyboard complaints are valid; the stupid thing takes forever to appear. Additionally, prepare yourself for an avalanche of BS notifications constantly, some of which you cannot disable.In short: This model phone may be fine, if you can order from a decent company with some morality and common sense. I'll be returning this ASAP."
"Worst phone EVER!!!!!! I've always preferred, bought and used Moto phones last one being the Moto Z Play which gave me several years of good quality. This Moto phone is awful. The slowest processer I have ever dealt with. Speaker is meh, loud but no bass whatsoever. It's not like there's an equalizer to add some bass and trebbile. Camera is ok and better than the last Moto but honestly would rather just buy another Z Play and throw this one in the trash. If you like to click something and move quickly, this PHONE IS NOT FOR YOU..IT IS SO SLOW"
"In my 25 years I have yet to own a phone as slow as this one. Maybe this phone would be a decent cheap backup for your other phone, but it's slower than death in a gas chamber. And crashes frequently"
I've always liked these cheap moto phones but the 2023 g play has become a joke.  The battery that used to genuinely be great is gone despite the claims.  This thing dies just as fast as any other cheap phone now despite very low use.  What a bummer there is truly no reason to recommend anymore
"The phone is the 2023 model.  You would think Near Field Communication would be standard. Nope. Without NFC you can't tap to pay. You can't tap to ride on the subway. You can't get Bluetooth and WiFi settings from another device.  It may be a 2023 model but it uses 2013 technology.  Complete with 2013 bloatware. Certainly a case of buyer's remorse.  Now, after several months of ownership, it randomly decides I have no cell coverage.  I will be sitting in a cafe or wherever scrolling away when suddenly, no service.  I haven't moved an inch, my wife is at the same table using the same wireless account and she is connected?  Oh, and time for an update -- delete apps and files to make room for that -- and it takes forever!  The brand name was bought out and the product is worthless. Stay away!"
"Hairline crack straight out of the box, could only be seen on white back ground. Also new screens with carried colored back grounds to find defect. Hdtvs included."
battery doesn't last 3 days.  maybe 8 hours at best.  keep getting storage alerts for no reason.  phone also gets very hot sometimes.  liked my old phone better.  look around for something else.
This phone is literally a wase of money. I have only had it for a month or two and I want to throw it across a room. It's so ungodly slow. The storage is basically non-existent. Anytime I try to type it take like 15 minutes for the keyboard to decide to pop up so I can send a message. I have had phones with poor storage but I've never had it be slow and glitch out on the keyboard. It will straight up kick me out of my app when it is slow.
"Misleading listing. The battery lasted a little over a day at best. Also, incompatible with apps on app store & some apps just didn't run right. Returned it.Feels solid with. Nice screen."
"We bought this phone for our daughter to replace a broken phone. It works as a phone but it will not connect to the internet or download apps. We have tried to solve the problem with the phone carrier but it did not help. They say the phone appears to be working properly on their end. We have reset the phone a couple of times which did not help. Her internet provider, Spectrum, even replaced her modem. Her other devices work on the internet, this one doesn't. Can we return it? Does anyone else have this problem?"
"It works okay as a phone for calls and texts but is horrible at anything else if you're used to something like an iPhone. Like the title says, save your money and get something better than this POS"
"The screen is slow to react.  I have to wait for it to recognize I need the keyboard to fill in fields or write a message.The memory is awful.  I installed a 512gb micro SD card and set it up as internal memory.  I still get warnings that I'm low on memory and some functions may not work properly.  I have uninstalled as many apps as I can and disabled others that the phone won't let me uninstall.  I give up.  I'm shopping for a new phone already.I like Motorola and am sorely disappointed with this one.  I just wanted a basic phone with a couple of simple games at a decent price.  Buyer beware, this one can't handle it."
The only worth this has would be as a spare phone and thats it. Other than that it hangs even without any apps on it.
Phones are slow they load slow I don't like the phone drop calls stops shuts down all the time slow connection and loading
"This phone was hard to set up, it didn't pair well with my previous samsung and it was not working. The first time I opened the phone it worked but if it sat for only an hour it would not respond on the screen and had to be restarted, ie, I couldn't answer a call, send or answer a text, check data, etc. The support staff were hard to deal with. I had to return."
"Not sure where any of these positive reviews come from.  I understand it's a cheap phone, but this phone operates worse then phones I had 15 years ago.  Sluggish to the point where it's often unusable.  Every app takes 5+ seconds to open.  Text windows take extensive time to open if they do at all.  Didn't expect much from a $100 phone, but this thing is pathetic."
"I have waited awhile before i reviewed this product it is great for day-to-day use. At a minimum it takes great pictures and video. The screen is a great size for people with average to large hands. At first glance it looks like a standard ultra model its big, orbital lens separation, sturdy, bezel with a sleek design. I have been a Samsung fan since the galaxy line up started and practically owned every model out there to test and see which one is practical me the average joe. If you a minimalist this might not be the phone for you. This has the latest tech and probably will be overwhelming for you. This is due to the endless features that it has. If you are a gamer and have several hrs to kill on your favorite Mobile game this will meet your needs and then some. If you are that person that has been a Samsung note fan than this is the phone for you. If you're a movie junkie this will def suit your needs, when you're on a break from work or just hanging out. The color details are great especially in 4k. With this being said there are some quirks that i did not know existed and will pass it on to everyone. The s24 ultra has some drawbacks if you are purchasing it directly through Samsung. Your video calling will not work on with carriers - the reason for this Samsung does not have to voip it's a software according to Samsung. This is when you go to your contacts, and you have the option for video calling. This apparently cannot be put on by your carrier as they will deny trying to add it.(Samsung blamed the carrier , the carrier blamed Samsung) After several back-and-forth conversations Samsung told me to download a 3rd party app to allow me to video call. Other providers told me they could not help me. Now would you want to tell all of your contacts to download a 3rd party app and you would have to ask yourself ""would you do it for one person?"". Moving on to text messages and multimedia. You would normally be able pictures direct to people where it would show on the receiver's messages. But instead, it will send them a link that would expire in a certain time frame. They will then have to click to download the image to their phone. My question would be, how annoying that has to be every time i send someone a picture. They have to go through a ring of fire just to see the image or video. I have also asked about this with carriers they have stated, you guessed it go with a third-party app.  to the upside the phone is great. Standard android system as they have always been great but with a lot more at your disposal. Gpu is exceptionally fast (doesn't feel laggy or buggy) Camera is outstanding have taken countless photos with it. Videos are not grainy as some cameras from the galaxy line up once were. The phone is unlocked from Samsung. Bluetooth is great, connects fast and easy. Graphics are great for this model (does not overheat like the previous models when gaming) Overall if you want a phone that does the job this can do it. But do not purchase it directly from Samsung, purchase it through your carrier to avoid the hassles and dragged-out conversations i have gone through. I hope this helps you make your decision a little bit clearer on how you want to proceed on a new phone. I am giving it 3 stars from the manufacture. There was no recourse rectifying a solution. Also, for placing blame on another company and have me contact them, rather than Samsung trying to speak to the carrier direct that it also provides phones to."
"Have been using an iPhone 14 Pro Max for the last few months. Before that I had a Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus for 4 years, and before that was on iPhone since the iPhone 4. I don't play the android vs ios games, so if you're looking for that pointless narrative then go elsewhere. I'm writing this review to share my experience having throughly used both platforms.Apple has masterfully crafted a user experience that works just fine for most users. These people don't care about customizing or having an ""always on display"" that's actually always on. You have to be brainwashed not to admit that the iPhones AOD isn't really always on, no matter what settings you use. What iPhones has going for it is a finely tuned phone, texting, facetime, apple pay experience - things that make owning an iPhone convenient.What makes Android worth owning is the ability to use it how you wanted to use it instead of a corporation telling you you're ""holding it wrong."" I enjoyed the galaxy s10. It had an excellent display, almost indistinguishable from the s24. My review will focus on the user experience/software of the S24, not the hardware. Hardware has gotten so powerful that most users will never need all that processing power.Samsung has failed to finely tune their software like Apple has. I liked s10's OneUI look - S24 is ugly in comparison. The stark blue and light grey quick menu has been replaced with an ugly ""Material You"" color pallet. You can download ""GoodLock"" and try to change the color palette, but countless things like transparency don't work with it. Bottom line is why I  would need to spend time trying to make it look decent if it's Samsung job considering the inflated price of these phones. So many things that should be included with the phone have been placed behind a paywall, forcing you to pay to get back what was part of OneUI in older versions.Another indication that Samsung isn't tuning its software is the fact that they gave up on their ""message"" app, now forcing you to use Googles message service, which is fine, but why bother having their own app if they never really committed to it?So many other system apps, Samsung has to confuse the user into deciding which platform to use. You will have double the apps for every single system app, again confusing the user into deciding in which service to commit to.I like Android, but I don't like Samsung. I don't see the point in spending a super premium price for a phone that's not fully committed to either own layer like ONEUI or Android. This has been the problem with Samsung phones since they released ONEUI. Either fully commit to your own version, or commit to stock Android - stop confusing consumers about what your product is about, and stop being scammy by holding back features behind a paywall.My recommendation for Android users is this: You don't need to pay a super premium price to get the Android experience. Today's budget phones are powerful enough to allow you to customize it according to your own liking."
"The bad:Screen colors recently fixed so I upped the stars to 3Reception is middling (compared to my Note 20 Ultra it's a bit worse)Camera white balance is straight green/blue and images/video are just darkWide angle camera is not as wide as my Note 20 and no better qualityWhen on speakerphone, the top speaker cuts out if you get close to the top speaker.Generally jagged user experience due to a bunch of Samsung crap that cannot be removed.Bloody expensive for something that's delivered in this state.The meh:Batt life is good (not great, just good) only if run in 60hz and low power mode.In low power mode at 120hz the batt life is merely acceptable.All compared to my 3yr old note 20 in low power 60hz mode which is just below acceptable.The good:The antireflective coating on the screen is genuinely amazingThe 120hz on the screen is uber smooth but unfortunately hits the battThe rest is fine; not different from my Note 20 UltraThere's a thread on the Samsung forum that's thousands of posts long about these same issues I've brought up here. The screen color issue has been improved with a recent update (3/7/24)Hopefully all of the bad can be fixed with a software update but currently the phone is borderline unusable due to the extremely blue camera(s) white balance and lacking signal strength. I cannot understand how after ALL THIS TIME, Samsung seemingly doesn't test their flagship phone before manufacturing and shipping.As for the cameras, they're okay if the white balance wasn't green/blue and dark. My Note 20 from 3yrs ago takes nicer looking pictures but it's honestly difficult to tell if the cameras are any good because it's just so green/blue. If you edit each image one by one on an appropriate editor (not the built in one), you can get the images to look pretty good but a typical iphone 15 takes the same looking image without any editing. Reviewers are showing carefully shot images of scenes. General picture taking without much thought results in pretty bland/poor looking images you don't care to share. I really wish they would allow you to adjust at least the white balance settings in the camera app such that the images it takes are correct to what you desire by default.I don't know what to say about all the tech reviewers out there raving about this phone. Either they were given a completely different phone or they're all paid off. I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone until Samsung addresses the ridiculous issues. I do believe all but the signal issue can be fixed with an update but that would require Samsung to admit there's an issue and then address it which seems to be difficult for them to do. The signal issue may even be able to be improved with a radio update but again, Samsung needs to admit there's something wrong which they don't want to.I absolutely hate Apple due to their requirement for you to live in their ecosystem but this will likely be my last Android if Samsung or someone else can't get their act together on such an expensive product.On a very very positive note, the antireflective screen on this phone is genuinely incredible. It's the single biggest upgrade imaginable. Unfortunately putting any screen protector ruins that feature so I'm just going to use it without a screen protector. The phone is worth buying simply for the antireflection. It's THAT BIG of a difference. I cannot understand why this isn't getting more attention. The darn signal strength issue is the single biggest deal breaker and so unfortunate and annoying. It's about ~15% worse than my 3yr old Note 20."
"Buying Samsung products is not inexpensive. With cell phones, however, one expects quality - especially as pricey as their phones are.My pro: the phone feels sturdy and comfortable in hand.My Cons:  1.  The secondary sim is an e-sim, which is not accommodated by all cell service providers.  2.  Most user choices are removed with this phone and unable to be changed in settings. Example - If you use an eSim with a physical sim, the physical sim settings are primary OVER eSim settings. This is even when the eSim is designated as the primary sim. All eSim settings are treated as secondary.  3.  Google accounts on the phone cannot be selected as primary or secondary. The phone forces the selection on users whether or not you want them that way. Example - I have a personal (for purposes of android) and work based email that each use Google. The physical sim attached to my work email / account is treated as primary OVER my personal account. Well, geez, it's my phone that I spent an enormous amount of money on.  4.  While different ringtones and notification settings are selected for each sim, AGAIN, they settings for the physical sim supersede those for the eSim.  5.  Many apps on your phone will default to the Samsung selected settings are unable to be changed.  6.  Privacy controls are NOT user editable.  Most privacy issues must be waved for use of the phone.There are many more gripes or dislikes about this phone. Bottom line, user control or preferences are removed. Further, if you use this phone to travel, wherein most users may opt to use a physical sim purchased in the respective country of travel, then expect that all settings for that physical sim will override ANY setting used for the eSim, EVEN WHEN the eSim is selected as primary.  NOT OKAY!!Samsung has already removed so many standard features from their phones such as the sd card, earphone jacks, and other things.  This is all done (seemingly) to compete with Apple.  What Samsung hasn't grasped is that Android users are not trying to be Apple users. Users selected or stayed with Android for a reason. Second, while Apple seemingly goes to great lengths to protect users privacy concerns, Samsung causes users to wave them, especially if the user wants to take advantage of their bloatware or apps.  For all these sacrifices, Samsung could have retained two things -  the use of TWO physical sim cards versus an eSim and physical and user control over their data."
"I don't think so.  I've had the S3, S4, S10, S20, and recently dropped the screen on my S21.  I've been a Samsung loyalist mainly because it's the best Android option, not for any other reason.  That being said, it's time for a change.I wanted to segregate the apps from my old phone and what would become my new phone, so I tried manually transferring data and the only apps I wanted on the new phone.  I planned to use my old phone for GP App use, so less apps would have direct access to my primary cell phone (I'd use mobile hotspot as needed).  It didn't go smooth, maybe it was my impatience, but there was an awful amount of bloatware and AI non-sense that no one needs.  I tried uninstalling what I could and got only so far.  Then I just gave up and used the Samsung app to drag everything from the old phone to the new phone.  It was OK but bloatware reappeared.  I wasn't happy because it neither adopted all of my prior phones settings, and neither all of my new phones settings...just an odd combo of each.My main grievance was that the battery drained so fast WITH NO USE.  After buying this phone, I still used my prior phone mostly at home and my laptop as well.  I rarely used the new phone for anything.  The battery simply drained dramatically for no reason.  I checked what apps were the cause and 1.  didn't list any apps used other than what I actually did use 2.  I think Windows Defender or whatever the Samsung equivalent is, was the primary source?  But even then, the % was so low.  But why go from 100% charge to 75% overnight, while I'm sleeping?  No thanks.  I gave it 2 weeks and this didn't change.  I thought some smartypants AI non-sense would adjust it, like I read somewhere but no dice.Also, somehow this phone/software kept backing up data I did NOT want backed up and in any cloud.  With the primary competitor to this phone the Pixel, a Google phone, I'm not sure what Android options remain.  I'm leaning towards a Tablet I can carry around and connect via Mobile Hotspot for apps and other uses.I also had mediocre data and cell reception quality.  It might have been the protector/case it was in, because I've had many Galaxy phones since the S3 with no problems in that department."
"I got this phone cuz I needed an upgrade. The battery on my S10 wasn't lasting very long. Honestly, I'm not impressed. It has awesome battery life and for the most part everything seems to work the way it should. However it has the worst fingerprint recognition scanner of any phone I've used. I'm having to enter the code about half of the time, and yes I've deleted the fingerprint imprint and redone it several times to the same effect.Also, even though I downloaded the UI update and installed it, it constantly says there's an update, tries to download it, halfway through it clears out the Wi-Fi password and pauses the install.  The smart transfer feature did not transfer password and logins to all of my various apps, even though another phone I got at the same time... A free phone from straight talk, copied everything perfectly.I'm sure these are all issues I will eventually overcome... But when I pay several hundred dollars for a phone, I expect it to be easier and work better.I also don't understand why they don't include an option to add an SD card."
"As a long-time fan of Samsung products, I was excited to upgrade from my Galaxy Note 9, which served me excellently over the past six years with its outstanding design. The rear fingerprint sensor was, in my opinion, the most convenient solution available on the market. Unfortunately, this feature has been removed in the A24 Ultra.Upon unboxing, the first thing that caught my eye was the placement of the stylus on the left side. This seems illogical and, frankly, a poor decision, as it’s much more convenient for right-handed users to retrieve the stylus from the right side. It feels akin to trying to draw a sword with your left hand—it just doesn’t work well.My initial attempt to transfer my SIM card from my previous Samsung device was frustrating; the card kept popping out of the slot. It took me around three minutes just to successfully insert the SIM card. I’m baffled by the design of the SIM card slot, as it worked flawlessly in the Galaxy Note 9.The A24 Ultra is a large phone with many impressive features, but I would say it has its fair share of shortcomings. One significant issue is the fingerprint sensor, which fails to work about 90% of the time shortly after registering my fingerprint. I’ve attempted to re-register my fingerprint around 15 times, yet the problem persists. The facial recognition feature is similarly underwhelming, often struggling to recognize me.Moving the fingerprint sensor from the back panel is, in my opinion, one of the worst decisions made, as it was one of the most functional developments in recent years. The ability to interact with the notification shade using the rear button was invaluable.Overall, I would rate the A24 Ultra a 6 out of 10. Is it worth the money? I would say no, as it feels overly large and clunky, with numerous issues and a stylus that is far inferior to that of the Galaxy Note 9, which was crafted from higher-quality materials and had no unpleasant odors.While the new features are impressive, the drawbacks overshadow many of them. It’s disappointing to have spent so much money on a device that falls short of expectations."
"Warranty seals were open, and the phone box was empty… Be cautious, is not a cheap phone …UPDATE: Amazon’s customer service is amazing! They send another phone Wich finally came in new package 🙌"
"I asked for the black color and received the violet color instead, since it will be in a case I guess it doesn't matter much. It came in 2 days and I opted out of the signature at delivery. Price wasn't too bad. I didn't check to see if my carrier will allow me to use the phone, but it's unlocked and a new phone. About to tyr and switch to it and see what happens.UPDATE: no SIM card came with the phone so I couldn't set the phone up. Sending it back."
"I switched from Galaxy S7. I love the S7 but the CPU and RAM can't keep up with today's apps and websites. The S24 a decent phone with some annoying problems. It feels like a $400-500 phone.Here are my complaints:- The most annoying problem so far is that videos are glitchy, choppy, or laggy every few seconds. Whatever you want to call it, it's the opposite of smooth. This happens in every streaming app and website I've tried so it's not isolated to a single app. It's not a bandwidth or buffering issue. This happens in Adaptive (120 Hz) and Standard (60 Hz) motion smoothness. I enabled the Show Refresh Rate option in the Developer menu. I don't know if it's accurate, but every time a video gets laggy the refresh rate shows 24 (in Hz). When it shows 60 or 120 the video is smooth. The OS should should detect if a video is playing and sync to the frame rate of the video or set a fixed 60 Hz refresh rate.- The physical buttons click very loudly. When I hear that click my brain thinks ""cheap junk"". They're loudest buttons of any current or previous phone or tablet we own (which is a lot). I'm guessing this is a QC issue and most people don't experience this. I have resorted to using apps to open the volume control and turn off the screen so I don't need to click those buttons.- All three buttons are on the same side now. I need to use two hands to reliably take a screen shot. Yes, I have gotten it to work a couple times with only my right thumb but only after locking the screen and changing the volume a few times.- Samsung frequently nags me about signing in. I have uninstalled and disabled as many Samsung apps as possible, but it keeps asking me to sign in."
"I tried this phone, and the build quality is great, but the OS is quite laggy. Notifications are extremely delayed when compared to other phones."
"The product looked good when delivered and I didn't notice the touchscreen problems until the next day after I downloaded everything to the phone. I have no screen protector that could be interfering with it. I am considering deleting everything and returning it but that is a lot of hassle. I had a very slow phone, which I used for years before this, so it's still an improvement. For $800  I would expect a phone that works as good as new. The other thing is the talk to text. Definitely.Adds periods and punctuation where it does not belong I end up having to correct a lot of what is said I left the last few sentences uncorrected, so you could see. Battery life, was good the first week And it might be the apps that I added that are sucking up the battery. I would say it's definitely the apps that are  running in the background. So I would say, overall, a good phone, but I wish the companies would test functionality a little more thoroughly, because the touchscreen is the most irritating thing to have to push on something six times to get it to respond. I am curious if this was a problem with the S24+ originally"
"I grudgingly gave up my Samsung Note 8, which I dearly loved and bought the S24 Plus, only because I was more and more concerned about security and updates, which the Note 8 doesn't get anymore. Many new apps wouldn't work on it either, the OS was Android 9 and it was just too outdated I guess.  The S24+ is a little shorter and wider and I thought it would be okay, but today I had my first lengthy phone conversation and it became pretty uncomfortable in my hand.  The flat sides, (like the iPhone now) just aren't comfortable to grip in your hand for any length of time.  I""m not talking about the corners which aren't as squared off as the Ultra,  I'm talking about the FLAT SIDES of the phone.  Why oh Why Samsung, are you trying to become an iPhone?  I've never had a phone as comfortable to hold as the Note. The curved (Infinity) screen was super soft to use, no side bezels at all, and the glass back with rounded sides was perfectly fitted to a human hand. I realize gamers didn't like it, but it was so comfortable for everyday use.  Maybe I'll try to find a case that will soften the sides of the S24 Plus phone by rounding them a little and that might make it better.  But, this isn't a great phone for me."
"Bought this to donate my other phone to a friend in need. Insurance covered their phone so this ended up being my new ""main"" device. Compared to the A53, camera is a little better, screen is a little cleaner looking, and the signal response it better, especially when switching between 4/5G. Other than that, it's only the slightest bit faster for what I do. The removal of the SD slot is a major drawback as I have a ton of CDs ripped to FLAC, and those files are beefy. Cloud/streaming services mean nothing when you work in buildings that block all signal. If I wasn't still paying it off, I would have gone back to the A53, which has become my media device on the go."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            My S24 Ultra spen is not working anymore, i try everything to fix this issue but is not working, i try with my spen from my old device S22 Ultra and work with this phone, so the Spen from my S24 Ultra is dead."
Laggy software and delayed notifications
"Since my S22 Ultra died, I began phone shopping. The S22 Ultra is an amazing phone, however it had several flaws. Nevertheless though, I thought for my next phone I would again go with a Samsung S24 Ultra. I was a little worried, since there have been a lot of people online talking about the S24 Ultra's screen quality being particularly bad for a Samsung device. Usually, the displays on these phones are some of the best. However, people online would talk about how the uniformity on the screen is bad, that there are color banding issues, or that it's extremely grainy relative to their old device. Honestly though, I wanted to order one and find out for myself. Were these issues really that bad, or was it a small problem blown out of proportion?Hoooooh boy...!When my S24 Ultra came in, the first god damn thing I noticed WAS the grain. Jesus christ, that grain. Yes guys, it is serioisly that bad. I believe some S24 Ultras don't have the grain nearly as bad as some others, but the device I recieved had the most atrocious OLED grain I have ever seen in my life. It would just turn any solid color, smooth gradient, and everything really, into a construction paper drawing. I AM NOT EXAGGERATING, IT IS REALLY THAT BAD. Under the glass, it looks like the manufacturers sprinkled colorful moonsand onto the OLED panel. The pictures I'm attaching this review do not do it justice, it is way worse in person and is there regardless of brightness. EVEN AT MAX BRIGHTNESS!!!It's a shame, because the phone is truly amazing otherwise. The cameras aren't as good as the specs and marketing would have you believe, especially with their default shutter speeds and motion handling, but they are certainly good. The performance is OUT of this world! If you're a power user, the S24's overclocked SD 8 Gen 3 is truly the king of Android SoCs, it is unbelievable. Never seen a stutter or hitch on this device when doing anything. It feels amazing to hold, it's weighty and certainly feels premium. The S Pen is an amazing feature, as well as the AI Stuff, the battery life is great. I really, really, really, REALLLY wanted to like this phone but... Yeah, naaaah. The display that my device arrived with is really that bad. Even my old S10e's screen is as smooth as butter, and as beautiful as I remember a proper OLED screen being. This one is just horrible.As for alternatives, I would suggest the Red Magic 9 Pro ($649!!!), the OnePlus 12 and OnePlus 12r ($700-$800 and $500 respectively), the Z Fold 5/OnePlus Open (considerably more expensive, but the form factor on those is killer), any of the iPhones, and even the damn S23U! (Gets all the same features as the S24 Ultra, just on a SoC that is marginally slower for practical use, and without the damn sandpaper screen)Incredibly disappointed. Stay away from these devices until Samsung has issued a statement or has totally fixed the screen problems!If you've made it this far, here's a cute picture of my pet cat. You've earned it."
"In all honesty I'm not sure if my over all complaint is with my cell provider or the phone but, it looses connectivity.I bought this unlocked so it should be no issue with my provider.At seemingly random times it just wont connect to data.The phone is always trying to be on wi-fi even when I turn it off.For me the S8 was a better phone but I ran out of storage. If the chip reader was any good on it I would have not needed to switch."
"i thought of moving apple to Samsung but with in 20 days i realized.Pros: Camara, Note PenCons: responding little late in face recognition, build quality"
"I had high hopes for this phone, especially the Camera. I read everywhere it is one of the best Cameras and features right now, so I bought the Phone. Especially this is my 3rd in the Series. I had a Galaxy S9, then 22S and now 24S Ultra. I LOVED my 22S pictures, zoom just about everything. This one don't take nearly as great photos and has not a stable focus and gets fuzzy for Close Ups. I don't even have a Macro setting, well I can't find it anywhere. I joined a Galaxy 24S Forum on FB and it seems like 1/2 the people are satisfight and 1/2 the people have same or similar problems with the Picture taking like me. I honestly bought this phone mainly for the camera and now I feel like I wasted alot of money and I am dissapointed."
"I had been running an iPhone 12 and an iPhone in general for a few years and decided to go back to Android due to UI and the ability to have many more app level options available, particularly in nav app options.The UI and performance overall on this phone are very good. Battery life in normal use is solid and charge rates for cabled charging are very fast. Photo quality is solid, overall it's a good phone.A major flaw is vehicle use and I use mine constantly for Spotify and running nav apps in my vehicles. One of my vehicles, a Subaru has wireless charging. There is no way to disable this in the phone or in the vehicle if you put the phone in the spot where it exists. This is the normal way to integrate Android Auto with the car's media system.The phone discharges faster than it charges while driving. The phone gets blistering hot with wireless charging (not on cable charging) and also Android Auto apparently drops operation if there isn't a cell signal. Car Play doesn't drop like this and I'm in a remote area with many cell coverage dead zones.I've swapped to using a cable to tether and charge in the car and so far it is not improving this issue. A long trip will mean the phone will die and I rely on the phone for navigation.I'll likely just put another RAM mount x-grip in this car to get it away from the wireless charging pad, but I'm not convinced the phone will charge fast enough to offset the running drain of the battery. I'll have to give it a try and see.Hopefully this will fix the issue, otherwise this phone will not work properly for vehicle nav and music use.They need to make it possible to turn off wireless charging, it's frustrating that this cannot be done."
"Too much bothersome by Samsung software/bloatware, their software design is not that good really, with numerous design problems, like:  you press & hold the power button long enough to shut down the phone, at least you expect that, but it doesn't work, sheer anguish! Thanks to Samsung's brilliant product managers!The system was draining batteries fast, but seemed to have gotten better after recent system upgrade. Yeah Samsung, work on real issues we care about!"
"I bought this phone because reviews were great and I wanted a capable device with a good camera that would last for years. Now I have buyer's remorse, as not only are the settings counterintuitive, they don’t work. In 2024, one should be able to turn off the ringer and text notifications with ease in the settings. However, despite calls and app notifications being set to none, and none of my contacts whitelisted, I still get text notifications and calls, even from strangers — usually scammers — at any time of the night. This is unacceptable!I want to use my phone for an alarm clock and if I watch a video while it’s on do not disturb, I want to hear sound. I’m tired of having to turn off the phone if I’m in a situation which requires it not to ring, like sleeping or even worse, a rehearsal or concert (I’m a musician). Perhaps there’s some setting that’s overriding do not disturb, but why should I have to jump through hoops to figure it out? Do not disturb means do not disturb! Calls and app notifications none means shut up! (screenshots attached)As far as jumping through hoops, I’ve had to search pretty extensively for a solution, but so far the only information I can find is how to enable the phone to ring during do not disturb — and also that many other people with S24 ultras have the same problem as I do. Android OS has never been so difficult to navigate and I’ve been using androids since Froyo 2.2. My 5 year old Moto G7, which was close to pure Android 10, was far better than this samsung piece of garbage. It even filtered out scammer calls, which samsung seems to give priority to.I deliberately purchased an unlocked unbranded flagship device so I wouldn’t have to deal with bloatware, yet this phone is loaded with samsung bloatware. It keeps flashing things on the screen to ask me if I want to enable this piece of samsung software or that, if I want samsung to retain my passwords, etc. The answer is NO! I don’t want to share anything with samsung! I spent $1300+ with tax for this thing (that was the price on sale) so I wouldn’t have to deal with such garbage. Now I’d like to return it for a refund, but of course there are no refunds on phones unless they don’t work as intended. Perhaps this is malfunctioning, but somehow I think it’s working just as samsung intended: phishing for my information and making me provide my own support.If you’re shopping for phones, do yourself a favor and avoid samsung altogether. The hardware is not worth the headache."
"So considering the phone I came from, this one is amazing! I give it that for sure! If your upgrading from a cheap phone with a bad camera, then do it! BUT, not that this price, if your after it for the amazing zoom quality... no it's useless...So here's the thing, idk if it's a fake I got, or if the zoom on the 24 ultra is just that bad, because I have seen the 22 in action,  and it's 1000x better, the zoom is the only Reason I even went for this phone to begin with honestyNow the phone I came from was a shitty BLU 91 pro, so yes, it's an amazing upgrade, but when your buying something specifically for sertan aspects of the camera, it's kinda sad.... so again, idk if I somehow got a fake or the zoom really is just that bad. It's Definitely not worth the tag if either of those are the case.If you can catch it on sale for under $800, go for it, but at $1,200 not worth it."
"I have the S21 Ultra.  Aside from the sharp edges, there was hardly any difference between mine and the S24 Ultra.  One major difference (and problem) with the S24, that is different from previous models, is the anti-reflective screen.  While it does reduce glare, the colors are significantly more dull.  You can boost the brightness, which overcomes this problem, but when I compared side-by-side, I had to set the brightness at 75% on the S24 to look as good as my S21 with the brightness set at only 50%, which is going to eat up even more battery life.  So what's the point?  I bet Samsung referred to the traditional screen in the next version.  I didn't check every single feature, but I checked enough to know that, aside from the ""AI feature,"" which did very little for me, there was virtually no difference and definitely nothing that made it better than previous versions.  In fact, even when setting the brightness at 50%, like my S21 the battery life was way worse than my S21, even without using it at all.  And I never even connected it to a cell provider (because I wasn't impressed by any part of it), so I have no idea what was using all of the battery."
"After having this phone for 9months, I am so disappointed that I want to let readers know that this phone is not worth it.  After 4 months of usage I notice that the keyboard sometime does not sense what I am typing, so it will miss a letter or two.  Sometime I have to press the apps more than once for it to react too. Now as I am traveling using esim in another country, I notice the phone does not receive full as to my previous S10+. Therefore, I am glad I have my old S10+ as a backup to switch the sim card, and now the signals is strong again.  One more thing, when I am all by myself and nothing around me is moving, I can hear the mechanics inside the phone making noises.  Overall, I have a feeling that this phone won't last me another year, which is why is not worth your money..."
Sold without a complete charger? Nice.
"This new Samsung S24 Ultra is not much better than the Galaxy Note 10 plus that it replaced Ram memory both have same 12 GB, cosider that note 10plus came out five 5 years ago. The screen resolution is higher, true but makes little difference in real life applications and videos. Same screen size as my note 10 plus 6.8 and no memory card. Is much heavier than the note 10 and bulky and the flat screen doesn't make much difference. To be truthful most users don't get to use not even 50% of the feature that these phones offer including me. So why not concentrate their resources in a truly better screen experience and interactive features that can be used in a day-to-day basis like email and chats. This phone doesn't justify the high price tag of $1675 retail by Samsung website. At least I got a better price here in Amazon, so I don't feel that bad. This phone will be replaced soon, I'm pretty sure.  I apologize for pointing out the not too good things, but I feel disappointed, I had higher expectations from a $1600 cell phone. Don't understand some reviewers here unless they were coming from a really basic phone. Be your own judge and keep posting your experiences. It helps. Kudos to Amazon for a super-Fast delivery!!!!!"
"I thought I'd treat myself for my birthday and get myself a nice new phone. I got the S24+ and at first I was happy with it. However, 3 to 4 weeks later I noticed a couple of small dots in the lower corner of the display where the display seemed washed out. I immediately went through the process of sending it in to get it repaired thinking that it would certainly be covered as it was clearly a manufacturing defect. A few days later I get a message telling me I'd need to pay $300 to get it fixed. I called in and they tell me it's an impact related issue. In other words that I must have dropped my phone and therefore it must be my fault. I hadn't even had the phone for a month yet and can say with absolute certainty that I never dropped it or did anything else to it that would cause the issue. I tried to explain that to their customer service. I tried to point out that the screen isn't cracked. That it looks like it's a de-lamination issue. I explained that I'm an engineer and that I work at an electronics manufacturing plant and that I know what I'm talking about. The person I was talking to just kept telling me that I was wrong because the report he was reading said it was impact related. And of course in the time it took for all of this to play out, it's now 3 days over the 1 month refund so I basically just got scammed out of $1000. Personally I would go with a different company that has better customer support. This is just insulting.**Added photos. You can see the three spots circled. They aren't chips or cracks and the pixels still light up. You can also see that, while the glass goes out to the edge of the screen, the spots stop right at the edge of the display.Clearly that is the display peeling off of the glass and no kind of 'impact related damage' is going to cause that while leaving the rest of the phone completely unharmed.Yes they are small and if they stay like that I won't be thrilled but I can live with it. But I hadn't even had the phone for a month when they showed up so I am expecting the issue to get worse."
"If you buy this as an unlocked phone and activate it on Verizon, you lose all the Verizon special features, like visual voicemail and click-to-block."
"The s24 ultra is extremely fast (compared to my old device, zflip 4), takes good pictures, and has a good overall appearance. (Though I wish the screen were curved like the s23 ultra). However, I decided to return it and order a replacement because I kept having small issues with it. For instance, the usb port seemed a little defective as it sometimes failed to connect to my car/PC. In addition, the display is kind of disappointing as it does not offer as much as my old samsungs did. Especially in the dark, the display seems very uncrisp/muddy. I tried to change the settings many times but failed to achieve my expectations. I heard this is a common quality issue with the s24 ultra, so I hope the new one I ordered does not have the same issues."
"Had to return, too heavy for my medium sized hands, seemed too tall as well."
"According to the advertisement this phone is supposed to have an amazing battery life, but if that's so why does mine have to sit on the charger all day?  Even with the screen so dim that I can barely see it the battery only lasts a few hours, and there's nothing running in the background.  Either I have a defective phone or the part about the battery is a lie."
"Too big for my liking.  Not sure if its the built in GPS app but the first day I opened this phone to see what it was about, it was freezing with all that storage.  It has a lot of AI features but I'm a bit private so it's not for me. Weight wise it was moderately heavy, I would have wanted it to be lighter"
"I used an iPhone for a long time and decided to give Android a try. While most things were fine, I ran into a big problem with group text messages from iPhone users. My new phone also didn’t work with my car’s CarPlay system, and my Apple Watch doesn’t work well with Android either, which has been frustrating."
"Update on 2/25/2024: ▪︎The issue of washout color has been fixed after software update. ▪︎The camera can take a rather clear photo on  A4 paper.  BUT, still not that perfect yet. ▪︎The phone still get hot on fast charging. I have to disable ""fast charging "". Is this issue caused by software or hardware??This S24 ultra is my 6th Samsung galaxy phone.As a big fan of Samsung, I pre ordered this S24 ultra phone.I couldn't understand why Samsung would make a flagship phone like this one. Unbelievable!>>>The screen has dull colors, poor saturation, and cannot be adjusted.  I once wondered if I had cataracts in my eyes.  But when I get back to my S21 , my eyes feel much more comfortable and relaxed.>>>The camera doesn't focus !Isn’t Samsung famous for its high-definition cameras?But this S24 ultra just can make your pictures blurred with the terrible post processing but can't avoid. I even couldn't take a normal clear picture in a  A4 paper schedule.Will Samsung fix this problem through software?Otherwise I might have to return it."
"I had the pixel 5 before this (no facial recognition) for my smart phone comparison I constantly have issues with the finger print scan (I have tried both thumbs and pointer fingers), the facial recognition works like 1 in 8 times if I'm lucky so I end up just typing my pin in. I am unsure about settings to change this but half the time I try swiping up for my pages open the samsung pay opens up instead so I have to try several times, I did a payment plan for it and feel like I am stuck with this phone for the next 2 years I would not recommend and I regret my purchase *updated my score because this phone gets worse and worse, after a month I get a notification that the voicemail was actually a month trial and it costs 2.99 a month for the voicemail display apple and pixel phones use now I have to call my number like it's 2009."
"At first I thought that it was just me, but it isn't.  It's everyone.  The world's current most expensive flagship phone actually shipped with a glitched out, awful looking  bland washed out screen that is cringe inducing when looking at it.  If you're expecting the beauty of the previous S2X phone series, you won't get it here, this screen is BAD and shipped effectively broken and not working properly to every single customer.  Honestly, everyone should be refunded and if there's a class action lawsuit, I'm definitely joining it.  All of the colors look completely washed out and almost pastel, it's just . . . BAD!  It reminds me of installing a wrong video driver in the 90's or if you're using an unsupported color/resolution mode.  Aside from the color just being horrendous and completely inaccurate, text looks smoothed and slightly blurry making it off-putting to read.  Looking at the S24 Ultra beside of the S22 Ultra is like night and day, no way in the world would I recommend someone to buy a S24 over the S22 or S23.  The S24 looks like garbage.  How in the world did they justify shipping it like this?  How in the world are they getting away with this?!  Massive respect and faith has been lost in Samsung as a smartphone leader in my eyes due to this.  Also, it's extremely suspicious that NO tech reviewers mentioned this, as if they were told not to or something.  I smell a lawsuit on the horizon . . .Shame on Samsung, big time . . .  I've been a loyal customer since the Galaxy III, but I think that this debacle has ended that long run that I was very happy about.  I feel betrayed and duped.DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE."
The phone is small
"So far I'm not impressed. It's very hard to differentiate from an iPhone until you turn it on. Maybe that's the point.Good:Fingerprint scanner is VERY fast compared to my older s10. S10 is 5 years older so that isn't saying much.Lame:No more rounded edges or screen. SD card was great to be able to add more space when you download movies from apps.  No Headphone port, which has come in handy on OLD devices that only support aux inputs.The AI features are neat, but not all that useful. Maybe if you need to translate languages often. I'm not sure why the AI stuff can't be applied to any other phone, since a lot of it is offloaded to the cloud anyway.Seems to be an S23 with some software that could also work on the s23.  Feels like a step backward from an older S10, which had curved edges, headphone and SD card ports. Phones seem to have plateaued about 4 years ago.Save your money and get an older s23 or 22."
"FedEx kept showing up at 2 for a delivery that required a signature. Had I known it was FedEx, I would not have bought it. I spent 3 hours of 5 o'clock traffic driving to the airport to pick it up."
"SAMSUNG S 24 ULTRA...What a waste of $1300.00.Very limited storage for videos,  pictures  ... 250 GBMy S8 was way quicker and stored 1-2 TB of all my documents that I needed for work on my SD CARDS.This S 24 ULTRA is not for business on the go.You will keep needing to clear the cache through the day.  ""AAP BY AAP"" UNLESS...You want to pay again for massive storage in a cloud that keeps getting hacked with skyrocketing prices.I'm going back to a phone that will allow SD CARDS.Oh...it's great to take pictures of the stars.I only did the list exchange because my cameras failed on all three of my S8's on the same day.  Who set that up. Samsung has no answers.Now I gotta look at different manufacturers who won't destroy SD CARD usage.Good luck folks."
"Just like any other Samsung. However, I've been having a issue where the screen overheats in average temps and I can feel it when I'm using the display"
"edit: after using for about a week... phone still doesn't push gmail notifications after being idle for 20+ minutes.  Seems like android or samsungs being too aggressive in making apps sleep in order to increase the Batter Life statistics for reviewers or something.  Seems to be happening on all my android devices... so not sure if it's an Android 14 issue ('feature') or just the company trying to make their battery life seem better than it is bc they're forcing apps to not be able to push notification.  I only get notification pop-ups after I unlock the phone.... which is almost useless.---finally the human race has come to the conclusion that curved edge displays are absolutely not it.  thank you. thank you. thank you.  The phone physically looks fantastic.  Feels great.. flat display, finally.  Speakers sound good.  Spen color doesn't match... no idea why they can't figure that one out.  Seems like an easy thing to do.  Still doesn't have secure face unlock... iphone does it.  Pixel does it...the thing is, i am barely able to use this phone because it didn't come with a charger.  this phone msrp $1,419.99 and the company doesn't include a charging adapter? $1,419.99.Also, so many features/customization options have been removed.. only mentioning a few out of the dozens, but the color settings don't allow for a vivid option that works.  The display is grainy.  There are color banding issues.  you can't change the brightness level of the AoD.  Bixby can't 'dismiss' a timer that has gone off (apple can do this)... so you have to physically press ""dismiss"" instead of saying ""bixby, dismiss timer.""  again, i am mentioning a few out of DOZENS."
"Being a top Samsung product and, by no means cheap, I feel that something is missing. Specially, the display does not feel crispy and color-rich as older generations of Samsung flagship phones. I was expecting some saturated colors as it is what I like. The display shows a bit dull and plain. The battery is OK but not extraordinary, you will barely make it through the whole day with a single charge. However, the exterior looks great and premium. The hardware-software response is great though, and excelent for multitasking and medium heavy task."
I gave 3 stars as other functionalities are solid. However 2 stars deducted as the glass quality is totally unacceptable. I put my company iphone 15 pro on top of my new Samsung 24+ in the pocket (as most working people do) for only two days and guess what: the Samsung screen suffered irreversible scratch and now completely dull! Are you kidding me?! Samsung screen is a**kicked by just your rival's backside camera edges?! Give me a break. The iPhone camera protuding edge is far from sharp!
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I was really very excited to get s24 ultra..I liked the build quality..camera zoom is amazing..s pen drawing to pic is really cool..but after using it for 2-3 weeks I realized the front camera is not that good..my s20 still has better front camera than s24..idk why samsung did this to s24..battery can last upto 10-12 hours even if you use it moderately..now the worst nightmare we used to have with early galaxy series that these phone start hanging..but I never expected this from s24 that withing 1 month this phone starts hanging..my s20 ultra still working fine and never hangs.. I'm returning this phone and reordering the same model again..let's see if I get lucky this time..
"I'm not sure if my phone is defective,  but it gets very hot and freezes the screen,  I just got it today."
"I ordered the US, Unlocked version and it was sent via a third party seller.  Upon receiving the phone, the box did not look like another one that I had recently purchased for a family member.  There were clear plastic ""circle"" tamper seals on the box, not the black ""pull to open"" and ""do not accept if broken"" security stickers.  Upon opening up the box, the phone appeared to be ok, correct size, weight and every camera lens did have a sensor behind it, however, it did not seem to have the cut-out below the power button for the MMW 5G antenna.  This is a dead give-away that the phone is not really a US version and would potentially be incompatible with 5G in future areas were MMW might be deployed (its not currently an issue today as far as I know).  I was able to check the IMEI online to determine that the model number of the IMEI was a Canadian variant that has different 5G antennas inside. I was able to process the return, and was worried that the 3rd party seller would give me a hard time or claim that I did something to the phone but they did not so kudos to them. They did not seem to think anything was wrong with the phone when i talked to them, i essentially returned it based on it not looking like an identical phone that i had purchased a month before and they were ok with that.  I do not know if the seller knows their device is really a Canadian version IMEI repackaged as a US version phone, but buyer beware.  Might be best to just buy this one direct from Amazon to make the returns less painful.  The process for this return took several weeks and a few phone calls to get my money refunded to my account, a bit more stressful than a Kohl's dropoff.  If the boxes stickers look off, or printed with blurry text, or the phone doesn't have the cut-out below the power button...you aren't getting an unlocked US version and you should return it."
"I purchased the phone in July 17 and after 2 month using it I can't connect to the provider,  people can't hear me or I can't hear them, the quality of the video is so beautiful but when I send it to my friends is a huge blurred...called Samsung and they won't fix the issue until I will send the phone in to be prepared.  They didn't provide a loaner phone so they want me to be without phone over 20 days by the time they will fix it if they can. The phone volume is so low even on the highest settings I barely hear people, I have to put them on speaker.  I really regret buying this phone."
I bought the phone when it was on sale but would not buy for the actual advertised price. It's nice and small. Battery is draining little faster for new phone. Overall it's doing it's job but not the greatest.
"Over $800 for a phone and won't let me send videos unless they are 2 seconds or less. That  not long enough to get the idea of the video shared. Not happy!! I shouldn't have to go through a cloud, which is just another thing to keep track of. Makes me wonder what else I'm going to find out as I use this phone."
I did not recieve a charging cord with my phone.  So far the phone is great.
"I kept this phone for 2 weeks before returning it. I wanted to get a good feel for it and I just ... Couldn't. Idk ... For the price, I just felt like it could be better? Also, the picture quality was all over the place. Sometimes, my pictures would come out beautiful but at other times, they were extremely grainy. Could be user error BUT for a phone that cost as much as this one, I would expect to just turn the camera on and have amazing pictures without adjusting the settings too much.The funny thing is after I returned this phone, I got an S23 Ultra which came out a year before the S24 and I find it to be better in a way. The pictures seem much better and honestly, they're so similar ... You can't really tell a difference unless you're really into phone specs. Plus, the S23 Ultra was cheaper but still superb.By no means am I a tech junky. I just wanted a new phone and the S24 Ultra simply didn't give me what I wanted at the price point."
"My phone frequently freezes and it's VERY annoying!! I have to get out of what I'm in and go back again. Also doesn't connect to all wi fi signals. If it doesn't improve, I'll have to return it or exchange it."
"Had major problems, typically Samsung can be picky. Don't get me wrong. I love the phone. Its a beast, just not a 1400.00 beast. Samsung has absolutely the worst customer service and Tech I've ever dealt with hands down. Overall the ohone is cool, fast as heck. Just remember..you cant add memory cards. Go big. Also. Verizon made me use my card slot which stinks. I wanted to have a second line. Seller was supper fast, and yep. Its unlocked as stated. I switch sims all the time."
I could have gotten it cheaper off the Samsung website but they offered a 200 e-gift card to be sent after you paid. I received the phone on feb 8th and I have paid the credit card. I called today and the lady on the phone said they were not running any specials on this phone EVER. I researched and found 3 articles that were pushing you to buy on Amazon to get the 200 E-gift card. I order off Amazon all the time so I didn't think to screenshot the info as they have always been easy to deal with. So Im very disappointed that no one can help me with this. The phone isn't worth the money. The pictures are not better than my Samsung s20.
"My first smart phone was a small Samsung which I enjoyed and decided to give the brand a try again. There are plenty of things I didn't enjoy, but here are the top 3:1. The quality of the design has really gone down. If you hold it with your left hand, your fingers will be covering the cameras (why do they need 3 of them to be placed on top of one another?). They removed the 3.5mm jack so you can't just plug a wired headphones. You have to buy an adapter for the usb-c port which means you can't listen to music and video and charge it at the same time, e.g. when in a car.2. Why remove the option to schedule a phone turn on time. Similarly, why can't I turn off the phone at night (e.g. if I wanted to avoid disturbance and radiation) and have the alarm work with the phone off? Why can't that be an option like on other phones?3. The biggest headache I had is with transferring the data from my old phone. Why was the sd_card_backup file from the previous phone hidden? Who really needs the option in the file folders that switches between Essential/All files? Why would Samsung decide which files are essential? Even if you need the button for some reason, why leave the default to Essential (which hides the files you have downloaded and leaves the Samsung factory files)?I will postpone buying a new phone for as long as I can, and I'm not buying a Samsung phone anymore."
Longtime Samsung customer and big fan of the Note series. I upgraded to the S24 from a Note 10 that was starting to bog down. The S24 has some improvements but overall it lacks in speed and signal strength compared to the previous phone. I have come to expect better from Samsung.
"I live in a fringe area. Above all else in a phone, I need excellent signal handling. If it won't talk to the cell tower, everything else is worthless.  The S24 Ultra fails in this one thing.  I experienced dropped calls, and extremely poor data rates.  My kids have a Galaxy A02 and a TCL 40: both low-end budget phones.  Yet both of these phones consistently have 6db higher signal levels, and twice the download bandwidth of this ""flagship"" phone.  I'm sure if you live in an area with excellent signal, this will be an excellent phone for you.  But if you struggle with a cell signal, this is not the phone for you."
"Upgraded from a 5 year old pixel 5. Phone is fast, good screen and samsung UI is not nearly as intrusive as it used to be. However, the picture quality is horrible. Have tried adjusting all setting but many pictures are over exposed and grainy pixilated. Most likely returning and getting a Pixel 9. Really unacceptable picture quality for a flagship."
"After owning the S series line of phones for years, this one, if not a step backward, was unquestionably no step forward. I don't know what happened with the color clarity of this phone. There appears to be an issue with the color clarity of this phone, causing the colors to be less sharp and vibrant than usual. My wife still owns the S23 Ultra, and the differences are obvious and incredible.Even with the newest processor, there's not a notable increase in speed compared to the S23 Ultra. She has some pretty chip-intensive apps on her phone, and after loading them on my phone, the S24 Ultra, her phone did better with them.The main point is that I dislike this phone. I found it disappointing given its price. I am going with OnePlus 12."
"Phone  is smaller than I expected. Much smaller than my LG. I guess I am not used to the Samsung brand but I was disappointed for what I received. The battery doesn't  last very long, maybe a day and a half. Pictures quality is not that great. My LG took much better pictures.It feels like a downgrade from my LG. Too bad LG is shutting down."
I was so excited to receive my phone....waiting a long time to be able to purchase is....when I got the package the box had already been open and the phone appeared to be a used phone.  The speakers popped when any sounds was played.  Very disappointing
"Only had it for one day so far. Everything's great. Except, I would just like to know why Amazon had my $1,400 sliding around in a box with no padding. Good way to cut costs. Also, a great way to get your customers' expensive purchases damaged."
"Did not receive the violet color I ordered.  To be fair,  the box started it was,  but the phone is graphite, not purple.  I'm terms of the phone itself,  the camera is OUTSTANDING,  don't appreciate not being able to use an SD card anymore - but I understand the marketing scam behind it (forcing service provider customers to purchase storage space a la carte).  It's thicker and considerably heavier than my last phone (Note 10+).  Any ""upgrade"" in cpu power or ram isn't readily noticeable in comparison to my old phone.  All in all,  it's a phone, and not Apple,  so I'm pleased."
I like the extra storage space. I'm still learning the new features it has. I had a Samsung A53 5g. This is an upgrade of it.
"Around a $1,000 and a charger is not included.  You know, pay more and get less.  I only just opened the package so I don't know how the phone works but we'll find out.  It would of been nice if Amazon clearly marked that there was no charger. Amazon should of offered to sell a charger as it is necessary in order to be able to use the product."
"Please look at the pictures they speak for themselves. This is right out of the box what the phone looks like and what my immediate experience is. Mind you this is not an inexpensive phone. The terrible quality control on display here is shameful. For starters the first thing I noticed was the nic of three pretty obvious scratches to the right of the front facing camera just as I peeled off the screen factory sticker. Then I started looking around seeing if there was anything else thinking I might be able to live with it and sure enough there was a few scratches around the metal camera bumpers which yeah maybe I could of lived with that too. But the worst was the s-pen, IT IS STUCK IN THE PHONE :(...... Shameful. And it looks like quality control knew because it looks like they tried to dislodge it and get it to come out. The reality here is that they knew about that and decided to package the phone and ship it out only for someone (me) to discover. Like what were they thinking, someone would just be cool with that. This is a flag ship phone and Samsung is doing this? Very concerning, downgrades the brand in my mind. I had high hopes for this, I'm coming from an s21 ultra and was super excited to get this. Very disappointed as I am pretty invested into the Samsung ecosystem, now I'm thinking about returning my Galaxy watch 7 I just got and just going to the OnePlus 12....cheaper anyways."
"Everything on the phone worked great for the first few days, however after using the phone for a week or so the front camera completely quit working it would lag so much it was unusable and would eventually give me an error code. Samsung tech support was useless and Amazon would not send my a replacement I am still waiting on my refund to be processed after almost 2 weeks of returning the phone."
"This was supposed to be an upgrade from my S10e.  However, the sound quality is very disappointing.  Even at full volume, music playing from this phone is not nearly as loud as my old phone.  I see from the Samsung website that others have the same complaint.  I've shared this with Samsung.  Hopefully it's something that can be addressed with a software patch and not a hardware issue.  If anything changes in this regard, I'll update my review.Update: got an unhelpful response from Samsung yesterday.  Today, I tried listening to music through earbuds instead of using the phone speakers.  The left channel is almost completely muted.  I checked the equalizer and it's set for even distribution between left and right channels.  I've let Samsung know about this.  We'll see what happens.Update 2: Samsung tells me they've raised the issue w/their developers for further evaluation.  Meanwhile, I've noticed a second issue.  The screen flickers when I scroll with my finger.  This happens with all the applications on my phone. I've reported this to Samsung as well.Update 3: I've discovered the problem with the left channel.  The problem wasn't in the Equalizer.  In Settings > Accessibility > Hearing enhancements, the balance was incorrect.  I've corrected that, and now the sound is great with my earbuds. However, the loudness and sound quality through the phone speakers still are inferior to my S10e."
"I have it on battery saver & do not disturb to try to slow down this dying battery, but even without playing videos or anything the battery dies like it's playing 8k movies all day. I charge my S22 Ultra every 2 days and this S24 Ultra has to be charged at least twice a day. My other phone is in decent shape. I'm debating on whether to send this back, honestly."
"I haven't purchased a new phone in quite a while so I was pretty excited to get the latest and greatest to hold on to for the better part of the next decade.The phone seems very high quality and premium, but one problem for me.The colors on the screen do not seem to pop. They are very muted. They look almost as good as a phone I purchased almost 7 years ago. The resolution is great, but the colors, just don't seem right. Other than that I can't find anything to complain about.  I hope this is just a software issue that just needs an update or I will feel a bit ripped off for the price."
I loved this phone for the 1st 6 months. Then it started getting hot and taking a long time to charge. A full charge lasts a few hours now and I have to turn it off overnight or the battery will be dead. It gets very hot just sitting in my purse. I shut down all apps to try to make the battery last longer. Sad.
I got the phone went to my reg carrier and spent money to get a card and kit spent 2 hours before I was told it wouldn't work on their site-I then try ed a few other well known carries that said t hey could help me with activation of a esim card.So I aske Amazon since it was a completely unlocked phone if they could help me get a few dollars back-its costing me15 more dollars per month because I cant use my reg carrier.They said they couldn't get a differment of the price i paid-its its not unlocked to all carriers then the phone shouldn't be as expensive as a totally unlocked one.Iam not a Happy customer.
"I bought it to use it in Costa Rica, almost got crazy mad when it didn't read my physical sim card but after replacing it for an esim it worked perfectly! :) hope this helps. Had to go to customer service SEVERAL times to receive the gift card promise and as the rest mentioned, I thought I wS going to be receiving the 1TB for the double storage but I received the 512 gb version as well, so the double storage was not given as promised with the pre order."
I came from one plus 8T and the software comparison is Day and night !The hardware is ok but my overall experience with the software is the worst!I was even thinking of returning it but because the shipping fees are too high i finaly kept it !It will be the last time buying samsung phones
I wouldn't order it here. 90 day warranty only. Too much money for that.
"Upgraded from the S22 Ultra, and while mostly everything about the S24 ultra is awesome, a really nagging thing seems to happen when switching zoom levels in the camera (the zoomed in image seems to consistently product a haziness/whitewash affect when zooming - noticed between 3x and 5x).It noticeably drops in saturation and I thought I was going crazy thinking some kind of condensation or something was obstructing the lens, but after removing the phone from its case and ensuring nothing was obstructing the lenses, it still produced that dull/unsaturated filter when 3x/5x zoom levels were chosen (and in good lighting)"
This is the worst of the worst. The voice text is TERRIBLE it uses words you don't even say. The test is worse because it corrects words that have NOTHING wrong with them. NOW IT WONT EVEN CHARGE. WHAT KIND OF GARBAGE IS AMAZON ALLOWING TO BE SOLD ANYMORE!! I CANT RETURN IT BECAUSE ITS BEEN OVER 30 DAYS SO I WONT EVEN GET MY MONEY BACK. WASTED 1500 DOLLARS
"The phone stopped taking a charge. Tried recommendations online. None worked. Wrote Samsung. No response. Tried chatting with Samsung. The bot wanted to send me through trouble-shooting steps – ON A DEAD PHONE. Called Samsung and was told to take it to a 3rd party repair shop. Was told by the repair shop that it is a known problem, and, no worries, they have the parts in stock. It would not need to be sent out so a quick turn-around could be expected. Cost to me $149. When I stated that it was only 6 months old and still under warranty, I was told the following. THE REPAIR SHOP ONLY TAKES IN SAMSUNG WARRANTY PHONES ONE DAY PER MONTH. I was told that he could check the schedule to see when the next available month/date was and warned me that the turn-around time could be long! What!?!? My next phone will not be a Samsung (nor my next watch, appliance, etc). If you already own Samsungs latest, top-of-the-line phone, cross your fingers. First the charge port, who knows what else (Samsung, perhaps) and then expect bottom-of-the-line support. If you are still in the market, talk to folks you trust who have purchased the competition and make your decision wisely."
"First, data transfer: you have to go through a bunch of advertising hurdles and a treasure hunt to figure out what to do next.Later, much later when thanks to cheer luck and many tries you finally get thing downloaded, you get a message ""to complete account setup click here"" > empty page.After trying several ways around, you get a message asking you to enter a code that was sent to the very email account you've been supposed to access for days to complete setup...Btw, i've been using Android phones for years. Never seen so many hurdles, so many options, so much marketing included in the interface.Samsung interface overlay (Launcher), that you can't do away with, is overly complicated. I can't find out how to organize my interface. One UI is too smart by a half to be anything but frustrating for a lambda user.Great camera though!!PS -  The 2 stars don't reflect the actual quality of the phone but the way I feel using it."
I was disappointed when I had gone through a lot of the process to find out this unit was not compatible with xfinity  mobile.  How are we able to see if it is unlocked and compatible with our phone carrier?  I went to an xfinity store and asked for help.  They found the problem and were able to fix it.  Thank you xfinity.
"This issue needs to be addressed I want a full refund or a replacement immediately please, the phone was bad as soon as I received it I could tell something was wrong and it started going downhill real fast from there about this phone for my son he did not open it until a little while after I purchased it, now he has no working phone, I have to contact customer support and see why this issue has not been handled, I took it to a dealer and he told me this phone had been previously used before I even purchased it, and it sure didn't take it long to completely die it's dead completely it will not even turn on it is a defective phone and was upon arrival., I want my money back or a replacement but I would rather have the refund I do not trust getting another phone I guess I need to contact customer support because I cannot get any answers like this and as an attorney I will push this to the fullest this is not a cheap phone to buy and I am not going to let this slide. I will return the phone once we get a resolution made here and I will be contacting customer support this morning."
I'm a bit disappointed that the video and photo quality isn't better than my S23 Ultra. I put all the settings exactly the same on both phones and the S23 Ultra still looks better than the S24 Ultra. You can really tell when you zoom in while recording a video. I'm wondering if I got a bad phone.
"The screen for this is significantly duller and the color more washed out that both my S9 and Pixel 7.  Went through all the software updates and display preferences, but still couldn't get a vibrant picture.  Returning and will continue to use my old phones."
"I already have the phone all set up so I'm sure I can't return it. But the display quality is horrible on this compared to my old samsung.  The photos are all washed out and not vibrant at all and after further research on this, it sounds like Samsung did this intentionally and I wish I knew it sooner. Super disappointed.I want to add to this agmfter having it for several weeks, the camera itself sucks. It darkens facial features and the overall photo. Like a shadowed look i guess.  I've googled and search forums for a solution ans tried changing settings and it just sucks 90% of the time. I wish I dint drop so much money on it."
The phone is missing the sim tray so it's unusable until I can either get a replacement tray or replacement phone
Not sure if this was a new phone but look at the condition I received this inSeal was broken when I got it and the box taped up to be reclosedPhone seems to be ok but this is poor
"This phone heats up more than it should. It should not feel hot in your hand. The camera is gimmicky, awful, and does not work properly at all. It has far too many bugs in it, including blurs and streaks; it takes lopsided photos even when the camera phone is being held very steady and straight. Who wants crooked photos? No one!!Nighttime photos are very grainy and streaky, and you end up with unwanted rainbow-effect blurs and streaks. This phone is totally overpriced for what you get, and Samsung product support leaves so much to be desired. Also, beware of all the hidden data collection features built into this phone. Bixby is very annoying and cannot be removed from the phone. Additionally, don’t be dazzled by a lot of storage memory when RAM is relatively low. This phone has a lot of bugs to be worked out yet, especially with the camera!! Moreover, is the Gorilla Glass screen really everything it's cracked up to be? Why would you still need to use a screen protector? There is an awful lot of hype about this overpriced phone. And please beware; it does not come with any charger, nor any ear buds. We cannot and will not recommend buying the S24+."
"The phone is great. Samsung did it again.  However, I only bought this straight out from Amazon because they promised a $200 reward which made this a cheaper option than my carrier.  Well, they have not given me the credit and each time I call I am told to just wait.  It's been 14 days.  Again, the phone is great.  Buy from your carrier.  I learned my lesson here."
The ear piece doesn't work.  I can only listen through the speaker on the phone!
"I, like many others, are in complete shock of how BAD, DULL and WASHED OUT the screen colors are on this phone. Surely these are defective, I can't think of any other reason. This simply can NOT be on purpose like they claim. Along with that, a lot of games I've played have a very slight 'stutter' or lag every other few minutes. I am furious I spent all of this money on phone with subpar screen colors, I mean that has to be in the top 3 aspects of a phone, marked at this price, that NEEDS to be perfect, no exception.I don't know if my phone is defective, but I'm not at all satisfied. If Samsung does not fix this egregious issue, I will have no choice but to return in. That's the last thing I want to do, it's a gorgeous phone otherwise but the color and lag issues are seriously insane for a phone that costs this much.SAMSUNG - You NEED to fix the color issue, save your reputation. I will have no other choice but to NEVER buy your phones again after this."
"The Vivid and Standard colors are the same, they do not change. The keyboard isn't great, you have to push down hard on keys. I'm not impressed with this phone. It's a bit Glitchy. The voice doesn't understand you very well when talking. If Samsung doesn't give an update soon to fix these problems; I'm going to return it, before the windows closes on the return."
"The equipment is new and came sealed But it came to me with battery problems, it drains without using it, I already updated it, optimized it and nothing works, finally I turned it off with 30% charge after a day I tried to turn it on and it did not turn on It seems that the battery was drained when it was turned off, that is not normal, it is still justifiable when it is on that the charge goes down but that even when it is off it drains the battery is useless. Do not throw away your money, I regret it. Having bought it I tried to return it but you have to have the time to be present and return it."
I bought s24 ultra 2 days ago and the battery is draining really fast and I even tried all the steup to increase battery life but nothing is helping
"Opted for the like new s24 now two months later it's slowed down,  lags. Not impressed. Pray the extra hundred dollars for a new one."
"I've only been using it for a day, so I can't comment on battery life. I did all the setup with the help of my tech-savvy son and there was no way the screen looked good, colourful and vivid. All the other phones in my house (which are older and mid-range) have better screen quality.By this time I've read reviews from some people saying the screen was ""ok"", well... or they received a differente version of OS or they have different expectations.I correct my previous words: maybe the screen is ok, maybe, but what it doesn't work at all, at least in my device, is the settings regarding the screen (colours, brightness, contrast, etc). It seems to be a widely spread issue among the new S24. (Mine is the US version). I hope it'll receive a patch fixing the issue."
"I recently watched the new movie, ""BlackBerry"" about the rise and fall of the BlackBerry. Spoiler Alert!! // In the movie, towards the end, they had to quickly manufacture a new model that would compete with the iPhone, which did not have a keyboard. Because they were so hasty in building the model, nearly 100% of the models were returned due to manufacture error. You can watch it here on Amazon Prime.Our Samsung Galaxy A32 5Gs were getting very slow and laggy. Granted they were only 2 years old! We decided to replace them with this phone. Out of the box, this new phone was even more laggy than the phones we were replacing. The most shocking moment was when I tried to load a simple website on Chrome and the graphics on the webpage froze and repeated themselves multiple times on the page. I pulled up my old laggy phone next to it and even that phone had seamless scrolling compared to the brand new phone that lagged. Really really shocking!I don't want to go through another experience of a lagging phone, and so we returned both phones, but wow! I guess technology quality is really going downhill with these lower level unlocked budget phones.Granted, I read all the gleaming reviews. I trusted this would be a good phone. More than $400 later (for two phones), and I'm doubting whether I should keep buying from Samsung Galaxy?! Even my MAC laptop, which is MORE THAN 10 years old ... does not lag like that new phone!!! 🤦🤦🤦"
"Yes it works, but I have complaints! The touch-screen is the biggest problem, it is unresponsive and inexact. VERY INEXACT. The battery life is pretty good, but not as good as my Moto-G. And it gets really bad call reception in my area if it's not set to wi-fi calling. I do live in a very remote location, but still, what the heck? My old phone worked! My husband's phone works! It's a phone, shouldn't its primary function be making and receiving calls? (Oh, I just betrayed my age, didn't I?)That's all my complaints. Those caveats aside, it has good smartphone functionality and it's sturdy. It is also extremely affordable.I'm afraid I had high expectations. Because they are the premier Android brand, I expected a low-level Samsung to be at least as good as a mid-level Motorola. NO. That is NOT the case. I will be going back to a Moto-G when this phone reaches the end of its usefulness. And I will try to take better care of the next one!"
"Three stars for the phone but ONE star for return options. I'm returning the phone because I miss wireless charging and the always on display clock. For the price the phone would work for a lot of people but not me. I ordered a different brand that offered the features I wanted. I've been a loyal LG person for years, but they got out of the phone business and since I changed cell providers, I had to get a new phone. Turns out if you want to return a phone from Amazon, you have two choices. Take the phone to a Whole Foods store or an Amazon bookstore. No return thru the UPS store. There is no mention of this on the web page that I saw. I verified the return method with Amazon costumer care. If you don't have one of those places near where you live, like the same town, you are stuck with the phone. I'm lucky to have a Whole Foods store five miles from me so I will take it there. The other phone I bought from Amazon, before I was aware of their return method, I plan on keeping. I do not recommend buying a phone from Amazon until they offer more return options like UPS."
"After a few days with the phone, I can say that it's pretty sub-par. It's definitely a step up from my previous device, but I honestly expected more from a 5G Galaxy device in 2024.The camera is nice, and the body is solid. The screen is beautiful, visually, but is slow and unresponsive, at times refusing to register taps and swipes.I've owned Galaxy devices before, but the Samsung bloatware on this one takes the cake. Dozens of apps are preloaded that you'll have to either disable or uninstall to get some of the precious memory back, and OneUI is aggressively intrusive, causing compatibility and sign in issues with just about everything you want to use.I suppose this is a case of get-what-you-pay-for, but the user experience seems oddly frustrating, given the promised five years of support.This phone has reaffirmed that the Samsung device environment is not for me."
"My phone died and I needed something quickly. After exhaustive research I settled on the A15 because I couldn't afford anything else at the moment and some reviews gave me hope.The good: easy to set up, fast, clear images, feels solid, connects to my car's Bluetooth easily (this was an issue with my old phone), lots of storage.The bad: apps randomly close, it randomly drops signal or wifi, it randomly freezes. Most of the time I can listen to a podcast/audio book or play a game, but not both (there are a couple of exceptions). If you have too many apps open at once it doesn't want to work right. The camera is good close up but terrible at any distance.Conclusion: good for a back up or an emergency but if you can pay more, do it and get another phone."
"I purchased this even though I was a little skeptical based on some of the negative reviews I read online about this not being compatible with some networks etc. I am with Metro (runs off T-Mobile's network) and it worked fine. It is NOT fully unlocked, and will not allow you to have access to both SIM cards, nor will it let you use an e-sim. I contacted Samsung and was advised that this phone will not allow access to e-sim due to being an international phone built in another country and not the USA once the tech ran diagnostics on my phone. He advised what country it was built in but I do not recall the name. It is still a good genuine Samsung Galaxy A35, just not one made specifically for the US, and has some limitations.On a side note, the ""blue"" on this phone is pretty much ""white,"" so don't be surprised when you receive a white phone."
"Last time I had a Samsung phone was 15 years ago. So far, I am trying to adjust to having so much bloating software that I don't  use and cannot uninstall!The A15 5G appears to be faster than the one I just decommission, but from a couple of days on, the phone has turned slow. I have a phone cleaner but it seems that it is not helping. The looks, weight and screen display look nice, but I am concerned with the constant ""Samsung eye"" checking on me...Is there a way to uninstall all that Samsung software I don't  want?"
"I always need a backup phone. My main phone ( Moto stylus 5g) dropped and had to order a new screen. My backup phone died so, I bought this Galaxy A15 since it would get to me the next day. I thought getting a Galaxy would be great with the brand reputation. I realize this is entry level for this family of phones, but did expect a little better. Here is the good:1. The Samsung UI is intuitive and is willing to take on tasks and minimize effort for logging in and anything related to accounts.2. Setup was easy with the Samsung UI.The not so good:1. It has to think about loading something when you try to open an app. I was able to grab my laptop log in and start typing before it loaded the app.2. It will say you are offline even when connected to WiFi or cell. You may have to close then relaunch the browser multiple times for it to load.3. the UI gives you a message that you will have to reboot the phone often to keep it working correctly. I know a little about computers and know that the file system will apply updates and such to ensure it is working right however, I found I had to reboot this one multiple times in a day to get it to open apps or connect. There were no error messages or indications of hardware issues. It was new in the box.4. I bought a Moto G 5G as a backup, which is in the same price range as the A15 and it; setup, connected and navigated apps without issues or delays. The performance difference was notable.I have read many reviews with the same result from users regarding the A15.I was able to install the new screen for my Stylus G, while it is slightly higher level than the A15, it hadno issues with speed or connectivity the same as the Moto G 5G.Summary:  The A15 performs lower than comparable phones so, if you are looking for a low mid range phone, other than a dedicated Samsung fan, it would benefit you to either upgrade to a higher level Galaxy or shop for a different brand in this price range.Hope this helps."
"I got this phone because I couldn't bear spending 1000$ on a new flagship model. I've been a samsung user for years. It's an ok value for a $200 phone. Battery life is good. Screen looks good. But sometimes it decides to be slow and lag to respond. It also clears your apps when switching through them. So if you're browsing Amazon and try to search something on google, it will clear your Amazon and you'll be brought back to the home screen when you return to the app. This is the biggest issue for me I wish I knew before buying or I probably would have spent alittle more for a nicer phone."
"I've had this phone for a little over a month and was so hopeful. It's a pretty phone that offers many options but the amount of frustration you're going to have waiting for it to respond is not worth it. I believe I'm a pretty patient person but I've gotten to where I just stay off my phone because it's so slow. I've deleted most apps and have the bare minimum which hasn't helped. I have full service, so it isn't a network issue. Keep this in my when purchasing."
"Very similar to older Samsung but was set up to only take three icons in width.  Could not find setting to change so set it up similar to older phone.  After about a week contacted Samsung about it and received a call back.  After resetting to factory settings I could change the display to 4 or 5 wide.  Then able to set up icons and widgets to give the desired spacing.  I then had to reload all my apps and go through all the settings again.All the other issues I have had have been with the changes from older software to the latest versions, not with the phone itself.  Samsung did add extraneous apps, some of which could not be deleted so I did a force stop on them.  The first update brought them back so had to turn off automatic updates, then allow or block updates individually since then.Would prefer to have the 256 gig memory of the non-US veersion but did not want to give up the warranty.  If they did not include the unwanted apps that would help the memory go further.Had for a month, mostly satisfied."
"Slow interface. Scrolling is slow. Maybe can have only two apps open at one time. Requires closing apps to improve performance. Requires frequent reboots. I'm not even doing much on this device. If device sits for too long takes forever to awaken. Yes, tried playing with all the setting. Just simply a slow processor. I'll definitely will spend more dollars in the future for a step-up from this phone."
"I bought the Samsung Galaxy, the description said unlocked. And compatible with my carrier which was MetroPCS. When I got the phone and try to activate it my carrier MetroPCS said it was locked by another carrier and wanted a $30 fee to unlock it. Or to call Amazon to see if they could call the carrier that it was locked by and have them unlock it. I had no success with that. So I returned the phone. I then but another Samsung phone of the same model, with the same description as being unlocked from Amazon. I bought a second replacement phone and that phone was also locked by another carrier. And a $30 fee was required to unlock it by my carrier. So both phones were locked when I bought them. If I would have been told that there was to be a unlock fee from my carrier in the first place I would have kept the first phone and just paid to have it unlocked. Not knowing this information from Amazon, and a incorrect description of phone and misinformation, cost me time and money for almost a month, waiting on a return of my money and in the meantime I had no phone. So phones that say unlocked are almost definitely locked. And a fee from your carrier will be needed to unlock it. And paid by the buyer. The phone I bought as a replacement after sending the first locked phone back was also locked. I ended up buying the same model Galaxy phone at a higher price , I also had to pay for unlock fee. The ram was lower, 4 gigs vs 6 gigs than the original one I purchased. So because of misinformation and bad description, the overall situation of the purchase was very very bad. The Galaxy phone itself seemed to be running fine so far. But because of low ram at 4 GB, it seems to lag when scrolling."
"After having the Samsung galaxy A15 5g for over 6 months now I can say it's not a bad deal for under 200 bucks. The performance on it has been slower over the months, but nothing too bad yet. It has 128 gb of internal storage, which for me is plenty. The sound quality on the speaker isn't anything amazing, but it works well. Although I do hate the placement of it at the bottom of the phone, it gets covered easily and muffles the sound. The picture quality is pretty, way better than my last phone. The thing I probably love about it the most is the display. I didn't think I would care that much about the display, but every time I look at someone else's phone I only then realize how much of a difference it makes. All in all if your looking for a reliable phone under 200, this is probably the best deal."
