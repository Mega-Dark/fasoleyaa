"Wish it was a bit wider as larger lenses are too big to fit. Other than that, its pretty good."
"Stitching coming out just shy of 4 months of light use. Started with just the top loop and now extending into the stitching of the strap to the actual bag. I don't usually leave reviews but since this is meant to be a bag for some pretty expensive equipment I thought I'd warn others off buying it. In the future I'm going to resume buying from my local camera shop, I don't even know why I bothered purchasing from amazon. Just as a note: I can't speak to its water resistance because I don't live in a place with much weather but based on the durability of the bag itself I wouldn't trust it."
I ordered burgundy..this bag is clearly RED! Nice compartments though.
I think it's pretty very functional but way to small for all my equipment.
"Not a huge fan, it’s a durable bag however not very much room for a DSLR that has multiple lenses. Not to mention the way that the zipper opens on the side is not very adequate, If you’re not careful things could fall out"
I really liked this bag but taking it out on a hike it kept falling off my shoulder.  I returned it.
"I used this bag for my new camera and lenses, but I found that it didn’t hold or fit my accessories well. There should have been an extra divider or two which might have helped but it wasn’t big enough to hold my camera base with no lens and the other additional 2 lenses I have securely enough for me to feel comfortable. I would’ve returned it but because of illness I missed my return window. So I’m stuck with a bag that I can’t use and ended up going with a different brand that had a better security strap and more dividers."
Seems like a decent quality but it simply didnt fit me comfortably. If you are petite you shouldn't have a problem.
"It holds what I need it to hold. However, the straps are very confusing.. which makes it difficult to take it places"
Was much smaller than I thought it would be.  I handled it very gently and it started to rip at the seams already.  Probably should spend a few more dollars and get something bigger with better quality
"My camera barely fit into the bag with the lens on, even though it's about the same as the pictured camera in the advertisement."
So I bought this bag for my Mavic Pro which it fits great with all it’s gear. But two months in the handle at the top of the bag just broke. I would call this shoddy workmanship. If one handle broke two months in what can I expect in the coming year.
"Although I like the style, this camera bag is a bit smaller than I expected. So, I am a bit disappointed."
"Nice case , it little smaller then it looks .  Already looking for another bag."
It barely fit my dslr and is quite uncomfortable to carry for any period of time.
"Too small for a DSLR, tripod and 3 lenses with accessories. Very nice otherwise."
But gotta be very careful else you can drop the gear when opening the zip!.
"It is a nice camera bag, it is small though."
I dislike the size of the bag and the lack of space. there are different compartments but they are basically useless because you can’t fit hardly anything in there. If you have a lot of lenses or extensions tubes this bad won’t hold but 4-5 and if you have telephoto lens or long lenses forget fitting anything in that bag. wish i had returned it because i really wasted my money.
"2 months in and the top strap rips off on one side, then the shoulder strap starts to tear. I didn’t expect high quality at this price point, but I expected to last at least 8-12 months. Spending the extra money for better quality."
"Okay case but there is a side fastener with a plastic clip on it. The clip is fine but the nylon they used did not grip, so it falls off at the slightest tug. That's not good near a cliff. The clip is made to fasten to another bag. Very poor design if you need this clip. Otherwise okay bag."
The strap/handle at the top broke within a month.  Compartments are well padded for camera and accessories but it is a small bag overallThe one shoulder strap really didn’t work for me and made it hard for quick access to the camera
"I actually like the concept of this bag along with the multiple pockets for organizing as well as the strap for a tripod.  However, the top handle broke on my third use.  I’m not an avid user and all I carry is a small Sony camcorder, a tripod, my keys and wallet.  I can’t say I would recommend this."
"Used couple times, and the stitch tear down"
If you want a small camera bag this isn't it.  If you want a big one and bulky this is for you.
Too tiny and way too rigid… it just didn’t feel quality. There wasn’t much space inside either. It’s a tiny sling bag that isn’t really comfortable on your shoulder. I returned it immediately.
"I am scared to even use this bag anymore because the handle & strap have bot ripped. The strap is half way off, the handle is completely detached. I LOVED the simplicity & size, as I attend concerts often but I can't trust this bag or company with my equipment."
"Kinda irritated. Haven’t had this bag long, bought At the end of June and didn’t start using to middle of July and I’m not rough on my stuff and the main strap that holds it on your back is already separating from the bag."
"This is extremely small and I was not expecting that! I would barely be able to get a DSLR and 3 lenses in it. Also, ergonomically it was uncomfortable."
"Great looking, nice quality. Unfortunately it’s 110% only for your left shoulder. And it’s actually pretty uncomfortable IMO. The shoulder strap at the neck curves in and rides your neck."
This wasn’t as comfortable as I had hoped. The carrying strap is wider than necessary. One of the buckle straps came detached after only one day of use.
I was disappointed with the size
I really loved this bag at first. But it’s broken already. I haven’t even had it for 4 months and the top portion broke.
After 2 days the side panel of main interior compartment ripped. Unfortunately a month and a few days from purchase date so no way to return.
"It was too small. My fault totally, should've checked the measurements"
"I like the camera bag but when I use it during a rainy day, it damage my Nikon D3s and my paper work I had inside."
"The cross body strap broke immediately out of the box, I can’t trust putting cameras and equipment in it."
The bag was so small and it’s a left shoulder strap. Sad to say it was return back.
I only used this camera back pack a handful of times and the pocket stitching let loose. STAY AWAY.
I loved it until the strap ripped from the bag one day with no warning. Very light use. Disappointing. No response from the seller.
The size was perfect fit to my gadget the total weight is about 5lb. It’s not quite heavy  but it become to break in a month.
I don't know but they added to many zippers and when you walk it makes a lot of noise..
The bottom strap is made funny. It doesn’t not fit right and hangs funny. I would t purchase another.
"The bag does its job alright - it transports large gear safely - but it's far from great. In two months the small zippers are already starting to catch in places. It also lacks pockets - only has 3. The main inside pocket doesn't seem very useful to me because it's so large, not see thru, and the zipper opening is somewhat difficult to reach into, and you can't see what you're grabbing so you have to fish around till you find it.On the plus side, the main compartment separators are not flimsy, and overall the bag is very sturdy.I would rather have spent more money for a bag that was more thought out with pockets, and better zippers."
Love bags from Mosiso.  Have many.But this particular style though slightly larger dimensions has a very flimsy carrying handle on the top compared to other styles.One would think that this design would have warranted at least the same strap as the others!
"Interior space is nice, but the zippers are cheap and will break, the straps are thin and poorly attached. Of the two outside pockets, only one has a strap for your tripod and its not designed well. My small collapsing tripod didn't fit well in the pocket, with little securing support from the strap that doesn't completely unloop. You have to slid it through the strap and fit into the pocket. Its a PITA to use and your tripod will fall out. Better to try and fit it inside the pack. This is a light duty pack, it wont survive many outdoor trips. All that aside it looks nice and holds a decent amount, its just an cheap pack."
Used this bag on one trip and it already ripped. This is sad with all the good reviews and feel like I may have got scammed. Tried to reached out but zero response. Hopefully this gets resolved
"Looks nice, but the top handle is too light weight,  the main compartment zipper is too light weight and lacks any environmental sealing, and the compartment dividers lack any structure. There is also no strap between the two shoulder straps."
"Bought this to fit a larger lens like the Fuji 150-600mm.  While the lens fits in this backpack, basic build quality control is lacking.  The zipper just doesn't close all the way."
Divider is too small. Small things like battery are moving around. The depth of the bag is a little too big for securely storing the lenses. Built quality is ok not great.
Would have been pleased if it wasn't mishandled. Dented in two places.
Pretty nice case lots of extra pockets on the exterior my biggest complaint that there is not a single pocket on the interior or a place to put an extra couple of memory cards. It appears that the top of the case is hard plastic and it's not it is a flexible rubber material and I don't believe that it would protect the interior contents from much impact. The bag is also lacking in outer padding so when you set your gear down you're going to need to be careful certainly I wouldn't drop this bag with thousands of dollars of camera equipment inside of it. It'll work for its intended use but there are certainly much much better products on the market.  I have shot professional photography for over a decade this is my professional opinion.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            DO NOT BUY IF YOU NEED IT FOR CAMERA1. It is not a hardshell. It is a very soft rubber. Even container from a dollar store will protect better.2. 17 inch laptop does not fit in.3. Top handle is very flimsy and small.4. Dividers are made from cheapest fabric and very thin.5. Zippers are the cheapest and already moving strange (brand new backpack)6. Straps are made to carry very light load (not dslr)7. Absolutely useless straps on a side, that do not do anything.Overall feels like a kids backpack that will not survive even one trip. Amazon disappoints me a lot."
I got this bag and was enjoying it after I got it all setup for my camera gear. I was excited to take it on a trip but after a single plane ride with the bag just going under the seat in front of me the whole outside of the bag was messed up. Just sliding the bag in and out ruined the smooth material on the outside of the bag. It still works great but it looks pretty bad.
"This bag is a nice size for daily walk around but it is small and shallow. For example, the bag is shallow so you can’t fit the camera body on its side. It works fine, if you only need to carry 1 camera and a lens or 2."
"In just two months of holding an iPhone gimbal, the hook was tired of hooking and just busted out of the seams and caused threading to come loose. Very sad about this and disappointed. However the size, and compartments of this bag are good."
The quality is really good But they exaggerates the size in the picture it wasn’t that big to be able to fit video camera in it
I used the bag for 5 days in Montana during a 60 mile float trip down the Smith River. It snowed and rain for 2 days and there definitely was water seepage in the front and back. I had all zippers properly closed. It was a good thing my Canon R5 and L lenses are very water resistant.
It was nicely designed but not for my purpose . I can’t believe I’m the only photog that uses designated bodies and lens! Would like to know what they use to carry both in 1 bag!
"I really wanted to love this ULANZI camera bag. Got it because I've gotten some high quality stuff from them before, and figured that this looked like a well built bag that would suit my needs.First off, I have a good bit of stuff that needs to fit in this bag since I'm a videographer. You can see my rig in the attached pictures, but I have a Canon R6 with a Smallrig cage, smallrig vmount battery slot, osee lilmon5, a set of cables, and my moman wireless audio received. Additionally, I have a smallrig handle on the left hand side. Now, the camera slot in the bag is nice, but it just isn't big enough, nor is it deep enough to fit the camera with the screen attached to it, which is really annoying. In my old Lowepro bag, which is arguably smaller, you can fit the whole rig in the top pocket, no problem.The rest of the pockets in the bag are decent, and you can definitely fit a decent bit of kit in here, but I find the slots to be either too big or too small for a lot of my stuff. Getting to the main big pocket is pretty easy, but you do really have to unzip the whole thing in order to get inside. The straps to hold it from opening too far are very useful, but there aren't a lot of great places to store small stuff.The front pocket can be irritating, because the fabric is so inflexible that you have to open it almost all the way in order to get to stuff in the bottom. Honestly, I haven't been on a trip or shoot with this so I'm not sure how much these minor things will affect me in the field.Water resistance on this bag seems like it'll be pretty good, the zippers and material feel very high quality and I think it will last a long time.Overall this bag is very expensive, and doesn't sort 100% of the things that I want it to, but my old bag was breaking so I suppose I'll use this one for a while and see if it ends up working out. One other thing, the water bottle slots on the side are a little smaller than I'd like. On my lowepro I could fit a hydro or a nalgene in it, but can't quite do it on this one."
"ULANZI Camera Backpack Professional Bag, Waterproof Photography Camera Case Anti Theft Travel for Photographers Women Men DSLR Mirrorless Camera Lens Tripod Holder 16 inch Laptop Black 22Li guess this would be a mid- to larger sized camera bag.  the internal sorter storage area comes preset but it is modifiable. so for me it solves the paralysis by analysis problem i have with a blank slate.  there is a pocket on the external face of the bag that is just weird. its like the full face of the bag but the opening is ackward and small. i guess for just jamming stuff in willy nilly. not a fan of willy nilly pockets that are huge but have very small openings. also in the main compartment there are 2 lashes that are meant to hold open the back so you can pack it or whatever but they are not adjustable and in my opinion to short to be really useful. the material seems water proof but looks a little not premium, i feel like this would be a dust magnet and look dirty most of the time--dont know that for sure and maybe its better to look a little dirty because it means youre working. i like the bag dont get me wrong there are just some strange choices with it. and for the point its at there should not be so many weird choices.  the back part of the bag where the backpack straps are have what appear to be air cushions which i suspect will make this nice to travel with which at the end of the day is what it needs to be.  my sample came with a cool little minibag  maybe bige enough for a few spare batteries that can attach to a belt. also an interesting if not peculiar tag is in both bags it states:  ""qualified certificate upon inspection and test this product is qualified."" nice. its qualified. bottom line its weird but does seem like its going to be a durable pack but only time can answer that question. itys a bit of a mixed bag. ha."
"this is one of the worst designed camera bags I have ever used, have now had my cameras and lenses fly across the floor several times . Also, it has fiddly loose straps everywhere which continually get caught on objects."
Interior of the bag was made of the fuzzy material for the hook and loop dividers to attached to but it is rough to the touch and thin. It would get very annoying for my hands and fingers to get scratched every time I insert or remove gear. Consider the price of this camera bag it on par but I returned it and purchased a higher quality model from. BTW a lot of Youtube influencers hype this bag because of the low price point but quality needs to be considered for long term use.
"Very honest review after 2 months of several use.Feels very nice regarding to quality. The look is nice as well.Side access is very convenient for your camera and batteries (only 4).Inside you can carry your lenses.But, you cannot carry your laptop. Unless you have a Mac (a very thin one like Mac book air). Forget about carry the laptop charger. And don’t even think if you have a windows laptop or anything thicker than a Mac.If you carry cables forget about them. If you carry a battery charger (you can carry that but it will barely fit) if you carry external hard drives (forget about them). Don’t event talk about videography gear, it is just not for that.It is like only upper half of the front pocket is usable the rest is super tight. Therefore you won’t be able to close your backpack.Too expensive for only carry lenses. There are too many options and way cheaper."
After seeing lots of Good reviews i got 1 but didn’t find the quality as expected. $170 plus Tax not worth. This bag must cost  $70  in terms of quality and design.
"Unfortunately the bag arrived with a scratch approximately 8 inches across the front clear panel, there was no damage to the original packaging so I can only assume it happened during manufacturing. Really disappointed as we were planning to use this for an upcoming trip and the replacement won't arrive in time. On a positive note the bag is a great size and easily fits an R10 with the 18-150mm lens attached along with a few extras. Hopefully the replacement doesn't have the same issue!"
"For reference, in the bag I put a Fujifilm X-T5 with the 70-300mm attached, and a 16-80 also in the main sectionIt fits. Barely. I have body and lens going across the bag and whilst it makes the bag bulge a little, i dont feel like the camera has any stressful pressure applied to it anywhere. It’s just a tight fit. I can also change it so the 16-80 is on the camera, and this all fits more comfortably, but then i’m stuck with the issue of the separators. They work well, but there isn’t one that goes across the case. So i’ve used the biggest separator and tried to get it around the 16-80. The small gap left over, i’ve put the battery and a cloth (see pic)Why not use the big pocket on the inside of the lid for the battery? It’s stupidly designed. It’s deep, and goes all the way to the hinge of the lid. Just a little deeper than my fingers can go. Meaning anything stuck at the bottom is a pain to get out. If they had split this big pocket in two, or maybe smaller SD card sized sections, it’d have been perfect. As it is, I have my SD cards in the opaque pocket on the outside. Again, not ideal not organised, but at least I can get to them.Both of these large pockets should be redesigned to be useful. They’ll never carry big things like mini tripods, lens etc, but they could be made much more useful for the small things like sd cards, batteries, cloths, filters etcIn terms of overall size, it’s definitely on the right track. It doesnt have so much padding as to be bulky, but does have the balance right between padding and protection. I’ll be using this pack when i go hiking, as it fits nicely into my backpack. The opening system on this pack means I can just unzip it and grab the camera, although the other lens and the battery will be more awkward. That said, having sat on a bus trying to balance a camera, another small bag containing the other lens, and another small accessory bag with sd cards and a battery in, i’m hoping this will at least condense my camera organisationYou can use it as a camera sling bag if you wish, but it is uncomfortable if you the back of the pack sits against the body owing to the lip of the zip sticking out. if you use it as a sling, sit the opaque pocket against the body, it is much more flatI do feel sorry for camera bag designers in one way. Cameras and additional lens are terrible to pack, as they dont sit well next to each other in square or rectangular shapes. The camera bag designer who decides to fit the bag around the equipment, will do really well. I wouldnt mind an odd shaped bag, if all my stuff fit snugly inside it, and it wasn’t full of empty space!"
"Good quality bag. Compact fit for SLR, 85mm, 58mm, 40mm and compact flash. Could really use more dividers as options are limited with the few provided. Has loops for a shoulder strap but no strap is included. Strap kit sold separately for £35 which I think is cheeky. Luckily I have spares of both from other bags."
"Like others, I had not properly done my homework with this case. I am a newbie amateur photographer and wanted something small and light to start off with for my DSLR and 3 lenses. This is a good small bag which is easy to get in and out of but i had assumed that it would come with a strap. If you want to buy the official Lowepro strap which is designed (as a standalone) item for this bag then you need to spend another approx. £40 on the strap. I would have been better off buying one of the smaller rucksacks or carry bags which actually come with a strap. I do not understand why Lowepro don't sell it with the strap and just hike the price up a littler but then £70-£80 for this bag with strap would put most buyers off so I guess its just  marketing."
Not the order I wanted to small
I was looking for a compact case for my canon DSLR camera. this is not suitable for this purpose
"On the camera side of bag, it's to tight to zip up.  My digital camera is a Sony a6100 on small side, so a larger camera will be problematic."
"The bag is really nice, but the way they purposefully cut off the title to make it seem like a tripod was included ticks me off. Label things clearly!!!"
"Padding, Velcro adaptive dividers, enough extra pockets: all okay.  I'm not using it for a camera.  Definitely worth the $ I paid for it."
"I purchased this to use on my 2 week vacation with my Sony a7iii and a couple lenses.In less than one week of daily use, the shoulder strap pad began to split at the seams. That is pretty terrible considering I used it only 5-6 days at the time of breakage.The firmness, padding and shape retention of the bag is alright, though it could be much better in all those categories. The dividers were nice and made organization easy along with all the pockets.You get what you pay for in this case though, don't expect much from a $26 bag that holds your expensive equipment.Heed Amazon's ""frequently returned"" warning"
"This bag does not have enough padding – I had to purchase an entirely separate unit to fit inside it, which was an additional $30 in order to adequately protect my camera. I will update my review once I find out if it’s actually waterproof. The zipper looks like it does not connect properly, which means it would not be. I’m not sure. I trust my expensive camera equipment in this bag."
There's not enough padding for securely storing camcorder
"The TAAOKA Camera Sling Bag can carry the Fujifilm X-T5 with the 16-80mm zoom lense mounted and another lense, and it's exactly what I was looking for.  After leaving the equipment in the bag for a few days, without actually carrying outdoor, or actually being used, I notice that the camera and lens had a lot of lint shred from the lining material.  Even after blowing the specs of lint for the camera and lens and put back into the bag, more lint appeared on the equipment.  I'm sure eventually the specs of will make its way into the lens and camera.  After some hesitation, I ended up returning it.  My suggestion to manufacture of this bag is that nylon lining material should be considered, rather than using the linty material for the lining."
Average camera bag. I would recommend spending a little more on a higher quality camera bag. Its certainly not waterproof. Got caught rain and my camera and lenses still got wet. I would not recommend.
"The latch isn't very strong, when I bent down with it with the latch sitting in the front, it released, dropping the bag to the ground. Not a great thing for a camera bag full of pricey equipment to do. I was going to return it but I missed my window.Also, the strap would slowly loosen, requiring regular re-cinching, also not a great thing for a camera bag.Such a shame. Being able to put it on around the waist with the bag resting along the back like that really frees up movement and let's you get down low without a bag swinging down in the way or having it sit uncomfortably across the chest, which as a woman can be very unpleasant after awhile. Course, only helpful if it doesn't pop loose.Edit: the zipper also pops apart really easily so it is difficult to keep closed when full of gear."
I loved it .. until the zipper broke within a month.
"I love the color but that's all I can say that I love about this bag. It's a throw over your shoulder bag, will hold camera with one lens attached and can only put one more lens in the bag without touching your camera. I'm very disappointed in it, going to keep it a couple of days to truly give it a chance, but at this point I am seriously thinking of returning it. Not working for what I want out of it. There will be no room for my long range lens and I definitely want that lens in my camera bag."
Looks like a light light beige in the photo but in real life it’s more of a blush/pink.
"Feels flimsy,  not enough support or padding in the bottom for my camera."
"Unfortunately ripped at the base of strap with the weight of 1 camera body a 50mm lens and a 70-300mm lens. Also, shoulder strap is not padded (the picture looks like it is) so keep that in mind for comfort."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I received the bag for the camera bag but unfortunately, I did not receive the tripod that is supposed to be with it. I’m not sure if there’s a way to just send me the tripod?"
"The bag is thin and not well padded.I dropped the bag on my first outing and split my kit lens from my Canon R7 near the mount. I added more padding from another camera bag because I was concerned before leaving and it still wasn’t enough to protect my gear.The dividers aren’t as sturdy as the Peak Design style they attempted to clone. I’m also finding the mesh panel on the back is beginning to fray after walking a few miles. The lack of structure can make the main compartment difficult to zipper too.It might be fine for a point and shoot or mirrorless with a very short lens, but I’d look elsewhere."
The way the image advertises I expected tripod to be included for the larger price. There was no tripod!!
"Super thin material, offers no protection for your camera or lenses."
Very inconvenient
Cheap in every aspect
This is a 2.5-star bag. While the setup and layout are great for carrying gear the quality of the bag is poor.The zippers feel cheap the material is thin and the bag lacks adequate protection.This one only houses my filters as I wouldn't want to put my actual camera in it.
"Wow, seems like the perfect design for those wishing to be mugged in a crowded place and have your gear stolen. What an innovation, no one thought about a quick release strap before!"
I knew it wasn't a hard case but the impression o got was there was a bit more of a rigid structure. There's not. Even the dividers are very bendy
Doesn't feel very padded and the internal structure isn't helpful. I guess if you have only a little to spend it would have to do.
"Nice bag, and it will work for a while, but it is smaller than the pictures depicted.  I only needed a bag large enough for a Nikon and a lens, and it is still a tight fit"
It's fine just a little small for my needs
No where close to being big enough not like what is pictured at all
"I’m giving the BAGSMART Small Camera Bag 1 star because it arrived in a sealed package, yet the strap was covered in dirt. This is unacceptable for a brand-new item, especially one that’s supposed to protect expensive camera equipment. While the design and features looked promising, the condition it arrived in made it unusable right out of the box. I expected better quality control from a brand like BAGSMART. Very disappointed."
My bag was supposed to have a tripod with it and it did not have it. The box looked like it was pried open on the top about 4 inches back and the tripod was missing.
Bag came with a rip on the side seam.
Could barely fit Nikon D7100 with 145 lens and additional 300 lens
I've now had to have my wife sew the seems more than once.  Not acceptable for a camera bag to have that problem.
This product does not come with a camera tripod device in the shipment
This bag is ridiculously small. It would barely hold the body (no lens) of my dslr and certainly nothing else.  A total waste of my time.
"Although it is very light weight, that comes at a lack of strength and support for your gear. Not sure how well it would protect your camera and lenses if it was knocked around or dropped, and I don’t want to find out."
"It does what it needs to do but I wish it had a zipper or a more reliable clasp. It’s too easy to come undone and for the camera to fall out. I would suggest another product since it’s such expensive equipment.On the other hand it is very cute and nothing has actually fallen out yet, just be careful."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Color in actual is darker than the photo. There’s lots of lints on the fabric like it’s old
Make sure you check your camera gear measurements against the bags as I could only fit my Nikon D7000 body and daily use lens if they were unassembled. If you are using an 18-55mm or short fixed lens it would do well.
this bag is made really well and should protect your camera unless...... you turn it upside down.  The top cover just barely fits so you need to manually stretch it over the opening.  Not a big deal but it should have been designed better....that's my only complaint.  It should last forever as it is a heavy canvas.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It’s a bag. You can put a camera in it. Inside is flexible so if your worried about inside dimensions it stretches. The material for the inside is a sort of microfiber soft fabric, that has little fabric hairs on it coming off. For DSLR cameras I’d be careful, I don’t want those little hairs on my lenses or in my camera. I don’t want to be blowing little fibers off my camera every time I take out my camera. I’m sure it’s fine and I’m overthinking it. But I’ll be looking for another bag one that isn’t of a fabric material inside. Other then that, it works. Will keep it but I’m just worried about those little hairs."
"It's a fine bag, except the MAIN ENCLOSURE DOES NOT HAVE A ZIPPER. It's only secured with a single magnetic strap. To store your potentially thousands of dollars camera & lens. It's pretty mind boggling.It's my fault of course. If I had more carefully read the description and looked at the images, I would've probably realized this, but I've never encountered a bag without a secure enclosure and this is such a fundamental part of a camera bag, I would expect it to be spelled out more clearly.If you just want to daintily carry around your camera indoors, then this bag is fine. It looks good, the materials seem good, there is padding, and there is space for your camera and 2 lenses. But unfortunately real life happens. It would worry me if I have to do any shooting outside, or travel and have to put the camera in my car or plane, or any activity where there's a remote possibility of it tipping over or dropping."
Bought a used one. The strip and the rain cover are missing.
"This bag is top-heavy and unstable. Upon picking it up, the bag tips sideways, and if the clasp is not done, everything falls out. The ONLY thing holding your camera in is a tiny magnet, NO ZIPPER. I found this out in a parking garage when I went to pick up my bag and the flimsy magnetic clasp came undone. My brand new camera fell out, cracking the screen completely. It will be $300 to fix the camera, which is not even worth it to me. This bag is not for professional use."
I love the look of this bag and it’s functionality. But the one I received was definitely a returned item. It had someone else’s camera accessories still in it and missing the shoulder strap. I missed the return window and am now stuck with a bag I have to carry in my hands.
"This could have easily been a cool bag, but what looks like a buckling strap is really just a magnetic snap, and one that easily comes undone. I've had it come undone just sitting the bag down in the car gently. no zipper or anything else, and even if the magnet holds, the corners of the top lift so things can come out easily. If I could have cinched it, it would allow my camera to be way more secure, and nothing falls out (which, I have lost my charger due to it).Everything else about the bag is well made, and would have easily been 5 stars if the strap was different."
This bag looks pretty durable but I don’t like the buckle connectivity with the magnet. It doesn’t seem secure. I would rather have a zipper. The material is nice and it’s VERY spacious. But the bottom never seems to sit flat either when placed. And it’s also awkward to quickly grab and put on. I think the design could use some work. But overall looks okay just not for me. I did enjoy the space it offered for my larger lens collection.
"Like shape and color ,  but wish large flap inside would close better."
This canvas bag has lots of room and looks very well made. However I’m returning it and giving it 3?stars because the faux leather straps make it look cheap to me.
"Pros - Fairly good product. Lots of cushion for your gear and the adjustable dividers and outer pockets are nice.Cons - Top closure doesn't fit/lay nicely when closed so feels a bit insecure and flimsy. Pockets are a tight fit, especially the back one. Swivel strap-to-bag connections can be annoying, would be better if it was just fixed in place.Summary - Decent economy camera bag if you are just starting out and want something that looks super chic and is still fairly serviceable."
The main closure (only closure) on the top depends on a weak magnet.  I would not trust an expensive camera in it during travel.  I returned it!
"I like the look of this bag a lot. I also should have ordered a larger size as it barely fits my canon r6 and one small lens + battery charger. I make it work as I like the portability. I do not like the magnetic closure, however, as it can open unexpectedly when the bag it being used."
"This bag is just okay. The interior is actually very nice, but the exterior is pretty low quality. It also, as other reviewers have mentioned, could benefit from a little more padding on the bottom of the bag. I don't feel particularly confident putting my NIkon Z5 in there and carting it around. I'm very likely going to return it as it just does not seem to be a good fit for my needs, and I don't want to risk damaging my equipment."
I ended up returning this bag it was quite a bit larger than I expected
The bag is really beautiful and WELL MADE!  But his single lock is in the center of the bag and already on my first exit with him from the house .. I drove in the car and when I arrived and wanted to get up from the seat .. the camera fell out of the bag from one if the sides .. luckily it dropped on the seat and no damage was done.I opened the box and used the bag so I will keep it as a bag for everyday use but as a camera bag it is not reliable for me and I'll have to buy another bag.
Too small - thought it would be larger!
"Nice looking bag  but it only closes with one magnetic strap….my camera and lens have fallen out of the bag on a couple of occasions…..that’s almost $500 worth of equipment!!! The bag was made for my camera so it’s not like it was too much equipment for the bag. Unfortunately, the 30 day return period has just passed so I’m struck with the bag ……I ordered a camera backpack this past weekend, hopefully that will work better!!"
"looks like something that was meant to be a camera bag , but is not  . wont close correctly .VERY FLIMSY, but looks like a bag"
Nice camera bag but wish I would have bought one with a handle grip on top . It does have nice shoulder strap.
Arrived on time. Picture looks bigger than the bag is. Too small for my needs.
"It’s fashionable but difficult to close. The top flap wraps around, but because it’s made of relatively soft fabric, it doesn’t always close properly. And when the top flap doesn’t close probably, it’s more difficult for the magnet closure to stick."
The grey looks like faded maroon.
"Smaller than I imagined. Thin canvas material.  Not padded.  Looks nice, but too small for a big Canon camera.  Barely fits."
"I wish it had a zipper. If you pick it up wrong,  it comes unsnapped and the camera can fall out."
"I really wanted this to be the bag for my new Fuji camera. It's organized nicely. It looks great. It's the right size for my camera and a few accessories.The first time I took it out, the camera fell out of the bag because the magnetic snap came undone. After the 3 foot fall, my week old camera landed on its back and bounced off the concrete driveway. It still turns on, and seems okay, but now I need it inspected. Not happy.I'm returning the bag."
"Looks good, and is descent, but the flap closure hood isn't form-fitted and every time you button it shut, you have to mess with the edges of it to make sure it's actually over the compartments to cover your gear. Get what you pay for."
Could fit several cameras
It holds the camera and a spare lens.
Not a trendy design as shown in the picture..
The bag was not as described. The waterproofing was a plastic cover to protect the bag during rain. Quickly returned bag.
"The manufacturer’s support phone number wasn’t working, and the website link led to an ERROR 404 page. I like the bag a lot , but there is not a buckle, and there is no way for my bag to close. The camera could fall out. Please contact me."
"This bag was suggested for purchase and I should have looked more into it. There is no zipper on the top/lid so it closes by use of a button magnet....not good as things can slip out from your bag. Also, its very small and doens't hold any secondary gear. Great bag if that stuff doesn't matter. The bag itself is nice quality---just not big enough for me."
Overall its not bad but its just too small. Its super stylish but need to be more practical
Ordered the black camera bag and I dont know how this was confused for black. It's a denim navy material and there's even a black strap on the back to make you aware of the difference. The inside lining is even blue.
"I got this camera bag for my wife but when she opened it, we discovered there were pieces missing. It didn’t come with a strap, the dividers, or the rain cover."
doesn't close easily and camera can fall out.  It looks good though. don't buy
"Missing the strap when it arrived, I tried to return but I forgot and time ran out :("

Supposed to be green but it is definitely brown
"I returned this bag because I found it too difficult to get in and out quickly. Opening and closing takes too much time and is a hassle. it is beautiful, just not functional for me."
hardly used . stitching coming undone.
Not big enough for any acccessories.
Case showed to be bigger but it wasn't.  Great color  and sturdy  just not big enough
"This camera bag is cute, but not the most comfortable to carry your gear around in. The strap is just a regular old purse strap, and not padded at all, making it uncomfortable if you have any amount of heavy camera equipment in the bag. I thought the hardware was kind of flimsy too. The hooks that fasten the strap to the bag are very small and thin. The zippers are thin too. It would be a good bag for smaller cameras, or when you only need to carry a little bit of gear. I unfortunately don't feel super secure using it for anything that heavy at all."
"I am a great fan of K&F so expected this to be the equal of ny other product I have from them, sadly this isn't the case.I already have a K&F sling and this is as far from that as can be, to call it a sling is misleading as it is nothing more than a small camera bag, the kind you can pick up here on Amazon unbranded and cheap.It isn't a bad bag per se, but it doesn't stand out in any way, size is a bit odd and is struggles to fit my Fuji X-Pro without a lot of jiggling, as an example, if I place my iPhone 15 Pro Max in end first the top of the phone protrudes above the zipper.For now I may use it for a drone, though it really doesn't have the space to carry any spare batteries.A very mixed bag!"
"Here we have a camera bag in pink.It comes wrapped in a plastic bag.The bag itself is quite basic, it has two pockets, one zipped compartment, and the main compartment. So it won't hold a huge amount, but if you're just travelling, this is more than enough for you.There's padding in all sides which isn't very thick, but it's certainly better than nothing!The main disappointment with this bag is that the strap feels cheap and rough, and doesn't match the rest of the bag."
"I liked the price, looks, choices of color, doesn't scream camera bag, various pockets.  I did not like the small size delegated to camera equipment.  Only fits one DSLR camera, 70200 f2.8, and 2470mm lens. No room for other lens without jamming it in.  I will be returning it. It was one of 5 bags recommended for photography, I just have too much stuff I need to carry."
"I bought it because I was taking a trip across country and didn’t want to check my expensive camera equipment on the plane and I needed something that could carry my camera plus some other items for some overnight travel to NYC. This bag didn’t feel bulky or anything either!Now while it fits everything I wanted it to in terms of camera/camera equipment, it almost didn’t fit my canon 6d mark ii with its battery grip on it. It made things slightly inconvenient since I couldn’t just pull out the camera on its side pocket, but I could at least, get it in and out of the bag from the front.One of the things I did love about this bad was the laptop side of it. I liked that I could fit my MacBook in the pocket designed for a laptop easily and I didn’t have to worry about whether or not it was gonna break or anything. I felt very comfortable with it in the bag. The only thing I will say is, is when you have the laptop in it, and even with your camera equipment out of the bag, the bag feels very heavy, at least to me.I do a lot of walking and heavy lifting as a full time photographer, and I’ve had tons of different camera bags over the years, but having the laptop in the bag made my back HURT after a short period of time. Now, this could be no fault of the bag itself, but I’ve never really had an issue before.Another little thing is, I wish the buckle could’ve been made to go a little further. If you have anything that’s just slightly bulging at the top of the bag, you can’t click it closed because it won’t reach.Overall though, I think it’s a decent bag, and everything felt secure in its place and I’d definitely use it again."
"I've used this a multiple long trips where it was my main carry bag for camera gear and whatever else would fit in it. As far as space, it's fantastic. Camera, lenses, batteries, tablet, wallet, souvenirs I buy along the way that for in the top pouch, side pouches for drinks or tripod, locking clips...all great.There are 2 main cons that have me looking for a different bag. 1) the magnetic belt strap is not reliable at all. It's flimsy, comes undone, can be tough to clip when you're trying to get going in a hurry, comes unbuckled. 2) The worst thing with this bag is accessing your camera or lens. You can even see by the product pictures, it's way too difficult to access things in the small space and put things away."
Fine bag.  has held up for six months.  The main drawback for me us that The top compartment has a drawstring closure and then a flap that secures with a magnetic buckle. That magnetic buckle is worthless and falls off pretty often. I did find that can keep everything pretty secure by just putting an extra loop in the drawstring  and connecting it to the side security hooks.
"The bag seems to be well made overall, but I wanted a waterproof bag like it says in the description, but the rain cover leads me to believe it isn’t waterproof. It is bit hard to configure due to the Velcro grabbing everything. I don’t like that the camera sit below the storage compartment. It limits what can be carried or the camera could be damaged. The camera area needs more rigidity to protect the camera better. The flexibility to use as a laptop bag is nice."
"** I would have given it a 4 star if it wasn't for the missing parts in the first shipment **The camera backpack looks and feels rugged and functional. There really is NOT (revised on 10/13) enough room to store my DSLR plus a 500mm lens and additional lenses in the camera compartment. The bottom padding is bit on the thin side in my opinion. The issue I had was that the dividers and the rain cover were missing in the package. I am returning it for an exchange. I will update this review once I receive the replacement.(Update 10/13/2019)Amazon/Seller shipped a replacement immediate upon request. This time, all parts were included.Pro:-- Extra space on the top for storage for accessories or clothing.-- A side pocket with a strap for tripods (I wish there two straps- one on top and one in the middle).-- Many dividers for different configuration.-- Rain hood.-- Light weight.-- Separate compartment for a laptop or tablet.-- Anti-theft clip and zippers with locking provision.Con:-- There really isn't enough space for a 500mm lens that is attached to the camera as shown in the picture.-- The long dividers, in my opinion, should be a bit shorter. They make the camera space too tight to put and pull the camera out without some struggle.-- The camera compartment opening can be a bit bigger, so it is not a struggle to store and remove the camera. (Maybe this is done on purpose, so the camera is very secure and difficult for a thief to remove the camera.)-- Not enough internal pockets. It would have been great if there is one more big pocket on the top side of the bag.-- The top handle is not padded. It  It would have been better if it is padded which will be easier on the hand with heavy equipment."
"I feel like a grouch writing this review. I didn't even have high expectations when I ordered it, to be honest.For a hybrid camera bag, this design seems like a good idea. Kind of like a diaper bag, which I had not long ago for my kids, but inserting a camera cube in the bottom compartment. Great idea!But here's what I didn't like-The material feels rigid and it is heavy. At over 2lbs for the bag alone, it's too heavy to use when adding all the camera gear-The straps are not comfortable, especially when all the gear is added-The magnetic lock takes way more time than I have patience for. I just want to flip the lid open and closed, not fiddle with a small leather strap holding an even smaller magnet and trying to align it to a metal base-Not enough organization for everyday essentials, such as wallets, keys, pens, papers, etc.-Did I mention it's heavy and uncomfortable?Sadly, my search goes on for a camera bag that suits my needs."
"There were a few redeeming features. The convenience of the top pouch and side camera access were pluses. However, the adjustable straps kept slipping, requiring constant readjustment. The bag was bulky and heavy, and just not comfortable to carry."
I can say it’s decently durable BUT the straps keep coming all the way out of their adjuster which is very inconvenient when trying to move quickly through an airport. It does stow decently under a plane seat in a delta flight so that’s a win. The strap padding is seriously lacking for hikes and honestly feels very narrow. I like the bag but am still looking for a new bag if that makes sense. Oh a final win is the luggage strap mid back. That was a handy feature.
"I thought this would be a great backpack for traveling with my camera. It works ok. The top pocket is frustrating as it has to be unclipped and the draw string opened up to get in the pocket. Then if you don’t close the draw string back stuff falls out. After carrying for a few days I realized how fat and uncomfortable the straps are on your shoulders. Not painful/digging, just restrictive. Balance is not right either, the weight when loaded with a dslr, 2 lens, and small laptop forces the bottom part that sits against your back to press into your back while the shoulder area gaps from your low back. Never used the quick access panel on the side (again thought this would be useful…it was not."
Did not fit all of my equipment securely and not as easily accessible as it looks. it was more of a hassle trying to get things in and out when traveling. love the look but found it challenging to use effectively.
"Honestly, not a fan. The bag took a lot of steaming to get it shaped to where it would stand up and unless you have it stuffed full, it still lacks some structure. I put my camera (Canon R7) it in, and no matter how I maneuver the padding strips, the camera is not secure. I don't feel like my camera is safe in the bag and will be returning."
"Went on a trip for 4 days and the durability of the backpack was topnotch. However, there were some few things that bothered me:1. The top latch (magnet) is not strong enough to withstand some force. The more items you have on the top compartment, the easier it is for the latch to reopen.2. The only thing that is keeping the top compartment secured is the cord fastener. You'll need to make another knot after you tighten it to keep the items from falling out during accidents.3. The only thing that keeps the top compartment in place from the bottom was a big divider that you can remove. I believe this can be a pro and a con. Little accessories can fall onto the camera section if the divider is not placed correctly.4. There is a security lock on the side entrance, but no security lock on the main opening for the camera. I just ended up using a TSA approved locks."
"So I've liked aspects of this bag for a bit but the cons certianly seem to outweigh the goods. It's sturdy made and everything feels decently premium but the camera carrying part is pretty tight and it's hard to get to things and take them out reliably when some of the side compartments are squished on the sides of it. The top it's just one zipper compartment and a giant open area, it fits my steam controller, wireless mouse, charger and headphones and well as some other peripherals and that's about it, the zipper pouch has an HDMI adapter and USB cable to connect. The laptop portion is pretty standard socno real complaints there. The one thing I really like is the side compartments for easily getting to my camera, I only have one real lens so there is no real setup so it's nice to have ease of access.Unfortunately the bad parts are the tripod holder on the side is one strap and it's SUPPOSED to fit into an elastic bottle style holder on the bottom, not only does that make it jut out on the side soci have to be more mindful when walking in crowded spaces but it barely fits in that little holder all folded up, bottom straps would have been easier and less inconvenient. The other MAJOR flaw is if I want to get to the top compartment to get out peripherals I either have to hold it up straight or secure it against a wall because the bottom was build slanted for what ever god awful reason so it doesn't stand up on its own it just falls over every single time. It's a compete deal breaker to have to fight the thing just got get stuff out of the top, everything takes twice as long because of it and it's awful. Why would you make it slanted? It makes no sense."
Not really a fan. Color is a lot darker in person than it shows in the picture. More of a darker camel than beige. Just not really what I was looking for.
"It isn’t big enough to hold more than one camera body and two lenses without flopping everywhere, and the adjustable panels aren’t even close to strong enough to hold those in place. The panels don’t hold at all so when you carry it around for a little while then open it, everything has fallen around everywhere. You can’t store anything it advertises in the top panel like clothes or quick access items bc they’ll fall through to your equipment. It definitely is not made for storing *anything* there and I’m guessing that’s why they’re saying to put something light like clothes in it - you definitely can’t put your wallet or keys or any practical items you may actually need there. (And unless your wallet is tiny it won’t fit in the anti theft pocket as advertised.) The pockets on the sides are also super small and shallow, the water bottle I managed to cram in there I couldn’t fill up all the way or it would topple out. I also don’t understand the random buckle on the front that literally does nothing, but should function as an actual strap and be able to tighten - it’s for show and just clips to the front. The overall quality of the bag is pretty good so I’m confused why the inserts are so bad. I am VERY disappointed."
"I was excited to buy this backpack to make it easy and have safe storage to travel with my camera and my computer.  When it came in, it looked great and appears to be well-made; however, it does not hold as big of a laptop as it states.  I measured my laptop prior to ordering and should have fit but the sleeve for the laptop on the back of the backpack is way too small.  I had to put the laptop in the backpack main compartment which then made me have to reconfigure how my camera and lens would fit in the front part.  I was able to make it work but was disappointed it did not hold as it states on the description.  I would return but there isn’t really another backpack with the same compartments and features so just made it work.  If you have a smaller laptop than the description, then definitely a  great find for you but anything close to the higher size in the description should just be prepared for it not to work as shown."
"It would have been a great bag but you can only lock one zipper at a time.  I would have tested out the bag but once i realized this, i put it right back in the box and returned it.  Its a really ridiculous desgin because there are two zippered pockets on the outside of the bag that lead right into the main compartment.  If one zipper is locked, the other isn't and someone can reach right in and grab your stuff.  Couldn't risk that because I go to NYC with my camera."
"There are two competing purposes of a backpack.  One is to attractively hold everything while transiting through airports, and the other is to be comfortable and accessible while walking around town.  This is more for the former.  I'm seeking one that does both.  Back it goes. (To be fair, I was hoping it would exceed the product description or I would adapt. It is pretty much just what they describe.)Very well cushioned, but not sturdy (will flop over).Good size, but not enough individual pockets. (Not a problem for those with purses.)It has a tripod holder, but really only for short tripods.It's too deep (lenses roll front to back).I wore it for five minutes, without a laptop, and the bottom edge immediately began pressing against my lower back.I cannot figure out how to snap it shut with just two hands. If you have a floor, chair or table, yes."
"Was happy to find a bag that seemed to fit all my needs: secure, durable, not too large, adjustable space to fit changing gear needs.... I currently have the bag with my on a field work trip abroad and for the most part the bag has done well. However, today I noticed that the inner part of the ""computer sleeve"" part of the bag (behind the straps) is starting to come apart at the top seam. I have not been using the bag to transport my laptop on a daily basis (mostly using it to carry a clipboard), so not sure why it should be wearing down so fast. Rest of the bag is working great, but feel like there should be some reinforcement in this part of the bag since it carries the bulk of the weight (aka it's also where the seams of the straps are located too)."
"From the Amazon description, I expected this bag to have outside compartments in which to stash things outside of the main compartment in which the camera body is stored. This is not the case. Every zipper opens to the main compartment that holds the camera. There are small pockets inside in which to store accessories. But I wanted outside compartments to hold things like my keys and wallet that I could access without exposing the camera.Otherwise, this is a beautifully made bag. Very durable material with quality hardware and straps. Water bottle pockets on each side. It does come with a rain cover. I wish I could have made it work for me but my search continues."
"I really like the organization on this bag but the gold ring of the snap broke on the first day of my trip. Luckily the drawstring is the real workhorse holding everything in the top compartment but still disappointing.Updated on day 2 of this trip: okay the snap has completely pulled out of the body of the bag and is attached to the snap on the flap. If it were not my only backpack available on this trip, I would throw it away I am so unsatisfied. I would like my money back."
"This backpack was a decent bag when i first got it. I got it for the separate compartment for other stuff other then photography stuff. I have been using this for about 5 months now and need to replace it already. The draw string the fraying and will break off any day now. The button that closes the top part, I got sand in it and it is forever ruined. So  i wish there was  real buckle instead of a magnetic button. No waist strap, and hiking 7 days  a week, this is becoming an issue with my back. The back pocket is just too small for a laptop, so i end up putting books back there. comfy pack, with lots of padding in the back and the straps. But needs replacing after 5 months of HEAVY use."
"I like this bag, but the strap is just decorative. It doesn't really have a buckle, and the strap is only held by a magnet. It's a huge design flaw. Anyone can open it effortlessly. I'm thinking of some ways to fix or modify it."
"Bought it for a trip to carry my camera safely, worked well. When I got home, I started to use it as a daily backpack and in ~2 weeks, it started to break here and there. The strap adjustments stopped working, as in they kept falling out and the bag would sit super low. The leather clasp broke as well, just snapped in half. I didn't really close it much because of the tightening feature but you get what you pay for. All over an ok bag, would look other places if you intend on using it often."
"I don’t know why it takes forever to pick a camera bag, anybody else feel the same way? I decided on this one after looking for several weeks. I needed enough space for at least 2 lenses and other gear, but also one that wasn’t so big that would be unpleasant to bring around. I am petite, 5’2” and I only saw tall people’s pictures. So this is the right amount of “big” for me. Put a 24-70mm and Sony alpha camera. I like the Zipper style because on the regular camera bags the zipper goes all the way around the bag and things can fall out. Especially when I go to the airport, and TSA wants to look inside my bag, they open it upright when it needs to be laid flat. Side zipper a plus and upper compartment great for other things I need to bring i.e. the baby’s bottle and formula. I like the small SD Card pockets.  I will use it as I travel and see how it holds up durability-wise.Update: Top part has slowly ripped off after barely any use. Not durable. I want my money back."
"I didn't realize this was a DIY backpack. It can with several pieces of material with velcro, multiple sizes. You're supposed to design the interior you want. I had trouble getting the velcro to work the way I wanted it layed out. Also the top compartment and camera compartment arent completely separated,  so things can falk down into the camera area."
"I thought I was going to love this.  I wanted something to hold my camera gear and keep it safe on a recent trip to Ireland.  I packed it at home with small camera body, 1 short light lens, 1 zoom lens, snacks and meds at the top, water bottle on the side.  Felt like it was going to work but two hours into wearing it around customs I had a major bruise on my shoulder and the straps were too wide to be comfortable.  I ended up nixing the bag and carrying my camera around my neck and my purse on the tour.  Waist of money.  I ordered it too early and now I cannot return it."
"I tried this bag, and yes it says the top of for personal items but that lost space really makes the bag pretty small if you have more than 1 lens or want to carry a flash or any extras.  Plus the top pouch isn't truly separate, you have to place a divider and hope nothing gets past it and falls out."
"I like the bag. It's comfortable, stylish, and fits a lot. After a couple weeks of using it, I had the bag on the floor with the top open. I needed to move it quickly to the side so grabbed the nylon at the top. It ripped very easily at the seam. I was super disappointed by this, and am worried that this will rip further and ruin the use of the bag.If not for this, I would be super satisfied! But for the cost this shouldn't have happened so easily."
Honestly I loved this bad at first! It has a lot of space and storage but the top is a draw string too and the ball they use to tighten the string is cheap as well as snot having a solid end to the other side…so unfortunately the string came out and the top part of the bag is unusable. Even with it snapped closed (doesn’t stay well) I have stuff falling out of the top (my flash!!) so I am unable to use half the bag. This happened after about 3 months of use. Definitely not worth the money! Save up and buy something nicer.
"I carry over $5,000 worth of camera equipment in my bag. This bag is not very padded and the zipper is falling apart as well as the back pocket which is hardly used… which is already ripping… I’d say invest in a real bag for camera and lenses. I used it for travel and had to get a new bag. Like previous reviews not much room for anything other than camera and a lens. Back pocket was used for papers. Nice looking bag that’s all."
"Bummed because this looked nice, even though it's kind of bulky and biggish. I put my camera gear in for a roadrip, and while it worked, it has already started ripping. Unfortunately my return window closed 2 days ago. :(Also important to note, you cannot lock this bag, if that's something you'd be interested in doing. Even if you secure the zippers with a lock, the top can be accessed."
"I have tried to find out if the damaged waterproof cover can be replaced, but no one at bagsmart is responding to my email enquiries.  The cover has many holes in it, it looks like it has been stored for a long time and the cover is degrading."
"Incredibly disappointed by all the positive reviews. This bag is flimsy and small, not suitable for anything more than just a camera bag. Don't waste your money, just use a camera bag.I bought this bag for school-- to hold my camera IN ADDITION TO my books, laptop, and personal items. It's very hard to find a backpack for these purposes, and my previous one was falling apart, so I was excited to try this one based on the positive reviews and nice aesthetic. Unfortunately, the package was damaged when I received it and the backpack itself was poorly designed. There is no built in camera compartment, you have to build it yourself with the flimsy pieces provided. If you have ever had a customizable camera bag, you would be familiar with these pieces-- they cannot hold much weight so that makes the ""above-camera-compartment"" basically useless. The laptop compartment is pretty useless too; it's basically just a small laptop case sewn onto the backpack. There's also almost no extra little pockets to hold accessories like an external hard drive, fishing wire, memory cards, clothes pins, or anything you would use as a professional photographer.Once again, this is basically just a big poorly designed camera case, as opposed to a backpack."
"I was hoping for a more brown looking bag like in the photos, not a light tan with orange looking strap... Quality is okay, nice thick material and fits all my essentials to shoot on the go"
"I had high hopes for this bag when I first received it. I thought it was a very smart looking bag and has just about all the right pocket functions for acting as a camera bag and small backpack and can be pretty flexible with the use of space in the main compartment.  The way that the side zipper compartment flips up rather than down/out when the backpack is on its back was awkward from the start -- but that's probably much more just a personal preference than true fault.However, what killed it for me and why I don't think that I could recommend any bag from this maker is that the cinch-sack compartment on the top tore after just 2 weeks of average use 3 to 4 days a week. It's subjective of course, but I don't think I was rough with this bag at all. I wasn't trying to overstuff it or anything, just cinching up a change of clothes and the very light material of the cinch sack started to tear away from the much heftier main bag material. Very disappointing."
This is how my package was delivered to my house overall the bag is nice and it holds all of my stuff
"Due to the pandemic we weren’t able to put this to use until recently. It is a great bag with smart features. It was great during our two week trip to Hawaii. Unfortunately, it had started to fall apart by the time we came home. Fabric around the drawstring closure has begun to tear. Sadly, I am sure they will say it is out of warranty, but this was the first time it had been used. Not good quality!"
Could be better. Not worth the money I spent. Found another camera bag for half the price and more useful.
As another reviewer mentioned it keeps tipping over when you stand it up. This backpack must be set flat on it's back. It is not convenient for me to have it tip over when you put it down. The color and fabric are beautiful. It had to go back.
"I REALLY liked this bag. Great design and fit my 15.6 MacBook Pro plus Canon 5D Mark IV with 2.8/70-200 lens attached plus lots of extras. However, the top compartment ripped after only a couple weeks of use. That material is very thin. :("
"The bag is designed by the clueless - waste  of money - had to buy a real bag to protect your gear - the most important piece of any bag is it's latch to keep stuff in and easy to access and feel secure - this bag has a pathetic tiny magnet on the front strap keeping the top of the case ""secure"". IF you can hit the mini socket with the mini magnet it's supposed to insert - after much fooling around with the tiny magnet on the end of a floppy strap, you still need to find the hole and as far as keeping anything in the top compartment in case it takes a tumble , there might as well be nothing there, no latch, no security - WORTHLESS -"
I like I can bring a set of clothes with me. But the bag quickly became shapeless and unable to hold anything in place. I have open the camera area to have lens falling out.
This bag is very basic. It looks nice. But doesn’t really hold a bunch of gear. But the compartments are difficult to arrange. It works for now.
I found it to be too small for my camera equipment
"Backpack did not live to my expectations. Unfortunately for me I used it for travel with my cameras, drone, and sometimes extra room for a speaker.I read great reviews from photographers who carry most of their gear, which was the reason I got it. This bag is made of decent material (doesn’t get dirty outside) and has pouches to keep things in place. Not a fan that opening in the front is small to access equipment and that you can easily damage anything at the bottom (learned the hard way). For the price tag this bag does not offer good value. As you can tell from the picture it broke after 3 months of use with consistent light travels to photoshoots."
Ehh hard to get camera and lenses to fit. Snap does not snap well lock? No LockSemi suck
The backpack is gorgeous but the compartment for  the equipment doesn’t hold. My lens and camera always end up rolled around in it
"I love the idea of a backpack. However, this one is bulky and falls over when you stand it up. Nice looking bag though."
"While this pack looks secure, the strap that is shown coming over the top - which makes it look as if the contents of the pack are well secured - is held in place by a magnet; making the strap little more than decorative.The inside of the pack is well designed with a side zipper for easy access to the camera. This is why I rated it two stars instead of one."
"Cheap material used for the ‘walls’. Not many extra pockets. For the price you can definitely find a better bag, but it’s still a good choice"
Bag was a little smaller than initially anticipated.
L shelf should be 2 but I only got 1
When you see this bag advertised it shows dividers for your camera equipment but when it showed up it had nothing in it. No padding or anything. It was definitely false advertising & I made them give me my money back without returning the bag. Why should I have to be put out anymore because of their incompetence?
The closure mechanism for the top compartment is completely inadequate! The magnet system for the strap does not keep the bag closed or secure!
Back pocket ripping after 4 months.
I like everything about this bag. I’m giving it a super low review because I’ve only had it for 2 months and the liner inside is already ripping and part of the leather material is coming off on the handle at the top of the bag.Works well. Looks good. Not good quality. 🤷🏼‍♀️
I owned this bag for 3 months and have used 4xs. The clasp completely broke off on its own. It will not close and the bag can not be used. The time line to returned has expired. It is made poorly. Do not purchase.
Bag came quickly. Happy with the quality. But was missing the inserts as well has the rain cover. Attempted to contact the seller but have not heard anything back. Camera bag is useless to me without the inserts.
"This bag is looks stylish, the camera part seems sturdy, and it's pretty convenient to use as a camera bag. However, I've had it for under 3 weeks and the top already ripped. It wasn't expensive but it wasn't cheap either and I am pretty bummed it only lasted this long."
It was very upsetting to see that the leather is the wrong color than advertised. It is darker and doesn’t contrast with the bag as shown in the pictures. The leather was also scratched up on the top.Maybe I was just the unlucky one but I spent a lot of money on a bag I wasn’t expecting.Very unhappy customer..
Bag ripped after only a few weeks of light use.
Not ideal for the Nikon Z9 body and a laptop to move around
The bag doesn’t stand up straight on its own. It just falls on its face.
this bag is a huge swing and a miss. why send me a bag with so much space and not enough dividers to make a decent build ? I There’s so much space that I know my gear isn’t even safe in here. This is so annoying. Im sure everyone who left a good review on this laughable product doesnt actually have to do this for a living every single day.
Cute backpack but doesn’t fit a standard 15” laptop as advertised. I have a 15.6” asus and it didn’t fit. Will be returning.
"So disappointed with this bag. The bag was initially great! I loved it. I had a bag that I could have all my camera gear and my laptop together in one place. Unfortunately, the zipper for the laptop compartment died after 93 days of use rendering the bag useless. It is a 15"" MacBook Pro, so I'm not carrying around anything that the bag was not designed to hold. Very disappointed."
Love the design and style just wish it was easier  to get camera out withouth having the lens  loose inside. Littlw complicated
This Camera Bag falls over on itself because of next level cheap construction. The base of the backpack is folded forward & causes the back pack to fall over on itself. I bought this Camera Bag then immediately return it for a full refund.
Just not way I expected the material to be
Had this bag for about two months. Used it twice bad the straps Broke off as I was wearing it at the airport. On my second use. It’s not like I’m hard on my things. What a waste of money
Cool backpack but it has a huge hole in it after only using it one time.
Do not buy this bag. I bought it and it’s a lot cheaper than the images lead you to believe. The bag literally tore in less than 24 hours.
I found this bag has limited storage pockets and is not well designed to securely hold the camera. I ended up sending it back.
Had this for 3 months. The bag part at the top already tore just from pulling the tie tight.
"Customer service is meh, the quality is meh"
Buckle broke off so it won’t close. I’ve used it maybe 3 times
The backpack is horribly lopsided and leans forward regardless of weight distribution. Its unable to stand unless leaning on something. Uncomfortable to wear due to the deformity.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The top part is useless because the button that attaches the strap to tighten it pops right iff with zero effort. Everything falls out and is NOT secured. Poor design😡
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Ripped so easily. I’ve only used it once for a trip I was going on. Wasn’t even heavy.
I didn’t like how bulky the bag was in real life.
Don't waste your money. You get what you pay for apparently. This thing fell apart straight away. Luckily I was within my return window.
This is not convenient if you need to grab your camera quickly also not enough padding to make me feel my camera and lenses are safe.
Buckle fell off while I was wearing it so it’s pretty useless at this point. Waste of money.
What's the point of a buckle when it's a snap button?The whole thing is poorly designed.
"Unsatisfying Experience, At first it seems like its well build but not at all. Not even a month and it already  rip."
Don't buy these bag easy to tear mine just tear open in the first month of purchase
"Big and bulky. Not waterproof unless you put the fly on it, which gets in the way."
"The bag is very stylish, and would be a good fit for someone who is an amateur photographer. If you are a professional, do not waste your time on this bag. Go for a bigger Bagsmart bag. A Canon 5d MarkIV with a battery grip is impossible to get out of the bag, and I’m not sure how an L series 70-200 could fit in this bag unless. Maybe would be better for someone carrying minimal gear."
"Kinda bulky and heavy. Every time I go out and bring my camera and gear, I keep finding myself opting to use a lighter backpack instead."
The fabric was rougher than I expectedIt wouldn’t be comfortable when I wear a tank topI returned it
This product has all the accessibility and the features mentioned in the description. However the outside material and the rose gold that I expected was not that great. This is me comparing this to my north face bag’s materials which could not be appropriate based on the pricing of these item. But just want to let everyone know. It doesn’t look as good as it is in the picture when you get it.
"It’s really front heavy with a laptop and camera equipment.  Doesn’t standup on its own just falls forward. I really like the aesthetic, functionally weight distribution is awkward."
Super cute but it doesn’t fit a sale with just one lens very well.
"Update: the metal enclosure broke on the top compartment broke after a month.I’ve been carrying my DJI drone & 80d in 2 bags for  a year now. Figured it was time upgrade. After DAYS of research I settled on this bag for price & what I thought looked functional. Holy crap it’s legit perfect, way more functional then I expected. Fits my drone, remote, battery packs, my camera & lenses, my laptop and still has room for clothes or random things. Love it for travel! Testing it out in Greece for 3 weeks now! Appreciate all the little pockets."
Wouldn’t be fair to one star just because it was my fault for not reading the dimensions. Bag is way too small for my equipment. If you have bigger equipment it’s probably a better idea to go for a backpack. My 75mm-300mm lens barely fit inside the case.
It's not very big - barely fit my digital camera with the lens.  Barely had enough room for the other accessories.  Pass this one by and look for a bigger bag
"Bag was way smaller than I was expecting. Camera fits just fine, but if you wanted to buy more pieces for your camera you will just need to get a new bag. Not much room for anything other than my camera & lense."
"The first one that was sent was missing the strap. The second one is made a little won,y and crooked but still works."
"It’s definitely convenient, but this bag won’t save your camera from anything besides water or rain.If you drop your camera bag with your camera in itGOOD LUCK"
"It is a good item but it did not fit in my camera, I was looking for something bigger so I returned it, although it was of good quality"
"I purchased this bag and the Ruggard Commando 15 DSL bag for our new Sony A6000 mirrorless camera.  I like the Ruggard Commando bag better and have given the Fosoto bag to a friend that also purchased the Sony A6000.Shipping was slow for the Fosoto bag and the packaging was minimal since it was just in a large envelope.  The envelope had a cut but the bag was undamaged.  The Fosoto bag is small and has a nice padded strap, but doesn't have any additional storage besides the small zippered section in the lid.The Ruggard bag has a full side compartment to store batteries, etc.  It also has the option of using the zipper to open the lid or the buckle (which is faster).  The zipper is great for transport since it keeps the lid more secure, but I prefer to use the buckle which actively shooting.Both bags are sized well and are quite compact which makes them perfect for a mirrorless camera.  The fosoto bag also has a rain pancho, but doesnt include the hidden compartment for storage like most of the larger bags use.  The only option is to either clip it to the outside of the bag, use valuable space inside the bag, or leave it at home (I would probably leave it at home).This is an ok bag, but I like the Ruggard better."
It was suggested to work with the camera that I bought. I could put five cameras in this bag.
I was a little disappointed in this carrying case. First off it does fit a Canon EOS R50 but it barely fits with the stock lens on. There's not much room for anything else in this case either. I can slide in a single DJI mic to the side of the camera in the case but it's a tight fit. Because the space is so tight for the camera with the lens on it pushes against the case sides just to fit. If I removed the lens it might fit next to it but then my mic wouldn't likely fit. The dimensions aren't right for carrying this camera/lens combo. I wouldn't buy this again nor recommend it for this camera. A slightly larger case or even just dimensions that fit the camera size closer would be a much better case.
"The reviews are misleading! Some reviews said it fits a camera and a couple of lenses. This is not accurate. I have a standard DSLR and two standard lenses. The bag could barely fit my camera + one lens. If you have other camera accessories (batteries, strap, adapter) they will NOT fit. This is the size of a kids lunch box for reference. This camera bag is good for small cameras only. 3 stars instead of 5 because the size does not match the price"
this is a soft case and is pretty flimsy. I am not sure I feel safe with my camera in this case.
"It says it is compatible with Panasonic GH5, but it is too small unless the lens is stored separately from the camera body and nothing else goes in the bag with it, which isn't what I want."
Zipper was easy to useIt was a little bigger than I expected but nice and soft
If you’re looking for a small camera bag this is for you. It’s a little small for what I need it for so that’s why I gave 3 stars but it works great!
"If your looking for a big bag... this one is not what you need... this bag is small. Does what it needs to do for my son who is just starting his photography road and he's only 15... but, once he gets more items I'll have to replace the bag... it barely fit the camera and 2 lens."
"Fits nicely for my M50 with kit lens, charger and 270 ex strobe.  Maybe room for another smaller lens.  However, the spring clip on the shoulder strap was missing;  had to adapt another form of quick release."
Not waterproof as described. Has a cheap and thin cover to go on the bag that falls apart easily. Bag is much smaller than it seems as well. It does seem to work okay for now.
"This has been a good compact camera case, but it has some serious flaws with the strap parts that help loop the straps. Both plastic parts broke (see photo) after about 8-9 months of regular but not heavy use. If the straps cannot loop around properly to the clip parts, they come loose and the strap is useless. While the bag itself is fine I now have to get a new strap, which kind of makes buying the bag in the first place very disappointing. I probably wouldn't buy this again, or if you do at least expect those parts to fail at some point and get ready to replace the strap."
"Space is enough for my travelling setup, it came teared at arrival tho, seems like well padded inside, I was unlucky with the one shipped to me."
This was smaller than expected for what I needed it for! Good bag but had to return.
Ther was no user manual with the camera and both batteries do not hold charge.
It's a lot smaller than I thought it would be. It'll hold my camera but just not my lenses. ;-;
To replace a camera bag that I previously had which had room for everything. Extra cassette my battery pack connections and extra amenities
"The bag is much smaller than shown in the pictures, and can barely fit my camera (its a standard canon EOS 250D). I wouldn't recommend this bag for anyone looking to have add-ons to go along with your camera, as the bag can barely fit the camera alone."
Too Small for my Canon Rebel!Good Quality and Material!
"I'm adding these photos so you guys have more to go off of when browsing. The case is extremely thin and the case is on the small side. I don't feel like my expensive camera will be safe in here with the lense either. Seems like it has some cushion, but is not very well protected. Not satisfied.It did come with a strap and thin waterproof case. But the walls are thinly padded. The red velcrow tabs come out and are removable so you can adjust them to your liking and size of whatever you are adding inside. That was cool.. just thinking I might have to return it, or cut it up and add more cusion to the walls, top, and bottom."
"This bag is very small and can either fit my DSLR (Canon EOS Rebel T3i) or my extra lense- not both. Was looking for something small to just carry these two in since my other camera bag is far to big to bring hiking etc, but sadly this bag is just too small for the job."
"The FOSOTO Waterproof Camera Case Bag, while branded as a protective haven for Canon Powershot cameras, turned out to be a damp squib. Its waterproof claim was immediately questionable after exposure to mild drizzle left moisture traces inside the bag. The ""anti-shock"" feature was equally underwhelming, as the padding felt thin and inadequate to cushion any significant impact. For a product intended to safeguard sensitive camera equipment, the FOSOTO case felt more like a superficial shell than a true guardian, leaving me constantly anxious about my camera's well-being."
"The case is fine, maybe a little smaller than you think. The case is NOT waterproof, there's a small rain shield that comes with it, however, is terrible. It's misshapen and doesn't cover the entire case. It also is not completely water resistant. If waterproofing is something important to you, look for a better case."
"This bag is really poor quality. The fabric feels cheap. The shoulder strap padding isn’t even centered and it is not even real padding - just an extra layer of cheap fabric with ugly stitching down the middle. The bag comes with a waterproof cover that just takes up space and the cover doesn’t even fit well over the bag. It’s a waste of space and I wouldn’t risk it to actually provide water proofing. The zippers don’t slide easily. The inside mesh pocket is too small to be usable. I couldn’t even fit a charger in there. It did fit my canon eos m50, but that’s the only plus. It’s going to cost to return it so I guess I’m stuck with it until it breaks"
Needs to be improved.  1. The shoulder strap slides off shoulder easily.  AND  2. Side pockets should zip up from top to button rather then bottom to top.  AND  3. Do without a tripod strap.
I expected this to be bigger than what it was; my fault for not paying close enough attention to the measurements... quality of bag is nice and the extra long strap is great. Just wish it was big enough for my camera with the lense on.
Not as good as description
To small for what I need. Just enough room to hold my camera.
"It really only fits one base and one lens. It can hold a couple of sd cards, and a couple of us filters. But that’s it. It is super small."
Its small.  But very nice.
Check the dimentions carefully
Too small for canon with less attached.  I will order a larger bag
"To small for my Fujifilm XT 20 and extra lens, I don't have place for battery charger, and for extra plastic staff for lens, if buy only for camera then it's good, but if you have extra pieces like charger, cleaner staff or extra lens then waste of money."
"Bag is in good quality, but it is vert congested to put camera with 2 lens and required charger etc. need to be bit wider"
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                It isn’t what I expected. I have a Canon Rebel T7 camera and it doesn’t fit in the case.. the camera is to wide if I try to keep the lens and the camera together. I tried to put the lens and the camera apart in the case but I can’t fit anything else in the case if I do that. This case would go perfectly with a smaller camera.
"I left my digital camera zipped up inside this bag during a rainstorm at a water park and when I take it out the camera was soaked, I have to replace the camera now. NOT WATERPROOF AS DESCRIBED"
Way too small. Barely fits the camera with a lens.
I guess the product description is accurate but the photos they have for reference are definitely inaccurate. Way way way too small to be meaningful in any kind of way for a photographer.
This camera bag is not a medium bag.ir is  much too small for my 35 mm camera and even 1 lense.  I would not recommend this bag for a 35 mm camera.
The bag is okay but size is much smaller than advertised
Verry small
This picture looks like the bag is way bigger than what it is. Nothing can fit in this bag.
This pack is very small. The pictures are a bit misleading.
It’s small and it rained and my camera got wet while in this bag in another.
Good bag but is to small for the cannons
"It’s way smaller than the picture, made of cheap material and they forgot a zipper on the pocket. Will be returning"
This thing was so tiny it barely fit my camera let alone any accessories. This is not okay when we really could pay $3 more and got a whole backpack.
"I have read most of the reviews tho it doesn't work for me,it really runs small n it doesn't hold anything"
It was so small. I should ordered a bigger size
Handle stitching is too tight!!
"A couple of months after use.The bag started to fall in pieces, like Velvet Revolver's song ""... fall to pieces..."".------------------------------------------------It came with oil like he person handling it was a pig (with mu apologies to pigs). Inside zipper was damaged, there's an awful shoulder belt craftmanship.In general, dimmensions are what I was looking for, however quality has a huge margin to improve. I would not buy again, that's what you get when being cheap sometimes."
"I bought this thing Ruth the understanding that it would hold a Canon EOS. It might work with a standard lens but it would not fit with mine zoom lens. I’d look for a larger, more versatile bag."
"Very small, misleading information. Not big at all and not sturdy at all. Wish I would have spent more  on something better!"
The product is a good size for my Panasonic HC-WXF995M handicam and folding tripod but there is not enough padding to provide adequate protection for my camera.
Good Product
"It’s perfect size, but both the clips for the sling broke after about 2 months"
Good size for a camera and one lens but the bags waterproof shell doesn't fit the whole bag.
Not bad and not gr8.(quality
Size is too small for anu camera and lens
It is expected than smaller.
Advertised as waterproof but comes with an extra cover for water protection which is not what I wanted. Otherwise fits camera and  accessories well.
Trop petit sac photo
Just cheap
"The bag size/shape/pockets are exactly what I wanted for taking my Nikon Z with the 70-180 2.8 attached to kids sports or walking around on vacation when I just want my camera quickly accessible and don't need another lens or to carry a bunch of other stuff. Camera, phone, my debit card, and a battery. Tripod holder and rain fly were bonuses but not a requirement.And this bag does fit my camera, with that lens attached. But the bag is so awkward to carry!! I'm 5'5"", with a small frame and a larger chest. As a sling/crossbody, to loosen the strap enough that it wasn't doing weird things to my chest, the bag was hanging down at my butt and would bounce when I walked. It flops awkwardly when just carrying it on my shoulder. Sadly, I think this is going back."
"The idea is so good! I wanted to love this camera case. For one, the size of it was smaller than I was expecting. It was a about an inch smaller than the measurements listed, which is even smaller in the interior after you account for the padding. I had trouble getting the equipment I needed into the bag in a way that I could get it back out again in a hurry (I was photographing a wedding and needed a smaller camera case).But this is a bag that might work for some people. It was very well made. The padding was great, the canvas was sturdy, and the purple color was beautiful. It also came with a cover to protect it from rain.I could have overlooked the size issues if it weren’t for one other thing; the strap was very awkward and made wearing the bag very uncomfortable. I don’t know exactly what it was, but it just seemed to be at a weird angle and didn’t sit well on my back. It would slide more to the side, and the strap crossed the front of my body awkwardly (I’m a woman, so a man might not have the same issues with it that I did). Overall, I just could not get it to sit right or stay towards my back instead of sliding down towards my hip."
bag was just ok for what i needed
i might’ve received a different version. but it was cute just not what i was looking for.
"I like the size and concept of this bag. However, I did not like how it could only be worn one way across my body. The color was exactly as pictured. It fit my camera and one two lenses."
"I forgot to write this review for some time now. The bag is great, I am using it and it’s nice, a little small than I would like but for a fujifilm camera it fits a lot of stuff. That’s not why I gave it 2 stars. When I first opened the bag and was exploring the pockets I ended up finding a dead cockroach in the side pocket of the bag. As you can see in the photo. If the bag wasn’t good I would’ve burnt the entire thing and thrown it out my window.Overall the bag is a 4.5 stars, but because of the dead bug, I can’t rate it higher than 2 stars."
"Didn't feel safe with my camera in it and it felt awkward carrying it. My Lowepro crossbody fits well, this one sits funny on the body."
Comfortable to carry.  I returned this because it is so small you struggle to find room for things or to get out what you need.
"Pros:Foam to protect equipmentGood build qualityComfortableCons:Pockets are too tight to fit almost anythingNot easy to access equipment due to sizeOverall the bag is great quality, which is a shame because of how tight the pockets are which makes accessing equipment almost impossible once you squeeze it all in."
"A little disappointed.The Bag is beautiful and lightweight. I ask before I buy about the 14"" laptop issue and answered by at least three customers that it is OK. Nobody answers no. So I trust to answers.The side access is OK, but have to find a way to order the flexible divisions to effectively uses space without dividing the bag and still access the parts that are not the camera.If you want good example, you can see the deprecates Lowepro Compuday 250, better designed by far, but a little heavier and little bigger for the current flight cabin regulations."
"Good size bag for a day out, decent layout of deciders, zippers seem to work well. Including the anti theft function.Now for the not so good.Shoulder straps are terribly thin and will be uncomfortable over time, especially on sweaty days. Would have been nice to add an additional chest strp to spread the weight. Material is quiet cheap and flimsy, almost resembles what you would buy at a $5 market stall. Inside front compartment would have done well with another pocket for batteries. There is a battery pocket in the side entrance where you place your water bottle, however if you put batteries here you can forget the water bottle as the elastic is very tight which will place pressure on the camera body.All in all. A decent day pack that will likely not last very long.  At this point unless improvements are made I would have to say I cannot recommend this bag."
"Several reviewers seemed to be really impressed the quality of this bag. If you're looking for a quality bag at a good price, this probably isn't the bag for you. It is what it is  – an inexpensively built camera bag. 5-star for clever design. Maybe 2-star for quality. And it's REALLY small. I get the idea of using photography to show your product at it's best, but this it stretching it.  The bad is too small for a Canon R6 with a battery grip (not deep enough). You can't get it out of the quick access opening. So, I think I'm going to give this one away, and try again."
"Because the middle divider is sewn in and not removable, it makes this bag less than ideal for a camera with a long lens attached.  I suppose you can fold down that divider and put your camera on top of it, but I would rather have the flexibility to configure the compartments fully how I want.  Will likely just return when I can find a bag that has what I need.  Wish I knew before ordering that this divider was permanent."
"Wanted to use for micro 4/3 camera, lenses and cloths buts it's just too small.The inside dividers are also not very good for micro 4/3 setups"
First impression was that it seemed well built but was too small for my needs. Was lightweight. Returned to purchase larger bag.
"I like this bag. I like how I can personalize the inside velcro components to the size of my camera equipment. However, I purchased this bag so that I can carry my camera, equipment AND my laptop. But on several occasions that part where my laptop is held, the zipper would come undone causing my laptop to be exposed and almost fall out. I ended up having to place a small lock to secure it. Not good."
"Material is decent and structure is a little flimsy.  Design is cool but falls short in execution, I struggled trying to fit everything, as it this was to replace a bag I currently own that is physically smaller than this but it just didn't work.  I recommend if you like the look and a small factor backpack for you small APSC camera gear.  Otherwise. skip."
I expected it to be larger. It does the job but I would recommend making in larger sizes.
Wish I would have ordered the larger size
Good idea but it’s too small for my liking
It came in with almost no instructions to how to assemble it.. spent 1 hour figuring out how to make best use of this and gave up and returned. It’s not good quality.. I hated ordering this .
The photo was deceiving. I really thought I was getting a larger camera bag. It’s smaller than a pre-schooler backpack. It was a waste of money and time ordering it.
The camera bag had the pocket that holds sd cards sewn in upside down.
Ordered new but received used
Pockets sown incorrectly. Cant put anything inside and hard to access.
Bag arrived missing all of the camera section dividers as well as the rain cover.
"This bag might be an okay choice for a point-and-shoot camera, deserving a 3 or 4-star rating for that. However, for SLR/DSLR cameras, my experience with my Nikon Full Frame DSLR reveals several drawbacks:1. Poor Build Quality: The built quality is poor and the Velcro inside is not strong enough to hold DSLR camera and lens combinations, like a 70-200mm lens.2. Inefficient Side Pocket: The side pocket for quick camera access is a good idea but poorly executed, making it difficult to retrieve the camera.3. Lack of Protection: If the bag is dropped, its construction and padding are inadequate to protect pricey camera gear from damage.4. Exposed iPad/Laptop Compartment: The compartment meant for an iPad or laptop isn't fully enclosed, leading to the risk of your devices getting scratched by other equipment in the bag.Considering these shortcomings, especially for DSLR use, this bag deserves no more than a 1-star rating. I hope the manufacturer addresses these issues for future versions to make it a better DSLR camera bag."
"So keep in mind before you order this bag that it is a Medium bag. So, if you are a photographer or videographer that wants to take the kitchen sink and all your lenses and gadgets and filters, this may not be big enough for you. This is a great day bag and I found it had just enough space for all my essentials!  I was able to fit a Canon R10 with a 24/105, 18-45mm , and a 35mm (on the camera itself),  The charger along with 5 batteries, memory cards, a compact tripod remote, a dummy power supply, some lens cleaning swabs and cloth, AND a couple of ND filters in a sleeve. Granted it was TIGHT, it all fit! Yes, that's alot for a day walk but I just wanted to see what I could fit in this bag! I do videography so I honestly wish I had a LARGE version of this bag. If Im doing a music video on location, I like to have at least 3 primes on hand and this bag just doesn't have enough room to hold 3 lenses and the camera. I would have to travel with a lens on the camera and if you have a zoom or a big cine lens, that's just not an option with this bag.  But like I said, as a day bag, this has plenty of room for a camera, a couple of lenses, and all the essentials you would need to have a fun day of shooting.As far as build, the stitching is quality and the bag itself has a little heft to it. It has a strap and the inside is padded. The separators inside are velcro and can be adjusted if you have a small camera and 2 big lenses, etc. It also came with a rain cover you can wrap this case up in and they claim the case itself is waterproof as well. I haven't tested that yet as the R10 is not waterproof! Overall a very handy case and I will definitely be using it on day trips, road trips, and the quick gig or live band scenario! Oh, did I mention it looks great! No obnoxious logos or huge branding, just sleek and well designed for a professional look, which I really appreciate.EDIT: So i went to a gig last night with this bag and the bottom of the bag is kinda thin so one of my lens housing actually got a little fracture and it was in this bag the entire time. The only thing I can think of is maybe it was set down a little too hard. Either way, this is no substitute for a lens bag so be careful putting your high dollar gear in there. My lens won't fit if they are in their lens bag and then put into this camera tote bag. Im not sure if i trust my $3k lens in this bag after last night. This bag is ideal for the casual photographer, NOT pro gear."
"I have a Canon R50 that fits pretty snugly in this bag, front to back. If I had a larger camera, it would not fit.I found that the capacity of the bag's pockets could have been better. It was hard to find a pocket that could hold my Lavalier mic case without interfering with the limited front-to-back depth, for example, so I finally just put them in the bag's main section.Underwhelmed is a great way to sum up the bag in one word."
"I received this gray camera bag today and I'm sorry I have to say I'm disappointed in it. It arrived in a plastic bag and was wrinkled with the two dividers and rain cover wadded up on top. It wasn't how I expected this to arrive. After unpackaging it, I found the threading of one of the dividers to be coming apart (see pics). The bag itself is rather on the small side but seems to be well-padded. Aside from the poor packaging, I find the bag itself to be cheap looking. I really wanted to like this bag but was very disappointed. I would not buy this bag."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            To be clear, I don't think this is a bad bag in any way, it seems well built, it has a lot of pockets, it serves its purpose, and it has features that my older bag does not have but it doesn't feel great and it came with a big flaw.To start off what I like, it comes with a raincoat jacket for itself, I love it. It has at the bottom a place to hold the tripod, I love it. If I want to add a buckle holding something up I can, I have placed a microfiber there, I love it. It has a nice belt and it goes around me easily, I love it. Inside, there is enough space to hold a camera and two lenses, if not more stuff, and a lot of pockets, and I mean a lot, I love it. The bag itself is designed to get Chunky, it expects you to hold a lot of stuff in there, again no problem, I love it.Let's move on to the problem, firstly, whatever it is made out of I don't know what it is but it feels kind of like a jeans kind of material, again I don't know what it is but I don't like it. It's hard to break it down to make it smaller or anything, like if I want to store it somewhere I cannot because it does not fold well.Now that is fine and dandy, but I find it hard to have a bag that I cannot break down, and that it will always take up a certain amount of space even if I'm not using it. Currently I'm not using this bag, my older bag is a bit smaller and doesn't have any of the features that this one has (which sucks) but it is small enough that it  goes into my backpack easily, fits the same amount of lenses, is padded, and though it's not perfect I can fold it up and put it away in some corner when I don't need it.The biggest flaw this one has is that one of the dividers, the foam dividers, well it wasn't sewn in correctly, and it doesn't have velcro on one side. One side of that foam was just open, if I wanted to use it, well I can't. So technically I got a bag with one divider not two. Now mistakes happen and I can chalk that up to mistakes, a mistake that would make me return it for a refund or a replacement.This bag is not perfect, if I want to use it, like if I want to put it inside a bag and then move with it then it's just not perfect for me, but if I want to just use it by itself as it's meant to be, it's great, but it just feels a bit uncomfortable, I'm going to ignore the missing piece.In no way I’m saying I won't use it but for now I am keeping it in my closet, and because I can't fold it, I have put my bike equipments in there, things that I don't use right now, I am using the bag as a storage. I can't in good faith tell anyone to buy it or not to buy it, I think it's a good bag even though I find it has issues, but me I’m storing something else in it, and I'll only use it when I have to.I took two stars off because of the bad divider."
Almost perfect bag. I loved that you could use it as a backpack or sling. I had an issue with the strap that’s supposed to hold your tripod securely. It kept coming loose. Returned for a different bag.
"This is a fairly well made bag, for the price.  The partitions inside are a bit short, with inferior velcro to really do the job well."
"The bag is very flimsy, very thin padding, and the materials feel particularly cheap. While the low price made me uncertain, I was still surprised by the low quality because most other reviews gave 4 or 5 stars. Anyone reading this should know, though, that the quality matches the price; low.The only positives are that the bag is indeed very lightweight, but that's because everything is very thin and cheap. I've had bags that maybe cost 2 times as much, but had 5 times the quality with sturdy, thicker, durable construction. I ended up returning the product. I recommend just investing in a good bag, or at least be aware this bag is flimsy and thin."
So there's a review here where the guys says a 13in Macbook Air fits. How?I cant close the zipper on a 12.9 Ipad Pro. Magical.This bag will be great for mirror less cameras. Full DSLRs with real lenses. Not so much.
The wall liner and inner dividers are super thin.  There is no cushion at all in the bag. I wouldn’t put a camera or electronic in this bag.
Picture makes it look larger and more durable than it actually is...sorry
Child size
"This would be a cute little pack for a starter photographer but the external padding is very thin and that's where you need the actual protection...from things hitting it. Inside the dividers are decent but once packed, you're not having that much movement. My wife bought this as a replacement for her old one that was at least 3x thicker on the padding and that saved her from multiple hits/bangs/bumps that would have done thousands of dollars in damages. She thought this was similar but no it's not."
"This product is not worth the money. If I had come across this in a shop I would not have paid the price. It is worth less than half that. It is not waterproof, it is splash proof."
I wouldn't recommend this bag tbh... it's cheaply made and I should give it to my kids lol..
"I suppose I should have paid a bit more and got a decent bag. This bag is way to small if you have any amount of decent camera equipment. No matter how I organised it, my equipment was not going to fit. Started to arrange a return (which normally you get to do free with Amazon), I have to pay for the shipping to China! Guess I’ll be listing it on Facebook and eBay then lol"
It's not great to smell for my lens but it do
Be warned for anyone who is buying this for Christmas and lives with there significant other or there children that this is delivered in a clear bag and you can 100 percent see exactly what it is. Ruined surprise but oh well it’s a nice bag
The bag is big… really big. I can fit two camera and many lenses in the bag. And you can adjust the sizes. The quality is heavy material. But it can be tricky to put much in the top part. I wish it had more usable pockets.
"While this bag may accomplish, on the cheap, what I want for our Alaska trip, it's not a serious camera bag. My intention was to have a smaller bag than my giant Tamrac Expedition 8, ideally to hold a pro-size Nikon D3, and 3 big f2.8 zooms: 14-24, 28-70, and 70-200, and my personal airplane carry-on stuff. To my surprise, I was able to get all the camera gear mentioned into the bottom half of the bag, using limited padding. The top half I crammed in over-ear headphones and a jacket. There are a few pockets for pens, passport, phone, MS-Surface, memory cards, wallet, etc. However when I arrive in Alaska and start hiking and shooting, I'm going to have to choose between gear and jacket storage: there's just too much stuff in it and as its packed now getting things out is going to lead to good gear falling on the ground.Other things: The canvas is nice but not waxed so waterproofing is up to the provided ""shower-cap."" The zippers aren't smooth operators nor waterproof. I don't like the small access opening for the camera, in a ""real camera bag"" I want a full open bag face. I also can't see using the upper half duffle bag style for other camera stuff like flashes and triggers. The bag does have a nice retro look, except the straps are vinyl which was a bit of a let down. All in all it's an inexpensive bag that provides an intermediate storage solution."
The backpack is a great one. holds all my camera equipment but for a 71 year old man it's heavy. I bought this backpack because it shows in the pictures that it has wheels and a handle to pull it with and it does not come with that. If I had known this I would have looked for one with  wheels.
"It is a seemingly robust, decently sized day or couple day pack. It has chest and stomach clipping straps, and almost enough strap adjustability to achieve optimal comfort. The ergonomic design has nothing on a true hiking or backpacking pack, and I suspect it would begin to be uncomfortable on a long walking or hiking trip. It is perfect for public or personal transit to pack ones equipment out to a specific shooting location, or for a short hike.There is enough room in the ""laptop pocket"" on the back of the bag for a water pack! The tube takes some work to get it to lie flat, and an extra elastic or velcro band might help it look better, but this pack CAN be converted into a water backpack.I purchased this model for the side-access camera pocket, hoping that it would allow me to quickly access my camera without removing the pack while on a hike (something I can currently do with my old side bag). It is possible to get the camera out without taking the bag off, though it is a little awkward, and very difficult to get the pocket zipped back up all the way after. If the zippers are not in the right position to start, it is pretty much impossible to get the pocket open with the pack on, too.The final comment is the bag does seem chunky and bulky when it is worn, which could be a desired aesthetic or could be a negative, depending on what you're looking for! Otherwise a very attractive bag"
"As far as being a cheap backpack for carrying my gear & other essentials, it does the job. This is not a backpack for a lot of weight or long distance or lengthy travel times. The hip straps do nothing for me when the shoulder straps are adjusted to fit me properly. The hip straps sit at just below my ribcage when the bag is positioned on my back the correct way.The laptop sleeve at the back holds mine quite well, and it can be a bit tricky to get out at times since the zipper is at the top where the straps are, but it's a minor annoyance.I do really enjoy the ease of access with the side zipper for a quick camera grab! But putting it back in through that is near impossible.Great beginner bag, but wouldn't recommend for extensive heavy use for long periods of time."
"I do really like this bag but unfortunately while I was on a trip to Italy the magnetic part came off the canvas fabric. By the time I got back home from my trip the 30 day return window had expired. Appears that the magnets are so strong that when you pull the straps off, the magnet can rip right off the fabric. Now I only have 1 strap that will attach to the bag. Could not get any support help for this. It's too bad, I do like this bag but unfortunately I'll have to look elsewhere for a bag where support is more helpful in case things go wrong."
Headline says it all. Returned it after trying to put gear into bag. I don't want my gear jammed into a bag. Also the straps didn't look like they would hold up to any repeated use.
"I suppose you get what you pay for, but if you are expecting a bag that will last many years of travel, you should probably shell out the extra money for a higher quality product. Within about 1.5-2 years the bag started ripping and fraying in a couple spots, but I did get some good use out of it and and it is a good looking bag. The magnetic buckle fasteners on the front are bit annoying because they get in the way of the zipper pocket."
"I was looking for a bag that had multiple accesses for my camera. This one seem to have what I was looking for and was priced about what I wanted to pay. One of the key factors was I also wanted room for some clothes or jacket. The lower compartment does fit my camera and some accessories and I am able to put things in the top compartment. The bag does get a little heavy and the top compartment doesn't hold a lot. The trip I just took, the bag worked well. The things that I don't like is how one has to build the compartments. It is good to have the flexibility, but the place holders are not easy to install. They advertise that it will hold a camera with lens and will have room for an additional large lens. I tried to put my 70 to 200mm lens in there and it really didn't fit."
"Overall love the bag. It has a good bit of storage and meets my needs in that arena. One of my main reasons for getting it was the stuff pouch on the top which always me to carry snacks, water, etc when I’m out hiking and want to take the camera with me. The strap on the side for the tripod works a lot better too as it’s more easily adjusted and actually my tripod actually without having to struggle with it. The only real complaint I have is that shortly after I got it the lining in the laptop compartment got torn which was a bit frustrating. It’s still usable and the overall bag seems more durable so I’ll live with it but that was a bit disappointing.Overall I’d say it’s a good value for the money spent."
"it works ok for my camera gear to a point, I like the ability to access my camera from the side zipped flap as that is really convenient and I don't have to expose the rest of the equipment.  I needed to take dividers out of my small pack to make enough compartments in this one.  I thought the straps had actual buckles but they are only little button snaps on the back side.  Don't stay closed very well.  I had hoped the top section would also be dividable but it is not.  I must have seen that feature in a different pack.  For the time being this will work, but I am sure I will replace it in the near future."
"This bag feels like a sturdy material and like it could hold up to time. However, I am returning it because there simply isn't enough space in the camera portion of the bag. I prefer to usually keep my 70-200 on my body when traveling which is impossible to have in this bag because it is not wide enough with my 5DM3. And the maximum of what I can fit is shown in the picture without using up the ""daily item"" space. I wish the velcro sectionals had the ability to go higher up in the bag so I could utilize that area more since I only need enough space up top for wallet and keys, but the highest velcro option available is what I have displayed in the pictures. All in all, a very cute bag for someone who's equipment is smaller, but if you have a full dslr and lenses, you may want to be wary on the lack of vertical spacial options in this bag. Half of the bag has no velcro to try to utilize the space more efficiently."
"I just traveled to Italy for two weeks with this bag and was very pleased that it held up with all the traveling. The main issue is that two of the zipper tabs fell off within the first day of use.  Having expensive camera gear in the bag, I got worried what else might fall apart on the bag, but it held up to expectations.  Test the bag before you use it for a trip/travel"
"Don’t get me wrong it’s a great bag and the support for the camera gear is sturdy. Enough space in the top compartment. But I’ve had this bag barely three weeks and just noticed the stitching came loose in the laptop storage space. I have no idea how or why, but was pretty disappointed with that. I heard good things about this brand and for the price I didn’t expect this to be an issue this early on…."
"This bag is made of very heavy canvas.  I returned it as the bottom of the bag is the same canvas - I was concerned that if I set it down on the ground, it would stain and water could seep through.  I was planning on using it for travel and hiking but besides this issue, I found it very heavy and stiff."
"Love this backpack it’s great for carrying around my camera, lens, and other items. I love the separate compartments.I am bummed that my laptop compartment ripped after the very first time I stored my laptop (an 11 inch macbook air - older model) in it. I hope the rest of the bag doesn’t come apart. It’s very stylish, but I wish the liner was made a little better. Hopefully mine was just defective."
"The size and design is great for my use. The quality is really great, but the laptop sleeve’s padding ripped from the top just two weeks after I started using it."
"The two straps on the front are very upsetting, you need to open them to be able to access the front pocked and open the zipper"
"Altough it looks big, the space in the top part gets small when the pads are added. Besides of that I really loved this backpack and defintelty would've recommended it to anybody who wanted a camera backpack with a ""casual"" look until I saw the top part of the laptop pocket rippedI had the backpack stored in my house for this travel and when I got to my destiny it was already ripped, didnt even put a laptop in there but well, it broke. For the price I did not expected it this to happen at all. Such a shame because I really liked it but now Im just disappointed."
"Easy access to supplies, especially to primary use camera. Plenty of room, good support.However,  it ripped out in the top seem in the back on only the 3rd use.  Do not put any heavy equipment in it.  It will not support all it holds."
"the measure fr a 15"" computer does not take into account the thickness of the computer.  I does not zip closed"
"This camera bag has some really nice features, but part of the storage area is not as useful because it is not padded and isolated"
It’s a nice bag. Versatile.  Lots of compliments.  But less than a year with it and one of the magnets on the leather straps is already lost.  Would give 5 stars otherwise.
"The laptop compartment dimension needs to be specified more clearly, most manufacturers just say 15"" when they're really 15.6""With this one, they really meant 15""Bummer, I liked the bag otherwise."
"I loved the look of this bag, but it is not practical or well made. The laptop compartment ripped in the first week of using it. The snap buttons and top string-close pocket make it hard to quickly access what you need and re-close it. I wish I could return but it's too late."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Bought the bag, used it about 5 times in two months. I’m still working from home, so it just sits in the closet most of the time. The compartment where the laptop is stored is already separated. It looks like the fabric is just too thin to handle any load. All I have in the bag is a camera, extra lens, MacBook Pro and a power cable. There’s no reason it shouldn’t be able to support that much for more than 2 months of occasional light use. I will just be investing in a reputable brand and spending more money."
It stared tearing up way too quickly
the inside lining is coming apart and I don't use it that much.
Back detached after 1month. little bit disappointed
"I REALLLY wanted to love this bag. I got it and was so excited for the versatility it offered and I just absolutely loved it. Putting away my gear was so satisfying. My first time using it, I took it on a trip to Iceland and the buckle fell off completely, the back—where the laptop goes— tore apart and the magnets for the other buckle stopped working. I’m so so sad. It was a great bag for the very very short life it had. But definitely not built to last"
We contacted the manufacturer for a replacement buckle but got nowhere - so - would not recommend purchases from this company.  Poor customer service.
"It is so heavy that the bag itself will give you a great deal of backpain. The material feels cheap and overall, I have not used it even once after receiving it."
Do you really want to put thousands of dollars of camera gear into a $50 bag?This one lasted a quarter in school before the seams on the inside of the laptop compartment began to rip.Name brand camera bags are pricey but worth it.  Better off taking the money you would have spent on a cheap bag and putting towards a camera bag with sturdier construction and more features.
The snaps on the bag I received were sewn on backwards. Couldn’t even snap it together.
Worked fine on small trips around town however the strap broke during a small hike.
"This is my first time using the bag. I bought the bag for this trip.This happened withing 6 hours of using it. Amazon will not let me return the bag because he has passed the return time howeve, I had not used the bag. I hope someone can replace the bag.  I like the space but cant have it falling apart first use."
"I carry several lenses, this bag is great for organized accessories. However, I have only owned it for four months and it has already ripped at the seam. Can this item be replaced?"
"On the beach carrying the back pack with a Sony lense inside, the camera compartment malfunctioned and my $3000 lense fell to the sand and is now ruined with tiny scratches from the sand."
WAY too big. You could fit like 5 lenses in this sucker. Takes up more than my back. Can’t imagine hiking or traveling with it.
"The magnetic snaps are completely useless, very bad idea"
Not all of the items were included as advertised
Product is flimsy a of low quality. It's more of a liability than an asset. Haven't used this and won't trust placing my R6 and glass in this bag.
Exterior band was nice and clean...but looks like the one I got was maybe previously a returned unit? It has a sort of oil stain on the interior in the bottom.
"I loved this back pack when it came, super comfy. but i went on one hike and it ripped… super bummed about this since i hardly used it…"
The compartment dividers did not come with my bag. Isn't having compartment dividers a necessity for a camera backpack? Overall quality of the bag seems durable. I hope you guys can make this right?
I've had this backpack for a littleOver 1 month. I took it on one trip and the seam on the back pocket is ripping already.
I want my money back now no more games
I received the bag but without any customizable dividers.
Laptop pouch ripped within 10 days of purchase! Very disappointed given how many excellent reviews there were for this bag.
Will not hold a 200-500 lenscamera body 18-75 lens and 70- 300 lensJUNK
"I received this bag as a gift. I asked for it because I own another Bagsmart brand bag which I love, but THIS bag's visual style is more my jam. I prefer the dark gray canvas + black leather combo to my old bag's black canvas + brown leather.Let's start with a list of what I love about my OLD Bagsmart camera bag:- Supremely sturdy, maintains its form/shape- Compact, fits perfectly under airplane seats- Ease of access for all pockets- Back/shoulder padding is supportive and comfy- Spacious lower pocket (good width for my needs)- Upper pocket access point is well-designed, zipper access, easy to see the items insideDidn't like:- Leather color is brown- Leather straps serve NO purpose; slide into the corresponding leather slots, but with nothing to hold them in, come out easily and flop around- Side pockets aren't very flexible, very limited capacitySo, the new bag. What'd they do right, and what'd they do wrong? I like:- Color choices: dark gray canvas, black leather- More storage pockets- Side pockets are now cinched, allowing storage of larger items i.e. water bottles- The two leather straps have corresponding magnetic clasps which clip onto traditional, belt-style adjustable bits- Extra modularity is neat (i.e. new & removable straps) but NOT useful to meHowever, I don't like:- Decreased sturdiness, doesn't hold form as well- Structure is baggy; now more like a large canvas sack with lots of pockets tacked on- Thanks to decreased sturdiness, I can feel larger items in the pockets bulging through the back padding and into my back, which is uncomfortable!- Lower pocket width is decreased, meaning I can no longer stow the same configuration of items I used before- Not as compact: significantly deeper thanks to the extra front pocket and less defined structure- The magnetic clasps for the leather straps are difficult to connect, due to poor clasp placement- The belt-style straps need their length tweaked every time the top pocket becomes more or less full, or else the straps cannot comfortable reach their clasps- Adjusting the strap length is finnicky and slow- Upper pocket now closes with a drawstring, which sounds easier than a zipper on paper and increases capacity. HOWEVER, this comes at the sacrifice of visibility and ease of use: The excess fabric gets in the way and blocks light, making it more difficult to see into and retrieve items from the pocket.- There is no good place to store the extra drawstring length, so it must unappealingly hand down from under the top flap unless you take the time to thread it into the cinched top pocket openingAs much as I'd love to use this bag for its looks, function always takes priority for me. Function is a clear L for the new bag."
"I wanted a bag that would hold my camera gear, allow easy access to my camera and lenses, but also had room for hiking essentials. Two out of three is... not enough. It holds all the gear and has plenty of room for snacks and hiking essentials. However, getting my camera in and out of the side door without taking the pack off was super tricky, and I still had to take the pack off to swap lenses. That leads me to my next issue: HEAVY! The bag is heavy before you even put anything in it. Once it's loaded with a camera, 2 extra lenses, hiking supplies, etc, it's easily 30 pounds. Now it's not the manufacturer's fault that I loaded it up with gear, but the fact that it is so heavy BEFORE you add gear, is. I actually injured my shoulder slinging it up on to my back :-(. The last issue is that it is canvas, which means it's gonna get dirty. I was a dork and bought a light color. The thing is, due to the design you *have* to lay it down to get to the lens compartment, which means you're going to set it in the dirt. I'm really disappointed that I spent $65 on a pack that I'm not going to use, and is so huge that I don't even have somewhere to store it."
"This thing is HUGE! I bought another Bagsmart bag that was a bit on the smaller side and decided to upgrade to this. When I open the side flap, my little mirrorless DSLR (Canon M50 mk2) looks hilariously small in there.The pack came with lots of dividing shelves and it holds all my gear well. The top is also way bigger than it appears on the pictures. You could do some serious day trips with this pack with no problems finding places to tuck all your extras. There are pouches within pouches, lots of zippers, and plenty of security. It's honestly a bit too big for my needs, but I'm okay with that. I'd rather have the extra space and not need it!UPDATE: The top handle ripped from the bag on the second day of use. The seller will not uphold their 30 day warranty policy and has instead offered me a 30% refund if I repair the item myself."
I loved this camera bag and was so obsessed. It still functions great but zippers are beginning to malfunction and the anti-theft zipper is missing. I was intrigued by this feature and I did not receive it. I have had this bag for several months and was not going to complain but now the quick access pocket to my camera does not stay zipped and that’s when I noticed I did not get a bag with the extra zipper for durability and safety. I am disappointed in how the bag was delivered to me but I still love it and wish I had that zipper to hold it all in. Everything except this one pocket works perfectly.
"I bought one directly from Sunny 16. When it came I wasn’t impressed with the storage for cards, batteries, remote shutter release, etc. it also seemed very stiff, and the main compartment zipper doesn’t open enough to pull the top all the way open. I plan to return it. But then I set it aside to contact the company, and noticed one of the snaps with a buckle attached was still on my bed. I hadn’t even tried to set it up for use and it already fell apart. I contacted the company a week ago, and still haven’t received a reply."
"Backpack was great for simple hikes on trails without much gear.  When I took it to Death Valley with a full complement of gear, the plastic clips for the waist strap broke when I was shifting the pack's position on my back.  Spent the next 7 days struggling to balance the load."
"Laptop sleeve fabric ripped a week into use, I carry my camera an extra lens and occasionally my macbook(No more than 5 times) , I haven’t even used the tripod pocket due to the bag coming without the tripod strap. Buckles are actually a magnetic clip that is easy to open and hard to close. The D-Rings on the straps are a light plastic that I wouldn’t trust for clipping anything to."
"I love canvas material, but it adds way too much weight to this bag."
The top flap zipper is designed in a way that you can't drop it over to one side completely to be out of the way and it doesn't really serve any purpose except to be annoying.
"It’s not that space efficient. I had trouble fitting my mirrorless camera and two lenses for a trip and was worried I couldn’t go.I then remembered I had a lunch pail (one of those fabric insulated lunch bags, not a hard one) and thought “it’s probably similarly water proof, let’s see if it’ll fit”. Low and behold, two lenses, my camera, and my accessories all fit perfectly in a bag the same size with similar protection (I’d trust the camera bag more than my lunch bag though to protect from a fall)."
"I ordered the SMALL and it was a bit too small.  Well made and CANVAS (like my Domke bag), so I kept for carry around.  Found that there is a MEDIUM bag; i ordered it..  Took FOREVER to get here but I stuck it out.  Bag arrived; big enough until I opened it and found a bunch of built in small pockets and zipper top, etc.  All of which consume camera space  The bag  is also not CANVAS; rather a waterproof micro fiber material.  Not my preference. If this MEDIUM was a carbon copy of the SMALL bag, it would be perfect.  It isn't; I am returning it. I5 stars fir small canvas  bag; 1 star for medium micro fiber bag.  3 stars average."
"I have been a photographer 35 years I have never seen such a poor quality camera bag! There is NO SUPPORT IN THE BACK OF THR BAG WHERE YOUR GEAR IS SITTING ON. Heavy camera bodies, heavy glass “lenses” cause the back to sway and all the gear falls all over the place. Where each lens and 5000.00 camera body slams together wheh you pick I up the bag . It’s like they forgot to add a base foundation structure to the whole back of the camera bag. Not just mine.. I tried to return it and they instead sent me a SECOND ONE ! So I went ahead and tried it out I loaded up my one camera body and only two lens and it did the exact same thing .. all the gear weight caused the bag back to sag and the gear to fall against each other. Scratched up my 4800.00 lens .. and broke a dial off my Sony Ar 7-3 body .. 5000.00 camera body.. not cheap to have fixed . I thought I’d trust reviews and get something cute to carry my gear in for wedding shoots in gardens.  So now I’m stuck with TWO WORTHLESS CAMERA BAGS! Out 200.00! I asked to return it..not get charged for  another crappy bag!  Leaving review today because now I’m giving up on getting my money back. It’s been 9 months ! Not even the bag pictured ! The ones I have are black floral back pack style ..not this messenger bag shown in the picture here for the item ! Beware very deceptive!"
"1) Buckles are cheap, not 360-degree rotation as described;2) Front pouch is not secured, things may slip out;3) Stitching and threads you will see from pics enclosed.Overall, it is a good small bag for a DSLR camera and a few accessories traveling along with, a big len is not recommend; cute, small but sturdy and endurable, low-profile; still, attention and improvement should be implemented. Would return it but time concerns and trip due, so that’s it, I keep it. Will test it out and update when we back from Christmas vacation."
"My camera broke while using it, not sure whether it’s my fault or the bags. It is well built though. I would recommend this to any one who needs something to hold there camera, but not necessarily protect it"
"The images flat out lie. It will absolutely not fit a sony a7ii or iii body with a 24-105 lens. Unless you want to put it in sideways at an incredibly tight fit. Like so tight that I fear it may eventually rip the view finder rubber piece off the camera. Quality seems great for how cheap it is. But a little bit of false advertising. It's not enough money to return it. So I guess the false advertising worked to their advantage.Also, the velcro is very tacky. They should have put a magnet in it or nothing at all with just having the zipper on the main pouch with a free closing flap without velcro. Could never use this in any quiet environment. The velcro is very very loud."
"I really liked the look of this bag as it's a plain, non-descript bag great for traveling. Based on the product image I assumed I could fit my Canon EOS RP (mirrorless) here with lens attached but quickly found three things:1. The Canon EOS RP will not fit with the grip extension attached2. The Canon EOS RP is a tight fit without the grip extension3. There's no way to fit in the Canon EOS RP with a lens attached.If the interior dimensions increased by 0.75"" in all directions this would've been the perfect bag!"
"Strange cover design, does not open fully. The opening does not extend far enough to just flip the cover after unzipping have to force the cover back to get it opened. Highly inconvenient and impractical. Returning it."
"Love the bag itself, perfect size for a small camera, but the clipping part of the strap broke off the first day I used it, and I have to carried the bag by hand and ruined my street photograph trip."
"I bought this bag for my new mirrorless camera to use on my trip to Spain and was unable to use it, because its not sturdy enough the first time I use it the strap came off. I try to connect it again and it cane off the minute I put it on my shoulder,  so I have this nice bag and it's no good thank goodness that when I first attempted to use it I was in my hotel room and when the strap broke it landed on my bed therefore saving my camera from damage.i was unable to send for a return because I was not home to return the item before it's due date now I have a useless bag unable to use it a waste of money."
"You know that velcro divider in the picture, mine didn't come with it."
Camera bag feels good queality and my fuji xt-100 fit perfectly. Nevertheless the sling broke at the first time of use.
It wasn't enough to fit all our camera accessories. So we returned it
My a7iv and lens barley fits. I have to wiggle it in there. And it’s mainly because of the extra zipper flap which is just unnecessary for a camera sling. The top flap is enough. This is a poor design.
Nice looking bag but broke at first moment on carry
"Way too small. This is really designed for low-end DSLR cameras. If you have anything other than entry level, then avoid this bag as your camera will not fit. This was an immediate return. Thankfully I ordered in enough time to find something else for Christmas."
Returned this cause of the smell it smelt fishy
"It's a basic camera bag, it held my mirrorless camera, some batteries, and my action camera. It looks good and is okay to wear.I found the dividers to be difficult and wish it had a bit more room"
"If I run it under a tap the water will mostly bead off, but when put under a shower it gets wet and absorbs the water. Saying the bag is ""waterproof"" is misleading and shouldn't be allowed to be said unless it's true."
Quick delivery. Bag was small but it lacks any padding in the bottom of them bag I wouldn’t be putting anything expensive in it .Cheap and useless .
In the product video they were able to fit a A7R with a 24-105mm lens however when I received this bag it was smaller and did not fit my camera and lens attached. I really liked the bag and the quality is nice but it did not work out for me.
"Padding of bag leaves a lot to be desired, spend a little more and get something better!!! Ended up having to buy a better bag"
Leather damage after little rain

"Had the washer for over 3 months now. At first I would hand wash my clothes or go to the laundromat. After a while decided to look for a washer through YT, Facebook, etc. And this washer was recommended.  It took me weeks, and worry would it break, or even be financially worth getting at the moment. So, then I saw the grey washer was on sale for about the same price for the white one. It came in quickly and was easy to pick up due to its lighter weight for me atleast, lol. Took it out the box, screwed on the bottom lid balanced the legs, and rolled it to my washer hookups. Everything hooked up fine, both hot and cold. I even tested it out on the sink faucet as well. Everything works as it should the only down side is currently a month ago it would make a screeching sound when on the spin cycle, thatll last for a good 10 to 20 secs, but that seems to not hinder its process whatsoever at the moment. The sound come and goes. 2 ti 4 weeks it doesn't make that sound and other times it does for about 1 to 4 times which worries me sometimes, but it still runs fine for its price. The other issue I had initially is that my clothes at the top would not be covered in water when washing but I come to realize the washer just doesnt want to use a lot of water. So if you have it packed, I found the Bulky setting fills it up all the way to the top so that resolves it, but I mostly put my blankets  shower curtains, and other big stuff on that setting and use normal or quick for other things. The cleaning out the pump filter I find tedious but it has to be done every month and it will drain a little bit of water on the floor which is not a problem. Overall besides the occassional noise it tries to make that happens like 1 to 3 times a month. The washer is as good as its price and gets the job done. Not everyone will have this experience.Update Dec 2022: Washer is still going Ok. For right now the washer is not frequently making that screeching sound, I notice it does that more when you add bleach in it, at random or use hot water sometimes. I've cleaned it out the filters once a month month, haven't yet seen mold or mildew for now. Hopefully it continues to stay working.Update: May 11th, 2023 I am starting to have issues to where the warm and hot setting I barely use that often for months will spill down wire connection out to my plug cord to the floor which I find as a huge hazard. This does not happen using cold only warm and hot and I found two holes where the water comes out to fill the tub. That are intentionally there. Which I find useless and caused an issue rather than a solution so I believe the steam is creating pressure which forces the water through those two holes in the top-back where the tray is. To confirm it I opened the detergent tray using both the hot and warm settings and as I thought the washer stopped leaking down the cords and wires onto the floor. I possibly would've noticed this way sooner if I was using the warm to hot option more often. But if you wondering why your washer is spilling that possibly is why, and opening the try will most likely fix it. But again those 2 larger holes in the back need to go to prevent this issue. I have contacted the company and we will see what they will say and do to fix this issue. To get visual information. I posted a video of explaining this issue, but unfortunately due to the inconvience and the hazard of it spilling on wires because of that and how soon these issues came about I'm reducing it to 3 stars. Next day: It seemed to now fixed itself a little, no longer spilling on the cords from what I can see but partially into that drum tube  in the back that i assume is a drainage tube back into the tub, but will continue watch it."
I purchased this product because we live off the grid and use a generator for our appliances. So I wanted something large enough for a full load but small enough to fit our power requirements. I used it for almost 10 mos with no issues. Loved it! One day I got an E3 error code which is something to do with the lid being open. It obviously was not the lid and it is easy enough to see it was closed. After multiple attempts to fix we called the customer service line. They explained that they do not repair or exchange portable washing machines so right now I am awaiting a refund check in the mail.We decided that because everything else about this model we liked we would order another one and give it one more shot. I am hoping that we do not experience the same or different problems with this one. I will review the new one after using it to report back.
I bought this washing machine in 2021. In the beginning it worked fine. I love this washing machine. Fast forward 2024. It's starting to break down. It leaks water from the bottom during washing and after the machine  is unloaded.It's time to buy a new washing machine.
"This is so tiny, I should have gone 2 sizes up. I don't even know how to return it because I had throw out the box and the foam"
"I purchased the 1.6 cu.ft portable washing machine to replace the machine that came with the house I bought, until I can get myself something nicer. This will also make it easier to move around to do repairs in the laundry room.PROS:- Small- Lightweight- Easy to move- Clothes are clean (dare I say, just as clean as a full-size washer)- Short cycles (26 min normal cycle got my work clothes clean)- Super easy setupCONS:- Shipping damage (broken plastic in drum, dented on most sides, scuffed up all around)*- Arrived missing pieces, but I contacted customer support, and hopefully will receive replacement parts- Doesn't save cycle settingsNEUTRAL:- It's uglier in person than it is in the pictures, but I guess that's just a preference, so take it as you will- Produced bits of packing foam for the first couple loads, but I think it's done now (my packaging was severely damaged when the product arrived)*- It's not noticeably quieter or louder than a full sized machine*I would have returned it, but I had too much stuff going on at the time it arrived between when I set it up, so I'm outside of the return window."
"Product came damaged with a slight dent in the front of the machine while the packaging it came in was not. The universal adapter will not fit your older traditional sink and you will need to purchase an extra piece to connect to your sink. You will need to go to a plumbing supply store. Don’t go to Home Depot or Lowe’s, you won’t find it there. If you are connecting it to your faucet, you will need to turn it on again when the machine is in between cycles as it will try to refill water. It isn’t that loud and it gets the job done. It will suffice. It’s my first time buying a portable house item and it wouldn’t be my first pick if I had the chance again just because it was quite inconvenient looking for that extra piece. If you are looking to buy a washing machine, this will work but not necessarily the most convenient.Update: two weeks later, it gets noisier and it squeaks when spinning. Water gets to the bottom of the machine and there’s no way of getting it out. It just swishes inside. Try not to let any water get out of the spinning wheel, it will be trapped inside the machine at the bottom. Don’t do large loads “L3 (load 3: large load)” it will splash water out. Only do small and medium loads. Best when the washer is filled half way or less of clothing."
"Pros:  Super compact compare with standard washing machines. Perfect for small spaces. 😯 Cons: Design flaws. Motor noise . Hard to move, only 2 tiny rollers. Heavy duty cycle -total time: 63 minutes ( Default program) .The drain hose must be no shorter than 32 in. Sometimes ,keeps overflowing 💦 .  😐 Tips: The biggest challenge was hooking it up to the water pipe . Make sure you get the right sink adapter at your local hardware store. Keep an eye on the washer . If you see something goes wrong. Just turn it off and then turn it back on. This will reset the fuzzy logic program . No child-lock. Not suitable for children operating it .😪"
"The 0.9 cu Ft. has a very small cord and drain pipe that doesn’t extend well. You have to be directly next to the sink or tub to use it. The images posted for the product are a little misleading. It also says the washer has a “Hot & cold water inlet”, but when I opened the package, there is a warning label that states “ CAUTIONDo not connect to the hot water supply.” It a long time to assemble and the video in the product description wasn’t much of a help. I also used the “Gentle” setting and the washer tore my pants. Parts of the hose are easily came off and resulted in water leaking. If you’re washing small loads, I still recommend a bigger size or you will end up wasting water."
"It's been a struggle since the machine arrived which is sad because i was really excited about this purchase. First, it arrived very damaged. There was a massive dent on the bottom of it, possibly from the way it was delivered but the machine also had signs that it may have been previously owned. Because the side of the machine is bent inward, the inner portion of the washer bumps against the outer wall very loudly during the spin cycle. Im not sure if the life expectancy will be very long because of this. Other than than the machine itself does what it's intended to do. The wash cycle was pretty impressive and my clothes were clean for the most part. However, my kitchen sink is a pull down sink (it's not recommended to connect the hose to this type of sink because it could damage your pipes but even so I could not find a connector that would work) and my bathroom sink is oddly shaped so I've just been making trips back and forth to my local hardware store trying to find an adapter that will fit, still haven't found one. I've found an adapter that will at least stay in place when the water pressure is low, so that's been my solution for now, but it takes forever for the washer to load because of it. I'm gonna keep looking for adapters and hopefully find one that fits my sink. I would just add the water in the top but that defeats the purpose of the automatic washer, in my opinion. Also, you can do decent sized loads with this. Ive washed blankets and comforters without any trouble. But it is pretty heavy. So, in short, the washing machine itself is a good product but beware that the parts may not fit your sink and then you won't be able to use the product as you intended."
"As quickly as it came into my life, it so swiftly was taken away (by the UPS man). I had hoped I would have a long fond relationship with this washing machine, knowing it would take great care with my delicate items.However, my 'Comfee', warm fuzzy feeling quickly left me feeling lost and disappointed.With all sillyness aside, I was looking forward to receiving my very needed 'new' washing machine. Instead after paying for a new machine, I received a used refurbished unit.  Sorry Comfee, next time you try to pass off a 'new' unit, you may want to clean out the lip of the basket. Yeah, the soap powder was a giveaway along with the sloshing of water still trapped in the unit.Speaking of 'trapped'... I then gave your company an opportunity to redeem itself, by requesting a replacement. Again, you chose to take the very low road. Yupper (yeah, that's a tone of contempt), I received the second unit. I was so hopeful believing you set high standards and believe your reputation for your company is important (side note to self, never date the gentleman who own/operates this company, high standards and reputation are obviously not important)...your playfulness in your deceitful game with your trusting customer(s), was ill received. Again, I opened the packaging to only find missing parts, broken styrofoam, water in the unit and the clean out in the back having high iron residue in it. If you know the prior owner of the unit you may send them a Thinking of You note to get a water filter device for their home.Well thank you for allowing me to poke fun at this, even though it is not really funny. The time that I had spent looking up the 'Best' machines was obviously overated, and I wasted time on trying to find a washing machine that was so needed. Thank you again for.... well...nothing.....Kind Regards,Virginia"
"First off, the washer arrived damaged in the shipping box.  The protective foam on one corner was crushed and the corner of the washer itself was dented several inches even though there was no damage to the outside of the shipping container.  This makes me wonder if this was a previously returned item which was re-boxed.  Moving the machine around popped some of it back out.  It is ugly, but it won't be on display so that is not important enough reason for me to return it.  I'm taking off a star for it though.Speaking of moving, the unit is bulky enough to be difficult to move about.  The wheels are small and placed in such a way that you must tilt the washer back about 45 degrees to move it, making it impossible to easily wheel into a closet for storage.  I'll be getting a small dolly to facilitate that.The first time I used it I ran a full load and found that it did not clean my clothes as well as a normal full-size washer.  Still, it has a low price tag for what you get and it did clean them when I reran with smaller loads.  Keep that in mind if you are considering one.On the plus side it is super quiet and has all the control options of any modern full-size washer.  It was easy to setup and the user manual was quite comprehensive (though fully half of it is warnings, cautions, and danger notices about not washing children or pets and all the ways you can electrocute yourself or suffocate in the plastic bag that surrounds it in the box).Bottom line:  This was worth the money.  No more trips to the laundromat and the associated hassles for me.  I have been looking for a unit like this for several months and this was best of breed in this price range."
"Update on the very last day they said would take the refund to be refunded: I’m showing now over 100.00 of the return was not returned. If they don’t return the money I’m going to call my attorneys and will take them to court!!!! This thing had a computer problem and would revert back to only being able to use heavy wash and they are taking their sweet time refunding the money. And I had to pay for the return label and the gasoline and time to get it to ups, I also had to repack the entire thing which did not easily go back in the box like I thought it would. And to re-box it, is on your dime.The hoses are so so small and so so short they won’t reach anything!!!A portable washer should reach longer. The rollers are not rollers like they used to have. It rolls on 2 straight cheap rollers that go only straight n wrong way!! 👎 You have to move it back and forth and back and forth rather than just move it freely!This is just horrible!It’s going back!!!! What cheap garbage!Could they make things any worse?Maybe I should not ask that cuz I bet they would and maybe will!I want one like my Haier washer that lasted years and years and with good hoses, with 4 good rollers and I thoroughly loved it!!! I thoroughly hate this thing!!!There has to be a better one out there! Unless you don’t mind cheap garbage with the shortest hoses and bad rollers and only using the heavy cycle. And I need the drain hose on the right. They are all on the left now.And the drain hoses are so small it will likely get clogged in no time!And the top of the power button had been smashed but I took the wrap off and you can’t tell but who knows if it will work after having it get hit like that.I decided to stretch the washer lines as far as they would go to see if it would work. All that unboxing and setting up and the machine didn’t even work right. I can’t believe that Only the bulk load would work with full heavy load. Medium or Small would not work. Delicate is not a delicate, it’s a lie, it’s only spin and spin doesn’t work! Why even put delicate on the washer when there is no delicate at all?This makes me mad to have to reorder one! Maybe I can find one straight from a company rather than this Amazon stuff cuz I’m tired of getting things that aren’t right cuz you can’t see them or try it on in the stores!I have no printer for the return label and have to take it to a UPS and have a label printed ( if they print them for you)  for it to go back and it takes a week after to get the money back. It’s been the 5 days they said fir the refund and nothing yet. They should have to pay me for my problems! The companies used to do that when you got faulty or wrong items.I won’t buy from Amazon anymore if they keep selling garbage like this and not refunding promptly. If I could have taken it by to the store I would already have the refund and a different washer. So I am without the money and a washer."
"Used this when I lived in off-campus housing and we had no washer/dryer in the unit. I will say, it made it a whole lot easier than having to haul our clothes/bedding/linen to a local laundry mat. Butttt, the loads are very small. It's a constant task to load/unload the laundry. It is also not very dog-friendly. Most of our linen still had dog fur attached to it. However, if you don't have a dog or don't mind the constant changing of clothing then this might be for you. It's still a better alternative than having no washer."
there's no temperature option in the unit we received. Maybe I could just fill it with warm water.
Worked really nice but only lasted 19 months. Started making a horrible noise and leaked
"I bought this machine 2020 , it worked good the time I had it , but recently it stopped doing the spin cycle , so the clothes come out damped wet . I tried trouble shooting it , unclogging the drain etc , but not seems to help , besides this issue it was great for the 4 years I owned it ."
"I bought this March 2024 we don’t use it every day, first it started making a lot of noise when it spins the clothes tried all the troubleshooting but still makes noise, then the lid broke it’s not even a year old not worth if it is basically disposable, on other hand it does wash clothes well only gave 2 stars for that reason but 0 in durability."
It worked great work first but then it just stopped working.
"I am so disappointed with this purchase . Let me first say that I placed this order back in April 2023 and it arrived in March . Shipping took maybe 2 weeks . Not to bad . My UPS delivery guy is and was amazing so no fault on them . The washing machine is beautiful in terms of appearance. It’s cute enough to fit the esthetic of any household . It’s relatively quiet compared to other washers I have used . It has hot and cold hooks ups in the back , 6 wash settings , everything you would need to wash a specific load . What I am disappointed In is I think this washer has a small manufacturing issue on the barrel. The top of the washer keeps shredding. It says don’t load bulk or heavy items into washer . I followed load instructions to a T. Now I wouldn’t be writing this based on one incident . The first Asher I received shredded so badly , Amazon did a replacement for me free of charge . Then I got the new one and have used it over 3 weeks and it’s doing the same thing . I am a frequent washer . I have 3 children , boys , 2 play sports and a 1 year old . Just to give some insight on how frequently I wash . I would not take the risk on those tiny plastic shards getting stuck into their clothing because they are similar to glass pieces and will cut your skin and cause irritation just the same . We are now almost at the end of June so I would like to say 2 months was a long enough time to give this a fair review . I don’t know if anyone else has had this issue with a portable washer but what ever the issue I hope they fix it because I was happy with the purchase design and appearance overall until the shredding started to happen !!! DO BETTER COMFEE!"
"I had a Black and Decker same listed size for the last 4 years or so and it was pretty good, rarely had any issues with it and the ones I did have were of my own making. I broke the lid on it a couple months ago. I couldn’t find the one I had purchased previously, so did a little research and this one was the best reviewed so decided to buy it. Delivery and set up were great. Shipped in good packaging. The issue I have with it is that it will just stop 8-12 minutes after starting a load. It is still on, it just pauses. So I then have to get up and pause it with the button and then start it again. Sometimes more than once per load I have to do it, very frustrating. The other thing I have noticed is that even though it’s listed as the same size as my previous washer, I can’t fit as many items as I could with my previous washer. I sent an email and will update when I hear back from them."
"When I received the product, I thought it's good about how much attention was given to the packaging for safety. It was securely packed with styrofoam and boxes from all directions, and it was easy to separate the box. The installation was also very simple. However, when I opened the bottom hole, dirty water came out. Water coming out from the bottom of a brand-new product, just taken out of the box? Is this some sort of pre-operation test that I don't know about? Also, when I looked inside the washing machine, there was some red staining. There were no issues with the exterior, but no matter how I looked at it, I started to feel like it might have been a returned or used product. I didn’t think it was serious enough to warrant a return, so I just cleaned the inside thoroughly and tried washing some workout clothes, and I was satisfied with its performance. If it weren't for that issue, I would have given it 5 stars, but as a consumer who bought a brand-new product, I should give one star for the signs of use I found on it."
"I am updating my review. Comfee portable washer I waited to give my review after 22 months . My washer died. Shortly after I reviewed it on Amazon. I believe the water pump went out since I had the appliance protection I immediately filed a claim so far I have been told that I will be reimbursed, I was refunded the full amount it is best to have some sort of appliance protection plan it stinks to spend the extra money, but just think of all the money that you lose, if the appliance breaks down in a short amount of time and there’s no one in my area that repairs portable washers they are disposable great if you are handy and can do the repairs yourself?I used the money and I purchased a portable washer/dryer extractor that lasted five months habutway it was under a protection plan I filed a claim and was refunded the whole amount I have since then purchased another portable washer dryer/extractor that I have had now for a monthI had an old Kenmore before I moved that was 40 years old. Best washer in the world and still going strong. It was completely rebuilt. The guy that I bought it from loves to restore old appliances. I missed that washer but anyway, this is the best I can do to be able to do laundry  without sharing the appliances here in my building I decided not to go with another automatic. We have issues with water pressure so I went with a  portable. I have two sizes. It’s a lot of work, but it gives me peace of mind. I think it just comes down to. You’re lucky if you get a couple of years out of an appliance, most appliances that I am purchasing. I’m lucky if I get six months out of them."
"This is a larger machine with a smaller tub than most machines this size, it washes clothes nicely but it doesn't fill up all the way no matter what cycle its in, full load only fills up 3/4 and so on, the rest of the levels fills up much less than it should to wash clothes. If the machine needs to be stopped to add softener, you have to pause it, if you accidently shut it off while it in the rinse mode to add softener, when you turn it back on it will drain the water and start the rinse cycle all over again. Has a cup in the back of the machine to add soap and softner, the issues is, it has slits in the cup and the product runs out and doesn't contain the ingredients till the water runs through specific cycles in the machine, so you must stop to add softener, to use bleach add the clothes that you want, make sure you remove all the clothes, then start the cycle to fill machine, pause the machine, add bleach, unpause the machine, let the bleach swish around, then add clothes--this is key. otherwise you get bleach spots. Machine is very loud, it's not a quiet operation at all. Electric bill went up drastically from the use of the machine, it's not energy efficient, I do about 2-6 loads a week, my bill jumped 300.00 a month using cold water. The clothes do come out clean but you can only fill the machine half way loosely on a full bulky load, which this is the only selection that allows the machine to fill up at least 3/4 of the way, trying to reset the machine from small, medium to large water levels doesn't correctly set the water, you have to use the cycle settings of normal, bulky, heavy, ext. which still gives a water level much lower than one can actually use to be efficient with clothes washing. The closest to a normal was would be the heavy setting which runs for about 50 min. If you want the normal load which is 38 min and you need the tub to fill up full, it wont. It only fills 1/2 way. If you want the machine to maneuver, you have to set it on a washer dolly, otherwise it's too bulky to tip back on the wheels and move around, the wheels are set in to far on the bottom of the machine, it will lean back to far when trying this function. I have called the company several times, sent them proof of purchase, as requested. Made several complaints to Amazon, no one will help me, they left me with a broke ass machine but it's not just this one, this specific model all of them are the same way, they all operate this way!"
"5 STARS:  It’s a great washing machine. It cleans the clothes very well. One can be tempted to overload it, though. Just because you can fit a lot of clothes in the drum, doesn’t mean you should. Wet clothes weigh more than dry clothes. You might damage the machine.4 STARS: Finding the right adaptor for your faucet might be a challenge. Yes, it comes with one but that doesn’t mean it will work with your faucet. I needed a new bathroom faucet so just chose a faucet that would work with the adaptor that comes with the machine.3 STARS: Drain hose is a pain. I’ve washed several loads so far and found that you have to keep a very close eye on the drain hose height. If it drops down too much, the machine won’t fill up with water and you’ll be wasting water. What to look for: water coming out of the drain hose as the machine is trying to fill up with water. Also, the timer won’t change because the machine can’t fill up.  If that happens, make sure the hose is raised higher. You may or not be able to use drain it in the tub because of this. I never leave the machine unattended when washing since I can’t trust the drain hose to do it’s job.Overall, I’m happy with my purchase. I’m 65 years old and in my twenties I owned a portable washing machine. Back in the day, things were made more efficient/durable.. Today, you pay a lot of money and hope for the best. Hopefully this machine will last longer than a few months. Hopefully it will last a long time."
"UPDATE!!!! JULY 15 2022This machine DOES NOT WASH WITH HOT WATER. USING HOT WATER WILL DAMAGE THE MACHINE SO ITS A COLD WATER ONLY MACHINE. I find that very inconvenient because I still have to use the laundromat for sanitizing reasons as hot water does kill germs especially if you have pets or children.I need to know if I can wash with hot water, the water hose indicates not to.So far so good and I thank God I bought it. This is the smartest decision I’ve ever made as far as appliances is concerned. I don’t know why I lived with the task of going to the laundromat for so many years. Breaking my back carrying laundry bags down the street or dragging a rickety cart I had to replace twice a year. I am a REAL person and this machine is working great for me. I don't know why people are saying it’s noisy, the noise level it’s more like a hum, you have to be conscientious about how much you load into it at once, you can’t over burden the machine. I’ve even had a load going whine I slept.One suggestion for the manufacturer, please give us ability to purchase a longer hose and drainage pipe:) at your store :) it would help people who buy it only to realize it doesn’t reach the sink!. Thanks"
"I purchased the machine back in May 2024 it has been almost 5 months and about 1 month ago the machine started making a loud (very loud noise) while on the spin cycle. At first I thought maybe it was too much clothes in there. However, I'll literally wash 5 items at a time and the loud noise continues. Any advice?"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            So I’ve used this washer several times now I’ve had it a little over a month and it works great! However when I received it there was water beneath the drum. Like if I shake the drum I can hear the water but I can’t see it ( I hope that makes sense). At first I thought I got a used washer but then I saw that they test all of their products before sending them to ensure they work (honestly… I’m still a little skeptical about it). So does the washer work yes, really well too. I just can’t seem to drain that water that is stuck in there. I drained it from the bottom and a good amount came out however there’s still some in there and the smell is NOT pleasant. I fear it will create mold that I can’t see. I really wanted to love this product but I think I’m going to have to throw it away. If anyone has any tips I’ll gladly take them!"
"The washer is good, but the packaging wasn’t the best, because it had a dent on the same side as the chunk of lid broken, but it seems to operate ok.."
"I've been using it for nearly 5 months now & always on lightly soiled cloths.  I've been pleased with it's performance but the multitude of setting options are ridiculous.  I finally just found one that I use for everything & that's working for me.  I'd recommend it without question if it was easier to find parts for.  I'd submitted a question about where you can buy a lint filter & received a response from someone that didn't even realize that the machine has one.  Today I searched for my question to see if anyone else answered & my question doesn't even show up.  But another person asked a similar question & received a reply directing them to ""Encompass"".  I went there & found parts for this machine but no lint filter.My current impression is that the lint filters aren't available as replacement parts.  So if the part wears out or simply breaks, you'll just have to do without.  I clean mine after every wash & expect that if it wasn't there, the filter in the exit line would need cleaning much more frequently.  Therefore, as good as the machine is, I'd have a hard time recommending it if you can't even find a replacement lint filter.  And what kind of other service issues will eventually crop up on a machine with so little customer support."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            *2nd update* I was thrilled with this initially... It was good while it lasted. Purchased this in march 2023. It's now August 2023 and the drum inside the very top plastic part seems to be rubbing up against something inside which is shaving the plastic off.  Ive since stopped using for fear the drum might eventually just fall right off and flood my house. This thing lasted 153 days, roughly five months. The machine cannot be operated with the lid closed so I can't even try to self diagnose what is going on.It's past the return window so I guess I'm left to deal with customer service of the manufacturer and see how that goes. I will post a final updateI did receive this with some minor cosmetic damages like a lot of other reviewers (A couple dents and a cracked plastic in the back). Amazon was very gracious in making things right. I have used this little machine now for a month or so and It works very well. This little thing washes my clothing cleaner than my larger fancier LG washing machine and even though it's drum looks tiny it holds a decent amount of laundry.The spin on this is also fierce as many others have mentioned...for my lycra clothing that I like to hang up to dry, I notice they dry much faster coming out of this washer than my regular full size washing machine.The only small gripe I have is I wish the drain hose was longer. I hook it up to the faucet in my guest bathroom and that bathroom is too small to put the machine in and have room to navigate around it. This leaves me having to place and angle the machine very awkardly outside the bathroom door in order to reach the sink.  I don't know if the hose length is short for safety/technical reasons etc. but if the hose was just maybe a foot longer that would have helped some."
"Not sure if the one I got was just defective but definitely do not feel safe using this. Set it up finally and seemed to be working fine, wasn’t leaking, wasn’t unbalanced or knocking, got through the first agitation cycle and then after it started draining and spinning I started smelling the most horrible burning smell. Immediately unplugged and started trying to find the source. Opened the lid and there was smoke inside of the drum and the drum was very hot(did not use hot water to wash the clothes per manual instructions). The few clothes I put in there now reek of the burning smell! It seems well made and I feel it would have cleaned the clothes properly but I’m terrified of what could have happened had I not sat there and watched and noticed!"
"The washer works great. My household has already washed 8 loads over the last few days. It doesn’t fit nearly as many articles of clothing as the description claims…you can fit approximately 4-6 T-shirts(average adult size), 2-3 pairs of jeans(average adult size), or 2-4 towel (depending on the size). It spins most of the water out so the clothes are only damp feeling but it’s kinda noisy when spinning (about the same as a regular washer). Overall we’re happy with our purchase.Update:The hinges on the lid broke after only3-4 months of use…it still worked for awhile after the hinges broke. Six months after the hinges broke it stopped working completely…all it shows now is an error message saying the lid isn’t closed even when we have the lid sitting on it. It lasted a little under a year from the date of purchase, which still isn’t too bad of a deal considering at the laundry mat it costs $2 or more per load to wash.Would I buy this brand again?…probably not unless I had no other choice."
It doesn't even fill the container on an L3 load even if I only put 50% of closing and pick L3 for the largest load it doesn't put enough water in the machine this is nonsense and trying to get anybody at the company to help you is ridiculous AI tells me to take off the back cover and look at the water sensor valve I'm not a mechanic
"Initially, the washer worked great. I purchased the 2.4 cu. ft. sized washer and was really pleasantly surprised at how roomy it is, I was able to wash a good amount of clothing in it and it got the clothes really clean. All was going well until it wasn't. 10 months in (still under the manufacturer's warranty) the machine showed an E3 error code and would not work. I contacted Midea, the manufacturer, and spoke with a customer service representative who suggested the washer needed to be reset by opening and closing the lid a number of times. It did not work. The manual states that an E3 error code is due to the lid being open, however the lid was most definitely not open. I assumed, in error, that because the washer was still under warranty, I could get it repaired or a replacement but if ordered from Amazon instead of ordering directly from Midea, the only option is a refund. I am awaiting the return of the funds I spent, supposedly will take 2-3 weeks. (???) I have read other reviews about the same error code as well as other error codes happening, making the washer inoperable. Now I am back to lugging laundry back and forth until I purchase another washer from a different company. Lesson learned."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            So the actual washing machine does a pretty good job cleaning it's a decent size does about a medium load. Mine arrived with lots of dents honestly looks like it was dropped on its side one of the corners of the machine is completely dented in all the way down to the bottom of the washing machine then there was also a big dent in the front of the washing machine which looks like it resulted from whatever caused the dent on the corner I was able to stick my hand inside the machine and pop most of the big dent on the front.  but not all of it the outside is made out of very thin sheet metal that can easily be dented in. From the outside of the box you couldn't even tell that it was damaged.. also I do not think it was the delivery person I watched my security cameras and the delivery guy picked it up and carried it he didn't drag it or toss it down so I think it was either damaged in transit or before even being put in the box. It works well it just looks beat up. And for the price it really should arrive with no damage. The overall functionality of it is really good it even has a quick wash mode that washes your clothes in 15 minutes. And it cleans well.
"We bought this washer 2 years ago in a pinch as we moved into an apartment. We were able to hook it up to our faucets and drain into the sink. It does run small loads, but got us clean clothes in the comfort of our place. However, it started throwing E3 codes. Sometimes they were able to be cleared, but finally it would not clear, spin or drain and left us high and dry. It was worth the 2 years we got out of it, but would not purchase another as a replacement."
"Unit looks great. Installation in the laundry closet of my apartment was quick and easy, I followed the instructions, completed the checklist, hot and cold waterlines were tight and sealed, drain hose was secured, unit was balanced on the tile floor. Test spin went fine, and everything seemed great... until I tried to do a test load. As soon as the machine started to fill with water, water started dripping out the back of the machine, through the grates, and pooling under the unit. Waterlines were tight and dry.Water was dripping off the electrical cord. I stopped/unplugged the machine. I dried the water with a towel and took off the service panel on the back to see what was happening. When the machine fills water pours out of the closed detergent tray into the cylinder like a waterfall. If you check the photos you’ll see two black wires in the background above the cylinder. Water was splashing from the detergent tray onto those wires and flowing straight down the inside of the machine into the wiring harness and collecting in the bottom cover. The wires are insulated/wrapped but nothing separates/protects those wires from the incoming water. There is only a very small lip with a drain around the edge of the cylinder that appears to be there to prevent exactly this, but it is not enough (lip had water splashed all over it. Water was dripping off what appears to be ground wires (see photos of wiring harness). This feels like a serious safety issue and a major design flaw. I can’t imagine this washer functioning safely. Unit did not short-out or blow a fuse, but even properly grounded (and plugged into a 3 prong grounded outlet) how is it acceptable to have water pour down the wiring harness and pool in the bottom cover, leaking onto the floor?Unacceptable risk in my opinion. Unit is a $300 paperweight.* update * ... made a second pass, confirmed unit was level and connected the water lines. Reconfirmed unit was level. This time I barely turned the water lines on. I turned the unit on, started a cycle... the water began to pour into the machine - and instantly splashed into the back of the unit down the wires into the wiring harness, and dripped off the power cord onto the floor and began to pool. I also double checked that there were no water leaks from the water connections (internal or external), or any other area inside the unit, definite design flaw. Unbelievable."
"Update: I have had this washer for about 4 months. It works well but kinda dangerous. I had the hose in the sink and it slipped and water got everywhere. When I ran to stop the water, I fell and gave myself a concussion. This happed. A second time. The hose got lose and water got everywhere. I didn’t fall the second time, but I was afraid of getting a electrocuted. I don’t know how to make this washer safe to use. But I decided to stop using this washer. If I could return it, I would. I don’t feel safe anymore using this washer. Which is a shame.Update: had washer about a month, used it about 4 different times. Still really love it, but be cautious with the hose. I did a load and the hose hook got lose from the sink and the water was all over the the bathroom floor, I didn’t know that and I fell and got a concussion from the fall. I know use a rubber band to make sure the water hose is attached to the water hose drain. This seems to fix the issue. Just not fun dealing with a concussion. I still recommend this washer, just be cautious.Amazing washing machine, I love it. I just Moved into an apartment with no hook ups. Been taking my clothes to families homes to do laundry but wanted my own washer dryer sets. I got this washer and used it twice today for the first time. I love it. I did have a hard time with the connection in the sink, but my brother was able to put it on. My Fossett had to take the top connector off, something like that. But now I know how to use it and it works perfectly. Not sure if this has a matching dryer if it did I would’ve bought that instead of the one I got. But overall very happy. I also think it holds more clothes than I thought I would to wash."
"We just ordered this item for our  very small apartment, before unboxed I noticed a hole on the side which was there upon arrival, when finally unboxed we seen that it had been dented pretty bad, and then also upon setting up we looked inside and saw the plastic rim had been broken completely as well I hope that packaging and safety of item is increased but overall after cleaning a load it was perfect."
I don’t know about this one….
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            So, there was something disgusting in this thing, yellow spots that were all over inside of the basin, on the upper part and on outside rim of the basin and when I went to try to clean it I found a hair! There were scuff marks on the control panel even though the film was still intact, water marks as well and debris in the feet. It smelled and there was old water inside of it. If you look at the packaging material, you can see there is all kinds of gross remnants of whatever was in there and I’m just so disappointed. Packaging it back up was obviously a chore and the bottom of the box consists of a piece of Styrofoam packaging material with no way to secure it. Hope it gets back OK…"

"This is just a whole mess to use this. Once you get it working it definitely works but it doesn’t come with parts that work well for most people theirs a review somewhere in here that shows a better adaptor head for the hose then the one sent which was plastic! Water went everywhere , the hose is also way to short (both hoses honestly) and crappy so go get yourself a stainless steal hose learned that from YouTube, get yourself a different adapter and unless your washer is against your sink your gonna have to get those rings from the hardware store that clamp pipes and hoses together via screw and put more drainage tube onto the hose, it was just .... a lot by the time I set up had the hose working has the supplies ordered I’d already gone to the luandry mat twice, if you don’t absolutely have to luandry at home just go to the mat, while it’s working you gotta watch it like a hawk for an entire hour to make sure it’s draining and that it won’t overflow or leak and chase major water damage id never get one again going forward and I imagine selling these is hard so purchase carefully definitely a huge hassle just to do smallLoads"
Nice big machine with hoses and cleaning. The color was nice. And it did a good job of cleaning. It was decent
Was very happy about this purchase but disappointed once I actually tried it. It can get quite loud and leaked on the first try. Too much of a hassle to return...
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I reviewed many portable washers for months before settling on this guy! I was so excited, so many wonderful reviews and it looked like it would be perfect for me!1) I got it delivered on the 5th and used it - just fine. I leveled it and everything. I was in love with this washer the first use.2) I use it for the second time on the 8th and this awfully loud clicking noise starts on the spin cycle. That's odd - so I take my clothes out and level it. Then use the spin cycle with nothing in there - it is still making that loud noise. I couldnt find a reason that it was doing that. Nothing was damaged, it was leveled 2 times.3) Contact Amazon and they told me to contact Comfee/Midea. I do so and they refused to help me. Tionne did not help me at all with troubleshooting. It took them 10 minutes to respond to each of my responses so it took me about 30 minutes to have him tell me to go back to Amazon. All he asked me was what kind of clothes were in the dryer and if the tub had any broken pieces. No troubleshooting at all! Horrible company. They wouldn't even send a replacement or troubleshoot further!4) Now I have to return it. Be sure to save your box or you'll have to buy a new box to send it back in.Overall: WORST PURCHASE I HAVE EVER MADE!!!! I WILL NEVER BUY COMFEE/MIDEA EVER AGAIN.It's been a horrible headache on top of me not having clean clothes. This whole thing was a waste of time and money for all parties involved. If you want a quality machine, get a Magic Chef! I have had no issues and it cleans my clothes even better than this one did. No issues and I've had my magic chef for a month, using it twice a week."
"I wanted to love this thing.  There were not many ""real"" reviews on it, other than the ""robotic"" type, so I took a chance.  My whole reason was to have a portable washer WITH A LINT TRAP.  I bought a ""Costway"" mini washing machine, and even though it ""tangles"" A LITTLE, it does NOT tie my clothes in KNOTS!  The only problem was it does not have the lint trap, so my clothes were coming out looking pretty nasty. Well, fast forward, back to AMAZON to buy some lint ball thingies, and while I'm at it order this machine WITH A LINT TRAP.The day I got it, I was pretty excited.  It was a pain it the  x x x to hook up (for me), and I was so used to the other one, this seemed like a huge task.  I got a ""load of jeans"" (i.e. THREE PAIR)  (NOT EXTRA LARGE OR ANYTHING), and went through the process.  The wash cycle alone told me everything I needed to know.  OUT IT GOES!!!  It took me 5 minutes just to UNTANGLE 3 pair of jeans!I hate the ""pulsator"" type washers that are ""the rage"" these days.  I just wish there was a portable with an old fashioned ""agitator"" with more than ONE CYCLE to choose from.  JUST NORMAL & GENTLE would be fine.  BUT NO, we have to choose from WHIP and BEAT ...This machine has its plus points:  Different cycles, it's automatic, BUT FOR ME, I have to move it every time I want to use it (weight wise, not fun), and it really is bulky.  And the tangled mess, NO WAY, just not going to deal with that.  Luckily the little lint ball thingies came the same day as this beastie... and I tried them in my little machine ...happy camper.  AMAZON was great about the return of this one, and it may work great for some, just not me."
"I am VERY disappointed in this washer and I haven't even used it yet!!! First, I was extremely annoyed to discover that you can only hook it up to COLD water. There was NO disclosure of this fact in any of the ""details"" or ""specifications"". I re-read them before writing this review and still saw no mention. In fact, in the Q & A section, the manufacturer specifically stated in response to a question, no doubt as a “selling point”, that it could be hooked up to BOTH COLD AND HOT water. No, it can't! There is only one water input ""valve"" and before you think you can alternate, unfortunately the manual even states COLD WATER ONLY! This is despite the fact the manual references water hoseS PLURAL! Also, the instructions are incorrect re: one ""instruction"" (so far). There is a bottom plate that the manual says to tilt the washer backwards to install. BUT, you have to tilt it FORWARDS because the plate needs to go in from the back plus, the screw to securely attach it is also in the back. Impossible to do the way they say to in the manual. Also, the manual says TWO screws but there is only one and only one place to put it. ""Finally"", it won't take liquid detergent: only high efficiency (HE) powdered detergent. This was also not mentioned anywhere except the manual. What a crock!As for returning it, after lugging it into my house and into the basement, I'm surely not going to reverse all that and return it. Guess I'm stuck with it and its’ limitations. TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE INCOMPETE DETAILS. Some might even say ""LIES BY OMISSION""."
"Amazing washer, I really do love everything about it besides the insanely short drain hose. The water hose is attached to the top area so it’s very easy to connect to the sink. As for the draining hose, it’s only about 2-3 ft long and it’s attached all the way at the bottom of the washer. I’ve put 30 pounds of weight on the hose to keep it still in my sink and it still ends up popping out onto the floor mid wash. I’ve literally flooded my apartment multiple times. I’ve tried moving the washer and rearranging my place to give it a better fit. Still the hose is insanely small and it stretches. Which seems nice until it stretched back into its place.The noise of it is also terribly loud, somewhat vibrate the floor and my neighbor hates it. Yes it is leveled but still is a bit loud."
"1) Hidden inconvenience: This washer is designed for HE (high efficiency) POWDER detergent only (to which I am allergic). This is not listed anywhere, neither on the website nor in the product description. I found it out only when I received it and read the accompanying manual. 2) Desigh flaw: The in-the-tub lint trap does not collect the lint, for it's made of two plastic aligned panels with large holes, so the lint goes thru, not getting trapped inside. After I laundered bath towels, I had the next batch all covered in fuzz and lint that floated in the system. 3) Particular item defect: Spin-only does not work as designed, needs to chose ""Rince and spin"". 4) This machine's 1.6 cu. ft. capacity is surprisingly much bigger than a 1.5 cu. ft. washer, and seems way too large for a one-person's need.Overall the machine looks good and seems practical with a good price and nice features. Alas, has major and minor  flaws IMO."
"The first one was delivered by UPS with punctures in the box, crushed side and 3 of 4 straps missing, physically it looked like it had been tossed down a flight of stairs, so got a refund and re ordered after meeting with a local witch doctor to guarantee safe intact arrival.....it worked, arrived with not a blemish!Setup was easy peasey, ran a water only test to check for leaks, all tight!The tub is much larger than I had expected in such a small foot print and the height is perfect, the clear glass lid is slick and you cannot slam it as is slowly comes down on its own.The digital control panel forced me to read the direction to simply turn it on....no biggy, (that High School Education Paid off), actually very good instructions ( perfect bathroom reading.....actually has a plot too)!Washing clothes is painless, quiet and uneventful.This sweety is perfect for my Full Time off Grid Tiny Cabin of 195 square feet and barely sips any power....something like this simply did not exist a decade ago.....and yes, as part of the Bonding experience she got her first Turtle Waxing....we be buds!Hot Tip.....using Liquid Turtle Wax (car wax) on the underside of the lid then wiping dry stops water spotting!Update:  Been using for months but unfortunately it simply does not get clothes clean, have tried many different detergents and modes butstains and dirt remain yet when I put same clothes in a conventional washer with an ""Oscillator"" or Beater clothes get cleaned, seems this one is just too gentle to sell and replace."
"The machine does work as advertised. It takes in water through the connected hose and you select the type of wash and options you want. When it comes to a medium load there are no issues. When you do a large load, however, it turns into if there's enough water in the machine, it spins so fast that it bangs against the walls and causes the timer to jump backward by 5 or 10 seconds.I just did a large wash and I had to stop it at the 20-minute mark that moved there for another time after spinning too hard.I like the machine and have given it multiple chances, but I almost hate that I can't do large loads without there being issues. It's a great machine, just be cautious about it."
The machine skips the rinse cycle on the normal program setting. Had the first unit replaced and now the second unit has same issue. But this second unit also has some kind of loose debris under the drum that makes an extremely loud crackling sound. When i called the manufacturer they told me they don't provide support for their washing machines. They said the only option is to return the unit and get replacement. Horrible experience.
"I have ordered this machine twice. Both times, it arrived dented in the same places, which leads me to think the issue isn't with shipping or delivery but rather with manufacturer's packaging, though Comfee denies responsibility.My first arrived in an unscathed box but with significant dents on the body of the machine. Upon operation, it turned out to be mechanically defective as well - made loud noises, even when run empty, that would put an old, ungreased wooden roller coaster to shame. I sent Comfee several pictures and videos of the problem to troubleshoot. After extensive investigation, they determined the machine was defective due to poor handling and delivery by Amazon. Fine. So, Amazon exchanged it for a new one, which also arrived in an unscathed box but with dents in the same spots as the first one. The second isn't mechanically defective, just cosmetically so. The delivery driver and I chatted as he took it from the truck and put it in front of my door, so I know it was handled well.It's unfortunate that Comfee doesn't package their product better so it could survive an average shipping and handling experience. That they didn't take responsibility for their poor packaging is just poor customer relations. Overall, the machine does the job fine. If not for Amazon's customer service - and excellent associates who helped me - I'd be stuck with a loud, unwieldy door stop. As it is, I have a banged up washer that doesn't look pretty but does the job fine."
"Purchased in July and was excited to start using it. Normal cycle didn't work as I thought it should. Tub would only fill halfway for large load and no water was added on the rinse cycle. Talked with customer service and they said that was correct. No water for rinse? Other cycles work fine, so I guess normal is not normal."
"Hello I’ve had this washer for over a two months now. The first washer I had to return because there was a loud rattling sound so they sent me a replacement. Reason I’m giving it 3 stars is because if I wash a light amount of clothes the spinning cycle is so loud it’s ridiculous idk if it’s broken or if that’s how it’s supposed to be. I wash on gentle hoping it helps with the noise but it not really. If I fill it up with a heavy load sometimes the spin isn’t as loud. I would like to be able to wash a light amount of clothes because I got a portable dryer, and if I stick the entire heavy load the clothes come out beyond wrinkly. So I have to wash a heavy load but dry it in two loads so my clothes aren’t wrinkled. Also the tires don’t help for nothing. I practically have to lift it everytime I move it. I did extensive research,all I read were good reviews, and nowhere did I see it would be rattling loudly during the spin cycle. Honestly I’m very disappointed 😭"
"I’ve had this washer for a month. When the washer arrived, the box was all but obliterated. The styrofoam packing material had broken into a million pieces and was lodged in every nook and cranny of the machine. I received a Panda electric dryer on the same day and their packaging was in pristine condition.The washing machine exterior shell has a large dent in it due to the poor packaging. However, it would be too much of a hassle to ship it back for a return (I’d need a new box and everything!), so I cleaned out the styrofoam as best I could and ran a wash cycle to see if it worked. It did!Although it has huge cosmetic defects, it washes my clothing wonderfully. Most loads are perfectly clean after only running the 15 minute quick cycle. Styrofoam bits still come out of the drain tube, but that has lessened over time and I think it will eventually stop.Overall, I’m pleased with the machine and I would have given it 5 stars if they used better/stronger packaging."
"None of the other settings beside rapid wash actually fill the washing machine up and it’s very small. You can only wash one sheet and a pillowcase at a time, even though it does take a lot of water like a regular washing machine. The motor is not powerful at all.If you have the space, just go ahead and get a regular upright washing machine"
I bought this in 2020 and bought a new one this year in 2024 but the model is different and the settings are different too. The 2020 model was amazing and the only reason I “upgraded” was because we accidentally broke it. But this new version of it is so bad. It takes wayyy longer to wash  and it keeps randomly stopping?? Definitely don’t recommend the new version of it.
Although the machine works very well the problem at hand is its huge to return and put back in box. It works so its not as if its affected its washing capabilities but I can not get a hold of any one person to let them know the shipment was obviously mishandled or it was damaged somewhere in after or before transport. It would be nice to be already able to contact seller not just start a ndamn return and deal with this big hilly item. Point being if I pay for an item I would like what I paid for not a broke. One to look at that ugly leg.  I would give 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that broken leg happened and I was by myself relying to figure that out. Money well spent though my kids like to wear fur coats by allowing the cats to sleep on all of their clothes... I literally bought this watsher to separate out clothes and I love it.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Honestly I get very excited when I use this machine. I like that I don’t need to go to the laundry room anymore for small loads. And it’s a five minute roll to the bathroom and hook up to sink and tub.  The agitator isn’t very powerful, and it kind of twists your clothing up, and maybe even stretches some clothing items.  The  soap doesn’t seem to sud up.l either. It does clean the clothing though, you just need to do “heavy” “load 3” for maximum washing. The handles on the side are awkward too and the wheels are very small, so it’s hard to move around the house. However, it’s very easy to install (plug into the sink) and go. You really need to put the water pump in a tub or VERY deep sink cause the water will shoot out and it’s quite a lot of water. It really is a game changer though for folks who don’t have machines in their home."
"SoGreat idea!The washer is aesthetically pleasing other than the damaged part that most likely occured in manufacturing but they sent the washer regardless because It arrived in a well boxed container. The washer arrived early!The problems:1st the simple aspects of the washer work great regardless the following:1. obvious damage on the front of the washer during manufacturing;2. pieces missing included the adapter to the sink;3. Floating pieces that we can not figure out where they belong;4. the washer will not perform the extra rince or spin cycles stated in the programming.We are focused on this aspect because we went and purchased the item needed. So unless the washer goes through a heavy duty wash cycle we can not use the rince or spin cycles. We do not dry our clothes due to a dryer's environmental impact therefore we purchased this washer mainly for the 2 components, rince and spin cycle.We have contacted the manufacturer and they were nice.we will see what the final solution will be and follow through with closing this review!"
"Would’ve been the perfect solution except it arrived busted. return has been easy enough just left it outside my porch and they picked it up, awaiting my refund"
"This machine will wash about maybe one pair of jeans and a T-shirt or two at most, for reference I wear large tees and a 34w in men's pants. So not a lot, it does wash well and seems good enough however it runs loud. May god help you if it's not balanced right or you put too much in. Eventually, as it runs it sounds like it's about to spin out of control so you will have to stop it and rebalance the load or take clothes out. For what it's worth this unit works well and helped me save money living in an apartment by doing some of my laundry. It runs better if you fill it about 60-80% full and the automatic drain/spin is worth it all you have to do is fill it up and start. Would I buy it again no, does it work yeah but not worth it uh hell no."
"After only six months of use, water started pouring out of it uncontrollably. After shutting off the water supply to the machine, it was clear that it was overflowing and the stop valve (inside the machine) was not working. Lesson learned, you get what you pay for. Going for a name brand next time."
The washer arrived with the bottom of the carton totally gone.  Fortunately it was inverted so it was the top of the carton.  When I moved it around it sounded as though there was water in it and it is supposed to be a new item.  I could not level it as the right leveling foot would not loosen even with a plumbers wrench and was missing the pad on the bottom of it.  Fortunately this has not affected the washer and I have done several loads and it does a good job and the spin cycle really works well.  The machine is relatively quiet.  I would have given it a 5 star rating if it had arrived in better shape and the one leveling foot could be loosened and was not missing the bottom pad.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I received this washing machine thinking I was purchasing a new oneWell, thays what I paid for $250 bucks... But when I got it there was water already in it. So if it's new why does it have water in it???Also, .. there's a plate missing at the bottom at the bottom of the washing machine is completely explodes as you can see in the video. YES!.. they wrap new plastic around it and put a yellow sticker on it. But, as you can see on the top of it it's all worn and old and looks as if it's used. And it's clearly NOT new. ESpecially if it has water in it and the hose for the WATER!!.. is (NOT) Universal there's an attachment missing and I did two loads only. And (IT BROKE DOWN) I barely had it for one day.I just picked it up yesterday my husband took it out the box and noticed it had water in it. But,  I did two loads and after two loads of stopped working....😠😠😠we had to literally ring out the clothes in the last load because it just stopped working and hubby had to pour the water out of it because it wouldn't come back on at all.So... BEWARE make sure you're getting a brand new one and not a used one as you can see the box that I put in a video as well it looks like it's been a retake several times so this washing machine is not new and it broke down after one day"
The washer seems to do the job but it was full of water when I received it so I know it was used. But it washes nicely and actually spins most of the water out. Don’t expect to do a whole load in this size but I was able to wash my daughters thick winter coat (kids coat for kindergartener). The user manual was a little confusing for me but I eventually got it.
"When I opened the delivered washing machine, I found the inside covered in what appeared to be hardened rust and an unknown yellow substance. It looked extremely dirty and clearly not like a new product, which was very disappointing."
Washes good and great for small spaces
"I have the grey 1.6 size washer.  When I unpacked it, it had water in it.  Made me a little uncomfortable seeing that. The washer actually washes nicely and is relatively quiet.  The reason I gave it a 3 star rating is the fact that is has a problem with washing a large, cold water, and normal cycle load with a cycle time of 69 minutes.  During this type of cycle it just sits still for about five minutes doing absolutely nothing and then it finishes out the cycle spinning for about forty minutes.  If you just change the cycle to use warm or hot water it would only take 37 minutes.  Obviously a glitch in the program.  Also, this washer really needs both the hot and cold water hoses hooked up in order to use warm and hot water settings.  Contemplated sending this washer back but from what I have read in other reviews, it can be a painful process.  Not sure if I can recommend this washer for purchase.  Will update this review in a few months.Update: Normal washing cycles using hot and warm water DO NOT rinse the clothes.  An obvious quality issue.  I want to send it back but my better-half doesn’t want me to.  Definitely cannot recommend this washer now."
"I thought it was a great supplement until I was able to get me a new washer/dryer combo, but boy aren't I wrong!!! Only four months in and it has stopped working. I smell a burning smell, and it seems to not want to spin anymore. I didn't over stuff it, so does that mean it was just over worked?"
This is my second time buying this brand I got the 2.4 cu ft my previous was a 1.6 cu ft and it worked just fine. This one 2.4 cu ft has a dent on the side and it leaks water it runs not really loud I like the buttons and how you can set the washer.  It's very heavy and the wheels are not that great overall I give a three star bc it leaks it's dented and definitely not for small spaces..
"I only used this machine to wash small shirts, few socks, undies and towels all separately. after 2 half years motor stopped working, it's not the belt, or pump, i don't overload don't wash heavy like jeans or jackets etc. the motor just heats up and make noises. no clippings lodge in there, no broken plastic, everything else is in pristine condition and looks all new. good workmanship on everything else but it seems impossible to replace that motor so need to buy a new mini washer."
"I Purchased This Because I Was Tired Of Going To The Laundry Matt Every 2 Weeks. My Delivery Was Horrible. Didn’t Come The Day It Was Supposed To And I Had To Wait A Couple Extra Days Which Was Kind Of Inconvenient For Me. However, The Washer Itself Is Nice So Far But Now The Spin Cycle Is Really Loud Like Its Hitting Against Something. And I Wish It Was Easier To Carry But Other Than That Its Worth The Purchase. Also, It Gets The Clothes 70-80% Dry So That’s Nice. I Didn’t Have Any Problems Connecting It To My Kitchen Sink And The Drain Hose Is Long Enough For My Set Up."
"I have yet to actually use the machine itself because the faucet adapter does not fit any of my faucets. I bought another adapter online that works for me but upon testing it, the pipe itself leaks & sprays water from the metal parts. Ordered a different/longer hose online & waiting to see if that helps."
"Worked great for about a year. Did a great job for such a small machine and was very convenient for someone who works out a lot. The water pump went out a month ago and I haven’t gotten a response from customer service, tried emailing and calling each week. I haven’t yet found a repair company that services this brand. Very disappointed."
Attempted to utilize modes “heavy” and “delicate” modes without success. Errored out before cycle was complete with drum filled with water. Nightmare to repackage. Returning.
I don't know why the washing machine is wet even though it's a newly opened box. I wonder if someone has used it before.
"Horrible customer service. They give the runaround and won’t assist at all. I was able to do 7 loads in this before it started leaking from up inside the machine where the water inlets are. It sprays water and leaks all down the left side if you are facing the back of the machine, running down the electrical cords and onto the floor.  The water inlets inside are under a solid plastic housing unit and not accessible, or I would try to fix it myself.  Amazon told me to call Comfee direct to try and resolve the problem.  The rep at Comfee was no help whatsoever!  She asked me who installed it and I said I did.  She was shocked that I, as a woman, installed this little washer.  Oh my gosh, the horror of a woman daring to attach a water inlet hose and put the drain hose in a drain hole!  She said I needed to send them a Video of how the machine is installed and a video of the water leaking in action.  So I asked her ""you want me to run this electrical and flood hazard and send you a video"".  Her response was ""yes, but don't use the machine until we get the video's"".  Hmmm, yeah that makes sense.  I have only had this machine for a few weeks and am still in my return window.  After 3 weeks and several emails with no help from Comfee, I’m done.  I’m returning the unit to Amazon. They need to deal with the seller."
"I love the portability, the ease of use, the design and the features. The machine is fairly quiet and does a good job of washing and rinsing. I only did a small load just to try it out and it works great! However, the downside is that the machine is not packaged well at all. My washer is FULL of dents all around and I’m totally not happy with having to look at dents on a brand new machine but the alternative is to return for a refund. I ordered this machine awhile ago and the first one got “lost” so they sent a replacement. So after waiting forever for the first one and then getting a replacement only for the replacement to dented up, needless to say I’m not happy. If I based the review solely on the functionality, I would rate it higher. But considering all the ups and downs, a 3 is being generous."
I want to give it 4 because besides this machine being loud when washing it did it’s job ! But sadly I’ve had it since 2020 and it stopped working today ( warranty expired after 3 years ) just my luck. I contacted amazon and they told me to contact the company directly “COMFEE” which i did and they told me they couldn’t do anything about it because none of their technicians specialize in portable washer which makes NO SENSE. Why sell these machines and not have technicians on them? Their products are great but what about the customers who carry your products for a while and want to remain with it. DONT BUY AFTER 3 YRS of WARRANTY they won’t fix it ( no one in my area specializes in these portable washer neither )
"The item arrived today about 2h ago, in undamaged package but when we opened it the product itself was strongly  damaged. Now we have to return it , wait to be refunded and but a new one. Which is VERY ANNOYING!"
the leaking from the back side which was not seen until the floor was damaged. From outside nothing has happened. But you step on the floor and a water comes out and you shoked.
This machine definitely does the job. My clothes are clean. Can't over stuff it. It won't wash well. Half way full does the job.  My issue with the machine its that its a bulky heavy machine. You need a trolley to move it around. If you have a small apartment it's going to take up a lot of space unless you have a closet to store it in. I bought this machine at a way cheaper price. It's way overprice. I would look for something a lot small and lighter but powerful.
I was excited to purchase delivery time was okay came next day which should’ve had me skeptical received my order & the bottom of my box was wet as if the machine was used which it shouldn’t have been because I ordered a brand new machine to my surprise the machine didn’t work very nice looking great detail but it doesn’t spin nor rinse anything worst $255 I’ve ever spent highly disappointed I thought I could retire going to a laundry mat but I guess not. I will be expecting my full refund. FYI it’s nice & small but don’t purchase they need to work on the motor for the rinse cycle
"Unfortunately this machine just stopped working suddenly. It won't turn on at all is is very frustrating as its just outside the support timeframe. Save your money because at this point I have no choice but to trash this item. I had a lot of trouble using it also the water would spill out at times, not always through the hose I had to manually add water to it. I tried purchasing a hose for it, no go. I would say save your money the idea is great but when it stops working there is no support you can get to fix it since its electric."
"I think it is absolutely unacceptable to pay so much for a damaged product. The washer came with all types of dents and dings which indicates the packaging is probably not sustainable because the box had a big tear in it. I’ve decided to keep it because I don’t have the time or strength to repackage and send back to the company and am tired of wasting money on washing my clothes at the laundry mat. Other than it not being aesthetically appealing, it works fine and is easy to put together. I gave two stars because I’m sure the company reads reviews and should know that there have been several complaints regarding the item being delivered damaged and should do something about it. I wouldn’t waste time or money on purchasing this product."
"I’ve been looking at this model for about a year and a half. I finally bought it on a Black Friday deal. I unpacked it and see there is a dent in the side. I was willing to overlook it because it’s just cosmetic. Setup was super easy, so I ran a quick cycle. After making sure it was filling, left the kitchen for about 10 minutes. When I came back, the machine had just finished draining in the sink, but there was water all over the floor! The leak is coming from underneath the machine and not the water connection or the drain hose (maybe the pump?). I can’t even begin to describe how disappointed I am. I don’t even know how I can return it because I had to destroy the packaging to unpack it and it threw it out already. I can’t even take a day off work if the courier can come and pick it up as-is."
"I've had this washing machine for almost a year now. It was great during the pandemic and incredibly useful. Machine washes clothes perfectly. I had no issues installing it to my kitchen sink and it's easy to move around if you buy a wheel dolly to put underneath.  The only negative thing about this machine is that it is ridiculously LOUD! It stresses me out, to be honest. It sounds like grinding metal when it's on the spin-dry cycle. Having a neighbor next to me I try to use it during the day or when he's gone because it's so loud."
"If you can figure out how to use it then great.On the occasions that I’ve been lucky enough to push the right buttons and get it to run, then yes it works….sometimes it’ll wash for 88-90 min., then I’ll get lucky and get a 35 min load from following the idiot instruction booklet.The instruction booklet has to be the absolute worst thing I’ve ever seen and tried to figure out. I’m not stupid, my IQ is well above average and this thing makes no sense to me, I’m also pretty mechanically inclined.As many as these washers that have been sold, at this point someone somewhere might have noticed the complaints about the awful instructions to perhaps want to rewrite them into something resembling easy to understand, step by step instructions. Instead of leaving this mess of vague information spread willy-nilly throughout the booklet.I’ve spent days searching online trying to find answers without success.At this point, I can’t recommend this washer, and if it wasn’t such a pita to pack the 88# thing up and ship it back, it would be gone from my house."
This washer worked for a little. I was able to get a few washing cycles out of it but then it broke. It kept stopping for no reason and wouldn’t wash the clothes.
Received my washer today. Got home from work excited to unbox it and test it out. I brought it inside and cut the straps. Opened up the box and took off the top styrofoam piece. Searched for grab handles but couldn’t get it to come out of box. Ended up cutting down one side of the box and folding it to the side. I could not get the bottom styrofoam off so I laid the washer down and tore it all out. When I went to stand it back up it slipped from a couple inches off the ground and dented up the corner and front of machine. Was really excited and now just PO’d about banging it all up. After I did all that I realized the entire box was supposed to just lift straight up. I could’ve avoided a lot of headache and disappointment if a simple piece of paper with unboxing instructions was put on the top of the machine in the box.
"Using the water inlet is not that easy as you might think before purchasing.1. You will have to turn off the faucet manually after the step sink and step rinse, which means you have to stay aside from this portable washer machine to avoid wasting water and breaking the tube.2. The caliber of the water inlet tube probably will not fit with the faucet that you want to get the water from. Even the caliber fits, a certain amount of water will run aside from the water inlet tube.And what makes my feeling worse is that the price for the same model dropped 43.04 dollars (13%) right after I purchase it."
"I received the washer in a good amount of time. The washer works really well. The clothes are coming out very clean and the spin cycle is great.  I really do love it. Although, it did arrive with a couple of considerable dents & a crack in the back panel. The dents may have happened during delivery as they are perfectly knee height. The washer is light weight & I assume whoever was moving it used their knee to push it around which dented the machine. Also, there is a crack in the back panel where a screw was placed. It was definitely tightened to hard on assembly and cracked. It would’ve been nice if the panel was replaced prior to selling. Otherwise, I am not returning it as it’s just too much trouble and because the washer works very well."
"This is a bummer, I seen ALL the high reviews and bought this after 2 YEARS of keeping my eyes on it. It arrived today in pristine condition. I set it up as directed and on the FIRST FEW SECONDS, the bottom leaked all over my floor :/ how do I fix this? Can you replace this?"
Great space saver. Easy to use. I loved the freedom of staying home to wash instead of going outside and dealing with the hustle and bustle of the process. The hauling the heavy cart up 3 flights of stairs.. But.... It's Not for me because 2 regular loads took me all day into 6 to 8 loads. It would restart when it becomes unbalanced after a violent banging sound. I used up all my laundry soap in two wash days.  Loss of Time and resources made me return it. But it will be great for wshing baby/toddlers clothes. Not big towels or bedsheets. That's what made it restart the most.
"It fits perfect to a small family or small quantities of clothes washing. Able to wash about 4 sweaters, or one bed sheet, or 2 denims, or 6-8 tee shirt ..... Works pretty good. However, one of the issue is the water drainage, found out that it drains the water before the cycle end, and keep filling up water for about 4 - 6 times. It happens when you put the drainage hose down on the floor. Have to watch the wash cycle carefully to prevent that problem."
"Pros:- My clothes are super clean! Like, better than a standard washer, clean.- Small profile for storage purposes.Cons:- Flooded my bathroom, because there is no way to secure the drain hose- Bottom case not put together properly, allowing for a bend in the lower portion.- Weird clicking noise when on the wash cycle. Sounds like banging metal.- The inner tub is a lot smaller than the outside lets on. Doesn't hold very many pieces of clothing.- Customer support for a return is non-existent. Just tell me how I can return it! Wouldn't allow me to chat with someone and just said that I can expect a phone call. We will see how that goes....While my clothes are clean and it makes it way more convenient to do my laundry in my apartment rather than dragging it to the laundry center, after only day 2, it seems to be more hassle than it's worth."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            So in the beginning, I obviously started with the wash cycle. I do not have a hook up to use so I just use a bucket to put the water in and then put the drain hose just sitting in the sink. All was going fine until I started to use the dryer part. I literally had a stand next to it and hold it Because it shakes so much! This is only my first time using it and just setting it up so I’m undecided if I’m gonna keep it. I really wanted to give it a 2 1/2 star but that’s not an option so I don’t know what made me go with the three star I think it’s because I’m a nice person and I feel bad."
But not great for everyday laundering.  Lid broke and the motor was starting to go after about 6 months of use.
"Since there is no rinse cycle, clothes must have detergent residue when they go in the spin tube?"
"I got this machine two days ago and the wash and spin features work surprisingly well. Unfortunately the drain hose is extremely flimsy and was leaking after the first drain. I tried to replace the hose, but the positioning in the machine makes it nearly impossible to get a good seal. Sadly this machine went from great to unusable in 24 hours :/ why not spend $3 more for a sturdier drain hose?"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The water input hose isn’t threaded, so it can’t be hooked up to the sink faucet. My only apparent option is to hold the hose up the the faucet while the tub slowly fills with water, which is not an acceptable use of my time when a decent hose end would do the job. I don’t understand why the manufacturer would cheap out like that. For a nearly $200 purchase I’d have gladly paid a few dollars more to be able to attach the water input hose to the sink. As it is I might as well return it and get a cheaper one if I need to replace the input hose anyway."
Thus far it’s doing the job. I’ve used it 3 times. I will come back after a while…
Needs a longer drain hose and a better water hose to fit all sink nozzles.
The spin cycle stopped working the second time I used it and I was left with a tub of dripping laundry. Returns are als difficult because this is a third party seller so even if the item is defective typically your going to have to pay to return it. I’d stay far away from this one both because of the poor quality and issues around returns.
I plugged the washing machine into our apartment's electric socket but it doesn't even start. I'm about to return it but I cannot find the return label either. I guess I have to return it via USPS using the label with address that sent it to me.
The product I purchased from COSTWAY was not as advertised and COSTWAY made me jump through hoops for a refund. AMAZON cared more about the relationship with COSTWAY than their customer. Buyer beware.
"Couldn't be happier with the product. I was on a budget and desperately needed this product to work. Sadly it didn't, it wouldn't drain on the wash side of the tub and took 4 hours to do what should have taken an hour or maybe an hour and a half at most."
"On the second use, the drain hose cracked and flooded my kitchen. I had to replace it and that wasn’t cheap. Then on the fifth or sixth use the drain pump burned out. Over all, it was not worth buying. Even if everything worked on it correctly, it was still a pain to use. Every step of the washing process has to be performed manually. It was a lot of work to do one small load."
"This washer works great It can hold a nice sized load and it gets my clothes as clean as a regular sized washer. I only have one issue with this item, the hoses are very cheap and flimsy. I’ve only had this about a month or so and the hoses are already broken. There are multiple cracks in the hoses and water sprays all over the floor when I fill it up, I have waterproof tape wrapped all around the hoses to keep it from flooding my floor. I’m just giving this three stars because of the leaking hoses but as far as the performance it does the job."
"My full sized washer broke about a week after I lost my job, so I decided to grab this to wash clothes in the meantime. It washes great, drain kind of sucks (thought it was a motorized drain) but I just get it going into a tote and cover the tip of the hose for suction. But the spinner doesn't spin. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I thought I had too much in there (3 pairs of leggings) but I took those out and put a pair of underwear in there and it still doesn't spin when I turn it on. So my clothes now take longer to dry in my dryer after hand wringing. I cannot lift it to return it, I am disabled and have no help, so I guess it does half the work I thought it would. Am I doing something wrong?"
"The Packaging was beautiful and well done! The machine came unharmed and unscratched etc... But when I started taking off the shrink wrapping from the machine, the lid in particular, I noticed that one side was coming off. when I further accessed why it was doing this, I found that the machine was shrink-wrapped with this piece already broken. Obviously did not go through any kind of inspection at all for the lid is falling off and if you use it, it will break the pin on the other side that is holding the entire lid.  To try the machine out, I had to handle the lid with extremely careful care.  The machine is working and working very well I love it...  I love the rinse option it has,  It works wonderfully, and love the way the machine is crafted, it's excellent!  But I found as its claim that it can be put almost anywhere is way untrue unless you go out and rebuy the hoses that it comes with.  They are extremely cheap and super short and do not work on any faucet in the house. So you end up filling up the machine with water yourself which is more of a hassle than it sounds.  And didn't want to have to do this, which is why you bought the machine in the first place. The power cord is very short so very limiting where you can put the machine unless you use an extension cord. The hardware does not match the magnificence of the machine but without the hardware... you can't use it!  So catch 22... The hoses are so short that they barely reach beyond the machine itself, and so flimsy that they couldn't last more than a month if you do get them to work somehow.  The drain hose is so short, I have the machine sitting inside a standup shower stall right practically on top of the drain and it doesn't reach the drain so you have to just let it go and plan on cleaning the shower after each time you use the washer or do more work emptying the bucket you used.  It's a shame that they used these hoses and hardware on these machines because the machine is awesome!  So if you like it as much you end up going out and spending another small chunk of $ to set it up correctly. and if you do you will be happy with it. it is great.  I am still waiting for the seller to call me back and we will see what they want to do and how to take care of this broken lid."
I like everything about this washer except for the fact that it leaks water from somewhere in the back right region. I set everything up and did a load of laundry everything worked fine but then I realized the mat that I had this sitting on was completely soaking wet with water which wasn’t coming from the drain pipe or any of the other hoses that water may come from.
Works for a single person. Worked decent until it stopped working. Easy to use. Did great getting water out of clothes. Moved alot. Semi-noise. Agitation was decent. Was super durable until stopped working after a couple washes.
The plastic cracked at the bottom of the washer and started leaking after only a few uses. The company did not respond to me when I messaged them. Great unit in concept but very cheaply made and no company support
I have to give this seller a low score my machine lasted only 6 month and I tried to get my money back because it suppose to last longer .If I would had known I never should have bought it .He sent me a return tag that was not readable to the scanning .i wrote again and nothing highly disappointed
"The instruction manual is absolutely useless unless you understand a 1st grader's use of grammar and comprehension of the English language. The washing side holds much less than advertised and the spin side is half that.2 pairs of pants, or 4 T-shirts, or 6 pairs of socks and underwear. It needs to be ran twice to get all the soap out if you use pods."
The first wash worked great. The second time nothing but a lot of clucking sounds but no action. I dumped out all of the water and tried again but nothing happened.
"I like that I can reuse the wash water. It spins water out quite well. Clothes do smell clean after.Draining the water out of the machine is difficult as the drain hose is so low. I have it on a couple of milk crates but it shifts during the wash and spin cycles. I do not want to put it in my tub as it would be hard on my back and my tub does not drain fast. (old tub)Tax not included for $180 I paid it is worth it. But it is time consuming because I only wash a few items at a time.  (6-8 clothing items, two towels)  Any more items would not clean as well and I spin only half at a time.Do expect to spill water, it will happen."
"It was a ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ purchase..  quiet, did what it was designed to do.. and one evening, 3 months in, small loads always, it just decided to stop spin drying my friggin clothes..  but I bought the warranty insurance so they replaced my money immediately..  now I have another brand, more expensive, but it doesn't pump the water out..  it is gravity draining, which means, in the bathtub..  but the other washer still washes and pumps into the toilet, so I kinda made out (2 washers and 1 slightly larger spinning machine..  9.5 lbs, I think) , if I want to try to look at this positive..  lol  ..  Shop around.. is all I can suggest.."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The washer part worked great, however, and as you can see in the video I didn't even fill the dryer bit all the way (there was only two shirts, and like 2 socks) I had just gotten it literally today, this was the first load I tried... so what's the problem??? It's a small load, and yet it's making a high pitched kinda ringing noise and shaking even though its on a flat surface and the laundry is spread as evenly as possible. I live in an apartment, second floor, the whole reason why I got this in the first place was so that way I could do my laundry without having to use the laundry facilities that cost me an arm and a leg and I don't have time to sit around in a landromat. I did everything the instructions and previous reviews said to do and yet I still get this. I would assume this might be a manufacturing error or something."
"I love this machine and how it washes but I thought it was a washer/dryer when I got it I had to contact the seller because my clothes was not drying that's when I was informed that they will take ""dryer"" off the description online because there is no dryer"
"It works, but has two screws going through the bottom and leaks. When you drain it it floods the floor and does not go through the tube."
"I loved this washing machine, it was perfect for my small apartment and worked really well. However, after 20 or so washes it started leaking from everywhere, so I’m going to have to get rid of it"
"I bought this because I am temporarily living in a camper and it is more convenient to do my laundry at home and line dry it instead of going to the laundromat. It worked impressively at first. The spin cycle got the clothes to where they were barely damp and so they dried quickly. But then, the spin stopped working. Which basically make the whole unit unusable."
"I purchased this item to make do for laundry; however the hoses ended up getting holes with in four uses, the drain isn’t strong and it never left my clothes clean enough, it shakes and makes rattling noises easily and isn’t worth the hassle. Just got to the laundromat and save yourself the trouble."
"It works, you will have to get it up higher to drain it properly I'd recommend a stool or bench over setting it in the tub because it plugs up to the wall relatively low in the back. The spinner will actually get small garments dry if you run them in very small amounts or on their own. Here's where the issue is: after the first use of the spinner the rattling and bumping around described in other reviews started. I looked insidethe spinner between the machine and the bucket and the bucket was damaged I cant see what's cutting into it (most likely the rubber smell) if you kind of re-center the bucket the rattling stops and it runs normal without all the bumping and no rubber smell. Worth buying? I'm not sure I may send it back because I'm not sure it will last with a defect like that."
It is compact and fits in my bathroom
I like it against the job done I just don't like that attachments they stand for the water were short
"Washer worked well for the 6 months it did. Literally went in to spin the clothes and the motor for both sides is done. Time still ticks, but no washer or spinner movement. Pretty disappointed. My last one (was bigger and from a different brand) lasted 2 years. This one only lasted 6 months."
"I’m not sure why it is advertised as ‘super quiet.’ The dryer function shakes the entire machine so hard and loud that it moved from one part of my bathroom to another. It sounded like a car crash! I live in an apartment so I thought I’d try this out but the noise level is ridiculous. It also does not drain properly and leaves the clothes fully soapy, with no instructions in the box. I’m sending this back. Good riddance."
"Stopped working after only 3 months! So disappointed, it was Amazing until it was not! Broke down n stopped working right when the warranty was up. Now I'm out $150 bucks it sucks, I'm Lucky if I got more then 10 washes out of it"
This machine is not what I was expecting. I only have about 10 items which are t-shirts for a small person three pairs of very small ankle socks and one undergarment and the machine barely has any power to spend and wash my items at all it seems as if it's going to be impossible to get any laundry done it's horrible I was under the impression that it's powerful and durable and it's way smaller than what I read about I'm very disappointed. I would say order a machine from a different company do not get this one I do not recommend it!
"I’ve had 2 portable washers in the past that lasted until I gave them away.  Well I decided I wanted to go back to using one.  This one arrived on time and well packaged. But as I was filling with water, it was draining right out from underneath onto the floor. Thank goodness I was sitting there and didn’t walk away for a min,  like I could do when filling my past units. And it’s a lot heavier than past 2"
"Yeah, don't wash anything valuable with this because it destroys it. 3 pictures of reference. 1 is a white pair of underwear elastic band perfectly preserved with normal front-load washers. the other 2 are another pair that I just washed with this and the elastic band is so roughed up it's not wearable anymore. I don't even understand how something like this could damage clothes so badly.Also there is an ungodly amount of lint left on everything after a cycle, the lint filter that's installed is basically useless."

"Purchased unit on February 20,2024:-Around day 35 of purchase: The input hose that connects from your sink to your washer broke down and leaking leaving it unusable. Unable to return unit as it was past 30 day return unit. Amazon doesn’t sell replacement hose.-Day 60 of ownership: Drain hose leaking leaving the entire unit unusable until I I find a replacement drain hose. Contacted seller and told no warranty after 30 days and seller doesn’t sell replacement hoses.Moral of the review: Do not buy this portable washer as DOES NOT LAST and it will break down a little after the 30 day return window and not worth the money. You will get no help from the amazon and the seller since it is past the 30 day return period. Hoses are not easily found and are expensive if you find them."
We have had this washer for only two months. The drying cycle only spins streamline slow now. There is not an uneven load or too much water. It just stopped working. Waste of money.
"Don’t buy this, it’s a hassle to return and the spin cycle side will stop working almost right away. My first one of these worked great….for almost three whole weeks of light use. When it stopped working I hoped I just got a lemon and since I liked it so much during its brief time functioning I returned the failed one and bought another one to replace it. Well the new one just broke the second time I used it! So if you need to wash clothes don’t get this machine, all you’ll be doing is dealing with the hassles of returning something and having your laundry still needing to be done :("
"It’s not quiet at all ! So loud I turned it off right after turning it on, it’s light weight but didn’t work…. in my opinion, not worth the price."
"It’s small. But big enough to do 1 queens bed sheet, Just one at a time. But not blankets."
"On the 1st wash cycle it leaked all the water, wouldn't drain and the spinning shook the whole device and eventually stopped working. The hoses were too short, flimsy and cracked. Bb Keep in mind, I have to pack it back and find someone to drop it off at UPS cuz it is too heavy for me. For all that trouble ishould just  trash it but I want my moneyGback, anyone find a better washer."
"Overall it's a great little washer, especially living in an apartment. The reason for 3 stars is because it came with the lid hinge busted, and the instructions manual isn't even for the model I ordered."
Good price.A bit small.Better to prop up on top of a wide rolling cart and place next to the bathtub. Use a shower hose to fill up.
1st time using it a screw from the main washing motor fell off. It's connected on the bottom plastic vent and no sturdy bracket that it should supposedly be screwed at. There was a small leak coming off the side of the spinner. Will update review after a month if it survive on once a week usage.
This product says it washes small loads great but it does not and the clothes smell sour afterwards even though they were put in a dryer
Not even what it shows the dryer don’t dry and it’s only like 5 minutes to dry
Waited 2 weeks for delivery open it up hinge is broken now I have to wait months for a refund or new one. And have to pay to ship it back.
The hoses were dry rotten and broke after second use!!
"Washed a couple of my work shirts. that went very well i thought, until i put them in the spin part and it it leaking water out the bottom. not sure what’s wrong with it but i feel i wasted 130 bucks :/"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I do NOT recommend this washer. I used it one day, and the second time, it stopped working. The spinner stopped first. It made a buzzing sound and would not spin. Then the washer side wouldn't work. I wouldn't recommend this wash machine. I have to try and start a return and figure out how to get my money back. Not having a car and having to do all this is going to add to the stress. Definitely not worth the money. I followed the instructions on using the wash machine. I didn't over load it. I don't understand how something that cost this much broke so easily."
Drain pump stop working after 30 days so it doesn’t drain water out I have to manually flip the washing machine upside to get the water out.
This too small. It's for kids
So this was shipped to me in November 2023 and I received it. It was great at first not now. now it is June 7th 2024 and the washer side works but the spin side quit all together now I wish I would not have spent that $128.00+ on it.
Id get a different one
It was too small and the capacity that was delivered was incorrect. It is not 17.6 lbs.
"I was very excited for this item. When I unboxed  it, I was pleased with the aesthetics. Unfortunately, when I hooked it up, it just did not work. It filled with water and then did absolutely nothing. I’m assuming it’s a faulty motor or something.Now I’m left with figuring out how to drain and dry this thing out so that I can return it."
I COULD NOT GIVE THIS PRODUCT A 0 STAR BECAUSE YOU WONT BE ABLE TO SEE MY REVIEW!!! WASHER DOES NOT SPIN IF YOU PUT 3 OR MORE ITEMS IN THE WASH SECTION! THE SPINNER IS VERY SMALL BUT IT ACTUALLY IS THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT IT GETS THE CLOTHES REALLY DRY BUT IT IS VERY VERY SMALL . THIS WASHER STOPED WORKING AFTER 4 LOADS ! NOT A GOOD PRODUCT DON BELIEVE THE REVIEWS!
"I ordered one in april, the one we recieved was dirty and used. It took two weeks to get a new replacement machine (in may), that ended up breaking in june. Now we are asking for a refund or a new machine and no one is responding to our messages or emails. buy a miniwasher from anyone else other than these people! they are a SCAM!"
The machine worked fine at first and I loved it but it died after 4 months. The machine was only used a total of 6 times.
Not really great customer service. I returned the item and didn't get a full refund. I was so excited for this item but it did not fit in my tub. It needs to drain so it has to be somewhere where the tube points down to drain. I tried to extend the hose to drain into my sink or into a bucket but nothing really worked. Unless you did your research this product is not worth the waste of time and money.
STAY AWAY - PRODUCT HARDLY WORKEED FOR A WEEK and NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AFTER THAT. WASTE OF MONEY. SAVE $150
"This item worked once and now it's done. Best of all, you, as the purchaser, are responsible for paying to send it back!! This isn't our first portable washing machine, unfortunately it is the worst. We're canceling our return and having it fixed. It's cheaper than shipping."
It’s shaking so bad in the spin cycle… how to fix that
This stopped spinning the clothes less than a month of having it. Company is not willing to replace or refund money after reaching out to me. Total waste of time and money.
"Very Bad Shopping experience. The product is from the USA, which has different voltage as EU one. Therefore, the machine operates in an unnormal way. During the usage, there is nobody can be found asking for wrong operation... It's super comlicated to wash clothes with this machine. Not worthy at ALL. Returning on the way now"
I had other washers similar to this over the years that lasted years. This only lasted 5 months. I would never buy anything from this company ever again. If you can afford to throw away over a hundred bucks have at it.
Not worth it. Had to return it. Stop working after 10 minutes.
It broke a couple of days after the return window closed for Amazon. The motor for the washer doesn't spin anymore. What a waste. I emailed them and got no reply.
"UPDATE: simple fix. Screw came loose.The motor went out and I haven’t even had this a month, three weeks maybe. I got it sept. 17 and it’s now October 2nd.Not happy at all!"
This machine worked once and then it stopped. It’s super loud and does not work as advertised. I tried returning it and seller makes you pay for the postage for return. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!!!!
Used it once and it smelled like burned rubber. And that was only washing two under Armour dry fit shirts. The spin cycle on the “dryer” end worked ok but still left enough water in the shirts to have to wring them out and then properly dry them.
Washing machine doesn't want to drain no more.
It turned off and started to smoke from the split wire .not a great product in my  opinion
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            TERRIBLE machine !!! second time using and it’s completely broken!! I didn’t overload it I only put about 10 pieces of INFANT clothing in it, It won’t spin at all ! A piece of JUNK! do not waste your money!!"
Very short cheap hose does not reach sink water machine must be lifted on a stool to use
I purchased this on April 10th and it’s May 3rd. I’ve used it maybe 3-4 times and it already broke. I would definitely recommend a different brand.
It had a hose leak and was leaking from the bottom. It was working great then bam. I liked it a lot I did reorder.
This machine came two weeks after is not working I wish they can give me my money back
The washer part is great. I love it and I love how clean it gets out clothes. The spinner however only worked once before the motor burnt-out.
Picture show it opens in the front and has shelves the one I received doesn’t open at all. This is false advertising.
"Work perfect for a month, then it stop working."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                First day I used it it was cutting out and then it just quit washing and spinning
This item Is a toy GdZ
Does not come with simple instructions and not big  enough
The washer doesn’t spin anymore
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I'm super disappointed.  I've been looking forward to it all week, only to come home to this!!"
"I’ve had this since end of January and thought it would be good to keep up on laundry, work scrubs and shirts because the cost of doing laundry in an apartment is VERY high. It’s been doing ok but I haven’t really used it much but tonight I put a load in and it filled up but wouldn’t wash or spin. Had to put the laundry in the bathtub 😡 not sure what happened 🤦🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ I will be turning in a return!"
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The machine is good to wash except the spin motor broke
"For a small machine, it generates an unacceptable amount of noise and vibration. During spin cycles, it emits a loud, rattling sound that can be heard throughout the house. This disrupts daily activities and makes it difficult to use the machine during quieter hours.The performance is abysmal. The washing cycles are excessively long, sometimes lasting twice as long as stated in the manual. This not only wastes time but also consumes more electricity and water than expected for such a small machine."
UPDATE ***** it worked great for 3 weeks but now there is quite loud clicking coming from underneath and my agitation isn't as strong. I had hopes in the beginning.  everything you will read after this is the initial review:  like the fact that someone decided to ditch the second tub idea as a spinner.  It allows a larger wash area to contain more clothes. I was pleasantly surprised at how many clothes I could put in this washer and the motor is strong enough to agitate them properly.  It's built in typical cheap plastic With a somewhat flimsy lid.  It does not let you operate with the lid up.  I have gone through three different apartment size washing machines all under $100 in the past 3 years.  This one has the largest capacity and has one of the stronger motors. I'm able to wash jeans and blankets  While it does work right now time will tell because I have had these motors go out before.  It definitely functions quite adequately but is certainly no frills.
"It came many days late. Hooked it up & put three towels in to give them a wash. It ran for about 5-8 minutes, then it just stoped. I came back here to look for real instructions and they are vague here. Then it mentions a brake for the motor to event overheating. Did it? Is it? How does one reset it? What does one do in the event this happens? Anyone? Consult the manual… the manual? Not a word in the itty bitty little booklet that came along. Useless manual. So… now waiting to see if the machine resets, turns off its brake, or what happens next. Plug out? I’m disappointed so far. I will update this if I do not return it."
"I plugged this in dry and turned on the wash mode. The timer started clicking and I could hear the click as the agitator motor was supposed to start and stop but nothing happened. After about 10 minutes of fiddling with the knobs it spontaneously started spinning, so I thought I'd chance a very small load of laundry. It span once and then became a cumbersome bucket full of soapy wet clothes I now had to hand wash.Returning it immediately.Please know that wasn't user error, I was using a similar machine for 2 years before it sprang a leak. I know the limits of these machines and well, empty shouldn't be a problem.UPDATE: After searching everywhere for a machine with the same specs and not finding one, I ordered this again. What I received was AN OPEN BOX RETURN addressed to Brian in Hawaii even though I paid for a NEW item. Amazon refused a partial refund even though I was willing to keep the machine (because I cannot beat the thought of a second going to landfill).Bad customer service all round!"
"The instructions were unclear on how to use the washing machine. Half of the instruction book is safety warnings. It’s not complicated to use once you learn how to properly use it. You have to connect a hose to the machine and hold the other end under the faucet to get the water in for use a bucket to add water. Either way is time consuming, and you’d use the same amount of time washing your clothes by hand in the sink or tub. Mine came unlabeled, so I had to put a piece of cardboard under one of the legs to stabilize it. After the wash cycle is done, you have to drain the washer. take out your clothes, insert the spinner, put your clothes in the spinner and put it on spin cycle. The spinner doesn’t hold much clothes, so you may have to separate your load into different spin cycles. I recommend looking for this specific brand on YouTube for an instruction tutorial on how to use it. Also, don’t use too much soap or you will have to do extra rinse cycles. It’s nosier than I was expecting."
It's really is only for students that have like just you know a handful of shirts and a handful of pants to wash at a time but if you're trying to wash you know your covers if you're trying to watch sweaters this thing might burn out if you actually try to do a full load of laundry from me using it and how it started acting it seems like it can only run for about 45 minutes anything other than that and it starts to overheat you're going to smell like a burning smell and it starts to overheat and especially as the unit gets older and older and starts building up more and more lint from your clothes the chance of it catching on fire pretty high if you go over 45 minutes so yeah by the first time I started using it I used for like 45 minutes I started smelling a burning smell somehow it had Lent in the bottom of it even though this is my first time using it so it should not have had any lint buildup or anything like that I heard some others on the other wall of me and my building they had one so I'm like it's just their old used one and they you know the company she made anything that I was buying a new one when I was buying old one the dryness sucks it won't dry your clothes you'll ring it out at best is what it equates to value for money correct power if you only have like I said about two shirts in there and that's really it it's pretty powerful but if you add even one more shirt or one more pair of pants a pair of socks then it's not worth it it's barely even able to spend which means it's definitely not even cleaning your clothes it needs to be able to spend very fast capacity sucks drying time sucks noise pretty good and since it's skip that one I'll say it again Capacity sucks
It was just fine just don't put no jeans in this machine because it won't spin..
Washer is great love it. Just know lot of little steps to way the clothes but I do not mind. Dryer was walking away from me from how much machine moves.
After about 6 months stopped working but worked great for time being
No automatic drain and spin barrel to small
"I really like this little washer. Convenient for a small load. Or in between going to laundromat. The washer side is great and so is the dryer side. Really surprised how dry it leaves the clothes. Only one problem , I was putting it away moving off of the counter when I noticed a dust of rubber underneath , mind you this is my first day using this. I looked underneath, and it appears to be a rubber belt , idk what’s it’s purpose but it looks like it might be rubbing up on something to its scrapping it leaving rubber dust all over underneath and falling thru. I’m not sure how long till it breaks apart. There’s no way of even getting a hold of customer support for this. Might just return before it’s too late."
"I purchased this washer to wash my uniform pants, tees and socks in order to skip the walk to laundry room.  First the cord is short and it states you can't use extension cord.  I used bucket to fill up water.  It washes well.  As you can see the dirty water in second pic.  Don't use too much detergent.  Your better off wringing your clothes by hand because the spinner doesn't work well and all it does is cause noise and move the machine around.  I had to sit there and hold the machine.  I tried it 3 times with different amount of clothes but still the same result.  It's lightweight and compact.  Other than that it does wash well but emptying out the water, wringing your clothes, spinning clothes little by little, filling up with water and sitting there to hold machine is just too much work for me.  I'll keep walking to laundry room.  I'm returning it."
"I am disappointed with this product and I wish I could get my money back.After all the hype and expectations, I was excited to buy this deco home portable washing machine, but what a disappointment it is, at this point, I would have already be made recommendations to other people to by the same, but now, how do I fix my face to say to these same people, that ether this product is still in its experimental development stage, I was the customer” gunny pig” and sad to say, this experiment failed.I unboxed and use the portable washing machine for the first time yesterday. There was a clicking sound coming from the timer and that’s the only thing that was working on this washing machine.  As for the twisting at the bottom, I heard it, only after several times playing with the niggle, but trust me, there was no washing going on in that bucket at all, and then  I thought it had some time to do with the voltage or watts, but my research yield that this was not the case, I made several attempts to wash my clothes, but then I gave up, the thing is a  failure,  and I want a full refund.Question what about quality control, are these things not tested before you allow them to leave your factory, and yes, I see there is a one year warranty, but because I live outside the UNITED STATES, it would be too costly to return, and so there goes my lost. I thought that in the long run, I would save, but all I have in my bathroom is a plastic barrel which I currently have no use for. I will research what legal rights I have in this matter. What a complete disappointment and a waste of my hard-earned money.  this is a great idea, however, especially in taught times where people like myself are trying to find ways to the same money, under the right conditions this product would be an asset to me. but guess I am that unlucky sucker. dam!"
It washes ok but does not spin the clothes well at all- the spin tub constantly shifts off the slots and my clothes are still dripping once it is done.I had to get this because it was smaller. I had a Costway with the separate washer and spin tub- it is exceptional. It was just too big for my small RV. Wish I had not given it away.  This one is not worth the money... go with the Costway.
Very difficult to keep spin cycle from spinning out of control.
After running for few minutes it gets too warm and I can tell as it starts giving off sort of a burning smell a little bit. Why is that?
It’s actually not big at all. The spin section is way smaller and will only fit maybe a t shirt or two. But it’s not going to fit my robe. The washer MAY. I don’t know if it’s worth it. Now if the spin section was a big as the wash section maybe. Not suitable for what I needed. I think it might be a waste of space for me personally! But I can see it’s use.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This is a wonderful little washer and perfect for one person's everyday items. It's very simple to use. I would have given it higher rating if the hoses for water intake and drainage were much longer.I purchased a compact appliance dolly to sit the washer on, raised it up several inches. Plus super easy to more when I need. (Get one you won't regret it)Overall I have done about 10 or 12 loads so far and have been very pleased.Update: October 29, 2024I have owned it for 14 months and now it will not spin and drain out the water. Everything is plastic, which I understood and took extreme care not to over load etc. So for over $267 or approximately $19 per month, it is not worth purchasing again.Just creates more waste"
I don't like this item  it's a joke don't waste money on this.
It is loud to me. Not sure if I can find a new belt if I need it. Cord is to short. Does good on washing. Could be little better.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Squeaky sound while washing machine in use. Other things were okay. Drain pipe is short and weird location of power line, water supply line and drain pipe."
Alot bigger then my other portable washer.  It just needs longer electric cord and hose. I was able to manage by using the water hose from other washer and a few zip ties for the drain hose.
Noise Dryness quality  not good enough
"When it works it’s great! However, I can only do about 3 cycles before it stops working. If I let it sit for about 5 sometimes 10 minutes then it works great...till it stops. The instructions are incomplete. So, I wasn’t able to see if this is normal, if I’m doing something wrong, how to troubleshoot. Luckily they make it easy to reach customer service (I checked this before I purchased.) So, I hope to hear back from them when they open in the morning."
I would not recommend heavy items. One towel and a couple light weight shirts. One pair of jeans and underwear. Just make your loads light enough because the agitator can not handle all that this descriptions claims it can.
At the beginning it works just perfect 🤩 but after two months 👎 no good anymore
"This is Great for socks, chonies, T-Shirts.  Will Not work with One pair of pants or One towel.  Other than that, I love this little thing.."
The wash cycle works okay but the spin cycle leaves a lot to be desired. Spin pretty much doesn't work.
I was loving this perfect little machine. I was so happy laundry was being managed and then boom all off a sudden in the middle of a wash session. It stopped working. So it’s up to you if you want to purchase. It’s a roll of the dice
"It does only small light washes .  No beddings or towels.  Otherwise it works well.  The heavy washers were always out of stock, unfortunately, so I opted this washer.  I do like the washer for what it can do."
Needs a lot of work on the spin cycleWash cycle works good.
There was a very strong chemical smell as soon as I opened the box. When attaching the rat guard I noticed what looks like old dirty rusty water stains in the drain hose. Also I can hear what sounds like a lot of water swishing around in the machine. I can't see it. Advertisement mentions there may be some condensation left from testing before shipping. Looking at the drain hose it makes me wonder how long ago was it tested and why didn't they drain all the water out?
I got what I paid for
"Too noisy, neighbors complain"
Broke after a month of use is a big hassle to use as well
"While not anything like a traditional washer (which I knew when buying), it did serve the purpose. While it holds plenty, the tricky part is when you have to spin the clothing, which requires you to remove all the soaking wet clothing and put it piece by piece into a small bucket that you spin the water out. That takes forever but is necessary for the clothing to dry and not drip on everything. We had planned on keeping it but after 3 days it stopped working so we returned and went to the local laundromat instead. 2 out of 5 stars ⭐️"
"This was m second portable washer, Really wish I still had the first, this unit is smaller, way less agitation as the slightly larger model and Ths doesn’t hold nearly as much"
this is great for washing but not for the spinning cycle. I couldn't get my clothes or sheets to wring out whatsoever! I have tried everything still the clothes won't wrong out.  They come out sopping wet.
It stopped spinning after a few loads. Waste of money
It didn't want to run after a short time..wish I didn't buy it
I would return this if I could but I missed the return window :/It seems like a good  product if yours works.
Got rid of it after about a month. It’s too much of a hassle. It’s so loud bc it shakes like crazy all over the floor
"Bought this to wash my 3 month old daughters clothes. It’s actually more than expected. The hose to run water into the washer is flimsy and has no length…Therefore, I have to lift a container filled with a few time to fill up the washer and only a few things can spin at a time.Convenient but not my favorite."
"Complete garbage! First time using it literally leaked all over the floor, and I waited too long to return it, just got back from my travels and didn’t have time to set it up or anything and the first time I use it there’s water all over my floor and it’s just uncalled for"
"The spinner is junk, when trying to use it, it will not stay in place. Cannot return it for the boxes got thrown away."
I bought this machine thinking it would make my work easy .it making me do all the work ..
The power on this washing machine wasn’t what I expected it cannot handle jeans or pants like it says on the description very disappointed it doesn’t have enough power to spin pants or jeans and I only put 2 . I was expecting more I have other machine smaller but side by side wash and spins it has double the power of this one that I just bought. I don’t recommend buy in it .
"Very nice little machine. It leaks a little from the bottom- I wanted to exchange because it’s a nice machine. They don’t accept exchanges- I have to return and buy again- not a big deal, but the company should be reaching out and trying to help me with exchange. Hence the one star."
"I’ve had it for two months and it has stopped working, I loved and all of a sudden mid wash it stopped washing everything else is working fine but to wash it stopped. I did this to save money not have to waste more I would really like a new one or a refund."
"Large capacity, good washing action, spin cycle poor, very difficult to keep the spin basket from flying out of place.  Returned due to spin basket"
"I would never buy this machine again. Use one time and the thing dies. Does not spin or anything will not wash Or rinse or even drain. Please Reconsider if you think of purchasing this machine. Honestly , I think they sent me a use machine. Most likely a Returned item."
Doesn’t wash like it says and the drain isn’t long enough
Hard to use and some parts may be missing barely can fit one cool thing item
The worst purchase ever from Amazon. This machine is a complete joke. The spin cycle is the worst the spin little bucket does not stay in place clothes are still super soaked. The drain hose is tiny and short. COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT. NO STARS !
I am absolutely disappointed by this attempt at a washing machine.  It is the size of a toy machine and the connectors don’t fit.  I show it next to my old machine which speaks volumes
I gas it for less than 30 days and it completely stopped working. I don't suggest buying it.
waste of money
This is bad
I was so excited when it came and I was able to get small chores done but after about a month it has stopped working.  I live in Hawaii so I'm not sure if I should return it or just throw away.  I can't find a help line for assistance.
It overheats and starts smoking.  Then it stops working after 2 weeks.
The drum does not stay locked no matter how much clothes are in it. It comes out the brackets and bounces all over the machine. I just use the washing part. The rest is a hassle.
The hose is so short on it.
Spin basket keeps popping out and more trouble than worth the $$$ spent.
"I had to get this washer replaced once , then got the second one refunded ... first one as soon as I used it and it smelled like it was burning, I got scared unplugged it drained out the water and had to hand ring out clothes. Not fun... I returned that one second one came washed clothes ... time to spin what a disaster as soon as the tiny lil spinner started it smelled like it was burning the spinner came off the middle.... I was over this machine the scary smell of burning this is not safe or worth the money"
Was delivered today. Opened it up looks good put some clothes in detergent in start filling with water only for the water to drain right out. Absolutely trash. I've contacted the beach people selling it 3 times to now avail. Please believe me when I say I will reverse the charges for selling me a defective item.
baught in march worked fine up until 3 days ago timer still works and spin dry side stil workes washer side will not come on cant return as the return period ended in april unfortunately very disappointing i only used this item to wash soiled undergarments during potty training so couldnt of broke from being to much clothes in it or anything
This machine never worked right I live in a tiny apartment and thought it when great Well the spin bucket just flew off and doesn't stay attached 😣 so not impressed
"this product is the worst purchase i've made from amazon it's like a large toy for children it washes ok but does not spin the clothes out , i wish i had never bought it . but i could not return for a refund because i could not get a return lable sent to my e-mail but its a purchase i will have to eat the cost on but i can promise you this i will tell everyone not to buy oneso maybe they will not be out the $ money"
Washing excellent but it doesn’t spin very well
This machine does not come with installation instructions
"The item broke after one wash and in the middle of my first spin cycle. I washed two jeans originally, but decided to just spin one pair of jeans to see exactly how well it wrings out water. The machine suddenly made a strange noise after 5 minutes and stopped spinning altogether. The whole machine is made of plastic really, and I shouldn’t be so surprised that it barely worked. I definitely would never recommend this machine or will I plan to buy from this company again."
This is ridiculous Amazon. Give back my money!!!! Why should I have to pay for defective merchandise to get my account refunded???...
"This machine leakes immediately , dryer part is useless.  Just skip this one"
"I should have read the previous reviews. I got one wash out of it. About 3 t-shits and then the washer ceased to function. The timer still works and so does the spin dryer, but washer that doesn't wash. Waste of time money and effort. Save your money for a different brand."
"We tried every wash setting and none of them spun out our loads enough to dry in less than 3 hours.  We even did extra spin cycles, it just doesn't spin enough to get the water out of the load."
I’ve had a couple of these this one is my favorite for sure…And it fits perfect in my RV shower love this ❤️
It does not wash properly
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Didn't come with parts to hold down the spinner tub. Very noisy. Doesn't work
So the machine smells like it’s burning out after one use not recommended not worth the money and it only washes 5 pieces of clothing and spins only 1 so definitely waist of time
"Washer side never worked, would have returned it immediately but we loved the spinner, which worked very well until recently when it just stopped working. Now after 6 months the whole device is useless."
It's great size for my apartment but it quit working after only 3 months and is to expensive to only last me 3 months. If it would have last 7 more months I wouldn't even complain
spinner broke before 6 months of use.  do not recommend
"I returned this product, it is very simple and light."
It is noisy.  It washes OK.
Dislike the dented portable washer and box also not enough power so it’s sitting out back collecting dust
It shakes and moves during spin cycle. It moved so much that the drain hose moved out of place causing water to flow on the floor.
It hasn’t even been a year since I bought it and it no longer works!!! Save your money instead!!!
I used this washer 3 times and already it doesn't work. Seems like the motor is already blown. Much better quality ones online you can buy. Don't buy this one
Do not purchase this item after one use it over heats and you have to wait a long time for it to cool off to use again and the spinner leaves the clothes drenched
Very poor quality. Destroyed my clothes.
"Very disappointed, not what , I expected. This was a waste of my money, this is garbage , like really. I bought this in March now, I need a new machine. Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage."
We didn’t use the washer because we couldn’t even get it to fill up with water. Sending it back
To much work just to wash clothes. It only washes once but what happens when you have to rinse you have to put more water in it and dump out the water again. Wouldn’t recommend.
"It broked really fast, like the same day I first use. I had really high expectations and was a disappointment. Too bad."
"Cannot fit on regular faucet, very fragile"
"Missing inner bucket, lid, and inlet hose. I had to return it."
1rst Try It Didn't Work At ALL
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            First of all, the hose they sent does not fit any of the fixtures in my house, or the water heater. After searching two stores, I bought the right hose, but it leaked water EVERYWHERE, from the back of the unit. My floor is damaged now."
"The first washer that I received didn’t work. The control panel lit up and I could change the program settings but beyond that nothing happened. It never made a sound. I called the customer support phone number and got a message saying that this was their busy period and I would do better to send an email. I did that and got a rapid initial reply. We emailed back and forth for several days. Their replies were very polite and said how much they wanted to resolve my problem. The thing is, if they would have picked up the phone and called me, we could have accomplished more in five minutes than we did in five days. Anyway, they ended up saying that I should contact Amazon about getting a replacement. I did that and that process went exceptionally well. The replacement did work.There were a couple of additional quality issues that I noticed when unpacking the first machine. There was a small break in the plastic shroud for the interior tub and the back access panel wasn't properly closed. It was a simple matter to snap the panel into place. The second unit suffered from the same panel deficiency.I have done one load in the second machine and it ran quietly and smoothly.One thing that seems unusual to me is that the outer case of the machine is a soft plastic material. It easily flexes. I don't know that this is a problem, but I'm surprised that they didn't use a more rigid plastic.Another thing is that only one of the four feet is adjustable for leveling. It doesn't seem like this will work very well.The instructions are not easy to understand. Word usage and sentence structure could be better. I'm guessing that no one fluent in English ever proofread it.The control panel shows 10 modes of operation but nowhere do they explain what each does.So, how do I rate this product? The first unit would get only one star. I think the second unit will be fine, but I don’t think that it is exceptional enough to warrant 5 stars. I automatically deduct one star for especially poor instructions. Taking all of this into account, I am giving a 3-star rating for the overall experience.UPDATE: From response to my email inquiry. I thought this might be helpful to others.Explanation of the 10 Programs(Common Use): This program is designed for general washing of regular clothes.(Standard): Suitable for washing clothes that are generally dirty and need frequent changing.(Heavy Duty): Used for washing large or heavily soiled items such as bed sheets and covers.(Quick Wash): Ideal for washing lightly soiled clothes in a shorter amount of time.(Soak Wash): Suitable for very dirty clothes. Clothes are soaked in the washing solution for a period before washing to help remove stains more effectively.(Wash Only): This program runs only the washing cycle.(Wash and Rinse): Used for clothes that are prone to wrinkling, without a spin cycle.(Rinse and Spin): Ideal for hand-washed clothes that need rinsing and spinning.(Spin Only): This program runs only the spin cycle.(Tub Air Dry): This program air-dries the inner and outer tubs of the washing machine to keep them dry and prevent mold growth."
"A very small product, which is not for me"
"Damaged, upon delivery, but the box was not damaged. Looks like it happened in manufacturing. Will be returning."
"Portable washer came damaged , on the inside tried to run it was leaking and it wouldn’t spin at all . DO NOT RECOMMEND."
I don't know how this is a portable anything because it is HUGE. There is no way you could travel with this making it useless to me. I honestly cannot think of a purpose this would have. I would not recommend this product based on the description in the listing.
It Says That You Can Wash The Clothes Without The Use Of The Water Connector But That Is False. I Have The Water Connector Inside The Washing Machine But It Doesn’t Fit Any Household Sinks… So It Won’t Wash The Clothes Without Using The Connector. I Felt Like My Mom Wasted Her Money Trying To Buy This For Me… The Only Time It Moves Is If I Press The Rinse Option Or Air Dry.
"Firstly, look at reviews all over the internet, this is a common problem that GE can’t or won’t fix. This thing doesn’t dry clothes. I’m not talking about slight dampness, I mean wet or soaked clothes. We have to run the dry cycle 3-4 times even with small loads  to get our clothes dry, and by then they’re very wrinkly. GE has been useless, taking over a month to get me an appointment. The day of the appointment the first time they didn’t show up, and rescheduled for 2 weeks later. This time they sent me parts so the tech could install them (how would they know what’s wrong without looking at it?). The tech was supposed to call before he came, but didn’t. He came and told me that he’s never seen one of these machines and had no idea what he’s doing. He managed to install one of the parts, but didn’t install the other one. Machine still isn’t drying clothes. They’re hardly warm after the initial dry cycle. I’ve contacted GE half a dozen times and am lucky if anyone responds to me, and if they do, it’s multiple days later, and they provide zero help. I’m stuck with a $2500 machine that doesn’t work. If GE wants to make this right, come take this thing off my hands and bring me a normal stackable washer and dryer. I’ll take the loss of the difference between them."
"The machine stopped working around mid June 2024. We bought this November 29, 2023. The machine did not drain at the end of the wash cycle and there are water left with the clothes. We took out the clothes, squeezed the water out and put them to dry. However, the dryer did not work either.  We scheduled to have the service tech to come out on June 28, 2024. The tech said he needs to order the sensors for both washer and dryer but he will not get it until August 2024. I called GE support, set up case number, and then I am told to speak with customer relations advocate who told me she did not see the parts order by the tech in her system and she'll reach out to the tech and get back to me. This is June 29, 2024. I have not heard back so I call the customer relations advocate again and she told me the same thing ""Let me reach out to the tech to see when did he ordered the part and get back to me."" I gave her the tech phone number so she does not have to search her database. So I told the advocate that I need a replacement since the machine is still in the warranty. We need to do the laundry as our dirty clothes pile up. We have 4 teenagers in our family. The nice lady said let me sent you $75 to pay for your laundry. That's nice BUT I need to have my own machine to do the laundry.If you have a large family doing a lot of laundry, this machine is not for you. In addition, NEVER buy a  Washer/Dryer combo machine because in our case the washing machine does not work, the dryer does not work as well.Paul"
"thanks for the scratch & dent! i'm too old to be moving this thing for someone to come get it, so i'll have to deal with it the way it is"
"I’m still up in the air on rating these. I bought 2 and kinda regretting it. They take forever to do a load. Cloths come out clean but the drying times are hours and sometimes they are still wet.  Either way, I’m stuck with them now. I’ll have to deal with them."
Unit does not dry. The clothes and leaves water in the drum item is grossly not as described or defective does not operate as promised Google reviews will confirm these common issues. I am having seller is trying to make me pay for return shipping had to open an A-to-Z claim.
"Machine constantly breaks down. Never has it ever dried clothes properly. Constantly have to tear into it to clean out all the built up lint because of faulty design. Water leaks out of the door seal, all over the clothes, every time you open the door after a wash/dryer cycle. Worst machine I have ever bought and still regret spending that much money for something that has never worked correctly. Drying time say 2 hours but takes several attempts at 2 hour intervals to even get clothes remotely dry and they are so wrinkled at this point an iron can't even do it's job to take the wrinkles out. I hate this machine. Load size doesnt matter (big or small) it still doesn't work. Same clothing type doesnt matter, it still doesnt dry anything. Consistant machine maintenance doesnt help anything. The only thing consistent about this machine is how inconsistent and terrible it is. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND SANITY AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE!"
"Here’s our cautionary $2,200 lesson: Don’t buy the GE washer and dryer machine all in one - they are defective garbage! It lasted 6 months before it stopped working. While the 1-year warranty covers the cost of repairs, we spent 2 months paying to go to the laundromat while we waited for their approved repair guy to assess, order parts, fix it, assess again, order parts, fix it, in a never-ending cycle all summer!Each time something else wouldn’t work: the water wouldn’t fully drain, it didn’t spin out the clothes, it wouldn’t dry. We had to shop vacuum water out of the machine multiple times – the machine is very heavy, and the drain is at the floor -– and wring out clothes by hand and hang them outside to dry. Worst of all, once it stops working, you can’t wash OR dry since it’s an all-in-one machine. Since it’s a “smart-machine”, we used their app when it first malfunctioned to see if an update would fix the issue, but the GE app said we had a “happy machine” even though the machine wouldn’t run and had error codes. Worst of all, shortly after using their app, someone tried to hack my iphone!GE replaced it with a new machine (same model) on July 25. That machine quit working on Sept. 27! Even though this new 2-month-old machine has a 1-year warranty, we’re cutting our losses and buying a new separate washer and dryer of another brand. We can’t deal with it anymore. We’re not going for months again without being able to do laundry at home and having to work around repairmen coming to the house to service the same defective piece of GE junk. GE you lost a customer for life over this. This is the WORST appliance we have ever purchased."
"DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER THIS PURCHASE FOR A SECOND!  My 20-year-old washer quit on us one day and given we are now empty nesters, we decided to splurge and get this fancy all-in-one washer dryer to replace it.  We don't do laundry like we did when all the kids lived here and it sure would be nice to put it in and forget it, right?  So we purchased this 'luxury' item and I've done nothing but regret it from day 1.  This thing is junk.  Everything you can imagine has gone wrong with this thing.  I'll give you a short list of examples below:-  After running a full wash and dry, clothes were sitting in a pool of water inside the tub.  I have a video of lifting them up and water just gushing out of the clothes.-  After running a full wash and dry, nothing happened.  I pulled out towels and it's like a drop of water didn't even touch it.  You know when you have a washcloth dry on a hook and it's stuck in that mold until you wash it.  Well, I pulled out a washcloth and it was in the exact same mold.-  After running a full wash and dry, clothes are not dry.  I run the drier again and still not dry.  Luckily, I kept our dryer and I have to use that for almost every load to finish the job this machine cannot do.-  After running a full wash and dry, my clothes come out looking like I took my jeans and twisted them as tight as I could get them and then knotted the legs together, and then dried them.  No way you would ever wear them.  Had to wash them again using wash only and then put them in my drier to make them wearable.-  After running a full wash and dry of my sheets, I pull them out and smell them, and despite the Tide detergent and fabric softener, no smell to them.  They smell like I just took them off my bed.  Nothing fresh about them.  I had to wash them again.I called the company I purchased it from and begged them to let me return it.  They said to talk to GE.  I've emailed, written, called, and had multiple service calls with GE and they say nothing is wrong with the machine.  They tell me to do half loads.  So, I do.  No difference.  They tell me to only do similar fabrics together.  I did a load of 4 pairs of jeans.  Stiff, wrinkled, and unwearable.  They tell me to put more clothes in there.  No difference.  Nothing works.  I've been on every GE tips and review sites I can find and tried everything they suggested.  I've changed the detergent.  I've added fabric softener. I bought a fabric softener with wrinkle guard.  Nothing works.They will not stand behind their product.  I have begged them to take it back and let me just use the ridiculous amount of money I spent on it to replace it with a separate washer and drier so my laundry room at least looks nice and the machines work.  No.  I asked to exchange it for a new unit.  No.  So, I keep calling and nagging them and now I'm here.  The GE technician just left my house AGAIN and said nothing is wrong with the machine.So, I hope this will at least stop one person from buying this machine!  Mine will probably end up in a landfill.  I would never even give it to someone who needs one for free because it's such a piece of junk.I'd love to put this machine in the home of ONE of GE's executive's homes and see what they say about it then.WORST EXPERIENCE WITH GE EVER!  I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN!!!!!"
"SummaryThis machine is not ready for prime time. I expect to see a class action lawsuit on account of design flaws that arguably cannot be rectified without a major redesign of the lint filtering system (read on for details).Supposedly, GE spent 7-years on designing this machine. I question whether they actually used it as a normal owner would, with a variety of clothing that includes cotton, polyester, nylon, linen, etc. If they had, then surely they would have encountered this issue. It is negligent, if not criminal, to sell this expensive machine knowing that it has a fatal flaw.THE GOODWe have a love-hate relationship with this machine. When it works, it does exactly what they claim. A full wash-dry cycle takes anywhere from 90 - 120 minutes. Using the extra dry setting eliminates any dampness. The convenience and space saving is fantastic. The simplicity of operation makes it a joy to use. It does a fantastic job of cleaning and clothes always come out dry. The anti-wrinkle care actually works. There is a lot to like about this machine... when it works.THE BAD* First machine arrived with a dead heat exchanger. From what everyone says, this was an anomaly. Most machines don't have this issue.* Fault Code 353 (clogged heat exchanger). This is the bane of an otherwise excellent machine. It took only four months to encounter this fault code the first time. The service technician cleaned it and called it good. Now, less than two months later we encounter the same fault code again, so it's back to the laundromat while our expensive washing system sits useless waiting on service call #2.Root cause is a poorly designed lint filter system.  How bad is this design? Let me count the ways.1. It lets lint through, which sooner or later will clog the heat exchanger.2. The filter is long, short, and quite narrow. The air path where it fits into requires periodic cleaning. However, it is nearly impossible to perform an effective cleaning because it is so narrow and deep. There is ample room in the machine to have made a good sized box-style filter with easy access, but they chose the cheaper, less effective, less serviceable route.3. There is a chamber at the back of the filter channel where lint can collect and sneaks around the filter. It is nearly impossible clean way back there.4. The filter has no gasket, which is another reason lint gets through.5. The filter appears inadequate to capture all lint, so even if it were perfectly sealed it looks like eventually the heat exchanger will clog, it is only a matter of time.6. The filter has a flimsy foam pre-filter that must be washed periodically (I debate if that can really get all the lint out). It is replaceable and obviously will not last.7. The heat exchanger cannot be cleaned by mere mortals. One must disassemble a big chunk of the machine to get to the other side of the heat exchanger. I question whether it can actually be fully cleaned once it has clogged, as the radiating surfaces are tightly knit (tiny air paths).If they are going to use a heat exchanger that must remain free of lint for many years, then they need an outstanding lint filter system that absolutely prevents this. In this regard, GE has utterly failed, and I see no retrofit that can resolve this issue given the current design.* The soap dispenser ran dry, but we did not get a warning indication. Maybe the sensor didn't get hooked up after the service call? Maybe it is broken?* The condensed water collection system has a drain at the bottom that must be emptied (infrequently). That's not a problem except that they placed it so low that unless you have the riser, there is insufficient room for a container to collect the water. Brilliant idea. Did they do this to sell more risers? We would have one except that would make the machine extend above the window (and create another difficult cleaning situation).* This machine is heavy, more so than a normal washer + dryer. It has a block of cement to keep it stable during spinning. Our old Maytag had a cleaver leveling system that was very light. Our previous Whirlpool didn't have a cement block either. Perhaps some day GE could design a system that doesn't need massive counterweights. Maybe they could get an ex Maytag engineer? Okay, this isn't really a super major issue except don't plan to move the machine to clean behind it."
"Start the load, wash and dry, come back two hours later for a surprise! Will it be wet, will it be dry? No body knows!!!This is embarrassing technology. It's 2024. If it's SOPPING WET it is not dry. It's a great concept to have wash and dry combined, but only if the sensor dry sensor actually works."
"Another reviewer here provides more detail (and more than I could get from GE itself), but yes, this unit has a design flaw, and also weighs a ton. The service tech GE sent out (after their support person shrugged about the fault code, pictured) said he didn’t know the cause of the problem or what the fault code meant, and would be unable to move the unit to service it. We’ve had the unit since November 2023, started getting the fault code in July 2024, but the unit’s efficiency has been declining steadily, even though we preform the required maintenance. Please, don’t waste your money on this product, or anything else this company offers."
"If I could give it 0 stars  I would. I purchased this machine in December 2023 and it has already broken down after only 6 months. The machine is just trash it doesn even dry clothes properly and it does a terrible job at trapping lint all over the machine. GE sent out a technician to ""fix"" my unit yesterday and it broke down again when I tried to run a load. Their only solution is to continue to send out technicians to fix the problem because warranty only covers service and repairs. Everyone who has this machine has been experiencing issues and yet GE refuses to exchange the machines or issue a recall. Save your money this thing is such a headache and not worth it. As a mom of 5 kids I am so disappointed in GE and the bad customer service. EVen the technician who came out told me that this machine is no good and that he gave it tops one month before it broke down on me again. Boy was he wrong it broke down the same day! Please please do not buy this piece of junk! Shame on you GE for putting us customers through this headache."
I purchased this last September thinking I had gotten a wonderful new addition for my laundry room. When I first got it the machine wasn’t drying properly and I had a service call and had to replace some parts. If you look it up on You Tube you will see there is a problem with lint buildup that gets past the filter. Now for some reason it is adding double the drying time after the machine has been washing already. I have to have another service call to figure out what this problem is and also stop water collecting on the gasket in front. I would not recommend buying it at this time.
"I purchased the machine in July of 2023 with high hopes, but unfortunately, it has been nothing short of a disappointment. Within the short span of eight months, the machine broke down completely, leaving me with piles of unwashed laundry and a lot of frustration. The build quality seems to be extremely poor, with various components malfunctioning despite minimal use.Furthermore, the customer service experience was equally disappointing. Each time I contacted customer support for assistance, I was met with long wait times and unhelpful responses. It’s incredibly frustrating to invest in a product that not only fails to live up to its promises but also lacks adequate support when issues arise. It's been a full month since I first contacted GE and they have yet to fix the machine or offer a solution.Overall, I cannot recommend the machine to anyone. Its unreliability and lack of durability make it a poor investment, and I will be seeking a replacement. I also won't be recommending any GE appliance to friends or family."
"I used to wake at 6am on Sundays and do my wash, I was finished by 9am...but now I have this unit that won't dry and now I'm good to finish my wash by noon"
"Received our machine back in November. The drain pump failed in February. GE oroginally said they'd have the part to us in a week to enable a tech to repair the machine. Now they're saying it's won't be available until mid April. If you value dependability, service, and parts availability I would recommend that you avoid this machine."
"I wanted to point out two first-hand observations from having used this model before returning for LG washer and dryer:1) Not being able to set the dryer temperature is a no-go for cottons and delicates.  This unit shrunk half-dozen previously washed and dried shirts and active wear items in my old washer and dryer.  The Eco Dry feature doesn't work.2) If you have real family laundry, you will separate out bedding, colors/whites, towels and so on.  Meaning, you can't wash a load while the previous is drying.  This adds hours to overall laundry time.  A no-go for our household.I would love to see a proper dryer with the heat-pump tech and full temp controls."
"Note:  I've submitted a refund/return request and may have them send another unit. I'll update this review if I do the latter.I bought this unit after conducting a bunch of reviews. Apartment living sucks if you don't have your own washer and dryer, so I figured this thing would save me some money.The washer in this unit works great. It does the same work I'd do by handwashing. The cycle for ""Normal"" seems to do the job well without being overly harsh on the clothes, a bonus for anyone who is tired of their everyday clothes getting holes from industrial washers. It takes a little time if you don't have a faucet hookup, but you'd probably take the same time doing it all by hand anyway. If I had only purchased the washer portion, this would probably be a 4 or 5 star review. Alas...The dryer immediately crapped out. First load of laundry. At first, it ran fine for the first half of a load. When I started on the second half, it wouldn't run. I figured maybe the clothes were too heavy, since some of them were really absorbent, but then the thing started smoking (some kind of electric smoke -- clear and semi-odorous, but definitely the ""burn your throat"" variety). It kept smoking when I stopped it.Again, if I were only buying the washer, I'd probably be a happy camper. But the spin dryer died on the first go and spewed some electric smoke garbage on top of it, which I assume is terrible for anyone to breathe. If you're in an apartment, it's not like you have much ventilation, so this could have been worse if I hadn't sat there watching it on the first round just to make sure I was doing everything right.It's a really great idea, and all the video reviews I've seen on YouTube have given units like this some kind words. But I'm not at all happy by how quickly it went from ""this might do the trick"" to ""OMG is my apartment gonna burn down and start the Apocalypse""..."
"i received the Giantex portable mini washing machine today and have done 4 washes already- the average wash load consist of 4 t-shirts, 4 under wears, a few pair of socks OR a couple of light weight pants and 2 t-shirts...Pros: The clothes came out clean and in good shape. I wash for about 3-4 mins using a tablespoon of detergent per load, then drain and wash again with just water and then transfer the clothes over to the spin dry for 3 mins, done with one small load! I hang delicates to dry and put the rest into the hot dryer.Cons: I am alittle worried about the electric motor over heating as there is a 'motor smell' coming from the bottom of the machine where the motor is. The machine is suppose to be on a flat surface, which it is, but the motor is warm and smells as though it is overheating on the leveled surface of the floor. I hope it is not an indication of a faulty motor, especially since it was only used for less than an hour.The other cons are the thin plastic knobs that have air line cracks, back plate that is screwed on the back of unit sticks out- in other words, not flushed to unit , and some of the edging along the unit is sharp to the touch.All things considered, I think it is a solid 3.5 stars out of 5. I'd like to give it a 3 stars but for $87.00 it is closer to a 4 stars. My Panda XPB36 $150.00 lasted about 2.5 years before it broke a couple of weeks- motor finally stopped after a slow kind of finale. Some people wrote in saying it still working well after 3 years but mine didn't. I contacted Panda and they said to buy a new motor that I have to put in myself would cost about $35.00, I think without shipping, so I decided to try this new Giantex. I hope this last me at least 2 years. These little machines are convenient to have for sure but know they do take some work because there are more 'mini' loads to do and you have to transfer washes to the spin compartment. You also should be home while using the mini washing machine because it can shake quite a bit, rock while washing or spinning, rock ALOT while spinning- you have to re-adjust the laundry to be leveled in spin dryer.If the motor gives out or something changes I will update my review! Good luck if you are giving it a go. One last note- the instruction manual is very difficult to understand because the English is written very poorly. You would be much better off with You Tube. There isn't a phone number or Company printed on the manual, nothing, no one ,if you wanted to contact a company representative. You would have to contact Amazon or try to contact manufacturer through your Amazon account, your orders, leave seller feedback, and then Contact the Seller.UPDATE Feb 18, 2018: My Spinner stopped working 2.5 months after receiving it. I've used it approximately 2-3 times a week which is about 6 small loads in total of daily cottons and twin sheets. I really liked it while it worked.  Customer service was terrific in giving a full refund, under 3 months warranty I believe. I got lucky it happaned under 3 months.I am wondering if it would have lasted longer if it was used just 1-2 times weekly and maybe only very light loads such as wash towels, socks and under garments..."
"I had a another one of these portable wash machines, in the past. It was the kind with 2 sides, one for washing, one for spin dry. I loved it. This machine combined the 2 functions in a single undivided container. Well, it didn't go as expected. The dryer bin was VERY difficult to attach and detach to the floor of the washer. The struggle was almost not worth it, but I decided I would get used to it. Then, the spin dryer cycle just didn't dry like it should. I literally hand rung my items after they had already been spun ""dry"". I was ringing water out by hand. This is definitely not the way it should be working. I hated the hassle of a return, especially a larger size item, but I had no choice. It simply was not working. Also, I have learned by this experience to not get rid of something that is working well, even if you aren't currently using it, and the double sided is better because you have more flexibility to wash more items before emptying the wash water and you can still spin dry in the middle of the washing. I would just go ahead and get the double sided one."
"I had used a larger, twin tub portable washer before and so am familiar with how clothes need to be arranged to spin dry, the limits of how dry they can actually get them and the reduced load for drying. That said this is functionally useless as a dryer, I have found it much simpler and more effective to let clothes hang for five minutes over the bathtub after washing and then wring them out by hand before putting them on the rack to dry fully.In terms of washing it does a fine job with small items, socks, underwear, tshirts, shorts, pillowcases. You can't wash much at once but that should be expected with something like this. Mine does leak something fierce so if you can't put it somewhere to catch the water then avoid.Generally I put my clothes and powder detergent in, add hot water, wash for the entire 10 minutes the timer runs then put it on again for 5 minutes. Empty and rinse with clean cold water for 10 minutes. Dry as described above, not bothering with the function in the machine itself. Gets most things clean enough. 3 stars for being a functional washer but no functional drying.TLDR: Doesn't dry, does wash acceptably. For small loads of small clothes is viable, very much not a laundrette or full washing machine replacement."
"Primarily use it for oily and dirty rags I would not wash in my proper washing machine. Filling and draining is a hassle and the agitator doesn't seem to do all that much to remove the dirt. Machine simply struggles to wash the handful of rags even with water at the max level and needs to run multiple cycles to get an acceptable wash. I can't see this machine washing anything more than a shirt or two at most and is more of a toy than an actual washing machine. If you need a washing machine for your daily wear, save your money by getting a cheap but proper top loader - it's going to pay for itself in the first month rather than this mini unit."
"I didn’t like the hose didn’t stay on, and it leaked from the bottom, so I had to have it in the shower for the leak. I moved and trashed it there knowing it wasn’t worth selling.I only recommend this buying for temporary use until customer has more money get something more study and don’t leak. The cord was really short too.ut was heavy to carry."
"I had a similiar washer/spinner (much bigger model) that worked really good but eventually died. I opted this model because I was looking to save some money and get something smaller too.Want my honest answer? Don't get this one. Even though it washes well, the spinner doesn't spin enough of the water out. The speed is weaker than the other model I had. Also, you gotta fight it sometimes, to get the dumb spinner container secured because it  will go out of place during the cycle. Yes, I made sure it was secured and wasn't overstuffed. Also, why is the spinner so small? I should have just bought the more expensive model, but gave this one a try. You get what you pay for applies here. Actually, given to its performance,  it should be less than the purchase price."
"This machine starts to overheating creating a funny smell after a back to back second wash. The barrell spins off if there is too much clothes in it. You have to divide the wet clothes and run the spin cycle a few times for remaining wet clothes, which results in overheating. I'd recommend waiting 30mins before doing any back to back washes!"
"I normally don’t write reviews but I relied on reviews for buying this so wanted to help others out. I tried it and decided to return it- the SMELL of plastic burning is really rough, and it gets really hot. That being said, I used it in my bathtub and it seemed to work! I quieted the spin cycle by putting a towel underneath and that helped.I’m returning it because the amount of babysitting it needs is just unrealistic for me, and the smell is pretty awful. That being said, if I was desperate, I would keep it and deal with it."
"Update: a year and a half later it is still going. I unfortunately followed another reviewer’s advice of using a dryer sheet to plug the lint collector in the wash basin. This ended up clogging my drain. See photo of melded dryer sheets clog; it’s the size of a small donut peach. After using a gentle drain remover for 7 days, the clog was cleared.  I used BioKleen Drain Care - which made a hole in the output pipe - just imagine what damage a more intense drainer cleaner like DrainO would have done.Now, it’s draining again.~I guess it saves your hands from having to wring out the wet clothes?Very manual way of doing a load of laundry. Forget about how convenient it was to just drop your clothes in a regular 'automatic' washing machine.To wash, you must fill up the basin with approximately 4 gallons per load. I don't have the right faucet diameter to fit the intake hose that came with the machine. I use an empty milk jug x 4. With the dials, select the wash setting on one dial, and then select the amount of time with the other dial. To rinse, undo output hose into sink, select drain on the middle dial. To continue with rinse process, lift up output hose out of sink (there's an attachment it hooks onto), must fill up basin again with water, select same setting as wash and select your time for the amount of time to rinse. When rinse cycle completed, select drain on the middle dial, lower output hose in sink. Once drained, add individual items into extractor basin. Best to balance item in extractor basin otherwise machine will shake uncontrollably and make a lot of noise. You’ll know the extractor is balanced when it makes a smooth ‘whirring’ noise. Best to use extractor with one item at a time.It has saved me the time/trouble of going to public laundromat.I put it on kitchen counter for easy intake/draining. I also use non-slip rubber pads below the footing of the machine. This prevents it from sliding.Yet, I miss my automatic washing machine where the only things you have to do is put your clothes in, select your chosen dials, put in your laundry detergent, and walk away..."
"I purchased it for my baby's clothes, the size is not what I expected. It was too small. But I think if it is for under garment washes it will be a great use. Just not for me.It spins and washes all well but a bit downside is that it doesn't drain out the water all the way.Also the machine tumbles very much when draining."
"I bought this product looking for something to easily and conveniently wash small loads without needing to wait to do a larger load at a laundromat.1. It washes for 10 mins, but I found that it frequently caused my garments to fray and thus, cause them to get tangled together in the wash cycle.2. It is rather inconvenient that I have to fill it in my tub, then drain the water, then fill it again to rinse, sometimes multiple times to get my clothes thoroughly cleaned and rinsed. This ended up using a lot more water than I thought would be required.3. When using the included spin basket to wring the water out, the unit shakes uncontrollably. So much so, that it stripped the inside plastic basin as well as the basket (see photos).4. Because of what I mentioned in number 3, for your one small load of washed laundry, you will need to divide up the load between 2 or 3 different spin cycles to prevent the unit from shaking.5. After your load is done, the drain in the wash basin is not place in a way that the water can easily be drained. This isn’t too much of a concern in the basin itself (because the wash basin can be easily wiped down with a towel) however, I would worry about there being water left in the hose or drain that can potentially cause mold in areas that cannot be seen or easily cleaned.Therefore, when thinking this would make my life more convenient without having to take a trip to the laundromat for smaller loads, having to do laundry with this unit is not at all convenient when you consider how much time and effort goes into doing such a small load of laundry."
"Final decision to buy this washer was based on reviews, price and THE ADVERTISED WATT USAGE. Description says, 70 watts washing power, 25 watts spinner. I have a 410 inverter, 100 WATT solar panel with 140 amp hour batteries. It should work, you would think even with surge. It arrived 2 days early so that's good. Packaging in good condition, packing adequate. Hooked it up and put some items I had soaking ready to do a couple of loads, then it BOMBED. First load was 1 pair of ladies long handle bottoms. It ran about 3 minutes and got water out great. Went to put second item in... Nothing, nada. Only thing that turned on was I could here timer clicking away. Checked my inverter, batteries. Drained inverter on 140 amp hour battery stay down so far inverter is reading low battery. It was fine when i started Looked on machine. Label readsWash imput power 150 watts, spinner Imput power 80 watts , Imput power 230 watts.  That's no where close to what is advertised in details!!! Tried it again this morning. Had a friend stand by it, turn it on while I watched WATT use read out on inverter. Inverter was at 14.4 at start up. Quickly climbed to 212 watts on spinner almost immediately after start up!!!! It did fine for maybe 30 seconds. Killed inverter again. WATT usage is misleading on this item!!!!Had planned on get to get larger inverter anyway, just not right now. Ordering larger 750 watt with 1500 surge tomorrow. Have another 100 WATT panel going in sometime in next day or two.. Will update after we get it all hooked up. Other then the FALSE WATT USAGE resulting  in this unexpected HASSLE & expense,  I'd give it a 5 IF IT HAD WORKED.UPDATE:  AUG 15,17.Got 750/1500 inverter inlineWasher works. Washer is drawing enough power take inverter fan kick in while it goes through its cycle. I know when cycle is done because of that. It does however work. Balance on spinner kind of picky . Have to  rearrange load a couple of times til I get it right. it does the laundry. That's the important thing Beats doing it by hand...."
5 Star- wash cycle2 Star- spin cycle1 Star- strong smell of plastic1 Star- leakage from the bottomSo glad Amazon accepted my return even though I threw out box.
"Used the washer the day after receiving it. Was so excited because I had some items I wanted to wash and didn't want to use my big washer.  The washer worked great, and the capacity was good also. The modifications I would suggest are wheels that lock. I also suggest that the drain tube be configured in such a way that the user would have to unlock it from the machine. I bumped it twice and twice if came off the machine and water was all over my floor. So, instead of my workload being lightened, I had extra work. The misleading description refers to the amount of clothing a user is led to believe that can be placed in the spinner basket. I tried putting one pair of jeans it it, and it wasn't happening. So, not only did I have to clean up my bathroom from all the water mentioned earlier, I had to take my wet clothes to my washing machine to spin them out. Overall it was a time consuming and disappointing experience."
"I really wanted this machine to work out but It ended up not being much of a time saver from regular hand washing when it came down to filling it up with water. First off, the hose is too short and too skinny. It hardly passed much water through and would barely reach any of my bathroom or kitchen faucets. It also didn’t fit any of the faucets so I ended up using a gallon plastic bowl I had to fill it up. And as you can imagine, when it came to rinsing, having to fill it up manually 2-3times then drain the water out through the small hose, just got very tiresome. I spent the same amount of time, if not more, filling and emptying the machine with water as it would’ve taken me to just hand wash my items. Also, the motor is rather noisy and vibrates a lot. Even though I placed it on leveled tile floor with two bath mats underneath I could still feel how much it was vibrating on the ground and making a noise. When there is too much clothes in the machine the motor struggles to turn the water and makes even more noise. I honestly wanted to like this machine and would be willing to look pass the noise if there was a more efficient way to get water in and out. The capacity of it is rather nice, good for doing 5 shirts and a lot of socks and underwear. Jeans make the machine struggle and anything with weight to it really. Better suited to doing a load of kids clothes or light adult clothes in one go. The spinner basket is very small and only suited to doing socks, underwear and maybe a Couple t-shirts but nothing more."
When it works works well.  First one stopped working sent a replacement. Now 2nd one has stopped working and I'm past return date
Washes clothes okay but spin dry is worthless.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                it doesnt do the full job! 3 stars.Wash works great!Spinner works great but not with denim pants (too heavy) even if its only 1.Best to handsqueeze yourself it becomes unstable. I recorded a video with pants ,wobbles! and will fall back but I won't let it."
"This washer is convenient and a good replacement for hand washing or to space out the times I would go to the laundromat, but it is not suitable for large loads or heavy/winter clothing. It doesn’t have a real washer agitator so the machine just swishes the clothes fast. The washer is not automatic washing machine quality. It’s just a basis semi-automatic washing machine for at home convenience.Also the rising basket is very cheaply made and small pieces of plastic starts to come off at the bottom after each wash. The hose that drains the water is very short and only works best if you place the whole machine in a bath tub.**update** the washer lasted a little over two months and now stops working consistently and leaks at the bottom. DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING!!!"
"The washer is good but, the spin cycle is crazy. It makes so much noise and vibrates all around. It doesn’t matter how you adjust it. I guess I can only dry one piece of clothing at at time??"
"Started off great washing part worked great, but the spinning did not work. Hard to attach the bin. When spinning the whole machine shook and made alot of lot of noise with just 2 tshirts in there. Tried the spinning again with just some socks and it didn't even start just noise. So disappointed was hoping it would work."
"I wanted to like this so much. I live in a studio apartment with a laundry room on another floor, and one gets tired of spending upwards of $30 a month in coins to those machines! With a baby on the way and dedication to a cloth diaper system, I thought this would be a great investment. Let me say first that I feel that the customer service was surprisingly good. I received a personal response within 24 hours when I first said I wanted to return it.I followed the booklet instructions and tips from other users: Fill 2/3 with water, not too many clothes, only a Tablespoon of detergent... And it was so fun! It was almost like entertainment, watching this cute little machine wash my clothes in just 6 minutes, and that spin dryer is excellent! A dress that was dripping wet, 6 minutes in the spinner came out just slightly damp- will completely dry hanging in probably an hour!Then, I put in a second load of wash, and put the clean items in the dryer in little loads, not to fill it too much... When I noticed that the spinner timer was ticking, but it was no longer spinning... and the washer wasn't doing anything either. So sad :(If this continued to work the way my first load went, it would totally be 5 stars! I was super impressed and entertained! I don't know if this is a single faulty item or if others have had issues with it burning out within just a few uses... So obviously due to the fact I only got one successful load of laundry, in my experience this can only deserve 2 stars."
"The wash for this item is just OK. You have to rinse stuff a lot and then clean out the inside of the machine. But the spin, which is equally important, is a zero. Even with one small lady's T-shirt, the spinner will come right off the tracks or the whole machine will shake so violently I have to hold it down. And the item of clothing still comes out sopping wet. The spinner shredded my dish towel so I don't really chance it much anymore anyway. And the manual doesn't help. It makes no sense much of the time and talks about things like removing the lint trap. There is no lint trap. I would definitely not recommend this to a friend or buy it again."
Was too small and too many steps to do wash.
"There were missing parts and I was forced to buy everything by myself. Just after a one-time use, the machine stopped working. I attempted to plug it into different plugs but it did not work. I brought a technician and he said the whole power board was damaged and then, he showed me multiple stains at different parts inside the machine. He said this was not a brand-new washing machine and had at least worked for a year. It was a 100% waste of money on a secondhand item that should be thrown away."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The drain hose  have 1/2 inches cracked on two sites.I did not like to complain  so I  glued it  and fixed some electrical tape ang duct tape , I thought that corrected  the problem but when I pre soaked my clothes I realized the water in the tub was completely drained. There is some where inside the bottom part that is leaking .I am quite concern that it may cause me electric shock . When I checked the reviews I seethTthedrIn hose is unhooked while on washing mode , but this one when I put the drain hose laying on the floor , it drains out all the water from the tub . So I always put the drain hose hooked up while on washing mode , BUT. I could not use the dryer when the drain hose was hooked up because  the dryer is filled with water as well .🤷‍♀️. It’s a waste of time washing  because  I have to finish all the second load of dirty laundry  be finished before I could use the dryer.I didn’t use the washing machine  when I received it last january 2021 .. it’s only now month of March I used it. And found out the defective  function and leaking  in 3 places . It’s a risk of electric shock because  the leak is coming from  the inside of the bottom part and that is where I see the electrical wirings are when I peeked on the  bottom  side . 🤷‍♀️Please see the video and pictures as my proof of complaints."
"It can get the job done however it is time consuming. The basket doesn’t hold much so you have to spin things separately 1-2 items depending on thickness , so that’s a process in its self , but then it’s also noisy and moves a lot . I’d rather just us it to wash then ring it out and put it in an actually dryer bs even using the spin basket"
"I bought this washer 2 months ago. I was very excited to receive it and it seemed perfect for our new tiny home. After using it on average 3-4 times a week, the spinner stopped working. It's not a failure of the power supply (which is the only fix the manual provides for this issue) because the spinner's motor hums like it wants to spin, but it doesn't budge at all. I've tried troubleshooting it myself and will look for other solutions, but as of right now I'm not too pleased. I have been careful to follow the guidelines provided in the manual and I don't overload the machine. I did, however, expect it to be able to manage my every day needs to be able to wash laundry and maybe that's where I made my mistake. Up until now, it worked great and I even used it last night without a problem, which is why I am giving it 3 stars. If this never happened or happened after a year of regular use, I would probably give it 4 or 5 stars because it is a great washer otherwise."
Good for small loads (no towels or bed linens). Easy to assemble and use. Washing time is 10 minutes. The spin dry unit is really small so several cycles are needed to get the water out of a small load.Update 7/10/24 This machine started off good but by the 3rd month the belt that runs the engine comes off. I have to take the machine apart to put it back in place after each use. It's difficult to find replacement belts as well.
"This worked really well for the time that it well, worked. I could fit a week’s worth of clothes for one person in and required no assembly. The spin cycle cut down on the drying time, and the product was easy to move to where it was needed.Then it broke randomly and it’s passed its return window. 🙃 But it’s only been three months. I can’t recommend this."
Shakes and makes too much noise when it’s spinning the clothes
This 'washer' is basically a toy. Or maybe it is made to wash doll clothing!  It requires ALL manual work.  Hose does NOT fit a standard US sink. Max load: four pairs of men's underwear or five pairs of thin men's socks. All rinsing is manual in a sink. And you have to pre-wring all clothing before putting it into the spinner. And the spin cycle does not do much.Better alternatives: Go to the laundromat or hand wash in a sink.
It washes fine but it does not spin very well. I had to wring out my socks by hand. Disappointed.
"The wash cycle is ok, but it doesn’t have a drain knob like some other models do. It’s also way smaller than you think, and the max line is just slightly above mid-way. The spin dryer is a joke, very slow, very sensitive to imbalance, and doesn’t dry the clothes as much as other mini washers on the market. I would buy something else and regret this purchase."
Lookwise nice but it's too small its for single person not for 2 3 person
"I was excited having my own washer to wash my workout clothes. I didn’t notice the crack until I started to wash my clothes and so I’ve deccided to stop the wash and drain the water. To my disgust, water was seeping from the bottom of the washer, flooding my whole floor. I just had my kitchen cleaned and I have to deal with this rubbish? Return me my $$. Take it away, it’s just a huge pile of plastic garbage.Update: seller was very prompt in refunding me the full sum. ( hence a 3 stars ) I guess that is the only silver lining after the traumatic incident of having my kitchen flooded. I wish others better luck in getting a functional washer. It’s not too bad a washer, if it’s not broken."
"Broke after about a month. This is just garbage. Went to fill it up after a few uses and the water just drained out the bottom, soaking the electrical parts snd soaking my kitchen.  So 90 for maybe 6 tiny loads? Terrible product made to fail."
When I first got my mini washing machine. The spin drier didn't go that fast and smoke came out of the back of the machine. The washer works awesome and can wash about 3 pants at a time. I fixed the spin drier. It seems that it has some sort of black thick grease inside the motor. Causing the motor to run slow and overheat then smoke. I fixed this by opening up the back cover. Then spraying the motor turning machinism with WD 40 until all of the black grease came out from the bottom of the machine. This fixed the spin drier perfect. It runs really fast now and dries the clothes enough not to drip on the floor from the drying rack.
"I bought the mini machine because I liked & could help clean a small amount of clothes. What I disliked was the company name came different as “costway “, which I ordered name was “giantex”. But the machine looked alike, I kept quiet. But I hope nothing wrong can happen."
"I bought this product because my washing machine had an issue that needed to be sorted.At first this product working well. However,  it only lasted for two weeks before it became a nightmare! A waste of money! It was leaking a lot of water! Flooded my bathroom and then stopped working! I would not recommend!!"
"I tried this unit, yet it was not worth it.  The directions are poorly written as well as out of sequence.  the notches in the basket allow for easy hooking into the spinner, yet not strongly enough to keep it from wobbling around. Because of the poorly written directions as well as having only 1 knob, there is not a real way to know what mode the washer is in, because I tried flipping to the spin mode when needed, yet the knob would not turn over to the spin timer.  It seemed to be in a perpetual state of wash mode, which led to the basket shaking off its locks at the bottom.  I returned he item.to the Manufacturer, please consider having a 2nd knob for just the pin mode."
"I purchased this item about seven months ago. I enjoyed it until now. The spin dryer is no longer working, suddenly. I have no clue what went wrong! I would always do very small loads no more than two shirts or one pair of pants(dress slacks), or other garments not weighing much. The last time I used the spin dryer it worked like a champ, like many times before. I never heard it make any strange noises or have any issue in working. I'm pretty much babied this machine in hopes it would last for many years or at least one year. The washing drum still works great but it is so inconvenient to twist your garments get out water, even doing that you'll struggle to get enough water it so it won't drip (if you hang dry). I did not purchase the warranty for $40+, so I'm not sure what if any coverage you would get. I recommend only buying this if you can also get the warranty that will cover issues with the spin dryer, only then will it be worth the cost of machine."
"I was only able to use this product once because it fell over on the first use while washing and spinning at the same time. The outer blue casing cracked and broke open when it fell over in my bathtub. On the bright side, it cleaned the one load, quite well. So, if you have a location for appropriate “gravity flow” drainage along with a large and safe enough space to accommodate the vibrational movement of the machine, it may be a wise investment. That wasn’t the case for me. I just contacted the seller and hope to resolve my dilemma."
This items spin cycle does not work AT all! It rattles the machine appart with literally any sized object in the spin basket.I am now trying to return the product but they apparently don't accept returns...Save yourself a headache and do not purchase.
"I bought this unit in July of 2019. In February of 2021, I find myself looking for a replacement. This unit worked very well at first. I strongly recommend that anyone buying purchase some floating lint catchers. However, even though I use 2 or 3 of these in every load, the hose eventually developed cracks, started draining slowly, and as of today, the unit began leaking. If you buy this unit, make sure you also buy insurance because it will not last long."
"I first love this little washing machine, as it was making quite strong spins during washing cycle.However, the drain basket is very small and on the second day of use, the bottoms of the basket was being scraped off against the bottom of the washer and as a result, there were bunch of white plastic pieces.And the draining spin is so slow and weak, the water didn’t get squeezed out much, and I had to twist and drain water by hands. (At this point, this washing machine isn’t doing the job in my opinion.)On the third day, I saw water dripping from the bottom and also the draining spin stopped working, so did the washing cycle.It’s a complete garbage.Don’t waste your money and unboxing AND boxing it back to return."
"It's not bad. When we got it, we read the instructions and were both left a little confused. It was actually customer comments and pics that helped us. You should know though, that this is not just a ""wash, spin, then hang"" you have to wash it, drain, spin, rinse, spin again. Also is has to be on a flat surface or it will be loud and clanky. I originally put it in my laundry room, but with this old house the floor isn't completely straight and flat. I put it on my kitchen counter and now it just hums. It's a bit more work than I anticipated, but its alright."
"I got mine yesterday, set it up and gave it a go. Overall the washing function is fantastic. Very pleased with that. But the spin cycle... I honestly wish I hadn't bothered to get one with the spin function. It would have been cheaper. I only tossed in a couple of thin tank tops to give it a try and it ended up being quicker just squeezing the excess water out because I had to do that anyway when they came out of the spin cycle the third time. Also, it smelled hot, with a lingering odor of melted plastic when running the spin cycle.Overall, for me, the washer is great! The spin cycle... meh.Edited: As of my second use, I discovered the washer tub no longer drains. The oh-so-helpful instructions suggest, if it isn't draining, something is plugging it up and to 'unplug it' ...I took off the back panel to have a look and see what might be wrong. Low and behold the piece of plastic, literally a piece of plastic that is used to secure large boxes, has disconnected from the knob. So I have to manually lift the little plug so that it will drain. I spent 80 bucks on this, I shouldn't have to do this, especially after having only used it ONE TIME.An absolute piece of crap."
Difficult to use spin doesn't spin good almost impossible to get it balanced so it shakes violently
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I really want to love it and I do love the fact it wash well, but only the second use and try , the host or tube is broken and made a mess in my kitchen and all water lack everywhere , its horrible experience and I'm returning this. The tube is made out of plastic and very thin n cheap, wish they have a better one."
"May 5: Did my second load, and the spinner broke (so the entire machine broke). I put 1 pair of pants in it. It cannot handle 1 pair of pants.Late April (ordered April 9 but took awhile to get it): First-time portable washer owner. If you put 6 gallons of water, you've wasted 3 gallons, because the drain hose fills ... and then over-fills. The clothes need to be able to move freely in the water (not packed tightly, even a little) because there is no center pivot oscillating whatchamacallit. Eg laundry accumulated for one person on a hot day is most likely too much for one load. Bermuda shorts, t-shirt and delicates are probably one load. Towel and scrubbing stuff would be a 2nd load. Whatever.Maybe because of ratio (a lot more water to clothes) is so much it only needs a 10 minute wash, and 3 minute rinse. The spin dry area takes less clothes than the washer, but only needs a minute spin. So washing 1 or 2 loads a day doesn't take long. (I use a smidge more soap than recommended, so the clothes smell great.)So, could be a water saver (cost cutter). Hope it lasts."
"Worked for about 2 months  Then it stopped working.  When you wash and rinse then you must take out dripping wet clothes and add a few items at a time to spin, which was also out of control!  It basically sucked! Don't buy it!"
"Let me start off by saying that I have 3 kids. I cloth diaper our baby. Soooo, obviously there’s a lot of dirty laundry for me to deal with. We live in an apartment without washer or dryer hook ups. When we go to the laundromat we easily spend $50-60 a week! We cannot afford that so when I discovered the world of portable washers a few years ago we quickly bought one and never looked back. Well, our old portable washer finally broke after a few years of use so we purchased this one as a replacement. Since arriving on February 11, 2019 I have washed exactly 3 loads of laundry every day. The first load is always the diapers, the others are miscellaneous kids/adult clothes. Well, exactly 8 days later, on February 19, 2018, the motor went out. The washing timer clicks and spins, but the clothes do not move to wash. It is so disappointing! I really need this washer! It’s an absolute shame too because when it works this washer is a lovely little powerhouse that gets even nastiest of diapers clean. I’ve contacted the seller and will update my review based on their customer service. Until then I’m back to hand washing my son’s cloth diapers. 😭😭"
This just didn’t live up to its claims. It leaked water and smelled like burning electrical parts. It did an okay job at washing but the spin was not enough and wobbled. I returned and spent $10 more dollars on something that actually works.
"I would never know if the machine can function at it's best because the manufacturer or shipper put the wrong size drain hose with my shipment. I reached out to them and have not heard back. At least give me a suggestion of the correct size drain hose, end one, or I'll get one and then be able to use the machine properly. So far, it washes and spin dries the clothes but the dirty water goes back into the clothes as the drain area isn't letting out the water effectively.Otherwise, the machine is great, it's a good size for small spaces, the noise level ain't bad at all,  and weight, I like how it looks, but that's not enough."
"Good washing machine. Make sure you have someplace to drain your water. Otherwise, you have to carry washer to drain the water. It is super heavy! No very helpful if you can’t drain the water directly.只能说美国垃圾公寓连个洗衣机都没有。 这种东西设计还是需要公寓能接洗衣机才好用。不然用起来不如手洗。"
"Giantex couldn't be reached via customer service to report a suddenly broken agitator after about ten weeks of use a few times a month--their email was not working right and they had no number listed on their website contact us page. I was looking for repair advice. However, Amazon customer service contacted the seller about the defect, Waitpaint, who was fabulous and refunded my money even though the return window closed even before I sent the video demonstrating the spinner still worked but agitator didn't. Besides poor durability, this machine's best quality is compact size and ratio of washer to spinner that have comparable capacity which helps to avoid splitting washed/rinsed loads to put in the spinner."
very coo! washer!!!!!!:-)
"The provided sink adapter is virtually useless. I’ve been forced to use a fill bucket which is messy, inconvenient, and not ideal. The spin cycle is very loud and causes the machine to move all over the place. Which wouldn’t be terrible except for the fact that you have to keep this on an elevated surface in order for it to drain. However, the machine itself works well at cleaning clothes."
"The product was fairly good and does what it suppose to do. It does best when washing small clothes. However, the spin option shakes way too much and I had to hand squeeze the water out of the clothes before putting it into the spin. I do not know why the bottom of the machine leaves black/grey mark, and the product has a strong smell of plastic, especially when running."
I havent even had this washer a week and the belt started to slip off and keeps falling off. The washer is leaking from the bottom and can’t figure out why. Quality seems to be trash if I havent even had it a week and it’s breaking.
lasted three loads of laundry. went to spin dry my socks and it stopped spinning and started making noise. smh dont waste your time.
Overall good but a bit small.
I had this little washing machine and it washed clothes very well but you need a little lint catcher to keep lint off clothes *a must have*!! It only lasted for about four months the spinner stopped probably because I stuffed it. It work well when it worked. It will clean your clothes but don't expect it to last very long.
It’s a nice small washer but requires your time and full time attention.  You would have to pour water in and manually.  It requires manual fabric swiping from washing tub to soaking side.  The hose come with it is made of poor quality.  Make noise after 2 or 3 washes.  Will not recommend.
"It has it's good points the spin dry is excellent, but the part of releasing the water is not so great, it's done by gravity & leaves only certain places you can put the washer. I am curious when they release water from washer, how the dirty things out of clothes? There are still a lot of soap bubble on the top. During the spin, it spreads some plastics smell."
Would recomend another model ( i used to have a panda) as the incredibly short hose makes this imposssible to use unless you can set it right next to a sink... that is also very close to an outlet because the power cord is incredibly short as well. Other functions work normally for a washer like this
Great design...Quality is terrible! Machine broke in less than 3 months with usage 1 day per week. Waste of money.
"Something is really truly wrong with this machine because everytime I touch it, on the edge by the lids, I get an electric shock.  Not just me, but my kids also.  And I mean, it is a good zap, not just a little pinch.  It hurts.  I don't know why this is, but it is scary and has caused me to not want to touch the machine while it is on at all.  I basically have it blocked off while it is in use.  I plan on replacing it with another brand machine soon as I can.Also, this machine tears up clothes, leaves lint and hair on everything, and stretches out clothes horribly.  I use Gain liquid detergent and snuggle fabric softener.  But this machine has messed our clothes up so badly that some pieces have needed to be thrown out including some bras and panties.hindsight is 20/20 if I could go back in time I would never have purchased this trash.  Buyer beware!!!"
...it came with a hose that's big enough to hook up to the faucet.Then the motor burnt up.
Well I bought this in July of 2018 and it's already dead. The motor in the washing tub is shot 😕 It was a great little machine while it lasted and for only $90 I can't complain. I used it for multiple loads 3xs a week for almost a year. Just wish it would have lasted more than a year.
"Didnt work when I got it, belt was off in the bottom, took apart to fix, bolt missing on motor mount was cause of the belt slipping off and damage inside, put belt back on wouldnt stay on when running, spend your money on something else"
Really liked it at first worked great but after a few washes to watching machine part stopped working the spinner still worked but was kind of useless without being able to use the washing machine part
"Item worked really well for 5 weeks, then just quit.  Got it out to use, neither wash side nor spin side moves.  It wasn't dropped or roughly handled in any way.  Unhappy camper here!  Filed a request for returning it.  Would have left more stars if it had kept working."
What I liked about the product is that it is very light weight and great for small apartments are areas.  It washes well once you figure out how to use it.What I don't like is that after only having it for about two months there is a hole in the drainage hose which is resulting in me purchasing a whole new portable washing machine.  Hose is cheaply made and to my knowledge not easy to replace if you can at all.  I have attempted to tape the hose to prolong the life of the product but alas it's not working.  Overall wouldn't recommend.
I wanted this machine to work so badly after all the wonderful reviews. The clothes were cleaned so very well but after 2 uses the dryer stopped working. Unfortunately I had to return it.
The machine stopped spinning after 1 or 2 usage only. I bought this 2 months back and now the returned window is closed. Customer support is too slow and also they are not able find my order which is surprising.I am still waiting for customer support reply.  Will update my review if i get any solution. Feels like we wasted $90
I gave it three stars because the tubes it comes with are flimsy.  So I manually put water in it. And drain it in my bath tub. For the spinner make sure you put 1 medium sized garment in at a time. Nothing to large or you'll burn out the machine.  Great for under garments. Perfect for an apartment.
"We live in our 26 foot travel trailer full time. So going to the laundromat was a weekly thing! When the Covid-19 scare rolled into Washington State, we decided to become a bit more reliant on ourselves and stay home as ordered. So we purchased this little washer/spinner for our RV! It works great in our shower! The laundry comes out clean too! We do have to split almost each load in half to use spin side. But that doesn’t bother us! The clothes are clean and pretty dry when they come out of this little washer! We also purchased a 110 V portable dryer to use outside our trailer. Perfect combo!! Very happy with our purchase!Update:The plastic parts cracked and broke in less than a year! We are full time RVers. Old people! We don’t have kids or pets. Nothing heavy. Did laundry once a week. Now it’s in the dumpster."
"Works well if rubber mat beneath feet to keep from scooting when in use.  Fairly quiet operation with occasional lid chatter.  Safety stop when spinner access door is lifted during spin cycle.The packaging was precarious, be careful opening as the bottom of box is loosely held together!Had a issue with unit and seller responded quickly to my concerns."
I’ve used this product 3 times since I bought it. First and 2nd time went ok. Now all of a sudden the machine stopped working and it’s leaking underneath.
"The unit we received was dirty and had been damaged with a gash in the front.Its a good washer/agitator and water extractor BUT (1) the plastic entry for water can't really be attached to anything and (2) it's completely unstable when the water extractor is in use - regardless of the amount being washed.  There's not much to affix anything to on the bottom so that it stays put and it shakes and vibrates so much that it probably will cause damage wherever it's placed if used regularly.Definitely conflicted about keeping it.Believe it or not, the bottom of the unit (secure footprint) is almost as important as the washer and extractor."
"I want to speak seler,i got problem after 6 months dirty water transform betwen washing space and drayer space.I just wanted to know how and where can i fix it.Becuse this machine was good and useful for our family.just geting unusfull very soon"
"Love the concept, but rinsing is difficult. I feel that I’m waiting water if I don’t wash more than one load with the same water.It took me some tries to get the hang of spinning the water out of the clothes.AND I can’t figure out how to clean behind the lint catcher. 😫"
This fit one outfit at a time and took a mad long time to use as well as more maintenance than I wanted to give to laundry. I had to empty and refill pretty frequently to get anything even halfway clean. Not recommended for uniforms. It doesn’t dry by heat also. It just spins to a less dampness. Still gonna be slightly damp and need to hang to dry a bit. Because there is zero heat you can’t put any smelly goods because they won’t dissolve. Just smear. You may as well hand wash for the effort you’re going to put into this.
It came in the mail quickly but it came with a piece broken off. It doesn't affect the ability to work but its annoying to look at .Works fast ! And works good! The hoses are very short so you might want to buy an extension
Thing is difficult to fill up we have up with the hose our spin feature quit too but I was refunded so it's alright we're living with it they were great about helping with a partial refund of 50$ but this item could use improvement
Directions where a little confusing.  The unit seemed cheaply made.  I put mine in the bathtub and it moved arround with the agitator.  After doing the process twice clothes still had lots of soap. I returned this product.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I was very excited to get this mini washer but became quickly disappointed to see a leak. The size is great. It’s a powerful little machine. It can be stored under the kitchen sink cabinet. The spinner is not that great. Nonetheless, the machine does its job."
"I really liked this little washer, only using it for small loads. I haven't even had it a month and yesterday I was using it and then.............Both washer and spinner stop spinning when they are turned on. One minute it was working,  then, the very next minute it wasn't.  Very disappointing!  Now I have to go through returning it.  So, my review is that it's not so great! Not even a month, and it's broken! Now it is randomly working. Yesterday it worked fine, today the washers agitator isn't working,  the timer is on but nothing. Also today the spinner isn't work although the timer is on. It keeps doing this. I just never know when it will work."
"noise level and vibration very high, sadly, most disruptive toneighbors.the water in hose is useless, cannot connect to outlets at all.  the suggested water out hose is not compatable with the extremely short outlet hose.the wash capacity is not as stated, at all  though it does do a very good job of cleaning.no directions on how to remove the filter to clean in the wash  basin.very, very time consuming.If I were able to choose a price for what this offers, I would not pay more than $50.I most likely will return this.not worth the time or price!Oh, they did not send a giantex, they sent a costway."
"Well. I bought this in the winter in anticipation of my new baby. Didn't start using it for about 6 months because we didn't need it yet and just purchased when we did because it was on sale.Now it's been a month of 1-2 washes per week and today the spinner motor stopped working. In the middle of use. So now I have soaking wet clothes and no dryer, and line drying in 60 degree weather means it'll be 24 hours of waiting.I'm super annoyed that I waited to use it because if I had done this earlier, it would be covered by warranty, but because I waited I am just screwed. And we didn't even use it much at all, maybe about 10 cycles total and boom, dunzo. So yeah, buyer beware."
"It washed best with small loads. At times there is an indistinct scent, more like rubber or oil when the spinner Is used. Lint is a real issue. 3 out of 5"
"I bought this in 2018, and it was mainly used to wash underwear and socks for the most part. On occasion I would wash light weight nursing scrubs which would be 2 tops, and 2 bottoms. Today which is 10/30/21 the spin dryer died. It still washes but the spin dryer, which worked great doesn't work. I wonder if it would have lasted this long if I used it more often, probably not."
Ive had this machine over a year. It leaks and the foam (inside of the machine) is moldy. The hose has also acquired a black film that I cant figure out how to clean. Overall this machine is great for a single person who just needs their workout  clothes washed.
"At first, I was very happy with this washing machine.  It's light enough for me to put it in my tub to use and for storage yet remove when I need to use the tub.  It washes well.  The spinner has done a good job of spinning dry.  However, I've had this about a month and now the spinner no longer works.  I've been very careful not to overload the spinner, to wring out clothes before placing in the spinner, and to arrange them around the edge, all to make the spinner's job easier.  Today, the spinner quit.  The unit is basically useless without the spinner.  Do not buy."
"It washes great, but the spinner basket to wring out cloth doesn't stay seated and pops off. Basically useless. The other one I had spun the cloth practically dry, but didn’t wash well. I can’t win."
Returning this washer as I was not even able to wash one v-neck tshirt in it. Also the drainage plug is not very secure and no good options for leaving the drain hose attached. Spin basket just press fits on and those clips will wear out.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The first two photos are before and after cleaning the floor mop .i used the 10 minute cycle and repeated it again for 10 minutes due to the mop was filthy. It had actually did a decent job cleaning it. I'm confident that it will clean the clothing in the future. Mind you that this is actually for quick temporary cleaning. You would still need to wash them in a full size washing machine for a thorough cleaning. Because this portable washing machine doesn't have a rinse cycle. Furthermore the basket that was provided to be used to spin your cleaning to get rid of access water to dry really sucks. You'll see if you decide to get this machine. You may need an extension cord depending where you decide to washing your clothes. After washing this mop I actually decided to rinse the mop out in the kitchen sink spray a few times and thoroughly wringing it out stuck it on the radiator. I rinsed out the machine then turned it upside down in getting out the excess water. But for some reason water remains inside under the spinner that spins the clothing.
Doesn't rinse well and spin  feature is the worst! Suction cup feet don't work and machine we t flying everywhere with only 4 tiny light weight dish rags. I returned and do not recommend.
I waited all day for this. Potty training my 2 year old comes with mess. Now I have to wait for another machine to come. It spins but water doesn’t come out of the clothes. I don’t understand the previous reviews. This machine couldn’t wash Barbie clothes. I just needed to clean my 2 year olds training undies.
"The power cord is lit up, but I’m unable to turn the machine on. I’ve tried pushing the button really hard and really soft. Nothing works waste of money."
"10l is meaningless you can wash stuff like bras. Shorts (ideally gym style). Socks , underwear. Baby stuff. But if you wear pants forget about it!If you wear thin dresses you probably fine. Or spandex/ leggings and shirtsI work home health so while sometimes I can get away with dresses. I do need pants for companion clients if I need pants or scrubs I prob can’t use this. You can’t wash you scrubs as they prob would take up too much space too. The diagram on the order page say if can do towels or pants. Not a chance. I think it’s misleading. Id you got thin pants the stretch kind you may."
"It seems you need water on all cycles to use - in other words, the last 2-minute cycle will not work to semi-dry the clothes in order to hang. I had to hand-wring the water myself. Not a time-saving task. (If I am doing something wrong, please let me know)."
It as strong as I was thinking it was going to be
"This foldable washing machine falls significantly short of expectations. The actual product bears very little resemblance to the advertised images, starting with the colour - I ordered purple but received a pink and white unit instead.The build quality appears similar to other budget portable washers in this category, but several issues make this purchase disappointing:1. No instruction manual included, leaving users to figure out operation through trial and error2. The dryer function is practically useless - clothes remain wet after the cycle3. Product appearance and colour differ substantially from the listing photosWhile the basic washing function does work, the dryer's poor performance is a major drawback.Pros:- Basic washing function works- Portable designCons:- Dryer function ineffective- No instruction manual- Colour mismatch (ordered purple, received pink/white)- Product appearance differs from listing photosWould not recommend.One month Update:- The product stopped working."
"Spinner doesn't work effectively, wash also nope. I put 2 pairs of socks and it can't handle it"
Very poor in working after one wash the machine is weak didn't perform well
"Before I get to the actual review, which I promise will be worth the wait, I should preface it by saying I gave this ""washing machine"" a fair evaluation by washing a few select articles of clothing, being very careful to avoid going over the weight limits.  I did the following loads:1. 1 t-shirt and 1 pair of sweatpants.2. 2 dress shirts.3. 1 pair of jeans4. 2 boxer briefs and 2 t-shirtsOn to the review.This is little more than a collapsible bucket.  To call it a ""washing machine"" would be liberally gifting it with a title it doesn't live up to.  The NICEST thing I'd call it is a ""clothing massage giver"" and that's being hugely kind to it.I  ALREADY have a 5 gallon bucket with a spigot I installed that holds more clothing at one time, and with a plunger, gets the clothing a hell of a lot cleaner.  I did side by side tests with this ""Portable Washing Machine"", and similar items of clothing using a plunger for the same amount of time.  The plunger method got more done, and the clothing was much cleaner.I bought this in the hope that my back, hands and wrists would be spared from having to use the plunger at all and just leave me with the wringing and rinsing as usual.  But alas, that was not to be.After the 4 loads I did, the unit died.  Since the power adapter doesn't light up anymore, I'm assuming the fault lies there.  But it struggled to wash virtually all of the above items, doing little more than maybe moving it in an arc one way, then the other.  My guess is that it was just not designed for ""light"" loads.It also leaked on one side (the side near the plug) at least once, though when it died, it did so in mid-cycle, and not immediately.  Since it had all night (almost a full 24 hours) to dry in 15% humidity, I don't believe the water had anything to do with the dying.  It's just a cheap piece of crap that would be better served by spending $20 at Home Depot for the appropriate buckets and plumbing attachments.  A touch more for a clean, unused basic toilet plunger (just cut some holes in the plunger so water gets through it) and some extra elbow grease and you're good to go.Or at least better than this thing is.Not only would I not recommend this to a friend, I would tie my friend up and take away their cell phone to keep them from buying it.  Since I don't have the original shipping equipment, returning it probably isn't an option (one I will explore after I get done par-broiling it here so that anyone else considering this POS won't buy it) so it's bound for the trash and I'm back to a bucket and plunger.Maybe I can throw together an automated plunger?  At least I know THAT method gets one's clothing cleaner than this does.Avoid this (and it's manufacturing-related brothers and sisters) at all costs."
"We have a large family and my washer died a few days ago. I have to keep laundry going and with the highs in the lower 30s and a 4yo in tow, I wasn't going to make trips to the laundromat.  I have a washboard and resorted to doing laundry pioneer style in the bath tub(and was shocked to see how clean the clothes came out with a washboard to be honest) but I'm in my 40s and my back can't handle hunching over and my arthritic hands can't handle it either.  My new washer won't be here for almost a week so I resorted to buying this machine, and was sold mainly on the spinning feature. I was using my spin mop bucket to spin clothes lol. Pro- this offered overnight free shipping so I had the machine very early this morning after ordering late yesterday afternoon. The assembly couldn't be easier. Just expand the tub, click the lid on, and  plug the drain. The lid clip broke clean off when I was putting it on.  It's a very flimsy plastic.  Minus 1 point. I put a couple small items in,  filled it with water and added a splash of soap. Then pushed the button so hard trying to choose the cycle that I thought my acrylic nail would break. I finally got it and it started the cycle. Not gonna lie,  I was pretty amazed watching it wash. It agitates back and forth like a washer and has an impeller at the bottom of the tub that twirls the clothes around. The 5 min cycle finished, I drained it, refilled it and started it again for the rinse portion.  Then drained it,  took the wet stuff out and snapped the drain basket to the impeller thing at the bottom. The basket is very small so I had to do 1 item at a time and it maybe spun half of the water out.  So I threw it back in the spin mop bucket and finished getting as much water out as I could.  But now I can't get the spin basket out. It's like locked in and the instructions say nothing about removing it.  I've pulled hard enough to where I thought I was close to yanking the impeller out.  So I got back on Amazon to see if there's i instructions in the product details but no such luck. So I sent the seller a question and am waiting for a reply. So as of now, all laundry washing has come to a halt."
"I was looking for a something that I could take the extra what out of clothes so I wouldn't have to wring the clothes by hand.I was a little disappointed.The washing part is what I would call generous.But the basket to spin extra water out of clothes is very small.I am not sure if I would get 2 pairs of any under garment into the little bucket to spin.In all fairness I haven't used it yet for that purpose.Now for being able to lift and carry it is not that heavy at all.It is made well. But, here is another problem.If a person a person doesn't have great upper body strength,  he or she may need assistance getting this pulled up in order to use this machine.Also, the lid is not locked into place. There is little ""c"" curves on the lid to push them into a little coordinating bar. I have not yet been able to push them onto the top of the machine.I am still hoping that this will help save my hands from doing all that wringing. I don't think I would buy another one."
"I bought this for emergency purposes. Seems to wash well, fits about 3-4 medium adult shirts. Need to run another cycle just to rinse though. Spin basket is smaller than expected and could only fit 1 adult medium shirt."
"The ""user manual"" is a half-sheet of tiny print. It doesn't cover essentials like:* how full to fill it (with water and clothes)?* how much detergent to use?* how to remove the spin basket? (I assume I'm going to break it trying to get it out, because there's no obvious way apart from just yanking on it.)Also: cheap construction (the control panel is coming off after one load)."
It is not easy to use. Very slow to release dirty water.
Too small for what I needed. Would probably be ok for a pair of underwear and maybe a pair of socks. Motor not very strong. I had high hopes but didn’t do it for me.
"Motor struggles with one t-shirt, absolutely cannot do two. Maybe a sports bra but not work out clothes. Definitely not 2 hand towels let alone 5 as advertised. Basically it’s for underwear and that’s it."
Flimsy and doesn’t agitate well. Probably only good for under garments ( not many) . I tried socks did not spun water out of them at all!
"UPDATE: This will ONLY work for small items! My twin sheets struggle to fit only one in the spin basket and it starts shaking loudly. I have to try about 4 times to get it to spin out one flippin sheet. Now I have to buy a separate spinner for anything bigger than a towel. This spin basket is only big enough for tshirts, socks and underware and hand towels. thin beach towels work. I also NOW have to buy a real portable dryer! That is like $500 more just to dry the clothes. I wish I had known. When winter comes there is NO WAY this will help with a blanket!The WASHER Is big and wonderful! You have to wash then drain then fill with clean water then drain again then try to get the spin basket to not wobble like crazy.= The Spinner basket is sooo small and will wobble like insanity if it is off balanced in the first 3 seconds! Very scary sounding! I am scared to turn on the spinner every time not knowing if it will shake like crazy. You have to super fast turn off the spinner and move things around. You can only spin out 4 pieces of clothes at one time ... like one shirt, thin shorts socks and underwear. That is one load in the spinner. Then you must hang your clothes up for several hours to air dry.Today I washed in ONE LOAD... 7 shirts, 4 pair of lightweight shorts and 6 pair of socks. You must spin out the water in 4 separate loads of 2 to 5 mins each so that is 15 mins wash time and 20 mins dry time. Pretty cool! BUT>>>>>>>> This will NOT easily even spin out a twin sheet without the WOBBLE unless it is a thin twin size sheet! I SO dont think I can use this in the winter at all! It will NOT spin out anything larger than a regular bath towel. You can forget about an extra size or heavy weight bath towel or even a blanket. NO WAY will it fit in here! The spinner is so small. It is 4 times smaller than the washer. BEWARE you will need an actual dryer and spinner that are larger! This is great for shirts, baby clothes and small stuff but NO WAY would a Queen size sheet fit in the spinner basket. This spinner starts to wobble and shake the unit like crazy where you must immediately turn the dial back to off and reposition what you are attempting to spin the water out of. It spins SO FAST that it must be balanced right off or it wont work without scaring you with how loud.Now there is a gas smell of oil inside when you lift the lid that is super annoying if you are sensitive to smells. It does not get on your clothes. You just cant leave the lid open without smelling it. I have used this 6 times and it is still there.Ok, so first the postal worker dropped this package a bit to hard in my opinion when it was delivered and I was worried it would not work but IT WORKS GREAT! I have it in the bathtub, not elevated at all and the drain tube just needs to be laying down in the tub to work. Make sure to gently tip the unit side to side to drain before taking it out of the tub.YOU MUST ADD CLEAN RINSE WATER as Step II and FIRST CHANGE IT FROM THE DRAIN SETTING! so I figured that out quickly LOL. The drain water was dirty so that was great to see. The rotating to the left then the right and repeating is wonderful. This washer is awesome!This holds alot of washing but will take you 4 loads to spin out the water in the clothes. So that is 20 mins to spin out all the water from one wash load. It took me an hour to do my first load with setup and learning. The instructions are stupid. I read them like 20 times hoping they would make sense LOL NOPE... You can figured it out tho.I could not get the lint trap out of the washer and that was frustrating. I figured out using my shaving razor handle I could pop it out. You have to clean it each time after a wash.One more thing, the box it comes in says 26 lbs but if your needing it to be lighter, take it out of the box to carry in then its only like 17 lbs easy to carry up stairs by yourself!I use an extension cord from another room and this works just fine. This is a 3 prong outlet and I only have a 2 prong in the bathroom so I had to do this. Works good."
"The washer does a good job of washing clothing and the spinner gets a good amount of water out even when spinning for one minute. However, the capacity of the wash tub is definitely not as high as they say it is - if you actually load it the way they suggest (20 t-shirts? 2 bedsheets? 5 trousers?) the agitator will not spin your clothes properly. I would say the capacity is about 50%-70% of what the manufacturer says it is. Another issue is the drainage - sometimes water does not drain out all the way and you have to lift the machine slightly to get all the water out. I’ve noticed a slightly moldy/mildewy smell after using this machine for a little over a month."
"This washer is good for washing small loads of clothes, however, it doesn’t fully drain all of the water out of the system. After a certain amount of water is drained, I can always see the remaining water being pushed up the tube but there is not enough force to get it out completely. And if you turn off the machine it goes back down and does not come back up to the top of the tube. I opened the back and sure enough the water is collecting at the base of the tube. There needs to be a secondary valve placed near the base in the back to drain the excess water out that can’t be forced out the tube. Other than that the machine works great. Just won’t be a long term thing because mold and mildew will start to grow from the water being left.Edit: After a month and only 2 uses, the drain hose broke so water goes everywhere."
It does the job. The only false advertising was the drain pump. The picture shows you can drape the drain hose it over a sink and it will pump the water out... wrong. You still have to have the drain hose lower than the machine for it to pump water out like a gravity drain. Slightly disappointed on that.
"I purchased this washer September 2024 to replace a similar model I bought a while ago. Barely a month old and l noticed my bathroom floor was getting very wet. Upon inspection, I found the drain hose had cracked and was squirting water on to the floor. I taped the hose up best possible to be able to continue to use the machine. Lucky me, it broke after my window to return it.Truthfully, I like my pervious model much better. It was a Giantex Washing Machine. It seemed to be a bit bigger and did a better job washing clothes. It did not have a pump to drain the water, but I just set that unit in my tub, dropped the hose and let the water drain out on its own. It actually drained better. I often notice water remains in this new washer even after the pump no longer pumps out water."
After a month the  spinning stop working . I got the washer bc have a spinner now I have to trashed it. That was a waste of money . I loved it first month now doesn’t drain properly doesn’t spin. So disappointed ☹️
"This machine works exactly like it’s supposed to. It is however labor intensive. I have to put the whole machine into my bathtub because it can get messy when filling, draining and rinsing. I think it uses a lot of water to thoroughly rinse the clothes or other item I’m washing. The way I do it now is by filling buckets of a water in order to fill it. I prepare a bucket of soapy water and add additional buckets of water to further dilute the suds and I only use a very little bit of soap but I am washing the clothes so I have to use some soap. The washing cycle works exactly as it should. (Make certain that the drain is not turned on when you fill it initially. After a good wash, I open the drain and let the water out. And then begins the RINSE cycle. It takes a lot of buckets of clear water to completely rinse the clothes. The spin cycle in the “dryer” works very well and the contents come out still wet but not dripping wet. It’s a handy little machine but I still need to go to the laundromat for the big items ."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It came in broken, the pice that’s broken is supposed to go through a hole to keep the lid together but it doesn’t even go in all the way and the lid came off completely. Not only that, the hinge broke off completely, but can probably be fixed with gorilla glue (I’m hoping), it is cheap plastic but you get what you pay for I guess. other than that it’s a pretty good size, and good for small spaces*********UPDATE*************so I’ve been washing clothes in it for a few days now and it’s not that bad. For those that still have soap in your clothes after one wash, put it through the spin cycle, it has a hole for water to drain through while your clothes are spinning and gets out a good amount of soap. Throw it back in the wash with clean water and let it wash and just throw it back in the spin. The spin isn’t a dryer it’s like the spin in a regular washer. It does get a good amount of water out of your clothes and feels almost dry. You ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO put your clothes AROUND the spinner, if not then the result is a loud spin. It’s because all of your clothes will be on one side making the machine unbalanced like any other washer. Even it out and it should run smoothly and quietly. After washing and drying clothes in here it doesn’t need that much time in the dryer. I usually do a 20- 30 minute cycle and it’s good to go. It’s a five star for how good it actually works, but sucks that part of the lid came in broken. Would buy it again if it ever breaks."
Looks used and dirty on the inside. Will update once I use it.
"I was very happy with the size, the drainage spinner, etc. Was a great little machine which I was able to run about 15 little loads from until it started leaking from the feet and bottom of the machine. I had made sure to use warm-cool water and follow the directions. I was able to run the wash cycle , however the drain cycle and spin cycle caused the water to flood my bathroom. I am hoping maybe only this one was defective in some way or something inside got jostled during the spin cycle that can be repaired."
"It did not come with the top spinning piece that you put in to hold your clothes a complained about this when I first opened the box, but nobody did anything about it so years have passed and I just let it go. I have to use a Washcloth to put in there to hold the clothes down."
The lid was partially broken when I got it but wasn’t important so I dealt with it. Doesn’t work for jeans or sweatpants we’ll and I’m 5’6 120lb man. Great for socks bed sheets shirts and underwear. Not good for sweaters. Spin dry is loud as hell and shakes the machine most of the time. It gets the job done but it’s not a deep clean not good for stains or big clothes. This is only good for saving money between laundromat trips and emergencies like spills on the bed. Gentle and normal are the same setting. No difference in spin speed. cord is super short. Too heavy to lift when full so only buy this if you can fit it INSIDE your shower or on top of a counter to drain into a sink. Also more labor intensive than you’d think. Each load needs to be washed spun rinsed and spun and if you don’t have a drying rack get one. Also most stuff will dry a little stiff and loose unless you can tumble dry
"You must ring out your clothes after it drains before you put it in the spin dry cycle, even then it’s still not completely dry will have to hang it up somewhere to fully dry good part is it’s very powerful"
"I liked this machine for about a year, but it does not drain completely.  Now the drain water smells like sewage.disappointed.  At least it was good for a year."
"Just arrived initial review: Purchased for convenience / so I could use my filtered shower instead of city tap in our buildings basement laundry room. This does not clean nearly as well and I assumed as much.I was able to do a smallllllll load of thin material items- socks/ undies, cropped clothes etc. talking like two pair of leggings, a hand towel, two tanks, and some socks. So if you need something done asap and you forgot to get quarters this would work.The spinner is honestly the star of the show- I’m amazed at how dry it was after just 30 seconds.Really is super light weight I carried it up 5 flights of stairs by myself (4’11 100lbs). HOWEVER- I WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN AFTER USING IT. If you don’t have building laundry, have a handicap of sorts, or are an avid camper this is ideal. Otherwise- I would reconsider."
"I bought my machine in 2021 but haven’t been able to use it until now that I have a place of my own . I have taken out the box brand new 2weeks ago and today I am using it for the second time , the first time everything was great washing was great the drying was impressive ! So today I decide ima do some laundry and everything was going great , I washed 6 shirts and split the dryer load in to 3 . First spin damn near dried the shirt ! Beautiful I go to do the second load and the dryer isn’t spinning I unplugged and re plugged in the machine and all that’s happening is the timer , I check to see if the washer is working and it is I try the dryer again , and it’s still not spinning . So now when I thought I could finally save time and money . I am now stuck with 3 overly wet shirts and a machine that only half works after only 2 uses ! You can imagine my frustrations . This is disappointing"
How in the world is this flemsy plastic tube supposed to fit on a spigot??? I had to order a different tubing system that cost me $32 and I hope it works! Not happy before I could even get to use it
"After reading many reviews, I decided to purchase this product. It is a lower priced alternative to a traditional washer and dryer. However, the washer does not spin, it holds water and I have had to agitate the clothes myself. (You can do this in a bucket for free.) The dryer works well, it's a lot like a salad spinner. But, if the weight is not equally balanced you will know by the loud thumps from the machine. I no longer have this product, I disposed of it because it did not work well for my needs."
"Agitator does not move so clothes just sat in the wash bin.  tried contacting seller but the return label was so small it could not be read.  Only other option for return is to pay for shipping myself, which I think is unfair for defective product.  Return Label for inside of box was of average size so don't understand why return label would be so small"
"I have used this washer/dryer 6 times and it stopped working. I contacted the company for assistance, and they requested a video to see what it is. I sent them a video of how it isn’t working. And instead of giving me assistance, they told me what I did wrong in the video. I offered to send another video with the CORRECT way of how the machine works, because it STILL does not work no matter what I do….and they have stopped contacting me. Not even 2 weeks old. And no help in figuring out what happened."
"Took it out of the box and washer lid was off hinge on one side, granted could have happened in transport but spin side door hinges completely broke on one side. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and since I could push it back and down and sit my laundry detergent jug on it to hold it closed, I thought as long as it works well I'm fine with it. Washed a load and it did great. Do wish the cord and hoses were longer though even a foot longer would be awesome, but then when I went to spin the clothes, it wouldn't work. All the components and hoses are very cheap plastic. Not much thicker than a cheap water bottle. Oh and how can I forget. When it drained it drowned my floor. I do not recommend this product at all"
I love the washer I ordered the next size up and got this one it works great I need replacement hoses can't find them
For one it says it has a lint trap  it don't u can see in my pics and my flood my floor I was able to fix it look at pic in the back of the washer there string or something coming down  to control  the drain  nob turn the nob u will see it make sure the cap on top is tight  mine wasn't
Makes tons of noise. The dryer stopped working and burned out after the first week and I didn’t use alot of clothes. Before the dryer blew out for those that decide to still buy it there’s a trick to the noise when u turn it on apply pressure on it when the machine just turns on and it won’t make sooo much noise but it’s still not worth it. My partner has to drain the water and strain the clothes out with her hands. When I bought this product I was hoping it would be easier for her to wash but doesn’t seem that way at all.
Got this machine for my apartment with no washer and dryer it is very cheaply made. The washer portion of the machine “works” but far from well. It just barely washes and the loads have to be much smaller than advertised to clean (1-3 shirts at a time and 1 - 2 pairs of pants). The dryer portion is a joke as I can barely fit 1 pair of pants/jeans into it. The dryer spin drys with no heat for air drying after but it has a hard time even doing that. I found myself still squeezing a large amount of water out of the cloths after it was finished “drying”. I do not advise buying this washer for cloths it’s more of a hassle than it’s worth and all in all is a bad product you’d be better of spending a little more money for a better washer. It gets the job done but does a really poor job. I even tried to return it and was told it was a $75 restocking fee as well almost 3/4s of the price. I give it 2 stars because if your desperate it can work but I do not advise buying this machine.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            i’ve purchased from this company twice. my first washer was perfectly fine, until the knobs broke. i got a lot of use out of it and ordered a new one. well now when i was my stuff there’s nothing but lint everywhere on our clothes. i have reached out to the company to try to get a replacement and they don’t return emails or get back to customers."
Used it four days and it just started leaking water.
Drain does not work on mine so I have to lift it upside down in the tub but everything else works fine I won't use the dryer tho since it's so small i just bought a separate dryer
"The machine is reasonable okay and does it job. I love the compact design and how light it is to move around. I found that the washing cycle is ok and the spinner spins the clothes very fast with good results each time. However, I dislike the two short inlet water hoses that connects to the machine. The material is cheap and is too short. Another three feet would be awesome.  After using a few times taking it on/off from the water tap, I notice that the mouth of the hose stretches and never stay connected to the tap supply. The outlet hose should also be three feet longer."
1.Likes : it served my purpose to conserve water for smaller loads. not difficult to operate/ use.2.Dislikes: a)the lint lint trap does not really work.  b)  Wattage was falsely advertised: 360W for washer and 240W for the spinner as specified on line/ at the back of the washer label  280W for washer and 160W for spinner.  c) noisy and heavy agitation when using the spinner.
The machine washes and then you have to drain the water to rinse the clothes. Also the two things I didn't like was the plug was not long at all and the drainage hose was super short to. The drainage is gravity flow only. So in order to drain the tub you have to put the hose a little lower the tub which means it has to be on the floor or hanging out the door. But it really cleans the clothes good with very little soap.
Came very late at night and stop working the very next day ! After one small load . Loved it while it worked . .Just leaves too much lint . .
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It takes more water than expected for the small size.  Washes clothes ok,  but you get what you pay for,  towels , wash rage, and socks come out kind of dingy.  But all in all,  I live off grid so it serves it purpose when in a pinch and need to wash a small load here or there.  The spin cycle does spin almost completely dry which is a plus.  The hoses are not very long, so an adapter for longer hose is a must."
"This product is really easy to you , it washes your clothes perfectly. The only issue that we had was , the knob to the dryer part was faulty .after spending the money in this , it was rather erky . However , we’re going to try and fix it. Overall I give it a 8/10! It’s not that noisy and fits a good amount of clothes at a time ."
"It's been about 4 month of very light use( baby clothes and 6 years school uniforms, undies and sock) and my spinner has stop working! I am so disappointed because it was a great buy. I used it about 2-3 a month. I reached out to the seller, haven't heard anything as yet."
Box was damaged as well as dirt inside the washer as if it had been used other than that it works good
"I ordered this product 6 mos. ago, the first one arrived damaged, unusable, they replaced it, next one came with shattered top, was going to send back but health issues got in way, my son was able to pop off broken glass, I do laundry about 1× month due to being old and not having but a few outfits a month, so I have used maybe 8-9 times total, with very small loads and spinner has already quit and washer is making terrible noise, dont waste your money on this machine!!!"
"I live in a senior apartment complex.  We do not have any faucets in our home that I could connect this to. I did not know this until I actually had the product here and tried to hook it up.  I have received authorization to return the product, but the return label that they provide from China is blurry and unusable.  I have repeatedly attempted contact with the company with no success. This has been a very frustrating experience."
"Worked great until it didn't. Not overloaded, jostled or any other kind of abuse. Timer continued to work, the washer just did not agitate.  Spinner continued to work. VERY DISSAPOINTED!"
The machine has black smudge inside the washing tub and looks like it has been used before.
"When I first got it i was very confused a little of no information on the instructions on really how too use so I google really cleans clothes,dryer area is small and you have too really balance out the sryer area it's not heat its really just spins and u have to spin a couple times too get damp,but too dry my clothes I still take to the laundry Matt to dry but I am saving on washing."
"It works for washing smalls things, but Don't use the spin function when the machine is tilted even a little. It will bang around.Also mind arrived with a cracked lid."
Was it supposed to arrive with a water pipe? If so I didn't receive it.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I paid close to $200 buying this because I just didn’t want to keep using the community washers. I was really excited at first. The set up was straight to the point even though the manual was kind of confusing in its directions. I got it together and the wash was smooth and wasn’t too noisy. They give you a tube for drainage that you can point to a tub or sink, but when I began the draining process, water spilled from all parts of the washer which led it to flood my whole bathroom. I was very frustrated. And the worst part is that I wasn’t able to return it because I personally didn’t have a car or the extra funds for transportation to return it in the small amount of time they gave me to return so I had to take the financial L"
the product works as promised when we got it. it took weeks for the company or fed ex to get it right and deliver the product as promised. also the company promised a credit which has not happened. but happy with the product. next time i will buy directly from amazon so i have better assurance that i will get the product on the date they state on line.
"The washer part was dirty on the sides, spinner was dirty and had water on it, smelled like mildew. Average noise as a regular washer."
"I have washed a few loads but couldn’t get the spinner to work.  Finally, after messing around with the spinner cover I realized you have to tug on the spinner attachment so it’s sort of flush with the top of that tiny basket.  Small, but efficient.  Can hang dry afterwards since I have the old radiator heaters."
Definitely doesn't work as advertised. Don't waste your money. Company is definitely not good about returns/refunds.
"Don't even waste your money this machine wasn't washing my clothes, nor were they spinning my clothes well enough to get a decent dry. It will take forever to wash an entire load on this thing! The spinner is tiny and doesn't hold much. I ended up giving it away to my neighbor in which my neighbor ended up selling it weeks later. I had a lot of faith in this thing."
It has a crack in it and I can’t use it without leaking water. The knob it damaged as well
"This is as advertised, just a little bit more of a hassle than I would have preferred..I ended up getting rid of it."
Stopped working after 6 loads had to open back not much to it a lot of small cheap plastic parts drain valve was stuck it was attached what looked like zip tie but I fixed it 😕
"Incredibly angry and misled. I did see reviews of it not working, but nahhhh, couldn’t happen to me. During the first use I was VERY happy - worked well, saved me so much time. But, the dryer stopped working so quickly (after one use) and the cord is so short. Such a hassle to return.UPDATE: The company says you must show it was a product error to return. I took videos and pictures. They suggested two things to try and then said it was my fault and ghosted me. I paid $40 in shipping to get this product and now I have to pay to return it, basically the price of this piece of junk. The instructions are written by someone who clearly does not know English, like they are broken sentences and make 0 sense. I feel like this company is fraud.Don't make the same mistake I did thinking it wouldn't happen to you."
"Terrible Product, stay away from this.1: Small & flimsy. Gotta be careful with this thing because one wrong move and it will break.2: Dryer part barely even works. When it does it makes a sound that almost feels like its getting punched from the inside, constantly. All that noise for nothing, the t shirt or hoodie still comes out wet. Oh did i mention how ridiculously small that dryer is? You can only put ONE piece of clothing in there. Thats ridiculous.3: clothes come out dirty. Weak machine. This machine is weak as hell. You’d be better off washing your clothing by hand like some hobbo...4: Third Party Seller so you won’t be able to get help from amazon..5: you get what you pay for. STAY AWAY FROM THIS AND GET YOURSELF SOMETHING DECENT"
"I liked it at first. However, the item stopped working a week after the month return mark and not sure how to contact the seller to see what could be the issue with my item"
Ran three small loads and the dryer quit spinning.  The washer seems to work grea.t.  it is quite noisy.  With carpal tunnel  it was hard to get the hose attached to the sink...I had to have someone come over.
"I bought this product on July 11, 2023Here it is NOT EVEN a year later and the motor sounds like it’s Running, but the agitator won’t work on its own. Something is broken! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT! I have to pay someone to look at it, because appliance repair estimates aren’t FREE THESE DAYS! 😖😢"
The washing machine takes a while to start washing but it gets my child’s clothes clean.  However the spin cycle doesn’t work at all and smells like it’s burning so unfortunately I will be returning!  I’m so disappointed but it’s convenient if it does happen to work.
"The product does well enough, however it doesn't always get the clothes as clean as a regular washer. The directions are confusing and difficult to understand."
"Purchased this item to use for my under garments… it took me about a month to finally take it out the box . Tbh I was just anxious about trying to set it up , didn’t want to deal with it if I had and issues . And sure enough it was issues … I got it out the box plugged in and everything and it did nothing ! Wish I could receive one that actually works because now I’m stuck with this huge item that takes up space but doesn’t work !!!"
The spin on the clothes is very rigorous which I like and dry takes out majority of the water. I don't like that it's too small and the hose to drain the water is too short you need an additional pc
"i expected more. It's a lot of work. But it gets the job done. Requires a lot of time. Cleaning can be a hit or miss. drying is the challenging part. overall, it depends on your effort with the machine."
I guess I bought the cheaper model cause I needed an attachment hose to drain in the sink I have it in the bath tub when I wash. The great thing is I only use a bucket of water to wash.
"The hose that comes with it is super flimsy and doesn’t connect to regular faucets, so you’ll have to spend even more money to get a connector. I got this bc I bought a washer from someone on FB and it didn’t work, I am out of state for school and needed one quickly and this truly was yet another waste of my time and money. Tried to return to the seller and he only returned half my money saying he took the cost of shipping out…. We both live in Georgia I should have drove it to his porch for the amount of money he took from me. If you’re reading this DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND DONT LET THIS SELLER PLAY WITH YOU"
"I have basically had good luck with all my orders from Amazon and been trreated fairly.  I did not like the washer dryer combo.  The ad led me to believe it would hold several pieces of laundry.  I did not use it at all, just  boxed it back up for return because it was just entirely too small."
After 4 usage the machine has stopped working. Please don’t purchase that 😓😭
They dont answer the phone at all! I need to know how to clean the lint filter because it's full and there is no way to clean it!!!
Ive purchased the Intetgreat washing machine but it not easy to remove the lent trap to clean it out how do you remove it
It functions just fine as a washer but the dryer setting has a max of 5 minutes. I’ve reset it every 5 minutes and even tried to jam the notch to keep it at 5 minutes but it is terrible for drying clothes. The loads have to be small and even smaller for drying. If your washer breaks and you can’t afford a new one this could be a good temporary solution but do not rely on it for the dryer.
"Washer works great but the second time I used it the spin side stopped working for some reason, I wrote to the seller but didn't get back to me yet, I will keep you updated"
I can’t use it bc I don’t have extra attachments to hook it up well the metal ring was missing
I purchased this product in Nov. I tried it once and the water would not drain all the way and the spinner sounded like rocks were spinning. Very loud. I returned the washer thru fed ex as they requested. I used it once put it back on the box the same way it was delivered to me. Just this month they returned the item to me saying return to sender. Item damaged. I did not damage anything. I'm waiting on a reply from the seller on what they expect me to do with this. Stay away from this seller. I did not take a video so I wasn't able to get a full refund. Stay away. The machine stinks
"So upset I paid 119$+ shipping+tax for a hunk of garbage its a plastic spinner not metal!!wash laod is what expected ,2 pair of jeans max load ,4-5 shirts max load,don't try to do any more than this!! Spinner plastic not metal! Only 1 item in spinner at a time. Haven't used it more than 15-20  times and spinner stopped working😡😡Have contacted company waiting for a response ,Don't waste your money on this a washboard and bucketis cheaper and better!"
"Sorry dont like it i brought for my newborn because i didnt want to go to  laundromat where there's mostly germs for newborn clothes , So that why I wouldn't be buyubg it again but i thought the price was okah for it but quality wise nahh"
I liked the washer but adding water is deficult the water hose is too short and the draning tube is short as well it's hard work to get the job done I will be investing in a washer that's worth the money because this one wasn't.
I just received my order today. I was so excited but to find out it was broken and a little dirty. This is very upsetting.
It worked okay until today. I bought it in March and it broke in October. The spinning section timer will run and the motor runs but it doesn't spin anymore.It also had trouble with spinning. Can hardly put any laundry in the spinning cycle compartment or it won't spin right/slow down/not spin at all.
It does wash well .drainage is tough because you can't elevate hose but it is not a dryer the other side is the rinse cycle. Easier to lug clothes to laundromat.  Just saying.
So far have not used it but the instructions were horrible. I had to go to a you tube video for an explanation. I would say that the size is great for really small places. It’s lite weight and can be picked up easy. The horse it uses are very cheap plastic.
"This is a great little unit when it works, but after a week it doesn’t drain properly anymore"
Worked as intended at first but after 2 months the drain stopped working. Thinking it might have been a clog and tried to clean out the hose but no the motor went out and there’s no way for me to fix it.
"Broken, didn't work at all and the size is definitely off. Like way off. Beware of these products"
My machine arrived damaged and was leaking
"Product came with useless 2 page mutilated directions. I figured it out. Have had this for 3 months. Washes clothes real good. The spin cycle is the problem. It’s so tiny, you have to split a load into 3 or 4 sections. It is such a hassle. The spinner is super loud too. The water hook up is a joke too, there is no way that would stay on any faucet. It’s cheaply made, I’m just amazed at how well it gets the clothes clean, other than that, it’s junk."
I like the washer the water hose just dont fit my sink
My washer pay didn't work but the spin side works great.
they sent wrong color and the spin dry is not as shown it’s so small only one regular adult size clothing item could ever go in and not a bath towel this looks larger in video that actually is .
The product arrived and I was thrilled. Once I used it I was so happy that I could wash my husbands work clothes in it. Then I tried using the spin cycle… the only thing was disappointment. I returned the item so I can get a new one sent. Then they send me a message that I’m only getting half of what I paid. I asked for a call back and mentioned that I just wanted a new one. No one has called or messaged me back. This is so frustrating and a total rip off
"Not an accurate description of this washing machine. The hose does not apply to every faucet & had to return it. However, seller still refused to pay full amount upon return of purchased item.Tip:  CHK for full description of item before you buy from ""3th party sellers"""
"Compared to my old 16lbs capacity, this “17lbs” capacity is much smaller. The drain hose is very short and the power cord is very short as well. I am very disappointed with this purchase. But that’s what I get for purchasing things online instead of in person. Lastly, do not put the circular plastic grate on top of your clothes to spin, it is extremely difficult to remove once you get it in."
"The rest works fine and for our needs we'll still use it, we just have to put a bit of muscle into wringing things out before hanging them. It's a pity, the spin dryer would have saved us so much work. Other than that it's compact and works well for apartment living, but a little noisier than we would like and we solved this by putting a very thick foam doormat made from recycled flip flops under it whenever we pull it out to use it. It seems to dampen the sound really well."
"It wasn't what I thought it would be, it only wash and not dry leaving a lot of extra water & it made a lot of noise. I asked for them to send me the information so that I can return it, but they never did send me the information so that I can return it back."
"I buy in march, stop working on May, i call amazon cs, they told me trow away and i go get my refund...many calls, i dont get anything, now i dont have washer and still made payments, i get it thru affirm...dont get it, waste of money"
Very small for wash cloths and underwear
"I am changing my review of this product, it wasn't the size I was expecting, I can't say if the product is good or bad because I haven't used it, I'm sure it would probably work fine for someone else but it won't work for me, it's a lot smaller than I need, I am still returning it but the seller has been understanding and tried to help me resolve the problem"
"Stopped working on second use. Can't be sure, but seems like the motor for draining overheated and burned itself out."
"08/01/2021Update to my original review. I am changing the rating on this washer. I have not had this long at all and there are already numerous issues.1. The foam padding on the inside, between the wash tub and outer covering that absorbs shock and noise during spinning has already come off. It is held on by some weak double sided tape and its almost impossible to get your hand down in there to pull them out and replace the tape.2. The capacity is much smaller than it looks. I tried putting a pair of jeans in with a couple of small thin t-shirts and sometimes it struggles to get them all clean.3. The water inlet on the machine is leaking water badly. The hose is fine but the port, where it sits on the inside of the machine, in an inaccessible spot is leaking. I did a load and came back to a kitchen floor flooded in soapy water.4. There are many times where the machine starts beeping for what seems like no reason, then you realize that the hose is not draining properly. You have to lower the hose into a bucket for a couple of minutes for the drain pump to finally kick in and then it starts draining properly.This thing is shoddily made and of poor quality. I am extremely disappointed in this purchase. I did purchase an extended warranty so hopefully they can send a repair person to either fix it or just give me my money back. I will be purchasing a better one with much better reviews. Such as the one from The Laundry Alternative._______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ORIGINAL REVIEW:This is a wonderful little machine but there are a few issues.1. Size. It is a great size to sit in the corner of my kitchen. The tub size however is smaller than expected. The listing does not give an accurate description of the actual size of the tub. I mean I understand it is not going to hold a full size load. I can do a few shirts, some underwear, socks and a pair of pants at once but it struggles with a pair of jeans and a sweater.2. Controls. The controls are not the worst but also not the best. Once you set the load size and then select the load type, the load size resets to medium and you have to go back and set to large again. It's a bit frustrating.3. Leaks. Yes, this leaks. It leaks at the faucet connection but a little Teflon tape takes care of that. The real leak is at the drain hose. Where is connects to the machine at the bottom more specifically. It does leak a bit there. I keep a Swiffer next to this to mop up the small amount of leak. It's not a large amount, just a few dribbles but its still annoying.4. Foam Padding. On the inside of the machine, on both sides of the tub there is foam padding to help with the spinning and vibration. They are held in place with these tiny strips of like double sided tape. They do not stick well at all and are all the time sliding down to the bottom of the unit. I have to cram my hand inside, which is painful as its a VERY hard space to reach, pull them back up and restick them. A little bit of better tape will fix this issue.5. Draining. Every now and again it just will not drain. It's almost like the pump just said ""I'm tired right now, try again later"". Taking the hose and lowering it into a bucket for a moment then back into the sink usually fixes it. It does not happen often but it does every so often.Overall this is a great washer. It cleans really well. Just a few things to deal with but for the price I recommend it. I do also recommend getting the extended protection warranty just in case it is needed. It's worth the extra 18 dollars. I would not buy again because I do plan on upgrading to one with a bit of a bigger capacity at some point but for a small apartment absolutely! It spins all the water out and everything is dry within a few hours. It has saved me a lot of money!."
90 day update: Offgassing smell has pretty much gone away. I started to have a problem with an error code flashing and beeping when I tried to start the machine after turning it on. I would have to turn it off to restart the cycle. Only happen every now and then but then it started happening every time I tried to use the machine. Turns out if you turn it on and press start too quickly there’s a weird failure. So if you just wait five seconds before pressing start after turning on the power it completely eliminated the problem. Maybe there’s a little computer inside that need it the boot up first and I was pressing start too quickly. I’m keeping my rating the same for quality control issues but I would say this is a pretty sufficient machine and much better than handwashing for the price.After spending two years handwashing items The precedent has been set that basically anything is going to be much better. I was pretty impressed with the machine up front and just to address one issue with leaking. There is none if you connect and use it properly. If you read the manual it clearly states it’s an overflow safety valve that will pour onto the floor if you overload the machine. If it leaks you need to stop stuffing it. Also with the drain valve make sure you put the clamp on properly and it should never leak. That said I do think quality control is pretty low on this unit. Upon opening the box There was a loose screw laying at the bottom of the box. I can’t find any where it would’ve gone so it may just have been one that fell in the machine during production but still should’ve been removed on an inspection. The second thing it’s a bit annoying is that the display screen is not lined up with the window for the display so you can only see the top half of the numbers and have to lean over to really see behind the blocked portion. Not that big of a deal.Overall the construction is a little on the cheap side but for 200 bucks what do you expect. It’s all really flimsy plastic and unfortunately the biggest problem I’ve had so far is some serious offgassing. To the point where all the clothes kind of smells like chemical plastics/hot rubber. This may be why they tell you not to use hot water. I don’t think the plastics are rated for it. I try to always use cold water with just a little bit of warm so that the water is at least room temperature. The machine is working well and cleans clothing really well so that part is impressive. As others have mentioned the spinning cycle virtually dries anything that’s not absorbent to the point where you don’t even have to put it in the dryer. You can just hang things right up on the shelf and let them air dry for 10 minutes. The spinning is very impressive. However the rinsing is pretty disappointing. Sometimes with towels or cottons I’ll have to run the rinse cycle five or six times so that suds finally stop coming out of drain. Overall I’m fairly happy with it however the offgassing and the strange smell is really bad. I’m going to use it every day until the return window Is over to see if it gets better and if not sadly it’s going back. It’s just that offputting. Especially with kids clothing.
"Long, long story, but will try to shorten here for you.Ordered this unit, came on time.  Started using.  A week later noticed that the tub was not filling to the same level for each wash mode.  I started testing it and in some modes despite selecting ""H"" it would only fill half way or less.  Then when selecting ""L"" it might fill all the way.  In some modes is nearly overflowed.  I also found that the clothes weren't really getting as clean as I would expect.  I contacted Amazon product support, who, basically read the manual (which I had already done) and could offer no assistance and directed me to Black & Decker.  I e-mailed B&D according to the information in the manual - over a week and no reply, not even acknowledging a receipt of my e-mail.  It was around the Holidays so I gave some leeway, but finally called.  The gentlemen could not assist me (he was also looking at the manual) and said I needed to contact Tech Support, and gave me a Phone Number.  I repeated it back to him for confirmation.  Upon hanging up with him I called that number and promptly received an automated message stating this number had been disconnected.  Well, back to Amazon.  I opened a chat, they set up a replacement to be sent at no charge.  It got lost in transit (is still lost now over a month ago!).  Contacted Amazon AGAIN - they arranged another replacement which arrived a day early.  Upon unpackaging it, plugging it in, and turning it on - just pushing the power button - ERROR CODE.  Checked the manual - directions said to Contact the manufacturer.  Once again I put a call in to B&D - their answer - within the first 30 days return to place of purchase - so Back to Amazon.  At this point they said they could not send another replacement.  They scheduled pickup for both the original unit and the ""new"" unit at no charge to me.  Amazon did everything they could in this situation and I have no complaints with them. B&D dropped the ball at every turn.  I had 2 defective units and one never arrive (USPS dropped the ball on that).  So now nearly 2 months into the saga I just switched gears and ordered something else.Here are my impressions of the first unit I received and ""worked"" to some degree.Proslightweighthandled a good amount of clothesinner lid prevented oversplashdisplay is easy to readoperation is easyquick connect faucet adapter was includedreasonably quietConsdidn't really seem to agitate agressively - like every setting was a gentle cycle.  (Note - this operates differently than your ""normal"" washer.  Instead of the tub swirling and agitating the clothes, there is an inner and outer tub.  The outer tub agitates the water around the clothes.  I believe this is less effective in cleaning)while the inner lid kept water from splashing it out it also prevented from seeing inside to make sure things were going well AND made the opening to the tub smallerno lint catcherI strongly recommend avoiding this machine.  After 0 for 2 on fully functional units and its less than quality cleaning ability it's a hard pass."
"I'll start by saying I will buy this appliance again.I can't review the item because mine arrived broken and used. Seriously broken, not just scratched. I found long blonde hair balls around it. I have short gray hair. The seller did the right thing and refunded, that is a huge plus. This problem seems like a shipping problem, or warehouse logistic problems. I can't even donate my machine. Thankfully I'm not made to haul the big box back to returns, another huge plus for the seller.I will buy it again because the quality of the machine overall, based on what I saw and touched, and on online reviews, this is a good product. I'll come back to review this review in the future.Edit: the machine was truly unsalvageable. It had to be taken to the trash. Made me sad for the environment to be honest.I bought another machine by a different brand after reading many more reviews on it. You can find my reviews easily, so I won't mention the brand here, but it is better and delivery was impeccable."
I’ve bought this washing machine a little over a year ago and it’s done well during this time. I’ve probably used it for around 60 washes total. The rest of the machine still functions perfectly except this rubber tube that connects the water to the load (it was scraping against the wall of the washer and punctured a hole in it). That’s when I noticed water leaking out of the back. Does anyone know where I can get this replacement part? I called support and they said they don’t have this part for purchase. I was hoping someone in the comments section could provide guidance!
"Maybe I'm not the brightest tool in the shed, but I can't get the additional rinse feature to work. I've tried all the suggestions I found on the Amazon Q&A, but it does not work. If someone to maybe shoot a quick video so I see what exactly is done that would be helpful. The manual is not helpful at all.So I want to add to my initial review regarding the additional rinse feature. I actually tried to find a video review of this product where someone used to rinse+ feature. No luck.  The main problem is the poor design feature, it is located directly above the Program button, so, unless you have super thin fingers I don't know how this works. I read the Q & A regarding this issue and the responses did not help me at all. I don't know if I have faulty machine. I found few reviews on line, but none of those show how to initiate the rinse feature. The manual is useless, so, for me this issue is the reason I gave it 2 stars. A better design is sorely needed for both the rinse + and the Delay Start, they need to moved."
"Im a renter. I don't have a washer/dryer in my unit and I’m a new mom so I thought this would be a great investment for my small apartment and to save a whole lot of time, money$$, and valuable energy going to the laundry mat every other week. I was so right about this purchase! It arrived pretty quickly. Was very easy to set up just had to clear my kitchen of space. With a good detergent it gets the job done and WELL! I just make sure not to overload. Not to mention it looks super cute and I can store it right in my bathroom. The ONLY thing I don’t like about it is the loud noise it makes when on the spin cycle…I hope my neighbor don’t start to complain"
"I am returning this washer due to the fact that if I use the normal cycle, water level 3, it runs for 81 minutes...55 spinning. has to be a programming defect as even the heavy cycle only runs for 63 minutes which 20 minutes of that cycle are soaking minutes.  I run all my clothes on normal . The wash cycle on normal is 12 minutes for all water levels and spin cycle for 5 on level I and level 2 for a total of 30 minutes. I looked up the company information to contact them and was referred to w appliance company which has a F rating with 47 unresolved complaints. For what I paid I am not willing to lose the money. Had a Comfee brand but they stopped making it in white. guess I will have to get the Comfee through Lowes or Home Depot or the gray one through Amazon. This is the first appliance I have ever seen like this. I added a photo of the machines breakdown time chart so you can see the 55 minutes in the spin cycle.And the start of the cycle says 81 minutes."
With 0.84 cubic ft of space I'm able to put almost 2 beach towels as 1 load. That's a waste of a pod and lots of water for 2 towels. Socks / underwear are fine but once you start putting thicker clothing...good luck. 2nd issue in the back there's a sliding door to see the mechanics of the machine and it has a tube that leaks water not a lot but it leaks. 3rd issue can't find the filter to clean out. Everything else is fine just those 3 issues I'm going to return and look for a better bigger option this option in the long run is going to cost my me more in my utility bill.
"I purchased this machine right before covid hit in 2020. It was amazing! Cleaned the clothes effortlessly and wasted little water, a blessing right before the pandemic when I couldn't visit the laundromat. But a few days ago it stopped draining water. I wish I could get help with it but the product support window was closed back in March. Otherwise I would give this 5 stars"
It came crushed. I think Amazon employees broke it during delivery. But I still think it good product.
"Washer basket near the lid cracked after about the 30th load.  I don't know if this is due to cheap or shoddy manufacturing or what but, I ended up fixing it with marine grade epoxy.  Still running strong.  I did not overload it at any point either.  I literally just throw in my clothes from the day when I get home, which is no where near the capacity."
"The machine works well but they send you a hose that is not replaceable. The hose that they send you with the unit is a smaller hose that simply cannot be replaced. My unit arrived with a hose that had a leaking connector valve and the replacement they send you as a universal hose that is not specific to this particular unit. Therefore, if your hose has a slit or a leak in it you will not be able to repair the machine because that particular Hose is not available on the market."
"I think this whole thing could likely be a finicky experience.  In the end I opted to return it.  Ensure that you have only a ""conventional faucet"".  This whole setup will absolutely not work for any faucet that is ""unconventional""!  Be AWARE!  Do your research!"
"So in the first photo, the circle is where I suspects it rubs and the square shows where it busted.It was working fine for small loads here and there for ~6 months.Why have I tried to fix the rubber hose? (Which I used Flex Seal liquid rubber and I also attached some Flex Seal tape)It is because there is literally NO replacement part that I could universally get. 1 end seems to be 3/4 and the other is 1/2.So I try to contact B&D and after a few days I get a response saying I have to try and get it from a third party source. This source has never contacted me back.I did tried to macgyver it with some clear hose and such, and it worked okay, but for certain reasons, the way I had to Jimmy it, made the machine shake so loudly.  It needs to be rubber and I couldn't figure it out for the life of me so I had to attempt to fix this one I had.After replacing, I cut out more of the plastic doohickey thing so it wouldn't touch the fragile hose and I don't lose out on $300."
"I am disappointed to share that my washer stopped functioning within just six months of purchase, which was already disheartening. However, my experience with the manufacturer's post-purchase service has been consistently subpar. Despite my persistent efforts to claim the warranty over the past three months, I have received no response whatsoever, leaving me feeling extremely frustrated and dissatisfied. The lack of prompt and effective communication from the manufacturer has only made matters worse, amplifying the disappointment of dealing with a faulty product and inadequate customer service. The responsiveness of the warranty team has been sorely lacking, despite multiple attempts to contact them. This has resulted in an ongoing and frustrating experience, as I have been unable to obtain the support I need for my product. The unresponsiveness of the warranty team has further added to the inconvenience and dissatisfaction of the situation, leaving me highly dissatisfied with the overall experience."
"I have had this machine for a little over a year now. It’s loud, leaks a lot. It doesn’t see heavy use but still didn’t keep up its quality, also a link catcher would be nice and replacement parts seem impossible to find. This thing is on its last legs and I can’t seem to find support for it."
I kind of hate this. The spin cycle feels like an earthquake is happening in my apartment and it’s quite unsettling.Water has flooded out of the holes in the back for some reason. Like completely spilled out of an area that isn’t related to the hose or the water hookup - it is partial user error and partial manufacturing hiccup as the noise has nothing to do with me.Seems like an equal amount of hassle to return it than it is to deal with it. Not sure what to do.Edit:I returned this one and bought a magic chef washer. It is bigger and quiet. Glad I got rid of this. Either I got a dud or it’s on sale because it isn’t a good product.
"I love my washer, it can get a little loud but I love it the only reason I give it a 3 stars is because it broke on me already."
"I moved into an apartment without a washer, and I thought this would be a good choice given the brand. It worked great for me for the first several months then in September, I get an error on the last spin cycle. I have tried troubleshooting, but unfortunately this error continues. I had not moved the washer or anything, so there is no reason for this to have occurred. Given the price of this appliance, I am high very disappointed.  I am in contact with the company costumer service, which has been less than efficient after having to call more than once."
"I like the fact that this fits in my small space; but, it does not do a great job washing more than 2 bath towels at a time.  Need to wash very little number of items.  Will not clean 1 tablecloth unless washed twice.  Terribly disappointed."
I have exhausted all options in trying to fix this machine and haven't been able to. There is no support on here for this product and clicking on the item I bought it shows a whole different machine not the one I purchased. I purchased a BLACK+DECKER BPWH84W Washer Portable and this is not what's shown makes me wonder.
"I do not write reviews , but this right here is utterly ridiculous. I ordered the Black & Decker washing machine last week I got it on 09/16/22. My son noticed that when he lifted it up it sounded like water was inside behind the drum. He started washing see if it work then it gets stuck on E3 (not draining).  I called them they sent a replacement out which I got 09/22/22.  The replacement has the same problem my son picked it up it was water underneath in a compartment underneath there and turn it on it gets stuck on E3. Amazon keeps sending me used products. this is ridiculous and unsanitary. I honestly don't want another. I'll get one locally."
"edit 7/2023: I purchased a Black + Decker machine from this listing, and this is now listing a different brand and different product. Deceptive.Amazing little washer! It was bigger than I expected, but that's not a huge problem. Another user mentioned using a pvc elbow and tubing around the back, so I did the same, and it prevented leakage. My suggestion is to gently tip it back over a tub if you plan on taking the tubes off after use, there's a good amount of water that never drains out.edit 7/20/21: I now get no leakage, but I make sure to turn the water off immediately and drain the official tubes soon after. Not sure if this has to do with it or not. Still working perfectly! Absolutely worth the money."
"Washes clothes well, it's convenient for small loads. However, it's really loud, and doesn't drain all of the water, every time I pull the drainage hose out it floods my kitchen floor with soapy water."
"Mine started leaking after about 5 uses. Also if you have a load that’s a little too big like I washed a pillow, it gets caught up in the lip and gets torn up. I also dislike that fact that you have to close the inner lid before it starts to agitate so you can’t see how well it washes. Plus the load size changes once you click start example I click load size to 3 then select a wash cycle and start it but then it goes down to load size 1. Also it has wheels but you have to tip it so far back they’re hard to use.  Not sure if they all do this or if mine was just defective."
