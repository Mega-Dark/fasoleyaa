dangerous. had to throw away after 4 uses
This is a cute kettle but it kept popping the breaker so I wasnt able to see how well it worked
"For me, this is just not the kettle that works best for me.  That said, the first issue that we have encountered with this kettle is that plugging it into a GFCI outlet (such as the one near the sink in the kitchen) will pop the GFCI as soon as you turn it on.  Our previous kettle did not have this issue at all.  Overall it heats the water very quickly and it gets nice and boiling hot.  However, you have to be careful with the gooseneck style of kettle, as they are not meant for fast pouring the water, which is totally not how I work.  The first time I used it I ended up dumping some of the water out the top, because I just wasn't patient enough for it.  Overall it works great, but I just don't like it."
"Works well, fast not rapid however. Looks good. But, three things aren’t great, firstly there’s no indicator to show that it’s on which really has been a feature of a standard electric kettle for 15 years, and secondly there’s no indicator for how full it is. Again a feature that’s been around forever. Finally the top comes off rather than a standard feature of an attached lid that opens.Ultimately I want a kettle that boils water quickly which this seems to do well.Just the absence of standard features means I was a little disappointed."
Decent  price.  I got what I paid for.  It works as it should. But there are a lot of little things that could be better.  A window with measurements to show level of water  a lid that locks in place . A light to indicate that it is on.
I love this kettle. I use it every day. Sometimes multiple times a day.Three stars because: whatever design genius thought the window you view the water level through should be under the handle you hold while filling it...why would anyone do that?Yes. I saw that in the picture before I bought it. But I didn't realize exactly how frustrating/annoying I would find it.
The product is will give 3.5 stars. It doesn’t have light indicator and taking more time heat water.
"I liked the kettle is stainless steel, lid is easy to take off and pours without spills. It’s a basic kettle, takes 6-7 minutes to heat up.  There’s no light indicator to show water is done boiling and kettle (stainless steel part) gets hot so only touch black handle.  I don’t understand the red tabs inside kettle that indicate water levels because they don’t move but remain at the bottom of the kettle.  Hope the kettle doesn’t calcify at bottom (I empty every night and don’t let water sit in it) and lasts at least 2 years.."
The interior became rusty within 3 weeks of use. This product works fine except for the mechanism that's supposed to shut it off when it's boiling over.
"It boils water Surprise. Didn't like that I discovered after the fact that I have to take the lid completely off. Girls with nails don't buy, the struggle is real."
"I purchased this base on the 240V operating voltage. It is not as described in product information section. I received product with 110V plug. The B&D answer to my question about product specification ""Thank you for your interest in this Black+Decker kettle. Under the Key Features section there is a Specifications box that indicates this Black+Decker kettle requires a 120 Volts – 60 Hz electric power service, such as that which is used in North America. Please do not attempt to use this kettle with any other electric power service.""Yet, this product comes up if you search Amazon for 240V kettle. I really wanted 240V kettle. 5 Stars for product ( I am sure it works great on 110V outlet). 0 Stars for manufacturer (false product information on Amazon). 2.5 Stars total."
Cord is way too short not even 6 in the top comes totally off the field instead of just tilting other than that okay
"I guess I didn’t read the description enough?  but the interior of this kettle is mostly plastic! For some reason I thought it was lined completely with stainless steel. The only stainless steel part is the bottom circle. No thanks, don’t need plastic seeping into my water/coffee every day! Only giving 3 stars because I’m sure it works fine, and is nice to look at."
"I did not even try to use it!  The website description is deceitful.  The plate inside at bottom is the only stainless material except maybe some trim on the outside.  It is very flimsy!  When I set it on the base it rocks.  It is not double-walled. I assumed since they said it was stainless steel material, and with an obvious plastic exterior that it would be double-walled.  It is beautiful!  For the construction this item should be priced at $26.00.  I’m returning it without using."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            So the description says the material is stainless steel but that’s just the heating component. There aren’t great pictures of the inside. The walls are plastic. It works well and is beautiful from the outside but it’s not BPA free so I can’t keep it. I don’t care for the idea of constantly boiling water in a plastic container. Gave it 3 stars cause the description doesn’t outright clarify that it’s not lined with stainless steel.
I received 2 black and Decker electric kettlesI ordered one onlyI returned both at Whole Foods Market in Nashua NH on march 27th.They were in good  condition but I did  not like them.  Where is my  refund?
Cheap price. Cheap construction. Works well.
"I was looking for a steel or glass kettle specifically to avoid plastic, however, this kettle contains a big plastic cup marker inside the steel body that will be in direct contact with hot boiling water potentially causing leaching. The plastic piece cannot be detached, so I had to return the kettle. Otherwise the kettle appeared to be well constructed and of a good size."
It was easy to use and worked well while it lasted.
It doesn't have a LED light show on/off power ! Doen' have a lid open push button !
Just bought my electric teapot and within one month of using the bottom started to rust
"The power cord is too long, it can be shorter"
Love how fast it heats your water but it is constantly peeling off the white color. Wouldnt buy again
"This kettle is gorgeous looking. It did look as if it is ceramic, but it is plastic. Not even BPA free. I like everything about it, but will be returning as health is more important, than kettle looks."
"Since I already used it a couple of times I won’t return it. I didn’t think about material before I buy, I wish I didn’t buy this plastic one, not a safe material for boiling water. I should have bought one in stainless steel, it’s same price anyway"
I returned the first kettle that was sent. I bought it for my daughters birthday gift. It came with missing parts. The same item was $34.23 I returned it then she liked the color and style so I bought it again and paid $58.85. I think since I had to go through all of the trouble of returning and re buying the same kettle I should get a refund. Don't you?I will give you an excellent rating because we do like the product.
Not really worth the price.
"I clearly did not read the description well on this item. I knew that it was plastic on the outside, and I liked the look of the texture on the outside. The problem is with the inside!  It is also plastic. Yuck!  When you boil the water it smells and tastes off. I gave it 3 stars because it does function very well as far as boiling the water quickly and efficiently, so if you don’t mind the plastic flavor then this would be good for you."
I put it on the counter waiting for it to boil and the cord is so  short I almost knocked it over off the counter with hot water. Going with something more substantial.
This kettle is defective. We have to pry out the small copper colored piece in the photo every three days to get it to work. Otherwise it will not turn on.
"The kettle seems to work fine so far, but so much of it is plastic. Why would someone want plastic pieces in boiling water that they’re going to drink?The lid is plastic, the depth markers are plastic, the filter at the spout is plastic. If you’re at all concerned about the health effects of microplastics do not buy this."
"The picture exaggerated the height of the kettle. I had to return it. I need an actual tall kettle, not one that deceives about the height."
"Pros: Love the affordability and how much water this can containCon: Super super superrr frustrating to clean. In time, there’d be limescale and brown yucky build-up ( I use Brita filter to prevent this which helped a LOT but not completely) and getting my hand and arm situated in the corners and around the bolt etc is really difficult! The filter on the tip of the mouth is also pretty flimsy, it’s a thin net. I have it so I’m using it, but I wouldn’t recommend repurchasing or gifting."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Fast-heating pot arrived today, I used it this evening, and am surprised and disappointed that the pot with boiling-hot water in it wobbles on its base.  Also surprised and disappointed that the outer jacket gets so hot it seems like it could burn skin:  I barely brushed it with my hand when reaching to lift the pot off the base to pour, and it hurt.The element does heat water effectively as advertised, and turns off when water is hot (boiling?). But, I question the integrity of this device since the pot wobbles on the base."
"I would give this a negative 5 star review if I could. I just unboxed this product. I read the manual to wash before first use. As I began washing, I noticed the water was running through like a river. I stopped, filled it up, and watched as the water leaked all through the bottom of the kettle within seconds. This is definitely not supposed to happen. Highly recommend not to purchase this as it is a huge safety risk. I will be starting the return process after typing this review. I am very disappointed."
"The entire thing is thin plastic, except for a few metal rings and screws.  Definitely not something you want to boil water that you are planning to drink.  I was searching for a steel or glass electrickettle, and this popped into my search results. My mistake for not reading the description carefully.  This doesn’t have just an exterior plastic coating like many other electric kettles, with a steel kettle inside: the entire thing, both interior and exterior are plastic. Just to be clear."
"This STAINLESS STEEL kettle has non-removable PLASTIC ""measuring"" tabs INSIDE. Aside from that major flaw, the kettle looks well made.  We had an older model (that did not have the tabs) that lasted many years.  Unfortunately the tabs are a nope for me, so I won't be using it."
"I got this kettle about two weeks ago and at first it seemed too good to be true. Holds a lot of water, boils fast and strong, you know. Yesterday I tried to boil some water to make tea, and it didn’t boil. The light turned on and it started steaming but nothing happened. I thought it might be an electricity problem and moved on.This morning I tried to boil some water for coffee and all of the power in my apartment shorted out. I had a meeting so I wasn’t able to fix it for hours and it was a hot day so I was miserable. I thought it might be because of the air conditioning or the oven - I was using a lot of appliances at the time. Eventually the technician came and fixed the problem. This evening I tried to boil some water again. My oven was off, my air conditioning was unplugged, and and all the power in my apartment shorted out AGAIN. I cannot emphasize enough, this kettle ruined my day today. Don’t buy it"
"It's slow, it gets boiling hot on the outside, there's no power indicator light, the max-fill-up indicator inside is on the wrong side. To make such a simple device this bad is a pretty impressive achievement.."
There is a lot of plastic on the inside.
"This kettle looks really nice, but I was unaware that it was not lined or even a double wall kettle like my old one. This is a single wall plastic kettle. Very light and unstable on the base, not sturdy at all and thus gave the impression that it's not durable so I returned it. I feel that this item is overpriced for the quality. I ended up purchasing a ceramic electric kettle."
Buttom showed rust after first use
Absolute Junk!Support team wanted me to read model number which was so tiny I had to take a photo and blow it up.Difficult to return.  Waste of Time!
"This one doesn't have a light to tell you its on, so you don't know if its working, and doesn't have a viewer window to see if there is any water in it, so you have to keep removing the lid.Its also made of tin, so is super hot to touch.Black and Decker makes another one, which I had to rebuy, with the above features, which is great, but Amazon doesn't take this one back because it fell short of expectations, if you have opened the box :-("
I put 1 cup of water in the kettle & 1 cup of water in a large skillet (it's the only pan I have as I'm moving). The kettle was only faster by under a minute. Moving from the UK where Kettles are 10x that fast this is seriously disappointing.
I didn't expect the interior of the kettle to rust after two months of use!
I bought this because I thought Black and decker is good brand but this product has a bad design. You can’t open it if you hand are wet!! And the breaker is tripping some times when I use it ! !!
I bought this for my daughter last month and this morning when she used it the bottom just broke off out of nowhere causing boiling hot water to spill all over her. This is extremely dangerous. Do not buy this product
"The item page did not contain a prop 65 warning, but the kettle arrived with the thankful prop 65 warning. It was the 2nd of 3 kettles that amazon shipped that were mis-listed and made of hazardous waste."
"Worked great for the first month +, but started leaking and we missed the return window. We’ll need to buy a new one now and will likely go with a different brand."
"Looks great. Heats up fast. But, be forewarned that it will smell like plastic for a while. I bought this forgetting that I wanted stainless steel for the interior. The kettle looks fantastic. Works great. It is just not a suitable alternative to one that has a stainless interior."
"I bought this because I love the way it looks! I was assuming the inside would be stainless steel like most electric kettles. However, unfortunately it was plastic on the inside. Returning because I don't want to boil my water in plastic :("
"Product description states the kettle material is stainless steal however the entire kettle, including the inside, is plastic. I’ll be returning for a glass or stainless steal kettle - heating up plastic is toxic."
Not thrilled that I had to pay for return shipping. I literally didn’t even take the kettle out of the box or the shipping box. The spout is too short for my pour over coffee and I didn’t realize it until after I tried using my old tea kettle and it leaked. Need a longer spout.
"I bought it in the beginning of May. After 5 months, the bottom of kettle is rusty."
"Be forewarned: this is just a cheap plastic boiler. I’ve had a few electric kettles so I didn’t think this would come *without* a stainless steel lining. This is my fault for not reading between the lines but in my defense there were no pictures of the interior on here and I am not sure I’ve ever seen an electric kettle without one. However, be warned: there’s no lining, so this is just a plastic tub, which cannot be good for repeatedly boiling water given how bad plastic is. I picked this solely because of the lovely design but apparently forgot caveat emptor. I’m sad to have wasted my money but can’t use a plastic water boiler. What a fail of a design and absolute waste of money."
"The exterior is plastic! It does look nice but I’m not used to a plastic exterior. The kettle is super slow to boil, even at just 1/4 full."
"With all the great reviews and my positive experience with this brand, I did not hesitate to purchase. When it arrived, I was surprised to see the interior is not lined at all. It is the thin plastic you see on the outside. Only the base is metal. Still unworried, I boiled some water after cleaning the kettle and noticed a strong chemical/plastic smell. Thought this was due to first-time use and started over. Same result. Returning this item, puzzled...."
"It looks nice for being all plastic, but the water tastes a little off and it takes forever to boil. Also the indicator is very hard to tell how full it actually is"
Has very bad and unpleasant smell after boiling the water
"Item has plastic lid, not stainless steel. There are also plastic parts on the inside.  I am not quite sure what the benefit would be of making it out of stainless steel then putting plastic parts on the inside.  I avoid consuming food/beverages that have been cooked in plastic due to common sense health practices."
I got this kettle and it stopped working after less than 24hours. I called support and they said they cannot replace because I used it outside North America. I am angry and will continue sharing my view about this product until it is replaced
Had to return because we did not realise it was plastic inside
"I bought this product, because it was cordless, but it has an electric cord."
The plastic around the bottom started melting. Very poor quality. Order a better one.
This kettle has the best warming system but unfortunately the outer walls of kettle getting very hot and it may cause an injury if you don’t pay attention therefore it better to find something with plastic.
We like the look of the pot and how it lights up to see the water level and boil point. What we do not like is how hot the container is to the touch. It is not insulated at all so the hot heat from the water radiates through the plastic container.
"I purchased this for my home office and every time I use it, it blows the fuse in the surge protector that it is plugged in. The first use the water was extremely hot and after the 2nd use, not so much. Returning NOW!!!"
"When I looked at the product, I was dubious about the stainless steel description, and should have gone with my instinct. It's plastic, inside and out of the water tank. Not at all what was advertised or what I wanted. Planning to return this."
"very beautiful and easy to use, but it smells bad when the water boils, fishy smell, in just two days of use"
Returned it as it was very loud while working. Also had spots on inside.
"I had loved this electric kettle when I first received it 2 months ago, but I recently noticed white flakes in my heated water. I empty the kettle after every use and I have not used any abrasive cleaning products to clean it. The plastic inside the kettle appears to be peeling. I want a refund!"
"It gets hot from the outside too, burn myself the first time I use it, very dangerous and more if you have kids!"
The kettle works but is already rusty inside only after 2 months of use!!! The return window also ends after 2 months. I want my money back! Stainless steel is not suppose to RUST! The machine is also very loud when boiling the water. Don’t waste your money on this product.
Doesn’t turn off and keep boiling water
"I didnt like product and returned ,I didnt not get my refund yet, is it a question on transparency"
This kettle was a waste of money as the boiled water had a nasty taste to it
"I made the mistake of ordering this while quickly looking for a new kettle after my current one died. If you look at the description quickly, it claims to be stainless steel construction. I admit, I should have scrolled through pictures more closely and read more reviews, but I was shocked to open the box today to discover a PLASTIC kettle. Who, in this day and age, wants to boil water in plastic? I put it right back in the box and it is awaiting UPS pickup. I should have ordered my original preference- the Haden electric kettle. That's been ordered now. Seriously, unless you love the idea of drinking plastic molecules, DO NOT order this kettle."
Loved this until the automatic shutoff stopped working a month after purchasing.
I bought this last week in December and it has not been 6 months and it stopped working 😞Oh well!
"Very simple, easy-to-use kettle. Unfortunately, a little less than 6 weeks after we started using it, it stopped turning on.,"
"I was surprised to find only the bottom of the pot is stainless steel, the rest is plastic with red plastic water levels inside the pot. Can’t find what type of plastic the pot is made out of. I don’t want to drink anything heated out of plastic :("
It’s a beautiful kettle.  But four months short of a year it developed a short.  Blew the electricity!  Beware.
The kettle is plastic not stainless steel as described. Only the base is stainless steel.
I love the look of this white kettle and pretty light which is important. I knew based on reviews the exterior was plastic. However I didn’t realize the interior was plastic. I don’t feel good about heating water in a plastic kettle. The plate at the bottom appears to be stainless steel but that is it. I did not even use this kettle and therefore cannot speak to its heating capabilities or other functions.
Well is not working was getting really hot before dies on me.. not recommended..
Dead out of the box. No power on light on this model. Customer service was no help and suggested I return it to Amazon. They want you to have a 5 star experience! Dutch Bros. Here I Come until a new kettle can be delivered
"Very poor workmanship on this item. The filter did not fit properly, the lid to the pitcher was lopsided, leaning to one side, couldn’t straighten it, the pitcher didn’t rest on the hot plate evenly, it rocked.  I have purchased items made by this co. before, this item was terrible."
I thought it was stainless steel. The entire inside is made of plastic material - no notes about what type of plastic is used. I returned it and bought a glass and stainless steel electric kettle.
I was afraid that the lid would come off when pouring the hot water.
Cheaply made
"Wanted something stylist for my kitchen so without much research I bought this kettle. Big mistake. As I opened it today, I could spot scratches and dirt marks. It looks like someone returned it and didn’t even bother to clean it. Him, we’re in the middle of a pandemic?!It only gets worse: I realize it is made of PLASTIC INSIDE. And on the box it says “it may expose you to styrene and BPA”, one is a carcinogen and the other a substance that can make you sterile or cause birth problems.I’m shocked this item is even being sold."
"This kettle was packed upside down in its original box, and seems to have been opened before.  The element piece had a chunk of plastic broken off, which was still in the box.  What a disappointment"
"Bought this March 29th and it developed a crack in the bottom, now it doesn’t hold water."
"About 5 months usage, no water leak, no crack outside, heat up properly until today I poured water into clear container, my original thought was just water bubbles, soon realize those are white color paint chips quickly sink to the bottom. Wait until water kettle dry, now clearly can see paints are coming off from the bottom of this kettle, it’s not water mark. Manufacturing defects, should be recall."
"Plastic body. Looks ok, feels flimsy, and, well, plastic."
Took it on a trip then dead after 2 uses. Never again.  Black and Decker.
"I’m so sad to be returning this product, its really gorgeous, but unfortunately it’s all plastic! There is no metal lining on the inside, and there is no way I’m heating up my water in plastic everyday!"
Only the bottom is stainless steel while the rest of the inside and out are plastic. And it says nothing about it being BPA free.
"Very Gross. Had several cups of tea and noticed small particles floating on the top of my tea. At first, I thought it was from my tea, but when I opened the kettle, I discovered the source. I've washed it over n over, and I am still getting these nasty bigger white particles in my tea that I drink daily. Very gross not sure how much of that I have put into my body or what it even is. It is being returned."
A very Short power cable male it useless without buying a extension cord.
"We have bought this twice now - the first one was great. But it was shattered by our movers when we relocated. So we repurchased the same item because we liked the first one so much. But the new one has a problem with the lid staying shut. We can shut it tight and the boiling water will pop it back open, which then prevents the shut-off from working, so it will just keep boiling away until it's empty if you don't realize that it's doing that. So that is really frustrating. We cannot walk away from this thing when it's running because we cannot trust it to stay latched so that it shuts off. Would not repurchase again because of this."
I have had 2 of this model over the last few years. They look really cool when they are on and it heats water very fast. The downside is the plastic where the spout mesh filter is breaks after a while but I can live with that. The major and potentially dangerous problem I have had is the glass breaks easily when washing. Both times I have been washing the hard water deposits off in the sink and I had the kettle's glass break. Fortunately I was holding it by the handle and no cuts. After this one I am going to a stainless steel model.
"I like the look of the kettle and how quickly it heats but the lid doesn't stay open when you go to pour out the excess water which I don't like. I will see if I want to keep it in the next week or so. As stated, the box was shipped in the original box rather than it being put in another box for shipping. That's why the box was ripped and torn on arrival. Not good!!"
"I like this kettle and I have owned a couple of them. Unfortunately they don’t last very long. The first one died after three years, the second one made it four years. Time for me to move on to a more reliable brand."
"This review is for the glass body version of this kettle. I've had the kettle less than a year and the lid latch has failed, meaning the lid won't stay closed. That means the auto-off doesn't work, and that your hands get scalded when you pour unless you deliberately hold the handle at a lower position. I still like that I can see the bottom of the kettle so I know when to descale. But I  would have bought the cheaper Amazon glass kettle if I'd known this failure would happen so fast. I expected better."
"It looks like a decent kettle but there are two problems with it. First, to open it you need Leo push the buttons on the side. It didn't stay open so you need to use two hands to fill it with water. One to hold the kettle and another one to keep the thing open. This is very annoying.Second, because of this system that thing that opens is not very secure. More than once I had a situation where the kettle didn't shut off and kept boiling because the lid wasn't 100% closed. I've gone all water boiled and I'm glad I noticed right then because the next step would be fire.I wish I could return it but the window has passed. I bought another kettle. Be careful"
"It’s working good, but it’s too loud for me"
"Well it lasted 1 yr 9 mo. and just failed. Loved that pot, almost instant hot water. Usual issues with these types of products. Just follow manf. recommendations of use. Only thing you should do is get the protection plan just in case something happens, could be worth it, cheap insurance."
Don’t like this one.
"The Hamilton Beach 1.7L Electric Kettle will boil water and turn itself off like it is supposed to, but the kettle itself is poorly made. The top of the kettle is jiggly and loose, and the spout doesn't pour water efficiently. When pouring with this kettle, expect to lose a little water and expect some of the water to go down the side."
We used our kettle about 2-3 times a week. It stopped turning on after 18 months.
"It boils water fast, and looks durable. It worths the money."
"I love the idea of this kettle, however the lid catch started wearing out at 7 months.  This lid would not stay secure anymore so now the auto shut off no longer works and makes this product very dangerous.  Find a different model with a more secure lid."
"It’s one of the cheaper models out there so I don’t expect perfection. However, it does sputter water out the spout at full boil when you fill to the max line. It also does not pour correctly… a stream will come out the sides making for liquid to miss your glass."
"It is pretty with the blue light while it is heating, but it is very wobbly on the heating element."
"Does the job but is flimsy, slow to boil, slow to pour and the filler cap is awkward and needs two hands to open."
"In my opinion, the product design is flawed.  It heats water acceptably,  However, to open and close the kettle, you need to place a hand near the spout.  So, if you want to immediately boil a second pot, you risk burning yourself.  The release button should be on the handle.  I've returned the product."
"I love that this is a glass kettle but the cover doesn't open up all the way unless you do it manually. The cover gets really hot so it's nearly impossible to do without getting burned. In addition, the automatic shutoff doesn't work on mine so I manually have to turn it off. I would return this item but unfortunately I threw away all the packaging :-("
"Had one in the past which was wonderful but needed replacement after years of use. New replacement quality changed from the past as lid constantly popped open when pouring water. Also, the shape must have changed slightly as it would dribble water when pouring."
"I rarely return things, but I immediately returned this electric kettle without even turning it on.  I did fill it with water and tested the filter that hangs down from the lid.  Much water passes by the large (about 3/16"") gap between filter and the glass.  I think many people just remove the filter.  The whole product gave me an impression of low quality, and I did not think I would be happy with it.  It has a lot of positive reviews, but the reviews seem to cover more than one model, which is very confusing.  The one I bought had the Iridescent Clear Glass and white handle and cover."
Stop working after 1.5 year
"I have used Hamilton Beach Electric Kettles for years.  The prior ones, would reset the power button to off when the kettle was removed from the base.  This one does not do that and I think it is by design.  So after I've poured the hot water and return the kettle to the base, it will resume heating and I have to manually trigger the power button to off.  Dumb design and somewhat of a safety hazard because in that situation the kettle may now be low in water.  And if I forget to trip it to off, it will boil dry.I don't like it at all.  I wish I could return it.BTW: I contacted Hamilton Beach about it and a potential return about 10 days ago.  I haven't hear back from them.  Apparently bad customer service.UPDATE:  Customer service finally responded to my issue.  They rejected and claim and would not honor the warranty."
"Glass is very thin and fragile, have only used a hand full of times and I have micro cracks in the thin cheap glass. If it wasn’t for that it’s an amazing product"
There is hot spot on the plate and the hard water burns into the plate. You can scrub but it doesn’t come out. I bought a cheaper Amazon brand one and that doesn’t happen. The Amazon brand also heats up faster.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I'm writing this review in comparison with another Hamilton Beach kettle that we have, which works well.Bad Design:* The lid open/close design is bad. You need to squeeze the button on top to open it and its hard when the lid is hot (which it obv is...)* Because of the belly shape and small spout, when pouring water into a cup, all steam is directed towards the hand and it gets pretty hot and uncomfortable.Boil-Dry Protection not working:* Well.. this one is the most basic of features and today after about 15 days of use I noticed that it did not shut off automatically after the water was boiling. This is dangerous.Not sturdy:* The glass is connected to the handle by a very small notch. I can feel the glass body moving when stirring and I'm sure it can fail after use.Slow:* Sort of a nit (because this is also a larger kettle). But when boiling the same quantity of water, this is slower than my older kettle.Overall, bad product."
"This was a replacement for another kettle brand that is no longer available and was chosen for the brand name.  The off on switch is a flimsy piece of plastic that sticks way out on the bottom of the kettle and I can see that it will be broken easily if banged into the sink when filling.  The worst part is the lid - it can only be opened by pressing two buttons on the top center of the lid.  It does not stay open on its own  it has to be held open, this is a serious problem because if you leave the lid closed to pour boiling water out it leaks (not a few drips but  severe leak) so your hand is in the way of the steam to pour boiling water.  So sorry I didn't go with the unknown brand with far better reviews.  Nothing good to say about this kettle."
I could tell you about the filter that doesnt fit flush so it doesnt filter anything or that there is no thermostat or that it does not keep water warm for more than perhaps 10 minutes after boiling or that it is extremely slow to boil water compared to most but the important thing is that this thing is a fire waiting to happen. After approximately 5-6 uses it started to randomly stay on and violently boil the water until someone investigates the ruckus and turns it off. On one occasion my wife turned it on and sat on the porch talking to a neighbor for around 20 minutes. Later she came back in to turn it on again thinking it would be to cold but it was hissing and boiling like crazy and there was less than an inch of water left. I would definitely avoid this one
"You have to pour the water slowly. If you tilt it all the way, it leaks.  Also, bottom of the container rusts after a while."
It’s ok but just that. Bought it for the camper so it will do the trick.
"I have had this model Hamilton Beach Electric Tea Kettle for over 5+ years, loved it and used it everyday! It was getting rusty around the metal on the top and handle, and bottom was clouding up too often, needing cleaning too often also. Because I loved the kettle so much I decide it was time to replace it. Of course, Amazon carried it and had reduced the price so I decided to send for it.I received it the next day. I was so happy to have received it and get the water boiling again for a cup of tea. I put some water in it to boil before using it for tea,  well….the kettle did not fit on the base properly, it was unsteady and wobbled! Since I had one I knew how they fit and work! I knew it was defective so I contacted Amazon and explained the issue; they sent a replacement out that I received the next day! Took it out of the box that was banged up and set it up; once again the kettle did not fit snuggly on the base and wobbled worse than the previous one!! I am returning both of them as they are defective and are an injury waiting to happen! I am extremely disappointed as I have other Hamilton Beach products I am happy with but, not this tea kettle! I’m wondering because the price as reduced if this was a truckload of defective kettles and the manufacturer gave a good price to Amazon. I would not recommend purchasing this particular model, as great as it use to be,it’s not worth the time or money to order.I have also reached out to the manufacturer due to the faulty product fit so, I’ll see if I get a response from them! I’m happy to say Amazon backs their customers!"
"This is the third one I've purchased - first one got knocked off a counter but was great, second one was great and lasted 5 years of heavy daily use but this third one is terrible.  It does heat water just fine.  But when you pour its acceptable angle before it leaks out the lid is very narrow and the lid sits somewhat loosely on the top.  Its developed an intermittent leak out the back over the on/off switch.  It doesn't sit flush on its base but rocks a little.  Generally a good product has been cheapened and made less good by shoddy manufacturing. Will not buy another."
"Previously had the 1 L model of this hot pot, worked well, speedy boil time, lasted about 5 years, so upgraded to this 1.7L model as it looked similar. It performs the same & boils water fast, but as others have commented, the pot wobbles on the base, not a secure fit, it still works though. Also, again, as others commented, the lid does not snap lock on security. Definitely some poorer quality with the design & inspection of manufacturing with this run. But it does boil water fast."
"It boils water fast; however, it almost always fails to cut off automatically when the water boils. The top also occasionally opens up when you’re pouring boiling water"
"This was my second time buying this kettle. My first one broke down and I decided to get the same one again. Until recently I started seeing black bits floating in the water after boiling, and it drove me crazy trying to figure out where these black bits were coming from. I thought it was coming from my faucet, and I kept cleaning the faucet and kettle and thinking all was good....until I would see black bits over and over again. I finally realized they were coming from the plastic lid in the kettle, slowly breaking down with each use of the kettle. So fustrating to see the plastic breaking down with each use, and landing in freshly boiled water. Another huge dislike it that the top is designed to pop up and stop the kettle once the water has finished boiling....not always the case. As you start using the kettle more and more, the plastic lid gets distorted so that when the water reaches boiling point, only one side of the lid will release, the but the other side won't, meaning the water will continue to boil until you come and shut it off. Long review, but I had this for awhile and after seeing g major flaws, finally decided to write these reviews"
"Hamilton Beach is a brand we have trusted for years and we can't say we don't trust them now, but we are returning this kettle after using it only a few times.  The general appearance is nice and I don't mind it being on my counter.  That said, I also feel uncomfortable with how thin and seemingly fragile the glass is around the rim.  The filter seems to serve no purpose at all as there is plenty of room for water to pass around it without being filtered.  This bit is on me, but I didn't understand how it is opened until I had it in my hands.  You need to squeeze two buttons at the top of the lid to open it and then pull it back until it clicks to keep it open.  Okay, that's fine for most, but if you are going to boil a second pitcher immediately after the first, the way you have to open it and the lack of 'seal' around the lid against the glass allows steam to escape and that can get a little dicey.  The last bit has to do with the lever that turns on the kettle.  On ours it feels soft and that may be why we've had to push on it a few times to get it going.  All in all, its functional, but not what it could be and that's a surprise.  I have already cleaned it up and boxed it to return this afternoon."
"We had this Hamilton Beach 40864 Electric Tea Kettle unused in storage for quite a while, but have now been using it for a number of months.Pros: 1) Large capacity  2) Brings max water level (1.7L) to vigorous boil in about 7-7.5 minutes 3) LED lights let you know when it's ONCons: 1) On/Off lever is at the base, and it takes very little pressure to activate - this can be a safety hazard, as the cord (if wrapped around the base) or a tossed dishtowel can hold the lever down and inadvertently either activate the kettle or cause it to not turn off. This happened to us, but luckily caught it before anything bad happened. 2) Auto-shutoff can take up to ~25 seconds before shutting off at vigorous boil 3) Top needs to be pressed firmly closed for auto-shutoff to work - just dropping it closed won't do the trick 4) No spring to hold lid open while fillingThe large water capacity is great, and it's one of the few budget water heaters I've found that boils the water this well, but honestly the cons outweigh the pros and I probably would not buy it again."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            11/11/24  third update.Still dangerous. I kept this kettle because it would work even though it would not work properly from time to time. Family came into town and accidentally left the kettle on the kettle boiled for almost 40 minutes. It was full and when I found it, it was almost empty and now it had a blue substance was coming out from the base. Maybe a chemical reaction from the heat on the counter with water also bubbling over not too sure what would cause the blue.  I have now thrown this away. It is such a fire danger.Dangerous, do not purchase! Please see update below.Just like the other reviews said this tea kettle has a wobbly base. Also, the instructions do not tell you,  if you open up the top and push it back that it will snap into place, so most people think that the top will not stay put while refilling it.I have to rate this product a 3,  because I will never buy something like this again.  my prior tea kettle lasted me years and had a sturdy base.  I don’t think it would be good for the connection piece on the bottom to have that constant friction of it moving around , but we’ll see how it goes in the next couple of months.Update: purchased on 10/25/23. I used the tea kettle for 2 1/2 months. Today on 1/7/24 I noticed that my tea kettle was not shutting off, it would stay on and the water would be at a rapid boil. Later in the day, it did it again. This time I let it run for 9 minutes, it never shut off, this is a fire danger. Of course it is outside of the return policy and does not allow you to contact the seller."
I bought this kettle as a gift for my mother in law. When we set it up to use it was clear that the kettle does not fit well on the base. it wobbled a lot. I asked for a replacement and the replacement also wobbles. It does the job of boiling water so she decided to keep the wobbling one.  I have the exact same kettle at home and mine does not wobble at all. the delivered product is definitely a defective product.
"Works great, perfect size, price was good heats up fast. Well made."
I love the product but it just stop working  out of year
"Disappointed it didn't even make 11 months.  Well I had bought a Mueller (lasted 2 years) prior to the Hamilton Beach and thought since Hamilton Beach has been around for such a long time, It might last a little longer.  It did all the things it was supposed to do ""heat water"", but not beyond 11 months for me.  Will move on to the most purchased kettle and see if that works any better."
Works as it states. The silicone seal at the bottom is pooping out. I’m going to try something else. Probably used about 3x/week over a year.
"I bought a Hamilton Beach, electric water kettle several years ago. Unfortunately, it recently broke. Naturally, I wanted another one because I really liked the initial one I had.I purchased one on Amazon. When I received it, quality was terrible, so I exchanged it for another. I thought it couldbe a fluke, so I tried again. When the next one arrived, it was the same bad quality. I went to a local store that carried this brand and opened the boxes of the 4 that were on the shelf - there were ALL the same! This is a manufacturer problem. Ultimately, I bought a different brand that felt well-made.  Hamilton Beach needs to pay attention to what is going on with their manufacturer."
It has a wider lid then most so you can get your hand in to clean it but it doesn’t pour very well and tends to make a bit of a mess. The glass has the color and it doesn’t light up.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It's convenient and cool (well, hot....but cool to see led's and bubbles).  It works quickly (with wooshing noise).....overall heats water quickly....BUT....the lid didn't last long.  After just a few uses the lid somehow lost it's ability to stay open.  Do not think that's not important.....You need 2 hands to fill now that the lid won't stay open.  First few uses there would be a sort of ""click"" that held lid open....now, no click, and it closes immediately.  Bottom line?  Works well but with broken lid it's frustrating.Funny how it broke just after ""return"" date."
"We loved this product. It was very easy to use and looked pretty. After a year, it still lit up, but stopped heating the water, which is unfortunate, because we had raved to everyone about it. It would be nice if it worked for more than one year."
"I received this item yesterday,  Followed the simple  instructions for operation, and it does not work.  Attempted to contact the manufacturer, but neither their email or any of their 3 phone numbers provide any information, but just send you back in a perpetual loop.Tried to contact Amazon to determine where to send item for return, and cannot find info on where to send the faulty item.  I have spent over an hour on this issue for a $26 item.  I am frustrated and disgusted with both Hamilton Beach and Amazon!"
"The kettle is large and has good illumination. However, the kettle lid isn’t very reliable, it has gaps and moves slightly from side to side. Also, the kettle doesn’t sit very securely on its base. On the bright side, it boils water quickly, and all this at a low price."
"I bought this kettle two months ago for my birthday early this month, after my current one of 7 years became too old and discharging some coating material from the pot's body. I did not use for the last two months until my BD. And I found out that the kettle cap is too lose and unable to hold up itself, because it appears that there is no snap-in place like the old one; and when I pour the water into the cup, the water spills even outside the spout, but I can't exchange because it is over 30 days return policy, which I thought 60 or 90 days after delivery."
"The metal trim on the lid and handle started to rust after a year of use. I suspect water gets trapped under the trim when water splashes there during filling, as well as steam from boiling. Since these parts don't come in contact with the water in main vessel, we continued to use it. After two years of use, the rust is really bad and ugly so it's time to replace. The lid also stopped staying up while filling.Frankly, I'd like an electric kettle to last longer than 2 years. At the price point, it's not bad, but I hate the idea of throwing plastics away unnecessarily. I will be shopping for a different kettle."
"Pot will continue to boil unless the lid is manually latched.  This requires conscious effort and focus, as one must squeeze the two tabs together while pushing the lid down.  You can't simply put downward force on the lid and have it latch, as I believe it should.  I have 2 family members, one apprentice and two room mates.  I have repeatedly heard the pot boiling and boiling, with the lid ajar, while someone has gone off and left it.  I constantly have to go in the kitchen and shut it off.  With multiple repeated uses, the latch on the lid has now failed.  I could choose to buy another vessel, but I am going with a different brand, because this design doesn't seem safety conscious.  I won't risk it."
"Broken already, disappointed it’s not that thick. Glass shattered already"
The base is plastic. The cord is wrapped around it. This is my first one so I am not familiar if all are like this. I chose not to return because it was cheap. Next time I will get one that is better quality.
"Loved it! Then after a year the plastic part that holds the lid open broke off so I had to hold it open manually while pouring water into it. A few months later the on/off switch quit working. Not worth the money if you have to replace it every year. I have 2 of them now, but won't buy another"
"For days I was searching for the source of a bad smell in my kitchen, like rotten organic. I looked everywhere, including cans in the pantry. Eventually I located the source! It was this kettle! The smell is emitted from the closed cover of the kettle. The cover is made of some hard plastic. When the water boils in this kettle the cover become very hot due to the hot steam and emits this bad smell. I tried to boil the water with the cover opened and the kettle still emitted bad smell! I completely removed the cover. Amazingly, it still emits bad smell! I had other kettles before and none had this bad smell! I bought this Hamilton Beach kettle to get the best kettle in the market. I was wrong."
"I have previously bought one for my mother and then another for myself. Both worked well and lasted quite a long time. Mine finally corroded and began making very loud noises. I ordered a new one and the carafe would not sit flat on the base. It wobbled and spun seriously, although it did heat the water. I returned it and the replacement has the same issue, but not as severe. I'm concerned that the quality of the connection is compromised and it may wear out sooner."
We are not thrilled with this kettle but it does work! It doesn’t sit well on the base and wobbles a bit!
"good kettle for the short term- I like the light and how it shuts off.  But the lid mechanism (where you have to press on both sides of the top) can be a little bit tricky sometimes to open and close, and now, after using it for about 15 months, the lid mechanism broke on one side, and subsequently a month or two later on both sides. Without the lid shutting, this won't shut off automatically.  Are there no replacement parts?  It's a shame to just throw this away..."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Works well, except the center on base is either too long or the piece of the kettle is too long"
"I have had many electric kettles, often Hamilton Beach products. this one does get to the boil fairly fast. I like the look of the kettle very much, but, the buttons to open the top are located on the top of the kettle and require two buttons to open and are in a position that will allow you to get burned when the kettle is hot. I won't return it because I need a kettle, but, I wouldn't purchase this model again."
"You get what you pay for with this one. Its big and it boils water. It’s a bit flimsy, rocks around on the base. The lid does not stay up (not spring loaded) when you open it. And in general does not seal well, pour very slow (which is mildly difficult because of the weight) or it will come out of the sides as well. But its glass and the light makes it look nice. I’ll use it but I wouldn’t buy it again."
I've gotten many hot water kettles and got this one for a friend. I've never used this brand before but she sent a short video that the kettle wobbles on the base. Seems unstable and maybe unsafe around children so we're returning it. But she was excited about it b/c sometimes they can't hear the tea kettle whistling on the stove so auto shut-off is a great feature.
"Been using for a year. This is a very attractive & fast kettle for boiling water. I wish the measurements printed on the side weren't *only* in liters. And the lid is not removable for a thorough cleaning. It's awkward to open to get inside the lid, let alone to store it upside down to dry thoroughly. It's only a matter of time before it snaps off. But until then, it does its job, and does it well."
"Great product overall but I made an incorrect assumption about the lid on this thing. It doesn't open like any kettle I've ever had, you have to pinch two buttons on either side of the top of the lid to open it, rather than using your thumb to pop it open right above the handle. It's annoying and I'm sure I'll get over it, but I don't understand the thought process behind this design, it's awkward and could lead to someone getting a steam burn if they need to refill the kettle before it's fully cooled."
"Heats up quickly. Easy to plug and play. However, I find that if I try to pour quickly, it will leak. I think that this is due to the filter at the spout. Also, there is no way for the top to stay open on its own while filling. Lastly, I wish that it had a warming function. Sort of like my Ninja Foodi, so when the timer is done it turns off and moves to a warming funtion. Versus shutting down completely.Other than that it is good."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Can anyone please answer my question? Is the kettle designed without a button to open lid??This kettle is very nice looking.  I don’t see a button to open the lid to fill.I’m waiting for support to contact me. If I’m misunderstanding how to open the lid then I’ll change my rating
"I purchased this as a birthday gift for my sister. The kettle works as expected, except the lid doesn’t properly click into place and you have to hold the lid while pouring the hot water or it spills. Neither my matching kettle or my parents’ kettle has this issue."
Bought this on black friday because it was $18 thought wow good deal! No! They delayed delivery and charged me $25. Don't say it's on black friday special if it isn't! 😡
We purchased this in April 2023 and this past week it just stopped turning on. Nothing is made well anymore these days.
"All the reviews I read were older and I thought maybe the issue has been addressed and rectified by now. As of August 2024 I can say that my unit did not always automatically shut-off. I followed the insturctions, including having enough water in the kettle. But after 2 weeks of use the kettle is no longer operating consistently as it should. Moments ago I timed how long the kettle boiled before I had to turn it off manually. After a little more than 4 minutes of rolling boil the kettle still hadn't shut itself off. I am returning it."
I’ve had the product before and it broke so I replaced it with this one. The cover doesn’t sit flush so the water comes out from the sides while pouring. Very annoying
"We have operated one of these for a long time, and it has functioned as expected. Sits fully flat on the base, and the cover fits tightly (if tapped down after filling) so it stays closed and does its job of controlling the pour-stream into the cup, and causing the auto-shutoff to work after a few seconds of boiling. Was quite satisfied with it.Sooo -- Ordered first one for a daughter-Xmas present. But the delivered pot was wobbly on the base, and the cover doesn't reliably stay closed when pouring, spraying boiling water. --- > Returned.Replacement second one, same defects, plus obviously is a returned item, covered with exterior water-spots. Was ordered as NEW, not open-box, this alone is a devious practice.Ordered a third one when Daughter-in-law saw the first one, loved the styling, and wanted one too, before we had powered up the first one. Same defects, wobbly base, loose cover latch.Dangerous product, don't put one in your house.Planarizing a comment from an earlier review --""Thoroughly disgusted with the substandard quality of a once reputable company's product.""Love you Annette."
"I really tried to love this electric kettle is a great looking one and from a reputable brand but the lid has a lot to desire, there’s no secure seal and when you pour down the water it spreads very dangerously all around the lid be careful to not get burn and pay attention when kids are using it.It boils the water (using max capacity 1.7) in around 7:15 minutes not extremely fast but reasonably good, not too noisy and seems to be of good quality and Durable except for the lid that seems to be the part prone to fail in a short period of time.I ended buying the Amazon Basics one and is better in all aspects."
"It is very convenient. Heats quicly and efficiently. Looks cool. It only boils - it does not have variable temperatures.Update: It has been good since purchase on October 2021 however just started experiencing it not shuting off completely. The blue lights weren't on and it wasn't boiling like it's completely on, but it continued to heat the water. I was in another room and heard a noise only to find the pot was very hot and most of the water had evaporated. I checked everything to see if I may have done something incorrectly but this has now happened twice and could have been a fire problem if I hadn't caught it. It's after 30 days so I can't return this through Amazon but I have sent a message to Hamilton Beach on their website. If I don't get a response I will call. I will update when I get some answers.UPDATE: manufacturer requested the serial numbers before instructing me to cut off the plug and trash it. They replaced it with a new one. I did not use the replacement though as I bought a different brand."
"This is a great kettle if you live alone or don't have kids.  If you have a busy kitchen I don't recommend it.  It is very easy to break the glass.  As much as I love this kettle, two of them have been broken so I can't recommend it anymore."
"Over all the product is good but when ever I try to pour the water, the water tends to leak from all over the cap."
"A couple of times it didn’t seem to shut off when the water started boiling. This morning it didn’t stop until I unplugged it. It had been boiling for at least 15 minutes and the top had popped open. It over heated so much that it warped the heating base. I had it less than 30 days, daily use"
Had to replace my kettle when I dropped my almost 20 yr old Dollar Store bought kettle and broke the reservoir. This kettle is heavy. Much heavier than my last kettle. The tabs on top to open the lid are spring loaded and makes it a pain to open when it is trying to plop back down.  The handle is junk. it is 2 piece plastic that snaps together and feels like it wants to break in my hand every time I lift it. Very disappointed.
"If you tip the kettle just a bit too far, the lid will pop open and dump water. Doesn't take much to tip it - it doesn't hold up against any bit more than a trickle before it opens up and the lid is flapping in the breeze followed by the surge of boiling water. It's much more predictable and safe to always make sure you pour the water out with the lid open, but it won't stay open, either. There is a latching mechanism on the lid that doesn't seem to have any purpose.It is unstable on the base; the build quality is extremely low.Given the safety concern, I'm returning the product."
"I sooo wanted to love this kettle, I am a loyal Hamilton Beach customer for many years!! And this kettle is very pretty, boils water excellent, however the Lid Popping Open as Soon as I start pouring from very first time is not okay, very dangerous and also makes filter screen useless! The lid does not appear to be broken in any way, it looks more like a design fault to me. Very sad to have to return this!"
"Sounds silly, but the blue light looks great on the black kitchen counter. It’s a basic electric kettle that saves me from using the cooktop and microwave. I like the filtered spout. Then, after only 11 months of use, the lid wouldn’t stay open for filling and cleaning, and a week later the on/off switch failed. If it had lasted, it would have been 5 stars."
We had the mostly metal version. I highly recommend that one. This one requires yo Lu pinch the latches in the lid to unlock. Lid doesn’t stay open. So it’s a 2 handed job to open / fill it. The other one had a push button that locked the lid open while filling.Also it’s mostly glass so it cools really fast.Go with the metal one. We had ours for 3-4 years. Worked great. Going with that one again.
"Just got this item today.  The only issue I have with it seems to be a design issue.When I pour the water into the pot I must simultaneously ""hold"" the lid open which Ifind very cumbersome.  Other electric kettles Ive had in the past stay open and can be manuallyopened and closed as needed.  Otherwise it appears to be a good value for the money."
"Product works well, however when you pick up with the handle like to fill with water etc., there is not a lid open button.  You open the lid with other hand by squeezing mechanism on top and flipping up.  Not a huge deal, but when you’re used to this function of flipping the lid open easily, it’s a bit awkward and frustrating."
"Hello,  This product was defective, I used for less that 1 year and the manufacturer, Hamilton Beach, sent me a coupon to purchase another at a discount - No Way!!"
"The kettle looks nice and heats water fairly quickly but it'll also get into a raging boil that doesn't shut off.  The auto shutoff is somehow linked to the top lid being snapped closed. It doesn't seem to shut off based on the water temperature.Additionally, even with the lid snapped shut, if there is the minimum amount of water in the kettle it still will go into a raging boil and takes a while to shut off.I have personally closed the lid but not snapped it shut multiple times and so have my kids.  It's not physically hard to do but is something that is easily overlooked.  Because the boil is so aggressive, I feel that it's just a matter of time that something bad is going to happen and asked my kids not to use the kettle anymore."
If you hit the glass it can easily break.  Not good quality.  Regret buying it.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            As stated, it doesn't always turn off after the water boils. I found it on with the water boiled out of it a few times. Also the lid is supposed to stay up when opened. After a few months it would not. Making it difficult to fill. I've only had this for 4 months. It really should last and work longer than this!"
"I purchased this product originally years ago through a dept store. It finally went out on us. We loved it so much that we decided to purchase it again. Amazon was the only place I could find it.Unfortunately, the quality is not the same. First, the kettle wobbles on the base. There’s been a few times I was worried it would fall. Also, the two “lid opening buttons” aren’t needed to open the lid. It just pulls right up, which is worrisome especially when pouring hot water. Also, the water comes out wider than the mouth. I can’t stress enough to be careful when pouring the water, as I got burnt the first time using this new one.I still wanted to give it a chance, so I returned it and purchased another one. Both had the same issues. I just really wish the quality was still like the original. I never had any of these issues with my original kettle."
The inside lid is plastic
"The first one that arrived had a very strong chemical odor that I could not get rid of. It tainted any water boiled in it. I tried boiling water multiple times, I tried baking soda, I tried vinegar, nothing helped. I had to have them send me a new one, which they did. Unfortunately, the new one leaks anytime you pour water from it because the lid doesn't latch tightly (the previous one did). I didn't bother trying to get a new one again, I'll just get a better brand next time.It does work well and I use it every day, but I wouldn't buy it again."
This product Stopped working and it is passed the Time for a refund
"Do not purchase this kettle. Unlike other electric kettles, the top on this one needs to be manually pushed into place to lock up. I find this annoying to have to do everytime and other Hamilton Beach models all do this naturally where you hit the release with your thumb and the top flies open. Buy one of those and not this."
"terrible product, stopped working only after less than 2 months of use."
"Totally substandard product. Does not deserve acceptable rating. To be clear - this is the 4th time I've purchased these. ~7 years ago I bought my first and was delighted. It performed beautifully for over 3 years so I was happy to replace it. The second,  the same. Last November it finally gave out so I didn't hesitate to buy again. That was a disappointment. You couldn't fill much past 1.2L without overboiling and spitting and the lid was ill-fitting. When it quit working after only 6 months I figured I'd gotten a lemon and tried again. This one is absolute trash. Not only does it still spit so I can't fill to max - ever, but the lid is ill-fitting enough to intermittently not register as closed so it boils out if not monitored. In addition the lip/lid fit is so distorted that it almost sprays the water (spilling next-to-boiling water outside of the cup), and the kettle wobbles on the base.Thoroughly disgusted with the substandard quality of a once reputable company's product."
"I had one of these that I absolutely loved. So I ordered another when it broke, but it is NOT the same. The lid does not open all the way, so it is hard to fill. And when it pours, it dribbles boiling water out the sides, which is definitely not ideal.I do like that it’s clear and I like the blue light. If the manufacturer would reach out and fix it, I would change this review; I miss my old kettle."
"I thought for the price we would be getting something of better quality construction wise, but unfortunately I was wrong.The lid for the kettle is not tight and one has to be careful pouring water otherwise it just goes out the sides of the top.The kettle also doesn't sit flat on the stand and in fact can wobble from side to side. The glass seems sturdy and comes with a useless light in case you didn't know it was on.Overall I'm disappointed, but it does boil water... eventually"
"At unboxing my fist impression was it was low quality. The function of the plastic lid is counterintuitive. The kettle does not seat firmly on the base and wobbles around.After a months use it quit shutting itself off when the water boiled. Fortunately I was quick to notice it, but what would have happened if I wasn’t around?I do not recommend this kettle for purchase."
It worked fine for a while and now the blue light comes on and the water DOES NOT GET HOT.  It ia frustrating because I feel like this should be an easy fix but I guess it is one of those things that are built to break. Disappointing.
"I bought this item twice and in both same issue , the Lid breaks after using few time. Rest the product is good overall"
"I absolutely love my kettle, the only reason I'm rating it as I did was because I had received it used after paying full price and it had hard water stains all over it. It was very easy to tell someone used it for a bit didn't like it and just put it back in the box afterwards without cleaning it. Thankfully it still works as new and with some distilled vinegar I was able to clean it out and start using it. It would be nice if these products were checked for usage after being returned so things like this don't happen but in the end it's a relatively good product."
"I've had it for a while, but only used it sporadically at best because I preferred a stovetop tea kettle. I started using it regularly this month and it broke. It won't heat. Another reviewer mentioned the blue light comes on but it won't heat, which is exactly my problem, so this is a built in defect. If you buy it don't expect it to last."
The kettle does its job fine. It'll heat water quickly like any other kettle. The base though is made of soft plastic which to me smacks of a design model that has been made with cheap parts with an eye toward saving on costs/labor. Also as previously mentioned the button that flips open the lid is poorly constructed. It works well enough but clearly very little thought was put in to the design of this product.
"I bought this as a gift, just wow. I have it for myself and it works wonders but this driver left it outside! While it was raining! It’s all wet, I do not want to check if the product itself is damaged because like I said ITS A GIFT. wow. Couldn’t even put it under my porch! And it says it was delivered in my mailbox but no way this box would’ve fit and I found it on my front lawn. Literally wow. I know it’s not Cosari’s (the production) fault, rather the drivers but I’m still upset! Man if you were going to leave it in the rain, why not put a plastic bag around it. 😡🙄🙁"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I specifically wanted an electric kettle made of glass so I could see the water heating. I filled it up to do the initial water test as stated in the instructions. I plugged it in and a blue light illuminates the kettle, but 10 minutes later I realized nothing was happening. Kettle was cold to touch and water did not heat. I contacted Cosori to troubleshoot and customer service informed me that it's faulty and to return. They also said they have a newer model which I'm going to try and hopefully will get a working one."
"It's a pretty kettle, but didn't last 4 weeks. Well, it will still boil water, you just need to lay something heavy on the off/on lever (I use a hammer). So, it kinda works; that brought it down to 3 stars. But they have a fake warranty as well, which cost them another star. They pretend to stand by their work, ask you to fill in a claim, send it proof of purchase, and as I bought it on Amazon that was all pretty unequivocal. But they never reply. They waste your time, which cost them another star. This is a company to avoid.After a week of resting the hammer on the lever in order to bring it to a boil I tried it without the hammer and so far, for a couple of days, it's worked as well as my wee heart could desire - stayed on to boil, clicked its own self off. So yay, guys - 2 stars. But still, the fake warranty business rankles. 2 stars seems reasonable.I came back to edit, to allow that it continues to turn on and off without the hammer and still looks pretty. And I like the fact that the lid will stay up without being held whilst filling. It's well designed and likely just a small goof in manufacture. A less judgmental guy would've given out another star or two. But that complete lack of response with the fake warranty still rankles. I would avoid the company."
"used the cosori kettle for almost a year, all was great until it started disconnecting all of a sudden. the spike at the bottom was a bit bended i noticed, after i  straightened it by just pushing a bit it started working again but after one week it stopped again, it does not boil now, it is such a beautiful product otherwise. i hope it can be fixed."
"While it was working it was fast and convenient. Nice looking also. But 3 1/2 years seems like a short life span for a simple appliance like this. One day it worked fine, the next, only the little light came on, but no heat.  And now I have to figure out appropriate disposal of it."
Worked fantastic for about a year and now I see it is badly cracked where the glass meets the metal. Not sure how long it'd last. Shame since it heats up quick and looks nice.
Served for 3 years then short circuited. I need to repair the outlet now. Pretty good but I’d say its better to pay a little bit more and buy reliable one
"We've had this kettle for a year and a half, and the auto shutoff has stopped working. Now we have to be vigilant that we don't forget that we set it, lest it boils all the water away and it somehow causes a fire. Otherwise, we love it. Heats water quickly, the lights still work, and it's very pretty."
"We are now on our 4th Cosori Kettle, they look good and poor easily, but 1 lasted just over a year, the last one just 9 months. I tried cleaning the contacts, but that didn't help. We are looking for a credit or warranty replacement, let's see how Cosori responds."
"This is a rubbish appliance. It does not shut off at the boil, as most tea kettles do, and as the company claims it does. The thing keeps boiling and boiling, steaming away. If you boil it full — at the the maximum allowable capacity — the kettle spurts scalding water from the spout. Horrible, dangerous, and a waste of money. I am sending it back to Amazon.This is what the manufacturer sent me when I notified them of the problems with the kettle. Hilariously fractured English aside, notice that they are assuming the customer must have done something wrong,  not that their piece-of-junk product is faulty:“Thanks so much for your feedback, I understand the water boiled over when filled to MAX line, not overfilled, and did not auto shut off when come to boil. Please allow me 1 minuts to explain this for you.Frist, I'd like to share with you how this auto shut off function work - once the water boiled, the hot steam will rise into the steam collection hole(connected with the kettle handle) and activate temperature sensor, then auto shut off happens.Here is 3 appliance which might cause the issue you reported:1. If the waterfilled exceeds the max line,  the water might bubbled into the steam collection hole instead of the steam, in consequence, the sensor will fail to work, the kettle will not auto shut off as you described.2. If you boil tea in kettle or other liquid in kettle, the water will bubbled fiercely, and the water or tea might be broght into the steam collection hole instead of the steam, in consequence, the sensor will fail, the kettle will not auto shut off as you described.3. Please make sure the lid was closed when boiling, or it will not auto shut off also.For your problem, can you please check the 3 situation? Your feedback are much more important for us, and we pay highly attention to this issue.”Useless!"
"We enjoyed our Cosori electric kettle for about three years, but then the heating element stopped working. The blue light switch turns on, but the water doesn’t get hot it boil. We can’t find a fix to this problem online, unfortunately, and will have to replace the kettle. I’m not sure if Amazon/seller is willing to replace in such is instances. Happy otherwise, until it quit working."
This kettle has been regularly used for about three and a half years. It's has done its job well. But now the chrome plating is peeling off the inside of the kettle and it must be thrown away.
"Loved it until it cracked at about the 40th cycle.  Two weeks of use, 2-3 times per day.I bought this instead of buying a hot shot, a product I grew up with.It looks cool from a design perspective with the blue glow and boiling water, but when reading reviews, I saw another one that had cracked so I left it in the box until I needed it after oral surgery.I figured that the cracked one was just because of misuse and kept it until I really needed it.I never once stayed in my kitchen while it was boiling.  I always stepped out.  I never forgot seeing that image of cracked glass.Last night I spotted a small crack.  I felt the outside of the glass and it was smooth so I used it again.Today, the first use following seeing the crack, the crack got longer.  This time I realized that it really was serious since it had grown in length.Something about this, in the back of my head had kept me from using it and I should have listened to that inner voice.My kitchen stays cool as I rarely keep the heat on in there and having water boil at a rolling boil that you can see just never sat well with me due to changes in temperature.That said, the past two weeks, the weather, and my kitchen, have both been mild in temperature... in the 60's.I see they make a product that isn't glass, by the way.I don't know what the solution is here, as I don't know glass.  But I won't continue to use it."
"This attractive kettle is functional but care must be taken to avoid burning. The first time I used it, I popped open the top and boiling water drained down on my hand. I previously owned a Cuisinart which is no longer available on Amazon. Mine stopped working for no apparent reason. I liked the Cuisinart better because the water temperatures were adjustable. However, it was impossible to hand clean the Cuisinart because the opening was too narrow to insert my hand. The Cosori kettle has a wider opening and is easy to clean. Also, I like the glass better than metal. The instructions say to use a minimum of 2.1 cups of water for each usage. They also say to clean and dry after each use and to descale it with a solution of vinegar and water at least once a week if it is used frequently. This seems excessive to me. The warranty can be extended to two years if the product is registered within 2 weeks of purchase. The Cuisinart had a three-year warranty."
"Bought the kettle fall of 2021 it’s now at about 1.5 years of regular use and recently noticed that it is leaking around the area where the glass meets the metal bottom. For the price I think I’ve gotten decent use. Heats well/fast, shut off feature is good, no way to set desired temps for tea types though."
"What I thought I was getting was not what I got.  It heats up to one temperature and that's all you get. When the boiling is complete it shuts off.  I wanted a kettle that I could control the temperature and this model does not.  I wanted a kettle that stay on like a coffee maker, not shut off; this model shuts off as soon as it completes the boil.  If I want more hot water I have to turn it back on.  I thought I did my due diligence in filtering what I wanted and ordered the correct product, but evidently I did not. This product is a disappointment."
"I wish this tea kettle had last a little longer but, two days ago, the unit shorted out and stopped working.  We bought this tea kettle in April of 2019 and used it every day, several times a day for making tea and warming water for cooking.  The filter is attached to the lid and it broke off after about a year.  No biggie.  It still worked until it didn't.  Thinking of purchasing another since the more expensive ones aren't any better.  Good, basic electric tea kettle."
"Bought on Sept. 9, 2021. Broke today (Oct. 10, 2023), without warning."
"We purchased this in April 2019 to replace a stainless steel electric kettle (the one recommended by A.B. in Gear for Your Kitchen).  It lasted probably 10 years.  But I thought the glass looked cool, and we wouldn't have to worry about rust (the old one never did, but I saw some newer metal ones do).Very nice kettle, heated up fast, and the automatic shut off worked great.But it only lasted about 5 months.  The little plastic pin on one side of the filter snapped off, and something unknown happened to the mechanism that keeps the lid down.We can still use it to boil water, but it takes longer.  And we learned the hard way that the automatic shutoff feature does not work when the lid is up.  So if we do use it, we have to stay in the kitchen and watch it."
"I love this kettle, don't get me wrong.  The flimsy hinge is situated on the top of the pot right where the steaming hot water escapes during boiling.  Purchased in 2020 this pot has failed due to faulty design.  The spring is so strong that super glue won't fix it!  It'd be grand if the company might consider changing the design and replacing it even though its out of warranty.  I have not tried to contact the company as yet, and will do so presently to see if perhaps this defect is worthy of replacement after such a short time in use."
"It worked great and I always wash and handle with care, but the plastic part that holds the loer part of the handle literally disintegrated. Moving on to better quality brand."
"Don't waste your money. The sensor that tells it to turn off when it's boiling failed, and it would just boil itself dry if you let it. Now the mechanism in the lid has failed, so it can't be closed."
"My previous review: We really like the Cosori 1.7L electric kettle.  It is both functional and elegant in appearance.  We love the clean, glass look and the blue light around the rim as it heats up.  It heats water rapidly (and not nearly as noisy as our old one), turns off after it attains a boiling temperature.  Highly recommend it.My current review: The Cosori 1.7L electric kettle has a little flap near the spout that I presume is designed to filter out particulates. Now, we would not normally need that, but I never thought it was a problem, until later. After a little over 2 years of use, that little flap broke off (one small corner; see photo). The problem was that we could no longer close the lid without pushing in a little rod at the inside base of the lid.  I contacted the company, asking if I could get a replacement part, just so we could close the lid again. They responded that it was past the 2 year warranty.  I was quite disappointed, as this little piece probably cost 10 cents to produce. I think this is a design flaw that needs correcting.  So, I can no longer recommend this product until they fix this, ideally just getting rid of the flap altogether, allowing the lid to close."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                I am extremely disappointed with the quality of the product I purchased from your brand. The product not only falls short of expectations, but your customer service has also been unhelpful. Additionally, there are no clear instructions or videos available to guide customers on how to fix the issue simply.Due to this experience, I will not be purchasing from your brand again"
"I like it. It works how it should and it does what I want it to do. However, the issue I have is with the quality of which it heats the water currently. I have not had it that long and find it takes it much longer to heat water now than it did when I first got the item. I'm sure this is due to standard use, element degradation, which is expected over time I suppose, it just seems this did it really quickly and it's getting worse so not sure how long this will actually last.I like the blue lights. I like the boiling effect. It's hip, it's cool looking, but where is the quality in anything anymore?"
"So I needed a new kettle as I drink 10+ cups of tea daily. I been using a stainless steel one but it was horrible after a year. It would leave floating pieces of I do not know what even though I descaled it every week.  I purchased this glass kettle April 5....it worked fine but now it has what looks like rusting at the bottom which makes me a little nervous. I have descaled it and still the bottom after just descaling it turns white. I am only using spring water so I am nervous this is not safe to drink. I am thinking about returning for something else. Other than that the Kettle is rather large, which I like. It boils very fast and hot that is also a plus. Just worried about the rusting and white stuff."
"December 2021: Edited to add:This kettle worked wonderfully for almost 3 years. Then one day when my husband picked it up full of boiling water the handle CRACKED OFF THE GLASS BEAKER WHILE HE WAS HOLDING IT! Not at all cool! Thankfully no one was burned because of the accident. So I guess my excellent recommendation below should be tempered with this: it’s not a long lasting product. Look for a kettle that can’t be damaged by heat stress!Excellent product!!! I waited ten months after purchasing this kettle in order to give a tested review. We have hard water which calcifies the bottom of the kettle after about two uses. I usually clean it with vinegar every 1-2 weeks...so not as often as recommended. We have a busy household and I would say the kettle gets heated 2x per day minimum- during canning season up to 8 times per day at least! Basically we have used this kettle hard and only done the minimum of cleaning/care for it. Given all that: see the picture for how it looks after 10 months of steady hard-water use after a vinegar/water cleaning treatment. Perfect!! No rust, no surface breakdown of any kind. If you're looking for a dependable kettle, I highly recommend this one!!"
"I have waited to write this review as I wanted to use it for several months before reviewing.  This kettle heats well and is attractive but it is super high maintenance and I wouldn't buy it again if I had too!  It is huge - much larger than I need but I bought it because I am trying so hard to rid my life of plastic.  Problem number 1, there is minimal plastic located at the spout that touches water so I have to open the top to pour the water out.  Problem number 2 is it is hard to clean, the top cover is small and only opens 3/4 of the way - it is hard to get an arm inside to clean.  Which leads me to the most problematic problem.  I have fairly good water and don't have any trouble with spots (hard or soft water) elsewhere in my home but if I use my tap water it scours the bottom stainless steel surface.  Since it spots easily and is hard to clean I use distilled water only.  We can put a man on the moon but apparently we cannot make a non-plastic, small easy to keep and clean water kettle!!!"
"I absolutely loved this kettle, but...it didn't last long. I had it 13 months and in fairness used it about 4 times a day. Last week it started smelling hot and today it burned out completely! Thank goodness my breakers in my house work well! I feel this pot should have at least lasted a few years. I'm so disappointed because I love it enough I even bought my kiddo one last year, but I am afraid to purchase another Cosori. So basically, it's a great pot for about a one year use only."
"i was in the market for a all stainless steel interior tea kettle, so i thought i would give an electric one a try...well performace wise i must say it brought water to a boil fairly quickly, the setup was easy and the blue led lights are a nice touch, but the major downfall for me as a picky healh nut... the plastic that holds the built in filter.. while the stainless still filter is a nice feature (although really not neccessary).... it left  a very strong chemical smell inside the kettle after use. but to be fair i didn't do a vinegar boil and rinse..... but still don't like the idea of plastic so i returned it.otherwise this seems like a well made product, just wish they would leave out the plastic."
"I could given 5 stars.  I absolutely love this kettle.  I switched to distilled water. No Spots Durability - ease of use. And cleaning. All dropped from 5 stars to three  stars.  I Can’t get the turn on buttton wet when cleaning it.  This not a game breaker either.  Now - I received  notification to never clean the kettle upside down.  What?? I might kill the keettle.  I am so happy with this kettle,  I wlam really loving it.  BUT,  I’m not certain I would buy this product.  Maybe I will find a way ....I will update this review ,  in a couple of weeks.  I hope it will return to its 5 star greatness.  We will see......"
After a few years the heating pin connection broke and we couldn't fix it.
"I have been through many sorts of kettles. I bought this one because it was glass and i wanted to avoid those mineral deposit and hard water stains that typically show on the stainless steel ones. This also had a nice big top that I anticipated would be great for filling and cleaning. After using this, I have to say that there were brown spots on the bottom of the kettle immediately after using it the first time. They didn't go away after trying to clean. The kettle takes a long while to auto shut off and shakes when the water is really boiling. I did love the glass and i do love the size of the lid, but it's not the best kettle I've owned. It does the job."
"I am very annoyed by having to unplug, as opposed to turning it off, between uses.  It makes it look sloppy, on smaller counter-tops, like those apartment dwellers have.  It is also counter-intuitive and hard to remember.  Turning things off the s natural,  for example when I saw this email, I had to get up and pull it out, realizing I hadn’t. There’s also a great difference between something being perfect you’re not perfect and this would be absolutely perfect if it wasn’t for that factor.  I was so excited about all the other features. Another thing is that most children or adolescents will not remember to pull it out since it is the only thing they have to do that with.,"
"I really hate to give a three star review. The large capacity of the kettle allows us to make a number of cups of tea at once, which is necessary given that there are 4-5 people who regularly drink it. The wide mouth make it much easier to clean than other electric kettles we've owned. So why only three stars? In less than 6 months usage, we now have to buy a new one because somehow the lid is stuck in the open position (it won't press down and attach), and thus the kettle won't boil and shut off. Did we get a lemon, or is it not designed to be used 5-6 times each day?"
"I use this every day. I purchased about 2 months ago.It seems where the most heat comes from (where it bubbles the most) there is rust (I assume rust) inside on the bottom along the side. I clean it but most of the rust does not come off. Unsure how long I will use it.Too bad, because other than that I like it.I saw this happened to others, hoping it wouldn’t happen to me."
"This kettle was a big hit in our house-- cool to watch boil and was quick on the job. 4 mos later, the kettle stopped working one day. It would stay ""on"" but the blue ring light that let you know it was working just stopped. Seems like the connection to heat conductor was lost . I just called customer service and they were very friendly and will be replacing my kettle. I'll update once we have and hopefully the longevity on this was will be better and other was a fluke.UPDATE: My kettle was replaced free of charge and this one's been working like a charm! No issues, we love it."
"The kettle worked perfectly for 4 months for us. Easy to use and clean, glow when heating. I noticed hard water spot on the bottle of the kettle after several use, but diluted vinegar does the magic job to bring it back to shine. However, the switch button stopped to work today. It pops back immediately after you press it down, so the kettle will not heat up. I have to replace it with a new one. I would not recommend for long term use. Our last one was not as cool because it's made with stainless steel and does not glow, but it lasted for years."
"Had this for just over a year. Used it periodically. Some weeks, especially colder months, we’d use it once or twice per day. Other times we’d go days without using it. It lived on the counter and wasn’t getting bumped around. Gentle wash and air dry. Today when we turned it on the glass shattered and glass and water was suddenly all over the kitchen. Yikes. When it was working we liked the ability to see that it was staying clean, and the wide top reduced the steam emitting. The base of the internal part got a bit discolored or corroded, but didn’t seem to be a problem. We didn’t notice particles flaking off in the water. It seemed to work pretty quickly and consistently for the most part. Not perfect, though good enough for the price. However, the price isn’t great for something that breaks after 1 year. Buyer beware."
"I really like this kettle, and wish I could keep using it; however, there is a small rubber seal inside the glass between the handle/head unit and the glass to stop stress on the handle causing the slender glass to crack. A great idea for sure.However after a year of daily use we have noticed small black particles in our water. Close inspection shows that the gasket is dislodging from its location and pieces of it are falling into the water. Oh well, another modern product that timed out shortly after the warranty.  Where is that Russell Hobbs I used to have???"
"I first liked the product because it was everything i was looking for but after a month or so it stopped automatically stop when it boils, it kept over flowing and messing up the kitchen."
"The kettle is good looking and works well at first, but I would caution against buying it due to safety concerns. 1) there must be a leaky seal because mold forms at the bottom of the kettle under the glass. But even more concerning 2) less than a year after buying it the automatic shutoff stopped working reliably. It is supposed to boil and then turn off, but now it often boils and boils and never shuts off. This is a significant safety issue because it will boil the water entirely away and keep heating an empty pot - causing fire and safety concerns. Yikes."
Kettle leaks where the bottom is attached to the glass.  Only when pouring water out of it.  Haven't used it much and only discovered the leak after the return/exchange date.  Heats water well.
"Kettle speed of heating up and size were positives. The negative is there is plastic that can't stand the heat. There is a ring that you could hear cracking as the kettle heated up. Finally the handle gave out from the heat, it broke off and went in the trash. First one we had lasted one year, this one lasted almost two years. Should have to buy a kettle every 1-2 years. Moved on from plastic and glass kettles, they just don't last."
"I’m writing this with both of my thighs burnt! Bought this kettle last year and been using it regularly since. Today, made myself tea, as I attempted to pour some for myself, the glass part broke off and shattered on the counter burning my legs.I only had it half full!!As shown in picture, the handle is attached to the glass kettle by a small piece !!! I was lucky that it didn’t happen to my mom or pregnant wife!!The design is flawed!! Recall and figure it out! Shame on you! You almost killed one of my family members if it didn’t occur to me."
"This kettle is advertised with a screen filter on the lid that is supposed to filter out tea leaves or other stuff when you pour out the kettle. However there is a massive gap on both sides of the filter which renders it completely useless.Also, it takes over 20 seconds to turn off once it’s come to a rolling boil.There are better options. Don’t buy this."
Good while it lasted but failed after two years
I was sadly disappointed as the unit’s operation was not up to par. When reaching boiling it would not automatically shut off and it appeared the heating element only worked around half the base. I am therefore required to stand and wait to shut it off when boiling
"I ordered this model rather than more complicated ones with temperature control, etc. because the more features they have the easier they break. After all what do you need from tea kettle? To boil enough water fast. And this one does indeed! It works perfectly, it has this substantial heavy weight to it that you won't get with plastic appliances, and it looks great. Very happySo, I am going from 5 stars to 1. This thing made me happy for about a month, then the Power button began to be a problem. Push it down, step away, come back - the kettle is off and cold. Then it would not even stay down for a second. Then you had to hit it really hard so it would switch on. Then it would stay on boiling to the empty. Etc. etc. Don't remember when I bought it - maybe a year ago? No more than that. And it has been torture most of the time, so I am looking for a new one. This is a good-looking kettle, but oh boy, is it a POS! Before it I had a simple cheap Walmart model - it worked for me perfectly 12 years! Threw it out wanting a better looking one! Just like some men, going through a midlife crisis, get themselves younger and prettier wives. Serves me right!"
"I bought this as a replacement for my previous electric kettle and I hoped it would be as nice, but I’m disappointed.  While the wide mouth is great for cleaning, that is the only thing I like better than my old Kettle. This kettle boils for a LONG time before it shuts off causing the water (or tea) to keep spilling out of the spout. It gets all over the counter and into the ring at the bottom so it comes out when I pour. Messy all around."
The glass shattered while in use of the product. It almost caused body injury to my hands and face.
"We boil water pretty regularly (3-4 times a day) and this product worked pretty well for about a year and 2 months and has recently given up. Now the bottom sometimes is stuck to the kettle and when the start button is pressed, there is no light and it won't boil. Maybe they just don't last that long? That's disappointing since it's a fairly simple product. In any case, I gave 2 stars for how well it worked for the time we had it."
"This kettle is loud and a bit scary when you first use it. I read many reviews of spots appearing in the kettle, and it did happen to me as well when I used the water from the faucet. However, I managed to take them off by washing it because I saw the spots right away.If you use bottled water or purified water, the spots won't appear.Other than that, it does the job at heating fast between 2 to 3 min depending on the amount of water."
I don't recommend this. This product will leave you permanent stains which cannot be removed by vinegar or baking soda. I asked for a replacement and it still has this problem only after two times use! I know the stains do not have much harm but who wants to drink cloudy water with something white in it? I recommend you to buy other better kettles with better price.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The kettle seemed like any other. Nothing fancy, just basic and slimmer. On the very first use, The most important feature didn’t work. It wouldn’t shut off. I followed the troubleshooting suggestion, to no avail. I live a busy life and I expect the kittle to shut off as advertised. I recorded it for 1 minute bowling before manually flipping the off button. Obviously, this is a problem. I would never feel comfortable leaving the kettle unattended, fearing that I might forget…Basically, it might be a flaw, but it’s being returned. I will repurchase the Cuisinart I currently have (it’s just old)."
"We purchased this kettle in July and it broke in December. It was working just fine until I was filling it up at the sink one day and tapped the faucet with it and the glass broke. It was a very light tap that can easily happen when you are filling a kettle... I was surprised at how brittle the quality of the glass must have been to break that easily. I reached out to the company directly explaining what happened and sharing photos, and they did not stand by their product (didn't offer to fix or replace it). I would purchase a kettle from another company (there are many here on Amazon!) that will actually stand by their product if it breaks. Especially after only a few months, and as a result of normal use."
"It’s a beautiful kettle but I was EXTREMELY disappointed to find out about the silicone ring in the bottom!! After reading the description thoroughly with references to “no plastic” inside, I find it very upsetting that it has silicone, and it is misleading! Please CHANGE the description to include the silicone ring, or better yet redesign this beautiful product to exclude the ring- a full glass interior is what I am after.I will be returning, and I hope I get my return shipping refunded.Very disappointed customer."
"Ok so I have purchased 3 of these and now 2 are starting to leak less than 6 months of use.  Other than that, they are great."
Sorry I love this product .. been using it everyday.. But it leaks when you pour... I do not see a leak.. it seems that there is water coming somewhere.... so still love it.. but why leaks... not much.. but still???  am I using it wrong? I mean .. it is a simple machine.  So simple it is great.
"We purchased this in September 2021, it works very well. However, there was a burning smell last night and had to throw it away for safety concerns. It’s a great kettle, but broke too fast. :("
When it was working it was working pretty good and looked good. But after about 6 months it wouldn't stop when water boiled so i did it manually because im mostly waiting for it to drink my coffee anyway. But lately it also has some weird smell and a chalky taste to it too. I washed cleaned used vinegar lime lemon watever wont go away.
"While this item is, in fact, very pretty while it is working, it is not very quick.  I filled my Krups kettle of about 6 years and my old stovetop one with the same amount of water, measured.  To boil when it was full, this took 1 minute and 23 seconds longer than the Krups and was only 28.21 quicker than my stovetop one.  For 3 cups, the distinction was less, but again the old electric one was somewhat faster.  That is disappointing."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Was great while it worked. Today the top lid would not stay shut. Heard a rattle in the handle like something was loose. Shook it and that small piece came out.Guessing that it's what the lid caught on to stay closed. Now it's broken and not safe to use due to the boiling water being able to splash out with the lid wide open.It also only has a 1 year warranty (+1 more if you register on their site) but of course I'm outside of that.Don't buy it if you expect it to last longer than 3 years.
"I didn't mind the style of the Kettle, looked sleek. I also didn't expect it to be as big as it was. I only used it 2 x and on the second time, when I poured the hot water into my oatmeal, the lid opened and will no longer close. Will be returning due to the lid not staying closed."
"It works very well and the auto off feature is the best that I've used. The problem is that, as shown in the review photos, spots developed after the first use and grew in size every use thereafter. I descaled the pot before using as per instructions but the spots always form after every use. Descaling (boiling a vinegar/water mix)  removes most of the spots that, if not removed, will eventually turn into rust spots. So, the problem is the inconvenience of having to descale it every week and then use baking soda to get the vinegar smell out. Here in Phoenix we have a lot of calcium in our drinking water but I used a plastic RIVAL cordless kettle for 2 years before any spots formed on its element. Cosori is made with cheap stainless steel. Edit: It continued to get worse. I returned it for a refund."
"I was so looking forward to receiving this because my friend had a great one that looked similar  : ( sooo disappointingThe open button is obnoxiously hard to press and slippery to boot. The kettle/jug super heavy but the flimsy plastic base is light as a feather...aka the opposite of what you’d want. The lid only opens partially, so cleaning will be impossible. Three stars because it is a kettle."
"We bought this to replace our prior electric kettle after 4 years of use - the plastic holding the lid on broke after 6 months of use. There were only 4 LED lights around the base, so the lighting wasn't very consistent, which was off-putting compared to our Brentwood, and 2 of those lights rarely worked from day 1. Since it still functionally worked, we decided returning it wasn't worthwhile. Now we find ourselves needing to purchase a replacement already.Pros:Works fine while it worksFeels heavier/weight of components is nicer than average countertop glass kettleCons:Cheap construction/Quality Testing lead to LED issues and breaking parts on oursNot enough LEDs around the base to look seamlessOnly lasted 6 months before breaking under daily (not rough) useMore pricey than alternatives"
"While boiling water on the first day, I noticed a crack in the glass. See photos. Obviously,  I was sold a used product for full new price. Returned the kettle immediately. I recommend getting stainless steel electric kettles."
"This is such a lovely looking kettle and it's important to me that there's no contact with plastic (leave the lid open to avoid pouring through the plastic/mesh strainer), but I wish it had temperature control. I've made some burnt tasting coffee and scalded my green tea a few times trying to guess when the water temp is at 200F and 170F respectively. If all you need is boiling water, this is a great kettle."
Kettle looks very smart on our counter and heats water very quickly. Disappointed how quickly calcium buildups on the heating base of the kettle and how difficult it is to remove calcium. We clean the kettle a minimum of once a week. Automatic Electric switch off also take slightly longer than I wish it did - a min or two after the kettle has boiled.
"I really liked this kettle. Got it for Christmas 2019.  For 11 months it was great, if not a bit loud, but it would boil water fast, and it looked good.  Which is all you want in an electric kettle.  Well, that and not working about it coming apart in your hands.Just the other day, boiled enough to make some pour over coffee, and then as I tipped it over to pour the water it just separated from the handle.  I was extremely lucky that it just fell onto the counter and kind of righted itself; but it still managed to throw up enough water (extremely hot water) to burn part of my hand.  If I had been unlucky it could have shattered on the counter and I could have had some severe burns.It looks like there are only two smalls screws at the base of the handle that hold the handle on - and the plastic melted?  From all the heat maybe?Anyway - Wish I could recommend it; but I would stay away now, because you never know when it might come apart on you."
"It works great no problem! But out of nowhere, the switch to turn it on won't stay on any longer even if I hold it down. It sucks that this only lasted 1.5 years! I guess you do get what you paid for?"
"After reading various reviews of the Cosori;  I bought the electric kettle.  After a few months the kettle melted on the plastic top.  Almost started a electrical fire.  I called Amazon CSR;  Long wait time, and after almost one hour on the phone with Amazon and two transfer calls and speaking with A Amazon Supervisor;  She agreed to take the defective Cosori Kettle back.  FYI: I have been a Prime Amazon Customer for almost eight years;  I buy products monthly including from Amazon Prime Grocery department.  I had to plea with Amazon twice.  Dealing with Amazon on this poorly made & dangerous product was a very disappointing experience.  I would not purchase this product, and I'am very upset and frustrated with Amazon Customer Service.  I believe in the best interest for the consumer, and safety concerns that and Amazon should stop selling this deplorable and dangerous product.  FYI:  A defective and dangerous item like the Cosoriz gives Amazon a bad name, and customer service needs to improve greatly.  A not so very happy customer.  Buyer Be Aware. !  This is my first disappointment with Amazon Customer Service !"
"I've had this kettle for about two years ago. It recently stopped working; it wouldn't turn on. When we tried to repair, we realized that this kettle is the same crap from China as all the other kettles, just for a higher premium. It uses triangle screws to make it difficult to open up, and once we did get it open, we found that the contacts were tarnished (they weren't nickel-coated to prevent this). Save your money and buy a cheaper kettle, or else do what I am planning to do next, and splurge on an actually high-quality one."
"Out of the box, unused and brand new, this kettle stunk of highly toxic airplane glue. This stink was probably caused by the gluing of the glass housing to its stainless steel base. I've owned kettles of this kind that did not have this stink upon viewing the product out of the box. One wonders who runs a company like this and whether quality control and safety inspections are done! But hey, if a smell like this accompanies an item through which you will be ingesting its water, well, do I really have to comment further about how dangerous a product like this can be for your health? Only someone completely unconscious and stupid would not remark on this this kind of issue, and apparently there are quite a few characters like this, who gave this crappy product a 4 or 5 star rating. If you like the smell of toxic glue you will love this product! I returned it directly to Amazon. Smells of this sort are often associated with causing respiratory difficulties, brain fog and cancer. This product should be removed from the market due to its health dangers! I hope Amazon reads this review and acts responsibly."
"It works great, but a small amount of hot water leaks out when you pour at the spot where the metal band starts.  I bought it for my vacation rental, but there's too much liability for something that leaks hot water in a spot you wouldn't expect and could burn someone, so I am returning."
"EDITED: So annoying!  DO NOT BUY.  Over the last few months, this water boiler has started to turn itself on by itself without the on-off tab being pushed down  ... very creepy!  Then it started intermittently refusing to turn on when I pressed the ""on"" tab.  The final straw was today — a metal strainer part (connected to a lever that tells the base the lid is closed) broke off ... so now the lid won't close, and the thing won't work at all.ORIGINAL REVIEW: We bought this water boiler after our old one (after about six years of service) started smelling like burning plastic every time we used it.  There is nothing that ruins a cup of chamomile like the worry that the water might be carcinogenic!  Anyway, this all glass-and-steel boiler is what we picked to avoid having that issue again.  We've had it a few months, and so far so good!  The ""ground effects"" lighting and the way you can see the water beginning to boil are also silly and unexpected joys of this boiler.  Probably the best feature of this boiler though are its exceptionally large capacity."
This is my first water heater. I find it more convenient than heating Water on the stove or in the microwave. It took 6 mins and 15 seconds to heat up 6 cups of water.My biggest concern is the stain that formed inside. It won't come off. I wonder what caused it. It seems to be getting worst the more I use it.
As with a lot of stuff on here the reviews dont necessarily reflect the reality of the product. Cheaply made plastic latch broke and now will not stay closed
First product I received had the spout misaligned with handle so it was pouring at an angle.UPDATE: Amazon sent me a replacement which is perfect. No issues but there is mineral deposits forming inside as I would expect. Not a problem. Only concern I have is the glass seems kiind of thin. Hopefully it never shatters. Keeping my 3 star rating due to initial quality control issues.
"Unfortunately the item I received was previously used. It smelled like tea leaves, there was a heat ring on the bottom and the filter was dirty. I reached out to Amazon support, and the only option was to send it back, which I didn’t want to do because I was concerned that they would turn around and send it to another customer since I had already received it in a used condition. I decided to keep it and try to clean it, which was hard because whatever the previous person had used in the kettle was so potent that I couldn’t get the smell out after cleaning it 3 times."
"Plastic on the filter! Contrary to all the notes on here, there is DEFINITELY plastic in contact with the water. The screen filter is metal but held in place and outlined by flimsy plastic. The water must pass through it every time. Huge bummer. Probably could break it off but it really should’ve been designed to be removeable.  Disappointed in the false advertising for such a highly rated product!!!"
"This is a very basic electric kettle. I don't know why it has gotten so many rave reviews. It is overpriced for what it is. It is super cheaply made and when it boils the whole thing starts shaking. If this were $20 I could understand but for twice that I would expect higher quality. I can tell after using it twice where the lever will break. It is all cheap plastic, it isn't even heavy or durable. I'm really disappointed but frankly I should have just gone to a real store and looked at them in person. So that is my fault."
"I guess my water has minerals that leave deposits in the bottom of the kettle, but after 1 use, there are white spots on the bottom of kettle that don't wash off.  Probably happened in my old kettle but couldn't see inside there to compare lol!Love how quick the water boils and stays hot for a long time.  Happy with purchase."
Had Hamilton Beach before and loved it.  Glowing reviews convinced me to buy this as replacement.  Bad decission ... Some false advertising as well as not so great balance in your hand compared to Hamilton Beach. And btw both have plastic lids ... This one just has chrome colored on the inside.
"I was using it daily to make chai. The bottom stains very easily but you can use a rough pad to clean it. A couple weeks ago my lid stopped staying shut, it just stays open now.I wish this had a timer or something on there. Some way for me to set boil for 5 mins etc.. perhaps temperature as well. Maybe that's asking too much."
"Love the kettle but it rusts really bad on the bottom over time to where bits of the metal get into the boiled water. great at first, not built to last"
"Really nice kettle with one big drawback: it’s really hard to keep clean and the metal plate at the base rusts/scales really quickly. You have to dry between every use and clean with vinegar regularly, but even that doesn’t stop it. To be fair, this happens on stainless kettles too, but the glass makes it super visible. If someone could just make a full glass kettle like the old Pyrex ones..."
"Attractive, after receiving I questioned the need for the kettle. For my purposes the microwave is more useful. Many Items such as Non-instant oatmeal, or anything that needs cooking cannot be done with water boiled in this kettle. I find it somewhat difficult to remove the kettle from the base. I think the blue light that comes on when turning on the kettle should turn red or green when the water is boiled."
"This 2-star review is because the vendor inaccurately claims no plastic touches the water. Unfortunately, the non-removable filter on the lid at the spout has a plastic casing.  Buried in the reviews but not the specs or description, the vendor solution is to open the lid when pouring, which is entirely unacceptable given their plastic-free advertisement where they say no plastic touches water, and yet the lid pour spout has plastic. Buried even further is the option to upgrade to the model that has a stainless steel filter holder. I would have purchased the upgrade, but having inaccurate information from the vendor about plastic on this model, I am now stuck with the plastic filter pour spout because I can't return.  Not happy."
"Glass went everywhere including in my eye (went to eye doctor to have a shard removed from the corner) and face (little cuts on my eyebrow, side of nose and chest). I was still holding the handle, and I mean exploded. Will not be purchasing again, no matter how much I liked this item. I will not take the chance of damaging my eyes. No reason for this to happen, I always rinse the pot out  before I use it. Last one broke while on the heating coil, thought it was a one off. No it's not the materials are obviously not what they say it is. This product will ONLY LAST ONE YEAR as I bought this in 2021. The other one was purchased in 2020 and broke in the beginning of 2021."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            it does the job. It has a button to open the lid and a button to boil the water. You can see light black patterns in less than 10 days! and I didn’t expect it to happen in less than 10 days! So I guess it’s because of the poor quality of the metal pieceUpdate: I have added one more picture. It has been a month now and much more darker black patterns ! The seller didn’t reach out to me and I think it seems normal to them!
"I am reordering another version of this kettle since after spending much time selecting one to avoid plastic touching the water, I was sent one with a plastic filter. What is the point of this? Then, while looking again for a new kettle, I found some of these have a stainless filter and only one has the plastic bit. Really annoying. The ""transparent"" one apparently has different parts. Be aware and order with caution. Otherwise, the kettle looked nice—no sense having plastic in this area."
I really like having an electric kettle. This really isn’t that easy to clean with the lid attached. I also just noticed the the measuring on both sides are noticeably uneven. Other than that I like it overall but probably would had picked something else. Does leave those spots you see in the photo but that doesn’t bother me as much
"We started using this in September 2019, and now it is December 2021 and it suddenly died. While it was working, it was great. Just disappointed it didn't last that long."
The lid does not open fully and you cannot see water level from outside. other than that it’s okay.
"I was hoping for a good water kettle, but not so sure. It worked great for about a week. Then it suddenly got load when turned on. It also has a steam capturing system. That worked well too, but now the steam rolls out of the spout. Wonder if we got a bad unit."
"Three stars for the sleek design and no plastic parts coming in contact with water. Now, here is the lowdown:1) capacity: the kettle is larger because the base is much thicker and the top max line is lower than other popular brands. I initially ordered a 1.5 l model, but it turned out to be huge. I ended up going with a 1 l which compares to my old 1.5 Aroma kettle on the overall size, but obviously fits 0.5 l less water.2) it is noisy; my pervious run-of- the mill kettle was quieter out of the box and got louder as it got older, but this one has been quite loud from the get-go; 3)  scratches easily. I ordered the silver-colored option. It looks like a metal construction, but in fact the outside shell is painted plastic. It scratches quite easily. Despite careful treatment, the base has got a few unsightly scratches already.When it is time to replace it, I will look for a different model. Hopefully by that time there will be other options with no plastic on the inside."
"I was searching for water kettle made in Germany with the intention to have water kettle that last longer. So I search for ""electric water kettle made in Germany"" and this zwilling kettle popped out and just trusting that this is a German brand.  When I got it right away, the way the lid open it does not feel like it is made in Germany.  The cover didn't pop up easily and I have to manually open the lid instead of the button that should open it.  Then I look at the box, sure enough, it says made in China.  The price of this kettle is double then other kettles' brand."
"As much as I like the look, the quality is really bad. It started to rust only after 1 month of use. At 6 months, the lid is loose and the kettle no longer automatically shuts down when water is boiling. Not worth the price.Contacted the seller hoping for a replacement. No response yet."
Poor quality product. I used it once and some water was left in the kettle overnight. Nest morning I saw a dark dot on the bottom (see photo).
Cheap made. Easy scuffed. No any buzzer sound when boiling done. Received one (bought as new) but it had few scratches. Only good thing that fully stainless steel inside.
Rusted after 7 months of use.
It stopped working after two years.  Maybe that’s average but I thought it would be better given the brand.
I expected a brand new water kettle. I received instead a worn torn box with used broken electric kettle.  Very disappointed it was shipped used but purchased brand new
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Very dangerous kettle! I just turned it on 3 times and each time with cold water to clean the inside, and my kitchen almost burned down, well I was there at that moment and unplugged it from the socket, no refund and no replacement. I am very disappointed"
"Update: 6/2/24 knock on wood, but this kettle is still going strong. I happened to see my old review and want to be fair and update.My hardwood is still damaged from the boil over and I’m bummed but learned a life lesson.We now do a vinegar water boil as soon as we see calcium build up. And use the kettle next to the sink with the spout aiming into the sink in case of boil over.I like this kettle, but am unsure if my (filtered, but hard) water is the problem or if other kettles would have same issue. ⭐️⭐️⭐️.53/12/21 We've only had this since Jan and it has started to boil over. At first cleaning any minerals with vinegar seemed to remedy this. But not so. Still a boil over (yes, minding the fill line is NOT the top line). Boil over caused new hardwood floors to start squeaking, due to the boiling water to gush onto them.Was great until it was terrible and dangerous."
I love everything about this kettle except that it’s so big.  The modern design is great. There’s no plastic that touches the water and it’s super easy to clean.  I wish it was 1/2 L smaller.
"This review concerns the delivery rather than the product. It was another example of a Prime delivery going astray, this time for 3 days. Amazon offers no explanation of why. What are customers paying for with expedited delivery or the Prime service?"
"As you see in the picture, for 3 months every day use, I noticed that on the side of the lid, the rust has been accumulated possibly from inside parts. Zwilling said that they won’t provide a prepaid return label to send it back for their evaluation.This product looks good and functions well but please be awared that you may have the same issue (I cannot say that this is a common problem.) and it is possible that you might need to pay an extra cost."
"Went on sale 20% cheaper a few days after I could no longer do anything about it.  Leaves a bitter taste...  $95CDN is fair, $115 less so (2024)"
"The way it's photographed, it looks small and nimble, but it is very big. Make sure to check sizes before purchasing.I hope ⬇️ this was helpful."
"If it wasn't for the hassle, I would have returned this right away. Two key problems - Plastic: The lid is plastic and the scale filter is plastic around the borders, also the warranty can't be registered in Canada. So that is what you get for over a $100 of kettle. Other than that, it functions as would be expected of an electric kettle, the look overall from the outside is quite impressive and slick."
"I like that the kettle boils water quickly. However, there is an intermittent loud knocking sound.Also, need to have my hand lower on the handle or steam burns."
"Very sad to see that this kettle is NOT made in Germany as someone has stated on these reviews!! The spout is poor in the way it splashes water all over the place when you pour from it. The look is cheap and doesn’t fit well in a North American Kitchen. It starts to shake when it boils and is very loud compared to our previous kettles. Overall, we’re quite disappointed with this kettle."
"Bought in mid-April.  Died in the beginning of June.  It looks nice and it's great, but now all I have is a paperweight.  Contacted their customer service, but no response yet."
"The toaster did not toast evenly, for a simple reason: the heating wires were not pulled through the insulation in all locations. See attached photos.Otherwise it seemed like a well-designed, solid, simple toaster (good in my book, I don't need my toaster networked) with nice features, such as a long slot for full bread slices or four bagel halves, pop-up heater.Hopefully they can get their manufacturing/QC issues sorted out."
"Some of the heating element wires do not glow red, a slice of bread gets very brown and toasted on one side of the bread and only lightly toasted on the other side, about half as much so certainly not even on both sides. In use it doesn't really feel very solid or well built, (I just replaced a Toastmaster used 32 years), then again this old toaster was a cheap one for the time as well.Updated,; Found that the heating element wires were laying against the board that they are installed across. If touching the board the wires don't glow red.  I identified the ones that weren't glowing then used and Exacto razor and with the tip of the blade slightly raised the wires off the board in various places. It doesn't take much, just slightly raised and they will glow red. Now they are all, or at least mostly, glowing red and the toast turns out a lot better. I'll keep it. Just a small attention to detail  that would reduce waste and cost in our society. An adjustment to the manufacturing process would solve the issue."
"A very nice, contemporary looking 4-slice toaster.  The slots are a bit wider but just two slots.  When toasting one or two slices, the bread needs to sit in the middle of the slot.  When toasting 4 slices--two slices on each side--the bread is side by side.  We purchased this toaster to replace a 4-slice that was only toasting on one side--two slots.  But that toaster had a ""bagel"" feature and this one does not.  When we toast bagels, even at the highest temperature, the bagels are not as ""well done"" as we would like them to be.  The instructions suggest keeping them in for another round to get darker, but if you don't pay close attention they will burn...smoke up the kitchen...and set off the dreaded smoke alarm."
"I have lived with this toaster for over a year (family of 5, pretty frequent use as the kids love toast and bagels), and here's my assessment:When you first buy it: It will smell like plastic for a while, and will only really seem to toast on one side. Anything over 2 (on a dial that goes up to 7) will INCINERATE your bread product.Within the first six months: You will hear crusty pieces of break shaking around in the unit, but even when you pull out the tray at the bottom, almost nothing will come out, but still the crunchy old toast remnant sound will remain. Try as you might, you will not get this to stop; your crunchy old bread pieces have entered THE TWILIGHT ZONE (also known as the area between the inner housing and the outer case. How? No clue).About a year and two months into ownership (just long enough for your warranty to expire, yay!), you will find that the lever won't stay down to toast your bread, and you are now forced to stand there like an idiot and hold the lever down until your bread reaches your desired level of toastiness. You will swear, you will cry, but you will stand there like a fool at the behest of your toaster.BONUS: You might find a video on YouTube for how to disassemble the toaster, and if you're lucky enough to have the right goofy star bits used to hold it together, you will take the toaster apart and find that one of those pieces of mystery bread has become lodged in the mechanism, which is why the lever won't stay down. You'll remove it, rejoice when you find that this fixes the problem, then put the whole thing back together.Epilogue: While you'll be happy your toaster is working again and proud of yourself for fixing it, you'll find that the lever on the OTHER side for the sacrificial bread warming arms or whatever-the-heck-those-things-are will work to put the arms up, but when you put it back down, only one arm will go back down. You'll push the other one down manually and say ""forget it"" because you don't use that stupid feature anyway.Good luck!"
Worked ok for the first year and now it takes two cycles to toast anything. Also it seems to be failing already as the mechanism that keeps it held down is failing. Cheap price = cheap quality.
The concept is great. The toaster looks good and is sturdy but it does not toast evenly. The top of regular sliced bread does not toast. I have followed the directions and placed the bread in the middle; I have adjusted the temperature but it just doesn't toast evenly.
The toaster looks great and has nice long slots for wide slices of sourdough bread but....the middle of the bread does not get brown until the edges are burnt.How hard can it be to make a toaster that actually toasts bread evenly.The pop up warming rack is a good feature but that alone isn't enough to convince me to keep it.I shipped it back to amazon.
"Update: 11.13.24 Seller offered a free replacement w/out return of the 1st one... I'm going to give it a try and see if it works good. Will update with results.I am very dissapointed, I expect better than this. Multiple parts of the very small elements inside each slot would not light, no qualioty control at all. If this is what I'm going to get I may as well keep the one I have as it is starting to get dead spots in the elements. Returning for credit."
"Works well when used as designed. But Heat Level and Toast Quality are hit or miss. Slots are not deep enough for standard bread or bagels. Will need to flip to heat both sides but is very easy to burn or over overcook. Sturdiness is questionable, as it rattles with the slightest touch. Smell is still foul even after a month of using; but ease of cleaning is as described, very easy."
"I bought this item, not once but twice.  The first toaster was okay in toasting as long as I had it on a high setting.  This second toaster, that I replaced it with since it was not toasting as well (about 2 years) doesn't really toast at all.  It needs a second time... but then you have to watch it that it doesn't over toast.  Bought this again because I liked the top rack and the defrost.  Unfortunately,  I waited too long to return this but planning to get a different toaster after 2 months."
"I really want to give this 5 stars because I love the slim line look of this toaster, which I was looking for. However two things drive me crazy about this toaster. First it has slots for 4 pieces of toast/waffles etc and never toast them evenly and it’s slow. I’ve adjusted the settings over and over. Second when you push the top “eject” button you have to hold onto the toaster or the toaster slides with the push of the button, its worst then the toast being uneven. However I do like the flip up heating bakery element on top. This toaster has such potential, it’s quiet too , just not quit there, for that I give it 3 stars."
"I'm disappointed. I've tried sandwich sliced wheat bread, Italian, and French bread slices and they all toast very unevenly."
"Very inconsistent toasting. Are you feeling lucky? Under toasted, over toasted, just right who knows."
"Bought this to replace our two slice toaster since we all eat bread or waffles at the same time. It is good for toasting a lot of things but the top of the bread or waffle doesn't slide all the way into the cooking area. So it will either come out still soft, soggy from melted ice, or still cold/frozen at the top. When cooking 1 to 2 slices you have to turn down the toast dial from what you would use at 4 slices, or it will over cook."
It did have some uneven browning. Does not have 4 slots just 2 long ones.
"It's just as bad as every other toaster under $300. They all suck. I've tried several. But for the price I probably shouldn't complain too much. It looks great and has an OK cord length for a toaster.On the highest setting it won't fully toast Artesano white bread or sliced sourdough from the store (not to mention my thicker cut homemade stuff). But that's okay since this thing toasts so unevenly between the center burners and the outer burners, I now do one pass on #3, swap the bread into the other slot, and do another pass on #3. It also toasts the ends of the slots more than the center, so if you're making a long piece of toast like sourdough, you'd better like either burnt ends or undercooked middles. Or cut them and rotate even more often, but then you're defeating the purpose of a long slot toaster in the first place.The other day, I was cooking a Mickey Mouse Eggo waffle for my kid, and when the cycle was complete this damn toaster launched that sucker 2 ft away and straight onto the floor. I didn't know whether to be pissed off or impressed. I guess maybe a little of both? I guess if I ever have an intruder I can use this crappy toaster to attack them with a half-cooked Eggo waffle (see above) like I'm Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone.I dream of the day when somebody figures out how to make a toaster that toasts evenly and lasts a reasonable amount of time for a reasonable price. In this day and age we can communicate with satellites from our cell phone and will soon be sending humans to Mars, but we're still using the same old 1920s technology to cook a dang Eggo. That being said, this thing is really no better or worse than any of the other mainstream brands that I've tried over the years."
Only two slots for four pieces. Bread placement critical and much more complicated than a simple four slice toaster.
"The ECT-3100 is a great looking toaster and looks beautiful in our kitchen. It toasts pretty well when cooking bread, but once you put a waffle or any other frozen item in, you take 2 full cook periods, even with the setting up at 6."
"Purchased this toaster in July 2024; The ""light toast"" function doesn't seem to work right.  At the second notch, it pops up completely white - more like stale bread, then when I toast again at the same notch; it burns.  The top where the slots are has burn marks that I cannot get rid of unless I want scratches all over it.  Needless to say I'm a little displeased. Not sure I would recommend to anyone."
The toaster looks good and it does a fine job of toasting the bread that gets toasted. But it is either not deep enough or doesn’t let the bread go in far enough that the top edge of the bread does not get toasted without the lower edge getting burned
"In 25 words or less: toasting was uneven and had poor darkness control from beginning, then as time wore on (18 months) it became unreliable and inoperable.I have had this for 18 months (purchased May 2022).  I didn't like it from the start - the toasting was uneven, the toasting darkness control was not sensitive.  but my cognitive dissonance kicked in - my wife liked it because it could do 4 slices and bagels - and I forced my self to say ""well, it's not that bad.""  18 months later: Yeah, it is. The toasting was uneven because about a fourth to a third of the filament strands were still flat against the backing and didn't generate enough heat to toast. I devised a tool using thin plastic to get between the filament and the backing and the plastic was stiff enough to twist and gently push the filament away from the backing.  The toasting improved but my remedy was uneven, too.  (But, really, I thought I paid for the filaments to be working.) Then, after a year, the bane of all toasters appeared - as far as i know it's for all toasters --  the magnetic lock that holds the bread carriage down began to fail. Push the toasting lever down and 'bam!' the toasting lever went back up immediately. Again and again.  Sometimes it would work sometimes not. We got superstitious. changed receptacles once and it worked.  that's the key!  Well, no, not really.  I read that cleaning the toaster would help with the magnetic lock.  I pulled the crumb tray.  A few small crumps. I turned the upside down and shook. Whoa! all sizes of crumbs began to fall.  After 15 minutes of shaking and at least 1/4 cup of crumbs, most of the crumbs were gone and the magnetic lock did work again reliably. Only for a month. then the intermittent failure began to happen with increasing frequency.  I cleaned the crumbs again. But this time, no go. It doesn't work period. (Maybe shaking the toaster isn't good for the magnetic locking mechanism?) Isn't there another locking/release mechanism that can be used? this is not the first toaster I encountered where the magnetic lock failed time and time again. I didn't try to get the toast darkness control to be more sensitive.  It's hard to find the spot where the toasting is as desired. It'll either be too light or too dark.  and this was at setting ""2"" (out of 6).I'm either going to go all in for super-duper expensive toaster that doesn't use a magnetic lock but rather something more reliable or I'm going to buy most inexpensive one from Walmart that uses the same magnetic lock and toasts as well even though it won't last long - then I'll buy another one. Disposal toasters, I suppose.So, again to summarize in 25 words or less: toasting was uneven and had poor darkness control from beginning, then as time wore on (18 months) it became unreliable and inoperable.  I hope this helps."
I was hoping to put a slice of bread in the toaster and have it come out toasted. There are at least 7 different bread placements to choose from when toasting multiple slices. Can’t think that early before coffee
"I love it. Works well, great for bigger bread like sourdough slices. Only bad thing is, it leaves a weird chemical smell when you use it. I figured its the oils of the manufacturer.  But its been used frequently for sometime and it continues. Im a little concerned."
"I love the long slots you can toast 4  normal sized slices of bread or one of the larger sized artisan breads which is why I bought this toaster.The issue I have with it is the holder for the bread doesn’t go down far enough so it doesn’t toast the top half of the bread properly, so I end up turning the bread around and toast it again."
I loved the concept. I buy sourdough bread and artesian breads. And really wanted this toaster. But had to return the first one because it didn’t toast the bread all the way. They sent me a replacement. That one only dried the bread out without any toast color. And that was on the highest setting. I was willing to try one more. But wasn’t given that option. So disappointed.. 😢
"The toaster works well enough and I like the longer shape, however I have found that it collects a stupid amount of bagel crumbs, seeds, pieces of broken pop tarts and other food waste to be very practical. I live in a city where it is imperative that all kitchen items remain clean and clear of food waste to prevent pest problems.The tray at the bottom only collects a minimal amount of stuff while more of it falls between the operational area and the housing. The use of poorly made torx screws on the bottom makes it near impossible to take apart. I was able to get it disassembled with some brute force and a flathead precision screwdriver and fortunately got the crumbs out for now (about half of them are pictured above the rest came out with a lot of shaking), but they should make it easier to clean. Otherwise it feels like they just want people to be wasteful and buy a new toaster when it gets too cruddy."
"It doesn't toast english muffins well and it take a long time to toast anything.  It is nice to look at on the counter, very sleek.  I do like the pop-up button."
Got this for the long slots because we use a lot of rustic bread etc but it doesn't toast evenly.
"The top of each slice sits proud of the toaster elements, leaving a strip of un-toasted bread. Also, no bagel setting. It toasts okay, but falls short in the design department."
"We liked this toaster with its two long slots.  It toasted well and evenly, and when it clicked off, you could play catch-the-toast as it popped up enthusiastically.  But it died after just 30 months - the shortest-lived toaster we've ever had."
This toaster was great as we have a family of 5 and the extra space to toast more bread at once was awesome! Does it save space? No. It's long so it doesn't stick out on your counter but I keep everything pushed back and it uses up a lot of space lengthwise. I'm looking forward to a smaller toaster again.We paid a little over $42 (after taxes and all) and it lasted less than 3 years. The elements went out. We clean it regularly so I'm surprised and disappointed. Just saying... most Walmart brand toasters would last over 10 years for less than $10. I'll go with a different brand when I order a new one as I'm looking for reliability not spending $42+ on toasters every 2 years.
"Something the manufacturer doesn't tell you until you have bought and received the toaster and read the manual, is that if you put in only one slice, the toaster will unevenly heat on one side, leaving you with one burned side and one decently toasted side on your normal setting, or if adjusted to a lighter setting, one decently toasted side and the other barely toasted at all.  As unhappy as I am with the issue, I am more unhappy that the company did not warn prospective purchasers about this peculiarity in the advertisement for the product prior to their purchasing the product. I expected better and will probably not buy this brand again."
It looks like all of the hearing elements don't heat?
"Received today and immediately put it to use. Very inaccurate in comparison to the user manual (pics) with a 4 setting being more like a 2 setting and had to toast again. The second time I set it on 6 and it was almost a 4 setting. I'll give it a few more tries before considering returning since it can't toast the first time the way I like it.Update; the settings only work for the inner coils, and it appears there aren't the same number of coils on the outer sides and why it only toasts one side kind of close to the pics for settings. Not a quality product."
"It’s my fault once again purchasing a non, namebrand cost-effective appliance. I’ve literally bought twice and have cried twice! This second toaster lasting less than eight months. Basically the toaster stops browning on both sides and you need to micro manage the toaster to achieve your desired toast. What a time suck!  Now I am switching to the “Smeg” brand And hopefully this is it. I wish I could start my purchasing experience all over again and buy once,  cry once.Now I have bought three times and cried three times!"
"Love everything about this toaster EXCEPT!! IT DOES NOT TOAST THE WHOLE PIECE OF TOAST (bagel, waffle etc) So annoying? Why? The toaster is not shorter than any other toaster we have owned."
"We bought this toaster because our other toaster was slow and didn't hold larger pieces of bread, like Rye.  However, you have to toast each piece of toast halfway, then turn the toast over and finish if you don't want one side burnt and the other raw, or random spot burns. It's pretty on the counter, but not doing the job I hoped it would. Now I have 2 toasters on the counter. One for regular size bread and this one for those pieces that won't fit in a standard toaster."
"This toaster is extremely difficult to use (never thought I'd say that of a toaster 😂).  It comes with an in-depth instruction manual because of it's complicated design and we've still yet to figure out how to toast bread evenly and/or completely.  We've had it for 8-9 months and even have the instructions posted near the toaster, so the family can follow them but it's hit and miss everytime. Either it's barely toasted at all, or burned to a crisp.  Totally unsatisfied."
Like the long and wide slots that accommodate both long slices of bread and thicker items like bagels.Do not like the uneven toasting of those long slices where one end is dark brown but the rest of the slice has little or no color change.Also do not like having
"I like this toaster.  It is the nicest made-in-china toaster I have owned.  I could not find one made in North America or Europe for under a few hundred dollars.  HOWEVER, in less than 2 months the hold-down latch stopped working.  The toast won't stay down.  I cleaned it and all that stuff.  When I went to the manufacturer's web site to see about the 1 year warrantee a robot chat sent me to a PAY-FOR small appliance repair advice page.  I don't care if the initial $1 fee is refundable, I don't want to give my credit card information out instead of being sent a working toaster!  It is probably a faulty contact for the electromagnetic solenoid that operates the latch.  I have fixed these before.  Oh how I long for that old Toastmaster of 60 years ago with the cloth-covered cord!  I could replace the cord with a properly grounded cord and it would probably still work.Update: The problem was the circuit board that contains the cancel light.  Sometimes it would energize the hold-down magnet, sometimes not.  After some time, I tried the Elite Gourmet site and found my way to a person who could honor the warranty.  They wanted me to verify I cleaned the toaster, a video of the problem, the original receipt, and a picture of the toaster with the cord cut.  A new toaster arrived in 12 business days and it is working.  Let's hope for a while.  I like it."
It is a toaster. It toasts
"Also I accused her of not doing it right.  I live in New Jersey and during my visit to Pennsylvania, I had occassion to make one waffle for her upon her homecoming from the hospital.  The pictures are evident that it has only been toasting one side.  Yes it be two years, but she complain from day one.  Now she say I want a toaster for one thing....toast.  She is 92.  Doesnt want bells and whistles on her toaster, but would like both sides toasted.  Me...I would turn it around and do it twice!"
The last few months this toaster only toasts one side of the bread in each slot. It has to be turned on 6 (highest setting) just to get light brown on one side. Have to flip bread then toast other side. Not ideal when you’re cooking breakfast for the family. On to shop for another brand that works properly.
Works well with useful features but recently about a 3rd of the warming coils stopped working and it is toasting the ends very dark but the center of the bread is still pale. We will need to replace and unfortunately will not be repurchasing this. Our previous toaster lasted 10+ years without issue.
"These toasters: I bought two of them & will return the 2nd one also, these were toasters 4 & 5, I already retuned 3 other brands.  Same problem with all the toasters, at least 1/3 of the elements do not heat up. My last toaster lasted me over 10 years. This morning it took me 3 times to get my toast toasted correctly on both sides, it shouldn't be that hard. I purchased 2 more different brands today, maybe I'll find one that works properly."
"This toaster was sent from the Amazon Warehouse, but I assumed that it had been fully checked out before being added to the list of items for sale.  As you can see from the photos, it was almost literally thrown into a box without any original packaging (did include instructions) and provided with only clumsy packaging, such that it was rattling around in the box during handling and shipping.  Because I had recently experienced a toaster with a malfunctioning thermostat that nearly started a fire in my kitchen, when I got this product, I proceeded to test it for the same or a similar issue.  I placed some refrigerated bread in the slot, set the thermostat control to the midpoint on the dial (in this case, a ""3""), and dropped the lever.  At the same time, I set a timer for one minute.  When the timer went off, the toast had not popped up yet.  I manually shut off the toaster and the toast was too dark.  The question is why hadn't it shut off automatically?  I then took another slice of the same bread and put it in the slot at a setting of ""2"" on the dial, dropped the lever, and timed it for one minute.  Again, the timer went off at one minute and the bread was still down in the toaster - so I again shut it off manually.  Why hadn't the toaster shut off automatically at the lower setting?  At this point, I was done fooling around with this malfunctioning appliance.  And, BTW I don't think the apparent faulty thermostat on this toaster had anything to do with the sloppy packaging job.  A toaster is probably the most uncomplicated kitchen appliance there is, and they were probably one of the first kitchen appliances ever invented.  Of course, I contacted Amazon and explained the issue, but I wanted to be ""compensated"" for my time dealing with this crappy product.  After much too long in the customer service chat mode, I was finally able to negotiate a ""promotional credit"" that would appear on my next Amazon shipped order.  As such, I dutifully shipped the thing back. The problem now (as if this episode hasn't already been a big enough problem) is that when I placed a new and different toaster in my cart and proceeded to the purchase stage - you guessed it - there was no promotional credit.  It seems I'm back to square one on this.  IS THERE A WAY TO SCORE THIS WITH ZERO STARS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DESERVE EVEN ONE STAR?"
"I like the length, 4 slice,  the cord it not convenient.  But it toasts good,looks good, and is a nice weight."
I bought this because I use larger bread that regular size. I was hoping it would work better than my old one. One side doesn't really brown well and the other side seems to over brown.
"The toaster looks great. Heats up as it should EXCEPT it browns one side of the bread more than the other side in both slots. So, one slice of bread is darker on the other side. This just started happening.  I cleaned the crumb trays. It doesnt matter if its basic white bread or sour dough bread from a grocery store. Its going to get burned or you eat it with one side browned lighter. I plugged it in where my last toaster was so its not the outlet. My return window has already expired so I didnt notify the company. Its a great concept though.  Maybe yours will work as it was designed to be. Thank you."
"I didn't want this big *** ugly toaster on my counter, so I bought this.  Problem:  You can not fit 4 slices of normal size bread side by side.  This has 2 long slots on each side, so you have to overlap the bread a bit on each of the two slices.  It works and I can get a pretty decent toast, but this is almost like deceiving advertising.  There are NOT 4 slots in this toaster!!  However, with that said, it does work pretty darn good so far.  I found a work around this by overlapping a bit.  If you use small bread you would not have any issues."
"Elite Gourmet has you jump through hoops to get a replacement under their 12-month product warranty (requiring video and photographs, including requiring you to cut the power cable), then I didn't receive the replacement for over 3 weeks.The toaster does look nice but doesn't toast evenly if you are toasting a single slice of bread."
This toaster is okay but sometimes have to cook the toast twice it doesn't seem to toast that well
"The toaster is very nice, and has several great additional settings, however, a normal size slice of bread does not go down far enough to toast completely, leaving an untoasted top about 3/4 inch wide. Unfortunately, I had discarded the box, so I cannot return it."
"Toaster has a chemical smell. Instructions before use is to push down the lever (empty of bread). Allowing heating element to burn off chemical smells before use. This process takes SEVERAL times before the smell is completely gone. It's ""trial-n-error"" to obtain bread toasting color. Have to put bread in a certain way when only toasting one slice. Otherwise, it will not toast evenly."
"Keep the dial below 3 to prevent burning the toast, as it does get hot"
First of all the toaster does fit many size slices and has a nice warming rack. After owning it for over a year now I am getting a different toaster. I've adjusted up and down to try and get a consistent browness but it sometimes under browns and most times over. There's always one side browner than the other also so if you want both sides the same you have to flip it halfway through. I've gotten tired of trying to figure it out and it's too late to return.
"I am disappointed in the toasting. If I turn it down it is not dark enough and if I turn it up it gets very dark on one side, almost burnt and not toasty on the other side."
Small crumbs tend to fall through the bottom even with a catching tray so moving the toaster leaves a trail. Pick the toaster up gently and hold it over the sink or garbage can when pulling the crumbs tray out for cleaning.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This toaster is the size I was looking for which I love. I wanted a toaster to make my sourdough toast which regular toasters are too small for and this thing is nice and big. The size is perfect. However, this toaster is weak. In this video, I have to set the setting to 5 (which is the second highest) to get enough color on it. This toaster wouldn’t be able to burn thick toast. It needs a lot of help to toast which might turn someone off from getting this thing. Love the size, needs a lot more power to be able to do its job."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I’m finding it hard to pay $35 for a toaster that doesn’t toast evenly on both sides. I exchanged my first purchase with the same one and both did not toast evenly. I bought this one originally because it fit longer pieces of bread but I’m better off toasting one end and flipping it over short side and toasting again with a regular sized toaster that’s less expensive. I also found that if you toast two consecutive pieces on the same setting one after the other, the second piece toasts more so it can end up being burnt if you’re not careful. Returning the exchanged toaster and searching for another brand."
Makes lousy toast. The top quarter of every slice is not toasted. The toaster just doesn't have the capacity for American bread I guess. Even a bagel comes out undone on top. After almost a year I am so fed up with this toaster that I'm throwing it into the trash even though it's not broken. I'd rather just buy one that works right.
Toaster is very long so I returned it.
"Died just shy of 2 years after purchased. It suddenly stopped ""popping"" and just kept toasting. If we hadn't been in the kitchen keeping an eye on things it absolutely would have started  a fire in my home."
"light weight, moves on counter, top Sounds hallowPoor for toasting two items at a timeYou must read where and remember how to add your bread, or the bread will burn on the sidesLooks great"
"I've had the toaster for about 10 days now. I have been experimenting with the heat setting to find my preferred toasting. I started at 1 and have made it up to 4 of 6. However, no matter the setting, the first time you push it down, it barely browns the toast. Each time I have had to toast a second time to get any color on the bread. When you do have to toast a second time, you must dial down to 1 and watch it or you will blacken the toast. Too much guesswork for a toaster."
Bought this toaster in October of last year. Went to use it today (pretty much daily use) and it no longer works. It was a great toaster but only lasting a little over a year is not ok.
The tips brown a lot more
"I don’t know why ‘they’ can’t build a decent toaster anymore.  I bought one and returned it immediately because it was so inadequate.  So I settled on trying this one.  The darned thing only toasts half of each side of a slice of bread.  It’s absolutely worthless.  I can’t return it, I waited too long wallowing in my disappointment!  Haha!  I’d give anything to have my old 1940’s toaster back. It was still working beautifully! Somebody knew a good thing when they saw it and stole it while I was away."
"This toaster does not toast evenly at all.  The outside of the slots toast less, crazy, never had a toaster do that, so I turn the temp up, that helps with the outside toast, but the inside of the toast gets darker.  Not happy with this toaster at all.  very disappointed."
I do like the design and I do like that it fits four slices and I especially like that even smaller pieces of bread pop right out. I don't like that it doesn't toast evenly. You had one job. You are doing it poorly. Toast should be evenly toasted on both sides and this toaster is not good at that
"regret buying this. it can’t even heat up an eggo waffle evenly even on the highest setting. toast is toasted on one side while the other side is still soft. do not buy, waste of money!"
On one side the heat stopped working and would only toast one side and it had to be flipped. Would not recommend. Amazon did in fact make it right though. That's the second star ...
Toaster is meh. It doesn't fit 4 pieces of normal sized bread or bagels. Have to turn it to 4 to get it to toast anything consistent and then it's mostly burned. Not a fan.
"At first we noticed that the bread did not toast evenly on both sides. Not a big deal for the price point and it still worked.Fast foward just under a month and a handful of uses and its almost completely unusable.The heat is very inconsistent.Same setting, same bread, wild results.No matter if it's from a cold start or just been used. The temperature is a toss up.May end up with unevenly toasted bread, may have one side burned and the other side untoasted."
Has very poor toasting. I have to turn it all the way up to get bread to toast.  The dial for darkness was not marked to see where to turn it so I had to mark a dot on it with paint
"I bought this April 7, 2023 and I thought it would burn off the new but still to today it sets my fire alarms off. Not good to buy this toaster."
"I splurge to get a larger toaster so the homemade bread will fit....almost(need to be just a little deeper).  The first one wouldn't release on its own.  The light/dark knob had no resistance.  If it weren't for Amazon's return policy, this would have been a major pain.  Having read the reviews and knowing this was the least expensive long toasters out there I replaced it right away.  I also paid for the 4 yr. replacement/refund program.  Still less expensive than other long toasters.  Replacement works fine.  Be sure to check yours out immediately."
This toaster is pretty and has 4 slots however all of the toaster crumbs fall out of the bottom after each use. It’s very annoying! What happened to having crumb tray🤔🤔🤔
Bought for the long slots.  Feel is lightweight and cheap.  Doesn't always toast evenly.  They just don't make thing like they used to!
"The size of this toaster is perfect for my kitchen, I wanted something a little less bulky than a normal four-slot. So after reading reviews I ordered this one. First I made some regular toast and it wasn’t toasted evenly and the tops of the bread was almost completely untouched. Disappointing. Next I made a bagel, this thing burned the heck out of the bottom of the bagel while it left the tops untoasted. Disappointing again. I made bagels again hoping the first time was operator error or just a fluke, but nope. Every time I make a bagel it burns it. So I gotta babysit my bagels so they don’t burn, which sucks. I definitely wouldn’t recommend this to anyone even though I like the size and stainless appearance, it’s main function leaves a LOT to be desired."
"It's really such a bummer. After all the looking around and picking a toaster, the first item in was burned. I tried toasting buns only to realize there is no option to toast only on one side. As someone who likes toasting bagels and buns, I was very bummed. It looks like yhe cheapest buns at the store are even too wide and every top is touching the elements. It's a very quick toaster though and overall things seem evenly done (burned). I wanted to return it the moment I saw there was no bagel option but my husband had thrown away the packaging. Was not worth it for me and I'll probably have to replace before long as it's not what my family needs."
At first it worked great. Now it's not browning the whole piece of toast. It will sometimes and other times it won't. I'm very disappointed in this product.
"The product looks exactly like pictured. The biggest issue with this toaster is that it toasts unevenly.  If you try to toast 4 slices of bread, the bread in the front row toasts much slower while the pieces in the back row get done (brown) much faster. If you restart it without decreasing the level it will burn badly! You are able to toast baguette or longer piece of bread or bagel but again, it just doesn't seem to be toasting evenly.  However, now that I know this, I plan accordingly and its work out well! But the trial and error was quite annoying and wasteful.  Bread is a touch to expensive to burn up in a toaster set on 2.5 of 6"
Doesn’t toast consistently the heat controls are very unreliable looks nice but don’t toast evenly and according to the settings u choose!
"My search for a toaster that doesn't drive me crazy continues. This toaster showed promise, but it has a few flaws that are ultimately leading me to return it. For some crazy reason there are a series of holes in the bottom of this thing that allow crumbs and debris to bypass the crumb tray and go directly on the counter. I made one everything bagel in it and my counter was a mess afterword when I picked up the toaster. It's bad enough that the crumb tray is about as wide as a stick of gum, but then I held up the toaster and low and behold, bright light shone through the bottom in multiple places where there are holes in the metal. Also, the spacing of the heating wires in mine seems really inconsistent as far as distance from the food goes so you get a really uneven toast."
"Toaster does not toast evenly top to bottom- the top inch is warm bread when the rest is done (even though bread is fully in toaster!) Also, once you’ve toasted once so the appliance is warm, you better turn it down or it will burn fast the second round. Expected to some extent but at this rate I want to my old Walmart brand 4 slice toaster that I was sick of back on my counter!"
"Works quickly and we enjoy the four slice, long slot design but it does not toast evenly at all! We have to toast our bread then flip to evenly brown."
"The Toaster worked great for about 10month, then it started to Break down. Now it will only toast 1 side of each toast.Not a durable product."
"I like the long slots. Barely wide enough for an average sliced bagel. Not deep enough for an average sliced bagel so bottom gets blackened and the top stays untoasted. Breads are fine. So, would I recommend, not if you're a bagel lover. I'll keep it for breads."
"Originally I loved this toaster. It was chrome for a fraction of the price and seemed like a steal. I don’t know about you, but I certainly did not expect to be buying another one in two years. Over the last month or so, everything now takes two full cycles and it’s begun to toast very unevenly with everything burned in the middle the slots. End result? You get what you pay for."
"Beautiful toaster, but doesn't do it's job! After a full wait on the highest setting, (and it IS a wait) the bread is barely toasted. Have to put it back in for another half cycle. When looking inside while it is on, I notice that some of the heating elements have cold spots, some almost the full length of the toaster. I'm certain this is the problem, just bad circuitry. And there is no bagel setting, wouldn't have bought it if I'd realized that. Semi functional, so I'm not going through the whole return thing. To bad, this could have been a gem, rather than a let down."
I'm very bummed about this toaster. I liked the price and the look and the fact you can do bagels. Well no matter what setting you use you have to push it down twice and keep an eye on it not to burn.
"On the plus side, the toaster looks good and cook times are easily adjusted.On the downside, returning this as the slots are too shallow for our bread. (Kroger or Franz wide loaf breads) or even Eggo waffles for the kids. Sometimes a little uneven, but that's to be expected for an inexpensive toaster.Basically, we don't want to deal with an untoasted strip atbthe top for years until we need a replacement."
"In need of a new toaster, I scoured through Amazon reviews in search of a practical solution. This toaster seemed to fit the bill with numerous reviews praising both the look and capability of this reasonably priced brand. How could I go wrong? Well, the look of the toaster is fine but it’s not remotely capable of its one job. First off, you cannot fit two slices of bread on a single side of the toaster. The stock image in the advertisement shows two bagels in a single slot, which may work if you order bagels from the mini food store. Ok so you have to use two slots for two pieces for bread/bagel/whatever, no big deal right? I still get my toast, no harm done. Wrong. Toasting in this toaster is a roulette wheel of fun. Rarely your toast will come out with both sides perfect. Sometimes one side is charred black while the other looks like it’s fresh out of the bag. Sometimes for have to toast 3x at max time just to get a little brown. It’s completely unpredictable and as much as I appreciate the independence the toaster is showing, I’d much rather have a toaster soldier that does what it is supposed to do well and predictably. Buyers beware, don’t believe these five star reviews!"
it was a fine toaster but stopped working in less than a year. i expected better and longer-lasting quality at thi price.
"The look of this toaster is nice and stainless steel. Pretty on the counter top but that’s about it . It toasts bread , bagels , waffles too much on the top portion and burns it . When you take it out you realize that the bottom is still cold . I have tried rotating it but it didn’t help . I’m sad it didn’t work the way I wanted it to. :(If you stand by the toaster and pop it up yourself every 30 seconds , you’ll have perfect toast . Lol otherwise it’s not going to cook properly ."
Here I am less than a year later looking at a different toaster purchase. This toaster dial is not accurate. It either under cooks or burns. The dial seems to not change anything in the cook cycle. I’m sick of cheap toasters and this toaster is not worth the lower price tag.
I bought this toaster because it could toast large pieces of bread. My complaint is that the white dot on the indicator is too tiny to read. Toast never comes out done enough. Should have returned it but too late now!!!
"We have been using this for about a year now. It is just OK. The temperature setting seems to be very hot and miss. On the same setting it will toast perfectly one time, under the next, then over the next."
"Decent toaster, but comes in a box clearly labeled what it is, ruined one of my mom’s “filler” gifts."
"Here you will get an honest , unpaid for opinion. Not a sales review. I'm not trying to please a manufacturer , only our family. These are just our or my  honest opinions so far on this toaster.We needed a new toaster. There was no choice there. Our old wide slot bagel and English muffin toaster gave uo the ghost. When I saw this longer wide slot, I thought, ooo..long enough for croissants!  That it is, but it will ruin your croissant,  your bagel and your English muffin everytime. Why? Because there is NO 1 SIDED TOASTING or BAGEL FEATURE! The outside just BURNS.It's ok otherwise, I guess? Just nothing all that special about it.  I'd give up the extra long feature for the 1 sided bagel any day.We did try the defrost mode. No. Just. No. Warms the outside. Inside still frozen solid stuck together. Still had to defrost in the microwave.The rest of the just ok part is, ok...so It toasts. 6 levels,  but again, even that is just sort of, Meh. It's not like this is any difference over the 6 levels our still working almost 65 yr old toaster has. It just isn't digital. I haven't noticed any benefit that makes this stand out against other toasters so far, and we have to toast on 4 twice to get the desired browning because 5 or 6 does it too quickly and burns instead, especially for things not toast like English muffin.Also,, I wish all toasters would stop listing removable crumb tray as some special feature. They all have a crumb tray. They pretty much gotta to meet fire safety codes and regulations. Again, even our old early 1960s model toaster has a crumb tray. Please. This is not a selling point. This is a bare minimum standard feature in order to function properly.  Tell me it can do 1 sided. Now that's a bonus feature!We are trying to decide to keep this or send it back. Gotta say, so far.. I'm leaning on sending it back. I don't think I can be happy without my 1 sided toasting feature, and there is nothing else so special about this toaster over any other that makes me want to lean towards keeping it.Now that's my honest opinion. If you don't eat bagels or English muffin, you'd probably be perfectly happy with having to toast your items twice each time so they don't burn too fast. Not us though.  I think it's time to go shopping again.UPDATE - WE sent it back! There is nothing 'sexy' about a mediocre, sucky toaster ! So glad we did. Found a much nicer option fir less money."
"I really wanted to like this toaster, but alas!I combed through all the long slot toasters on Amazon and decided on this one...despite some of the concerns I ready in the reviews. I figured sometimes there's user error with some reviewers...especially when so many others leave good reviews.It has a reasonably small footprint with a nice variety of features, especially the long slot (for artisan bread). Unfortunately, there are too many drawbacks. Things to be aware of before you choose this toaster...I tried positioning the bread in different positions along the slots, and nowhere could I get it to toast evenly...see picture.The body is all metal so it gets pretty hot. Not a kid save toaster that's for sure. Even as a cautious adult, I burned my fingers multiple times trying to get toast out after it popped up. Also, we had to pull it out away from our fridge panel, which is wood, for fear of the heat damaging the panel.Lastly, after only a few weeks, and without daily usage, the indicator symbols are already starting to wear off.By the way, if you're not familiar with Euro iconography, you should definitely read the guide to understand how to use the controls.I'm super glad that we kept our old toaster just in case. Alas, we will be donating this one and going back to our old toaster.Good luck on your journey to find a long slot, small footprint toaster...my search continues!"
"You're probably looking at this product because you want a toaster, and thought to yourself, ""Well I don't want a piece of crap, but I'm also not spending $200-$300. This product has 9,000 reviews Maybe this is the one""Well, the product works. It toasts bread and fits 4 slices. Its not a miracle worker, it will not provide you with perfectly even picturesque golden toasted bread.  Sometimes you'll have to pop it up and flip your toast to get it even. Sometimes it'll pop up randomly, sometimes it'll over toast. It will likely perform similar to every other toaster you've owned, because be honest, you're not looking at a $40 toaster and expecting perfection.Its worth about $40. It toasts bread. You can spend the 3-4 minutes standing in the kitchen looking down waiting for you bread to toast and think about if next time you can justify spending $200 on a fancy toaster that lets you walk away and cooks perfectly."
"So my family enjoyed this until it stopped working just about a year into its use. When we reached out to support, they responded that ""we are powerless to do anything"" about it. That may be true of the customer service reps needing to follow certain policies, but if those policies didn't exist, they wouldn't be powerless.We still can use one of the toasters. The other died and we don't know why. It looks pretty nice overall, but admittedly it doesn't feel sturdy and is flimsy and the experience our family had reflects the build quality.On the other hand, it's a nice looking toaster. So we are conflicted about having to get rid of it, but it's too bad because they are ""powerless"" to stop us.Unfortunate. My family isn't a huge toasting family, and I've never used it myself, but when my husband used it with some of our kids, they really liked it while it worked."
"The best thing I can say is that my husband and I have had a lot of laughs over the toast roulette we play. Sometimes the item isn't toasted and sometimes almost burned at the very same setting. We are experimenting on what combination of settings will work for various things. At least when the item isn't toasted enough, it can be put through again, and that seems to be the result more often than being burned. The extra long slots are nice and they are wide enough for bagels."
"The toaster works but is made with thin metal and it rattles loudly when the lever is pushed down or it pops up. There are a few ""cold spots"" in the heating elements (wires) in the toaster- something that the instructions (oddly) says is normal but it doesn't completely brown food that is placed near those spots. If you use a toaster every day, you'll probably want to invest in something sturdier. I also bought a hand mixer from Mueller recently and  was very disappointed. It is supposed to be multi-speed but no matter what level you set it at, it's either completely off or on high- nothing in between. Their standard of quality has fallen since they moved most of their manufacturing out of Austria to China- something that most consumers (including me) weren't aware of. Apparently in 2023, they agreed to pay to settle a class action lawsuit that claimed that Mueller used the Austrian flag and the name ""Austria"" to mislead consumers into thinking their products were made in Austria. Apparently the only tools they still make in Austria are their camp axes."
"Toaster worked well out of the box with the control buttons fairly self explanatory.  First toasting trial with 4 slices resulted in nice, evenly brown toast top to bottom and side to side.  However, I noted that the slots, while appearing long, are actually a bit short to easily hold 2 pieces of many commercially available bread loaves, i.e. brown berry.  I had to squish the pieces a bit to get them to fit and when the cycle ended, had to help the handle up because the slices expanded a bit under heat.  The other issue noted is quite simply my fault.  There is no option to toast just one side ala a bagel setting.  I should have noticed this before ordering.  These two issues force me to give a mediocre rating.  This is a decent, inexpensive but limited 4 slice toaster.  If you want to regularly toast larger slices, if you want to toast bagels or english muffins or if you want to toast slices of differing darkness at the same time - look elsewhere.  I am undecided on whether to keep it or not."
"Toasts ok, HOWEVER, one of the dumbest designs I've ever seen, electric cord-wise is, this toaster has its electric cord terminated on the end of the toaster that has the lever to lower the bread in.  The cord SHOULD'VE been terminated on the opposite end of the toaster."
"The design is nice but this toaster doesn't toast evenly, I always have to flip the bread. I think the quality is not the best for the price so  I would avoid getting this toaster. There are other better options in the store."
"Toaster seems to work okay, but toaster was badly dented on arrival. Dent is on the back of toaster and not as noticeable when in place on the counter - otherwise would be returning it for a replacement"
"Cooks very unevenly, half of any bread, waffle, etc. comes out burnt and half not fully cooked. Aside from that, it's pretty and has standard options. Fix up the uneven cooking and it's a great value toaster."
Love the long opening for wide bread. Don’t love the uneven toasting  bagel only goes down 80% of the way and have to remember to rotate it  not sure if I’m going to keep it
I love the wider & very long slots that easily accommodate sour dough wide bread slices. I just wish it would toast evenly. It burns on the bottom while the top is half as toasted.
Cute little toaster but not efficient. The small cord and placement at the front of the toaster makes it hard for placement. The cord is really short. Product not used to determine use
"Product works great - design flaw is that there is only one up/down for both slots.  So if you want to toast 4 items at once it's what you want.  But if you start 2 items in one slot, there is no second up/down lever to start 2 more items in the 2nd slot.  Did not know this when purchasing so will be buying another with a up/down lever for each slot."
"I did some research on this toaster before ordering. Most folks like it. The videos I've seen show a different level of efficiency than the one I received. I'd guess that it's a matter of consistency of production. The one I received has a couple of problems. A few of the heating elements do not work - about half of the elements on the front slot rear side are out. It still works okay, but as it should. Also, the toaster will not toast darker english muffins, even at number 6 setting. Seems to be cooler overall than those I've seen in videos. I will keep it and use it, as it's adequate, but I am disappointed. Would not recommend."
"It works decent and looks decent. It does work very well! however the touch buttons are shoddy and might not be reliable in the long run but for the money its quite a nice looking machine!also i did not get my ""Yes it is a sexy toaster tag"" Tragic!! How could you Mueller. NOTE: Tag doesn't really come with the product of course."
"So, for a while this was great the front toast holder weakened on left side (I lost english muffins) Then when wiping with dishcloth the print started to wear off.  The spots corresponding to temperature and such wore off.  Will be keeping as a backup but need to get new one now."
"Bought this in 2022 and thought it was great. However, over time it functioned differently. When we first got it, a level 5 toasted perfectly. After a while we had to turn it down. Recently, we found we had to turn it back up because we had to toast things 2-3 times to get the shade we wanted. Really inconsistent over time, so this is a ""not recommended."""
"Its okay, a relatively cheap toaster, seems to toast fine,  but I question how long it will last"
"This toaster does not have a bagel setting, so it won't toast on one side ."
"Loved the design.  It only worked for 3 months, then one heating element worked."
"Essentially, I've found the toast time for this toaster on the average to low side and the only advantage I could find is the extra room (and yes I've tested the settings). It's not bad if you don't mind waiting a while."
I thought the One Slot option would be more useful but it isn’t The Toaster is longer but thinner and difficult to store due to its odd size. works fine for toasting.
"I like the size.  We got it for larger pieces of sourdough bread and it works for that.However, the browning is not consistent.  Sometimes the #3 setting is golden brown and sometimes it starts to burn.  So, we have to stand there and watch it.  It's the same with all of the settings.Would I recommend this toaster to a friend?  Maybe - but only after explaining about the inconsistencies."
"This is a nice, simple toaster with 1 long slot. It's very easy to use but I need to flip the bread over to toast top and bottom of the slice."
Uneven toasting
"I bought this toaster for two reasons, the slim line feature and the brand name. Regrettably there’s an issue with uneven toasting. One side toasted more than the other. I found that I had to flip sides to get an even toast. I had to return this toaster."
Even though setting is lowered the toast is always burnt around the edges.
"This toaster does not toast similarly on each side. Sometimes it doesn’t toast consistently on a single side of the bread with one end of the bread burnt and the other nicely browned.It’s a great size toaster and pretty, but doesn’t do its job very well."
"This toaster works, but it misses parts of the bread to toast. The metal is somewhat cheap and so is the handle.  We are keeping it, just because, but it's not all that. It's also a lot longer than what I expected."
"I like the design and how sleek this toaster is, but……im finding that im having to toast an object twice because the depth of the toaster does not toast the top part of the breads and bagels at all.  This is soooo frustrating.  Why wont this toaster toast an item completely.  Here in the USA, the cuts of the breads and bagels dont get toasted at the top at all.  Our breads here are no different from other countries.  Do you have a toaster that is deep enough to toast an entire piece of brad or bagel?"
"Nice looking toaster,  it takes a long time to toast anything compared to my last toaster. I prefer fast toast, so I have had to make it with a side of patience every morning."
Toasts fine. Buttons became a mystery within a few months.
Costly bulky with long slots but too skinny for English muffins.
It never toasts the entire item evenly.
You can't toast two slides of bread side by side ☹️
"I have only had this toaster for 1 1/2 months.  I should have sent it back immediately, but I thought I could figure it out.  Nope-not so far.  The first time I used the toaster my toast turned out way to light on setting 3.  It was way to light so I put it back down, and it was not great, but acceptable, so I kept playing the game.  Obviously 1 or 2 would be to light, so I tried 4. I ended up with partially burnt toast.This toaster has never had a piece of bread turn out evenly toasted.  The reason I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 is because at least part of the toast ends up edible, and my dog can eat the parts that I won't."
I have purchased this toaster twice. The first one burned the bread on the number one setting. I got another one today. It didn’t burn on the first setting but there is no way it would not burn the bread if I set it higher than a 1. I just love the looks of it because it is so sleek. If I can’t get used to how dark the toast can get then I will give up on it.
"Toast is very uneven. On setting 4, the center of the unit burns the bread while the outside edges are barely showing any color. Surprising for a Prime recommended item."
"I use a toaster for an English muffin almost every day, and our old toaster had the push-down lever break so I looked into 4 slice types with the long opening. The first one I tried seemed good but also seemed less effective at browning after just a few uses. So I returned that one, and tried this one.The first time I used it on my English muffin, I used Level 5, and it was barely brown on the fringes. The 2nd time I jacked it up to 6, the Max level, and it still was only slightly more browned. That was the last time I used it before sending it back. I felt bad as there was a message inside, apparently handwritten, that thanked me for the purchase and that Mueller was not a big brand along with other thoughtful statements...nice touch but if the toaster doesn't REALLY BROWN, then I don't want it."
"Well, it did look stylish but the design is poor. Takes up way too much counter space and logo is just front and center because.... essential control panel on the long end, not beneath the press handle as typical. As for the controls (and maybe my tiny fingertips are too fat), they only scroll up, not down (so you have to keep repeating to get to lower browning numbers).  Toasting started out decently, although again poor design, toaster accommodates 2 slices of smaller-sized breads, so tops of slice do not get toasted. It quickly declined from there and now only one side gets toasted even at max 6 setting, so one needs to re-toast the pale side.  My prior toaster died early Sunday morning, and this got delivered same day, used a coupon and gift card, so paid very little and that's...basically what it's worth...not much."
"edit;  Well, my wife stuck a piece of bread in it yesterday morning and it quickly came popped back up after making a crack sound with smoke coming out of the right side.  She instantly unplugged it and I will take it apart and see what happened, but pretty sure it cooked itself somehow.We like how it can sit up against the counter parallel with the wall and not stick out giving us more counter space.  The wife does say once in a while the toast will pop out and go behind the the toaster, but not a huge deal.It's not our 50's vintage Sunbeam that she just loved, but it's a good replacement since the Sunbeam finally conked out and the heating element broke."
Toaster pop up symbol worn off Not long after I received the toaster. Does it look right?
"Bought this about a year ago. Loved it. I love the form factor, the wide slots, ease of cleaning...everything. I found the perfect toaster!At first, setting ""3"" was perfect, and that is a good sign, right in the mid-range. After a while, 3 began to burn the toast (or nearly so), so I moved down to two. Cool, I guess. Now it is somewhere between 1 and 2. Sometimes 2 is too much...burnt edges (various different kinds of toast, toaster pastries, etc) but 1 is too raw. Not sure if mine is faulty or if they all ""move south"" in their usable range over time, but very disappointing that something I started out being so impressed with has slowly become barely usable in a year. If I had reviewed this a week after buying it (maybe I did?) I would've said 6 stars....bought ready to toss in garbage now. Would be cool if toasters came with a ""re-calibration"" knob to tweak."
"It doesn’t even hold 2 slices of bread, either not toasted or burns bread.  Very flimsy"
Disliked it heating both sides when only toasting 2 pieces of bread.
"Love the toaster, it toasts beautifully. It’s sexy, but mine had a few cosmetic flaws… yeah I’m very detail oriented. The quality of the end did not line up and there was some stainless cover film that had to be removed.  See pic. Didn’t line up."
At last I have a toaster that toasts everythingLove it
"Although the toaster was nice and easy to use, the tops of slices of bread, especially sourdough, did not toast. Also, the center only toasted on Wonder bread. I’m sorry this beautiful toaster did work for me. I had to return it."
"The toaster looks sleek and toasts 4 pieces but even with small bread slices the bottom is heavily toasted with the top of the slice still white. It doesn’t have even toasting,  a little disappointed tbh."
Seems sort of cheaply made
"I needed a new toaster after mine stopped working after several years. I saw this toaster and it looked nice and it had a 4 toaster slots and wide slots for bagels and Texas toast, plus, it was on sale. Needless to say “ it only toasted 1/2 the bread.” Ugh! I placed my bread in the toaster push down the lever and it had a very strong electrical smoke smell, which set off my smoke alarm, which my neighbors were not to happy about, since I was craving a BLT at 3:00 am. Haven't used it since."
Controls on the side
I wish the controls were on both sides. It doesn't fit where I normally but my toaster but that is my fault for not thinking about that before purchase. But I also don't like how the area you put your bread is one long slot rather than two but it may be helpful if I ever want to toast something long. I also think it makes the bread hard even on 1 or 2. Like dried out hard. Not just toasting the outside.
"I wanted to love this toaster because it does look nice and sleek! BUT, there's no option to toast the two sides separately (I didn't realize that- and it defeats the entire purpose for me), and the bread is all comingled in two big slots. It's weird and I really don't like it.The hearing is okay, my family doesn't like it but I find it to be alright. I just HATE that all four slices (often you can't fit four, though, so it's a normal two slice toaster) have to be toasted at once.I'm finally replacing this thing."
"It's an okay toaster, but has a tendency to toast unevenly, and sometimes burns half a piece of toast or a bagel on level 3 which shouldn't happen. Also, some bread or English muffins that have a bend or curl to them, often get caught and prevent the spring mechanism from electing your toast. The defrost mode works well, but it lacks a dedicated bagel mode that only toasts one side. I wish I had considered this prior to purchasing. I also found the cord to be too short, as it comes out of the front of the unit on the end where the controls are located. So when you pull the toaster towards the edge of your countertop to view the control panel, the cord becomes too short to reach the outlets on our backsplash. I feel like the cord needs to be 6""-9"" longer. For the price point I suppose it's a decent four slice toaster, but I wish I had spent about $20 more to get a better toaster with bagel mode. I would have rated higher, but  it's toast level inconsistency is annoying."
"Looks nice, love the lllooonnnggg slots, but doesn’t really toast evenly. Edges are burnt, middle of slice is just warmed over."
"Overall, I really like the design of this toaster. I've had it for a couple of years now and the problem seems to be getting worse: it toasts very unevenly. Depending on where you place the bread, one side is brown and the other side is not toasted at all, or half of the bread is not toasted. You can see what the problem is in the photos. Some of the elements are hidden behind the slots. I'm wondering if this is a bad design or if I got a defective one."
"Nice looking modern stainless toaster out of the box.Unfortunately for me, the toaster failed to deliver a consistent or acceptable toast.First I read and followed the manufacturers instructions to a tee.I did the first two time pre-heat burn per the manual.The first slice went in on the first #1 setting.It did a very, very light toast.O.K. On the 2nd slice test , I adjusted to the #2 setting.A little more light toasting occurred with the edges of the slice dark.3rd slice test, on the #3 setting, the slice of bread was too dark with almost burnt edges.Unfortunately this toaster failed with the preset factory toasting settings.I did not attempt a fourth slice on the #4 setting.The main issue I had is the top 1/4 of the sliced bread does not get toasted properly/fully.IMHO, It would benefit if the bread could be lowered in its slot more.I will be returning this toaster for a refund."
Will toast whatever you need toasted but does not toast bagels evenly top to bottom.
"Two complaints: Takes too long to toast.  An English muffin takes 3-1/2 minutes, and that's just slightly browned.  Heating elements do not appear to be strong enough to toast something in 1-1/2 minutes.  Cord is on the wrong side.  The down lever is in front (where it should be) and the electrical cord is in the front also.  The cord should be in the back of the toaster."
"Does not toast evenly, not even close....I've made al a lot of toast and I can't seem to find a setting that works...burns the bottom and almost white on top and I have found that higher than the 3 setting will burn a lot. I doubt that I will continue use of this toaster."
"I’ve had this toaster for a few months so now I can provide an experienced review.First- it’s attractive, BUT rather bulky for a “2” slice toaster. FYI- that it’s a “two slice” toaster will greatly depend on what kind of bread you buy. I generally use Pepperidge Farm and Arnold “farmhouse” or “country” breads which are about 5.5in in width. I would have to smoosh them together side by side to make them fit in the 10 inch slot- only to have them stick up over the heating elements. It’s a very shallow (height) space. The bottom has openings so that the crumb tray isn’t as effective as it should be. Also, there are lots of places for crumbs to stick into places that are difficult to clean. I am very very tidy, so I kept up on that but it’s really kind of annoying. Overall, the toaster is REALLY light, and while it’s nice looking, (albeit a bulky wall of an off color stainless steel) it is super cheap feeling because it’s so lightweight. It toasts ok, up to where the bread sticks out of that shallow slot. I think the price should be under $20.00. I have just replaced this toaster with another (more expensive) brand that adequately fits my bread. I’m glad I did! I hope this helps you make your decision! Happy toasting!"
"Ok, first off ... for those who are too trusting and think the name Mueller makes it a German made appliance  ... WRONG. Like so many things it's manufactured in the PRC ...CHINA. It is however VERY attractive, real stainless steel (not plastic) and works well for bread ... but hardly browns toward the top of standard bread slices. It is great for 2 slices at a time a larger artisan bread slices. But as far as English Muffins (my daily go-to) ... horrible! On #4 or 5 still spots that don't get browned but the edges burned first ... setting of my fire alarm. It did the same thing on a bagel. If you mostly want it for a variety of thin to thick breads ... for the price ... you will love it. If you are a big English Muffin and bagel person  ... get one with a bagel button/setting. Next!!!"
"I kept this toaster and I am not sure why.  Just one big slit in the top for 2 slices of bread.  No separation which is weird.  The construction seems subpar, just feels flimsy.  I guess for the price, you get what you pay for.  Should have returned."
Third times a charm?  Nope!! I’m on my 3rd toaster. Every setting on this toaster 1 through 6 makes uneven overdone toast. I like my bread lightly toasted and that just doesn’t happen. According to the customer service they claim this is  fine. To expect variation due to the breads HUMIDITY!?!?!  What the heck?!?  Ive given this toaster 3 attempts and im still disappointed here.  All I want is a good looking decent toaster that works!!!!!  I guess a call to customer service is happening yet again.
"10-week update:Now toasts unevenly, with the middle much darker than the sides. Also, the settings bring inconsistent results. Sometimes ""3"" does the job, other times you have to use ""4"" - for example. Seems to be more trial and error for something that should be a simple thing and ends up taking more time than it should.Original review:Would be a 5-start if it had a bagel toasting option."
There is no bagel setting....why? Burns the bagel tops.
Stopped working in 10 months after purchase. Would have expected it to last longer - at least a few years - with our light usage.From a design standpoint there should be a way to turn off one slot when toasting a single slide oc bread.
"I have bought other products from Mueller that I have been very happy with.  This isn't one of them.  The bread slots are too small in height so the top of the piece does not get toasted.  There is no bagel alternative so bagels get toasted on both sides.  I thought the linear design would be neat, but actually, it just takes up alot of room.  I tried to love it...I don't."
"Its design and overall features are good, but unless you're always toasting 4 slices at a time, and want them to come out rather dark (or severely burned), this toaster fails at its core function: to make toast that is enjoyable. After performing the initial burn-off in my garage (which is absolutely necessary to get the manufacturing residue off the elements), I set the toaster to setting '3' and put a single slice in. Before the timer was even at 1/2 way through its countdown, the toast was smoking and came out as charcoal. I put in another slice, set the toaster to '1' and let it go to the end of the cycle. That single slice came out as dark as I'd expect it to at the highest setting. After doing some more research into this style of toaster, I learned that these extra long two slot 4 slice toasters are basically useless for single slices of toast and this behavior is expected (it makes sense... the empty slot is running at full power and causes the slot with the bread it it to get way too hot and uneven). The recommendation I saw was to toast 2 slices at minimum, and to make sure one is in each slot and centered. Trying this, the results were improved. However even at setting '1' with two slices, both came out extremely dark (level 6, according to the product pictures), had slightly burned edges and were uneven from top to bottom. Finally, I tried 4 slices at setting '1' and they came out a little bit lighter but still very dark (what I'd expect at a setting of 4 or 5, according to the product pictures). In short, any setting above 1-2 on this toaster will simply result in charcoal and lots of smoke.Because I'm a bit of a nerd, I wanted to confirm that my outlet wasn't supplying too much voltage or that the unit wasn't consuming too much wattage, so I checked and both are within spec. My outlet is delivering ~122v and the toaster would jump between ~1340w -~1470w consumed (it is advertised as 1500w, so that is within the stated spec.).I like the overall design and features of the toaster, but given that I like lighter toast, and about half the time only toast 1-2 slices, this unit simply won't work for me and I've returned it."
"I have only had this item for a short time but I like the way it fits into the space I created for it. I think for the price the item pop up, quality, items stability, buttons and material is just OK."
"This toaster looks nice but feels light & flimsy. When you push the slider down, it often doesn’t catch and takes 2 or 3 attempts before it stays down to toast. No matter the heat setting, the bottom of the slice is blackened before the rest has browned leaving the kitchen smelling of burnt toast. I also failed to notice it only has 1 handle to put all 4 slices down at once.  Might be a personal preference, but I’d like 2 handles with the ability to select 2 different heat settings. I wish I’d spent the extra money to buy better quality!"
"While this product looks good on the counter, I am very disappointed with the performance. It provides 6 temperature settings and I have now used 3 of them on 5 occasions. With each use, one half of the bread is darkly toasted while the other half is lightly toasted. So disappointing. Even when set on 1 (the lowest temperature) one half of the bread is darkly toasted and I am seeking a lightly, and evenly toasted, slice. While it has a 4 and a half star rating with over 8,000 reviews,  I do plan to return it because it does not perform well."
"The appearance and the directions for use are fine. The toaster is to light and interfers with the digital operation. We need to hold the toaster on one end to avoid slipping. It's Annoying. However, it operates as it should."
"Until this toaster arrived, I didn't realize how hard to read the settings are on this toaster. They are are on the side, kind of confusing, and not reachable if there is something next to the toaster on the counter. You have to pull the toaster out to look on the side of it... We tried once, and weren't impressed with the evenness of the toast either..."
"Handles 4 slices. Controls too easily adjusted by accident when moving unit on the counter. Simply failed to work almost a year to the date of purchase, without any issues prior."
"This toaster didn't toast the bread very dark even on the the highest setting.  Nothing like the pictures.  I even tried the defrost setting combined with the max setting, and it was toasted but not dark.  It also didn't toast the bread all the way to the top, as there was an untoasted section at the top of the bread.  I'm returning it."
"When this was new it worked great, excelent control over toast level, and great features, but not long after setting it up, the far left element stopped working completely, leaving toast made in the left slot only toasted on one side.We continue to use it in the right slot only as a 2 slice toaster, but dissapointing that it failed so quickly."
"I bought this toaster in January of 2023. It lasted me up until a week ago when it started smelling horrible. Like melting plastic. I tried to contact the seller through Amazon but didn't hear back. After a lot of research with no better options, I bought it again with a coupon and a warranty this time. Kinda disappointed it didn't last long the first go, but at least this one has a 3 year warranty. The eject button has pretty much worn off in the last 15 months."
"Strange that it claims to be extra wide, which is hardly the case. Anything other than 2 small/regular slices must be toasted one at a time."
I have had this toaster for a few months and one side already feels like it is not toasting as well as it should and the button markings have already come off from regular use. Also the cord comes out of the front where the buttons are? Which makes it really hard to plug in. Do not recommend this toaster.
"The toaster was great while it worked.  Purchased on 30May2023, died on 05Jun2024.  It was a very toasty year!  And, now, it's over.  I'm not sure how long a toaster should last, but I thought it would be longer than a year.  The categories of Easy to Use, Easy to Clean, and Temperature Control - I gave 5 stars.  If there was a category for Long-Lasting - I would have given that 1 star.  Overall, 3 stars!"
"Pros: Very sharp looking. The wide, long slots solves accommodating large Sour Dough and Italian sliced bread. That's a huge plus for me. Nice and light weight. Easy controls and the digital setting is remembered once set. Cons: Stainless steel shows your hand prints. Toasts well, but I am already on maximum setting; 6. The chord winding slots underneath don't work well and no user is going to upend their toaster to wind the chord. Better to have placed it at the back."
"This is the third time I’ve bought this toaster because I really love the design—I gifted two of them, and finally decided to get one for myself after my old toaster’s lever broke. However, I didn’t expect the lever on this one to break so easily! It stopped working in less than a month. Although I could get a refund, I’m now worried about what people think of me since their gifts may have broken too. If you buy this toaster, just be very gentle with the lever."
"This appears to be a great toaster. My complaint is in the way Amazon ships it. It was shipped in the retail packaging only. When i received it, there was a big hole in the packaging. When i opened it for inspection, of course it was dented. I will keep it because its not worth the time to return it and wait for a replacement. please take note Amazon, this item needs an outer carton for shipping."
"I love the extended length slots. However, I also like my toast a little darker, and this toaster only toasts light-medium on the highest setting. I still have to cycle my bread twice, which is why I was buying a new toaster in the first place. I'm disappointed over all. I'd send it back, but it is way too much effort to pack it all up and take it to UPS for a return."
"This is the third toaster I’ve purchased, and the first one that toasts both sides of the slice of bread. It toasts evenly on each side and doesn’t take a long time. Also, the slimmer profile doesn’t take up much room on my counter."
"I like the design, but it’s not working for us as a toaster as it is uneven in the toasting so that the ends seem to be burning. We particularly bought it for longer shaped bread. Notice how it seems to be hotter on the ends even when I pull the bread to one end of the toaster and then the middle of the bread is not as well toasted notice the white off center that is not as toasted"
"UPDATE: I can't give the toaster any more stars because of this, but after my initial review, Mueller customer support contacted me with apologies and offered to fully refund my purchase price. I did not expect to hear from anyone, so that was a really nice suprise. They were so kind, in fact, that I will shop for my next toaster from Mueller first. Customer support gets five stars!!I should send this thing back, but I’ll suffer with it until I have punished myself enough for not thoroughly absorbing the description and reading reviews.1. No bagel setting. It just toasts the same on both sides.2. The top inch or so of everything you put in this machine does not get any color, as it doesn’t go down into the toaster far enough.3. Their picture guide shows what level of toastiness your bread will come out based on what number you choose. When I put mine on number four, the toast looks like picture number one or two instead.4. You cannot manually pop up the lever. You have to use one of the buttons on the side. I think people can get used to that but it’s just an additional frustration.5. There is no extra give at the top of the lever, if you know what I mean, my last toaster would pop up, but then you couldn’t actually push the lever up a little bit more to reach something.I think five things are enough to complain about. I have justified the two star rating I am giving this product. I thought that the brand name would ensure a good product, but this is pretty janky.  On the most basic level of what this proud supposed to do well (toast), it fails.Oh, there is a little advertisement inside the box that says you can choose to either get a free milk frother or some kind of microfiber cleaning cloth. Like many other reviews I have read, I have not received my free item. Thumbs down people, way down. Just continue your search for a good toaster. This is not it."
"Very good looking toaster was the reason I bought this item.Unfortunately, it’s the worst toaster I have ever owned. Uneven and inconsistent toasting are the most frustrating issues with this device. This morning it launched my single slice of bread onto the kitchen floor.The single long slot doesn’t fit two slices, unless you overlap them.If you’re interested in buying this item, it will be available at my local thrift store down the street.Thanks for listening."
Honestly I was attracted to this one for the fact that it was made in Austria & I’m partial to the country- it also had long slots which accommodates my choice in bread. My expectation was great but my disappointment greater. This results in the most uneven toasting! I am now looking for a replacement. The quality and look are good but functionality is below par. Off to thrift store once I get a new one. Darn.
Hard to get to toast evenly. Love the design and the large opening!
"I loved this toaster’s sleek design with the front controls, the long slots that descend deep enough for artisan bread, and the wide enough slot to accommodate thick slices like bagels.I extremely dislike that it just suddenly stopped toasting after 1.5 years of gentle use. It now barely gets warm as if it’s eternally stuck in defrost mode."
Feels flimsy. I like the extra log slots
"This product arrived damaged, so I only used it once. I'm pretty serious about my toast - and my impression was that it toasted the outside but the toast wasn't heated through and then the toast was ejected clear out of the toaster and onto the counter."
"Cute product with a long grill area which is great if your toasting rye or other elongated bread. It does not toast a typical processed loaf of bread fully. If you toast regular loaf of bread it leaves the top and bottom portion untoasted. Alright, but not worth the hype or the additional effort to return it."
I'm a person who loves light to medium toast.  Calibrating the right setting is the challenge. I set it on 2 and just about burned it.  I turned it down to 1 and a half and it wasn't brown at all.  Still working on it.
"Bread toasted nicely, but could only hold 1 piece at a time.  You would have to use bread that isn't very wide to fit two pieces in at once."
"I like the look and simplicity of this toaster, great slim storage. Each time I've used it so far though, it has a strong burning plastic smell which is a bit alarming"
"I bought this for two reasons: 1) I have limited counter space and was drawn to the slim design, and 2) I typically toast one slice of sourdough bread with breakfast, so the one large slot seemed perfect … however, it seems the toaster is meant for two small slices of bread as it does not toast in the center. My sourdough slice toasts fine on out outside edges, but stays completely un-toasted in the middle. Frustrating."
"Regulating the toasting time, the outside edges right and left burn especially the left, the right only slightly, but burned where it's necessary to scrape it."
"What I liked about this toaster;1. space saving2. Modern smooth lines. This toaster looks great.That's all this toaster has going for it.What I dislike about this toaster;1. The smell when you first use it. The instructions tell you to Operate the toaster without bread for the first use to dissipate residual manufacturing oil. If you are sensitive to burning plastic smells you may wish to do this outdoors. I had to operate the toaster four times before the smell went away and I am NOT sensitive to smells.2. Two pieces of whole wheat bread do not fit in this toaster. They over lap by a half inch, since whole wheat bread if a bit wider than regular white bread. If you want to toast whole wheat, sour dough, or rye bread you will have to do so one slice at a time. Very disappointing that my brand new two slice toaster won't hold two slices.3. Bread comes out poorly toasted. I made several pieces of toast, ( one slice at a time, since that was all this crappie toaster can hold) each time the toast came out with light and dark vertical bands, toast was darker at the top and lighter at the bottom, and the edges were charred black. Your toast will end up simultaneously under done and burnt.I would not recommend this toaster."
The toaster works fine so far but it arrived broken at the bottom and one of the legs was broken. Apparently the previous comments about the quality of the product being broken are true.
"I am so tired of getting defective or low quality stuff and this is no exception.  I was just going to put the toaster away when I got it to use another time.  Good thing I didn't.  Upon getting ready to use it, I found that the toast holders weren't right.  One was in the slot, the other isn't.  If you press the control down, the holder that's not in it's slot comes together and the other one stays open.  Great.  A couple other things I noticed, that I would have ignored had it not been defective, are the finish, which is matt plastic in oat milk.  It looks dingy and seems like it will stain easily.  The second thing is the warning in large bold print:  ""PLASTICIZER WARNING  CAUTION:  To prevent Plasticizers from migrating to the finish of the counter top or table top or other furniture place NON-PLASTIC coasters of placemats between the appliance and finish of the counter or table.  Failure to do so may cause the finish to darken, permanent blemishes may occur or stains can appear.""  So, it appears they already know there's an issue and they're too cheap to use something else.  Another interesting instruction from them is you're supposed to store it in it's box.  Doesn't that kind of defeat the ""slim easy to store"" claim and also make it less convenient to access.  They don't show that in their videos, so why do they include that in their instructions?  Maybe because the material is so cheap or fragile, it needs protection?  All I want is a toaster that toasts.  Years ago I had one and it lasted for many, many years.  Now I can't even fine one that works, let alone lasts."
"I wanted to love this toaster, love the slim line and long slot as I like long bread slices, but within a week it started to burn the toast absolutely black at one end while it was barely brown anywhere else.  I started a return, they sent me another one, which was very nice and why this is 2 stars instead of one, but the second toaster does the exact same thing-- same burning, same place. It seems like this is just a flaw in the design/manufacturing; one time could be an accident, twice is an ongoing issue they're just not bothering to fix. Do I try again and add a third crappy toaster to the landfill?"
I was excited when I found this-love the design and color-but I need two run the cycle 4 times to get a piece of bread toasted to a nice shade of brown and the bread gets dried out as a result. I bought this old fashioned toaster because my bread got dried out when I toasted it in my Ninji Airfrier.
"I love the slim size of this toaster since I have a small kitchen. The blue color is so pretty. It toasted bread evenly for about 2 weeks, and now....toasts all around the edges. What a waste of money, and it's too late to return it. What is it about toasters that they cannot be made to simply toast a piece of bread evenly? It's ridiculous."
"I hate this toaster! There I said it. The only things I like about it is the long space saving shape and the color. I cant fit a bagel in it and two pieces of toast do not fit side by side. I have to jam the bagel and toast in there. Even with just toast, i’m burning the tips of my fingers prying it out. I repurchased my old toaster that’s how much I hate this."
Bought this based on the high reviews but I was a bit surprised when I got it. The exterior is a flimsy plastic. Bread does not toast evenly (the edges burn and the middle is just white) and there's no popper to take it out when you're ready for it sooner. Would not buy again.
The toasting is uneven. I placed one slice of bread on the side closest to the dial. Set on 5.5 out of 6. This is what I got
"Arrived with the top edges warped away from the metal. After running for the 1st three cycles to burn off the nasty smelling burned plastic smell (fans going and all doors and windows open) I saw the top part was bowed out even more. I was able to press it back in a bit but it still bothered me.I tried to make toast, number 4 setting still wasn't very toasted so I tried setting number 5, which unfortunately burned the top. Tried it at 4.5, not very toasted. 4 and 3/4....better toast with top of toast edge burned. Then I looked at the picture on the box,...haha the toast on the box was burned too! Sending back and looking for a better brand."
Toaster looks ok but product was damaged on transportation so packaging and/or product too fragile.
"It does the job, but I won’t keep it long as it’s a bit flimsy."
"We loved this light and compact toaster until the first time we used it.  Bagels are our #1 toasting product, and it has no bagel setting.  Before we could get the top browned enough, the bottom was burnt.  If you're like us, it might not fit your needs.  We're returning it for this one reason."
Like another post on here when I plugged in the toaster for the first time there was a spark and and then a bang followed by smoke and melted plastic. Product was dead. It seemed like the thermostat did not cycle off and kept getting hotter and hotter on setting 3 of 6.
"I purchased this toaster, because I had seen so many positive reviews; however, when I got mine the mechism that lowers the bread inside was already broken, never used it, and had to get a refund on it.  The product seems to have poor quality control, and inferior materials used to make this toaster."
"Edges of the toaster on top are metal, when trying to grab toast you will burn yourself.Slim design is nice but wider toast 2 will not fit.  Children should not use, even Adultseasy to get burned."
"Believe the reviews about it smelling GOD AWFUL like burning plastic. I did one ""test run"" & it was so bad I had to remove it from my house. It looks awesome but is cheaply made and clearly a hazard. Returning it today."
"Toasting 2 bread slices turned deadly when I went to grab the toastert left hand touched the red hot toaster. I'm still soaking my hand in cold water, feeling horrible pain. Idk if I'm permanently damaged."
The insides were bent. When I put English muffins in they burned on the inside. Smoke started coming out before I realized. Tried again and I had to push the bread down after I pushed the lever down then had to pull the bread out when lever came up. Toaster had a horrible smell like burning plastic.
This toaster sparked a flame and there was a bang from it when I first used it . Then it just went dead. Very dangerous and it was my sockets as I have had other thing plugged into it. I told Amazon and they seemed unphased bu it. Definitely a fire hazard . DO NOT BUY
"Returned, received $21 refund despite the cost of $71.  I rarely return items purchased from Amazon.  Why such a horrible return policy on this crappy toaster?"
"Thought I really liked it at first, but it burns everything and it’s poorly constructed. No wonder it was 20 bucks.  Guess you get what you pay for."
"It may look nice on the outside, but I caution everybody who wants to buy this product.The second I turned it on to test it out, it started smelling like burnt plastic very strongly. I Immediately pressed the cancel button. I had to open all of my windows and turn on a fan on full blast to get the smell out of my apartment."
Is she gorgeous? Yes. Can she toast? No. I am actually surprised at how bad this toaster is at being a toaster. It toasts very unevenly and the plastic exterior is warping away from the sides. I’ve only used it a few times and I’m not confident that it won’t melt.
The spring holding it in toasting position stopped working in a month of very light use.  Waste of money
Broken foot. Won’t stand up. Package damaged upon arrival. No packaging at all. Cheap. Returning.
My toaster was cracked when it arrived. The package looked like it had been dropped.
After first use it won't keep the bread down. I have to hold.
This product doesn't work at all!!!!! Terrible! We need to press the button down a million times until it works. Ridiculous
As soon as I turned this on it smelled like burnt plastic. I will be returning this.
Had to return it because it was broken.
the product isn't wide enough to handle 2 slices of bread
Received this broken.
Bread don't fitWant to return
Actual toaster and one shown online are different from toaster shown in instruction booklet.
The handle wouldn’t stay down to toast the bread.
"I was all but ready to put this in and donate our old side by side toaster, until my husband pointed out that you can't fit two slices of the wider loaves of bread in at the same time. This is okay for something like toasting long slices of baguette, but it's a miss for me."
I had very high hopes for this sleek designed toaster but turned out to be a big disappointment. This toaster is good for bread slices that are very small in size (toasting a bagel is out of the question) Any multigrain bread that you get nowadays has bigger toast slice sizes. Even when toasting a single slice there was uneven toasting so this one is very flawed in my opinion.I will be getting a better brand and do not recommend this.
"I've owned this toaster for about 1.5 years. It is absolutely the slowest toaster I have ever owned. It also ""mostly"" toasts one side but not the other. I say mostly because sometimes it toasts both sides but not usually. Recently, the toasting has gotten really unreliable. My usual setting of 4 is now burning the toast. I turned it down to 3 and it didn't toast at all. 3 stars only because it is sturdy and nice looking. Why is it so hard to find a decent toaster? My last one, a cheap Proctor Silex, lasted almost 25 years."
"The toaster power cord was touching the backside of a toaster oven much of the time since I purchased it in early November 2024 before the cord insulation melted enough to expose the wire and short with an exciting flash. As far as toasting bread, it does a decent job but the size of the openings does not accommodate larger-sized loafs of bread (e.g., round). I am using a higher setting on this toaster than others I have used in the past to get the same degree of toast."
"I love the look of this toaster. The one thing I don’t like and is an important issue for me is the levels of browning from 1-7. I  am toasting frozen gluten free bread most of the time.I like my toast a little dark but, even if I put it on 7 and press the frozen button it is just starting to get brown ."
"Every few years, we have to purchase a new toaster, and every few years, we hope they have been manufactured better than they used to be.  Well, this is a toaster, and it toasts...sort of.  It toasts as well as our previous toasters, and it toasts as well as our parents toasters.  That means that some parts of the bread turn out very dark, while other parts turn out....let's call it untoasted.  It also means that one slice turns out dark, and the other not so much.So...we are waiting for another couple of years with the hope that our next toaster will have progressed out of the early 1900's.  Still...I'm sure this one is every bit as good as the dozens of others we studied very closely but didn't buy.Good luck to you!"
"We were originally quite pleased with the GE Stainless Steel Toaster | 4 Slice.  It preformed well for morning toast on nearly a daily basis, and did deliver very evenly toasted sides.  Some time about 6 months after purchasing the toaster, we noticed that two of the heating elements weren't heating as evenly. What this meant is that we would have to raise each bread slice, reverse bread direction, then re-start the toasting process again.  It was becoming quite inconvenient to do after a period of time.  Finally one of the heating elements failed and in less than one year, we have to purchase a new toaster.  It's a shame because we really liked this GE toaster, but will have to re-think purchasing another.  KZ"
"Toasting of bread is uneven. Constantly have to adjust between dark setting, each cycle gets lighter and lighter with each successive use in a row until cools down. not what i want in a toaster."
"This toaster is soooo light that when you push down the toast lever, it tips over if you don't hold it with your other hand.  Also the holes aren't long enough to fit most bread slices.  I think they're wide enough for bagels but I haven't tried bagels yet."
"I love the look of the toaster but its performance isn’t great. I’ve owned this for four years and need to have it on the longest setting just to thaw ego waffles (not even toast them), even with the “frozen” button pushed. Kinda sad. My last toaster lasted 20 years but didn’t survive the trip when I moved so I had to replace it. Wish I remembered what model that was."
crumbs all over countertop and needs to be on number 6:5 to toast well some breads
My older toaster is 3 times as heavy. This toaster feels cheaply made. I guess this is shrinkflation. I haven't used it yet so I don't know how well it works. Hesistant to send it back but not sure if all toasters are doing this now.
"Uneven toasting ,one side of bread dark , other side  light . Strong chemical smell when first used., disappeared quickly . Nice looking , button lights up blue when selected. Disappointed in the uneven toasting , Amazon basic for half the price would have been just as good ."
"The toaster is lightweight and good looking and coordinates well with all of our other appliances. The only beef is that it takes a little too much time to toast - I suspect that it is underpowered. I was always happy with GE products but once Haier has taken over, I cannot always rely on the quality anymore."
"I've owned this toaster for a rew months now.  It does what it's supposed to do - toast bread - but slowly, inconsistently, and regarding english muffins, barely.  Even on the highest setting, English muffins are unevenly and barely toasted.  It'll do, and I'm glad I didn't pay an exorbitant price for it."
Center columns of heating elements do not heat up at all on two sides. One side of each slice of toast browns while the other does not toast evenly at all.
"Let me start by saying that I'm not going to tell you how this toaster looks in my kitchen - like so many other reviewers.  Personally it could look like it was designed by a class of kindergarteners, as long as it did it's job.  I want to put in a couple slices of bread, start it and come back to find two pieces of EVENLY toasted bread.  We had a toaster for years that faithfully did than until it died of natural causes.This GE toaster, like several others I've tried fails to accomplish this rudimentary task.  Bread comes out properly toasted on one side and barely toasted on the other (see photos).  I'm old enough (geezer) to remember when we landed men on the moon.  If we can accomplish this scientific and engineering feat then why can's someone build a toaster that EVENLY toasts bread!?Heck, I'll even reveal the secret to a proper working toaster. It's the heating elements.  Some bow out from the backing plate and generate more heat than their neighboring ones that lay flat against the plate.  So.... If they all bowed out OR all laid flat the heating would be uniform.  Take a look at the third photo.  See how the middle row of elements lay flat, and aren't glowing as brightly.  That's the issue.To add insult to injury, there are additional ""Bagel"" and ""Frozen"" buttons.  What do these do?  Nothing as far as I could tell.  A bagel setting should turn on only the outer - or inner - elements so only the face of the bagel gets toasted.  On this GE model it functions the same whether you set to bagel, frozen or leave it to it's default toast setting.So I'm sending it back for a refund.  But truthfully, I don't know if I'll ever find a toaster that does what it's supposed to do.  Toast bread evenly."
Does not heat evenly and takes forever to toast something
"To start with, I returned this toaster.  We just couldn't get it to brown evenly, consistantly, or sometimes at all.  The first muffin I put in to toast set 4.5 didn't toast at all.  I had to try again and then pop it out because it was going to get too brown.  I decided to try regular white bread.  The first piece I put in on 4.5 got nicely toasted on one side but when I turned it over, it was burnt on the other side.  Over three days we tried different settings and types of bread and we could never get the toaster to toast evenly on both sides or even toast at all.  The second problem with the toaster is that the toast would not pop up out of the toaster.  To be able to grab it at all, you had to manually push up the release button.  We were not impressed."
"Bought this to replace about a 15-20 yr old GE toaster that was Walmart branded. The lever has been getting difficult to push down so I decided to replace it. It has been a great toaster.This toaster, not so great. Took a couple tries to figure out that after the lever is pushed down you have to push the bread down into the toaster (don't burn your finger or use a metal utensil). There are two ""clamps?"" that clamp onto the bread, which I assume is to hold it upright. Problem is that it clamps down on the bread before it is all the way inside the toaster and the top of the bread is lightly toasted and the bottom is pretty dark, burnt for my taste.Once I figured out I needed to push the bread into the toaster after starting it I found it doesn't toast evenly on each side. The side of the bread facing the center of the toaster is dark/burnt and the side of the bread facing the outside of the toaster is light and about right for my taste. Setting was at 3.5.I opted for this toaster because of my experience with my other GE toaster and it is built pretty solid compared to the $15 ones in store. This one was definitley not worth the $50 I paid and I will probably end up throwing it out since I have used it and threw the box away."
"We have had this for about 6 months. Love the look and function, no issues there. Toasts evenly, and takes the largest bagels you can buy.  But it’s a crumb monster. The crumb collection plate is inadequate, so crumbs spill out the bottom continuously.  Now I’m looking for a tray to go underneath it.  I won’t say stay away, because it’s a good toaster.  But beware the crumbs!"
"First thing noticed was the chemical odor.  Washed it immediately, better, but still noticeable.  Afraid of what the interior odors would emit to my toast, we turned it on several times before putting bread in. Stunk - had to turn fan on.  Better now, but toasts unevenly with thin bread, more toasted on bottom than on top.  Regular bread toasts fine.Very light weight.  Slider lever was crooked.This is a low quality product."
"The toaster itself looks amazing in my kitchen, but the toasting is pretty inconsistent. One side will be golden brown with the other being barely browned"
"I was looking for a good basic toaster and America’s Test Kitchen recommend this one. It worked fine for six months - then started toasting unevenly. Think only the top half toasting, or one side toasting a golden brown and the other side was burnt. At eight months pieces started falling out of it and it stopped working completely."
"Even on the highest settings, the bread gets warm but doesn't toast very much.  You have to run it for a second cycle and reduce the time so it doesn't burn. Annoying, and a fail, in my opinion. Good thing it was cheap, but I'm buying a Breville that worked flawlessly for 8 years."
"Given generally positive reviews, I was very disappointed with this toaster. Maybe I got a bad one. The two sides in regular toast was very uneven. When I tried the bagel option that is supposed to reduce heat on one side, both sides very overdone. I ended up getting a Hamilton Beach and so far it is working great."
Am I the only one who likes their toast golden brown? You have to have the toaster on the second from maximum level to get golden brown toast. Levels one through six leave the toast very pale. Looks nice though.
I purchased this toaster with the hope that it would toast evenly.  Not the case. One side barely feels toasted.
This toaster worked fine for four monthsThen the plunger that causes the toast to go into the toaster stayed down. So I pushed the cancel button which now will not un-pushSo now the plunger won’t stay down and I have to hold it down manually to toast the bread
Very nice appealing toaster.
"I am disappointed with toasting of a frozen item.  Being single, I have to freeze bread and other items because I cannot eat them fast enough before they spoil.  Although the toaster has a “frozen” button the toaster only toasts on one side.  Also the toaster is rather large for a two slice.  Consider other brands is my recommendation."
"4 month review: For a toaster that costs as much as this one does, you would think all the functions would work. As others have said, pressing the bagel button makes no difference whatsoever. It does NOTHING.It has a weird smell. I expected it the first time we used it so I ran both sides on high with nothing in it to burn off the smell, but four month later with daily use, it still smells when you first turn it on."
"Last time I bought a toaster I paid a bit more and felt like it was a bit nicer than a standard cheapy.  That one died, and I tried the same approach this time, but for the life of me I can't tell why this is twice the price of dozens of other toasters. It feels cheap, doesn't toast evenly on both sides, I need to turn it nearly all the way up to get the same toast I had before at one o'clock on the dial on the old one.  It's not bad exactly, but it should cost $20. Return."
We liked this toaster.  We liked the bagel versus bread toasting.  It lasted 16 months before the handle wouldn't stay down.  We ordered a different toaster.  If they are going to last a year or so might as well get a cheaper one.
"I researched the toasts that were made in the USA thinking that the GE brand said they were...but when the box arrived it said ""Made in China""Disappointed that I wasn't supporting a USA Made company"
"Took a while to determine the right toasting setting. Never really had that issue before. Also, the bagel setting still toasts both sides, so useless, and I haven't noticed any difference in how things cook when using the frozen setting. Could have saved myself some money getting a model without these options."
"…for price, it’s cheaply made, is not fingerprint proof, and does not come with crumb trays as advertised. I’ll be returning or donating and going with another option. I’d advise the same."
"I went with this toaster because of the GE brand name, and was willing to pay more than I would for a standard toaster, expecting a higher quality item.Unfortunately, this toaster is quite lightweight and flimsy, and is not very impressive. While it has the same basic functions as toasters far cheaper, it doesn’t have enough going for it to justify its cost.I would not recommend this as the go-to everyday toaster for a modern kitchen."
"I bought this GE toaster on 12/4/23.  It toasted well.  A few days ago, I had my hand on the sink when I depressed the on lever to toast a bagel, I felt a sting.  I then pushed the bagel button and got shocked again.  I am an engineer.  I got my electric multi-meter and started testing the toaster.  I put black lead on the sink then touched the red lead on the stainless steel out case.  With toaster off, the meter showed a 6.5volt AC potential leak from the outer case to the grounded sink.  Then I turned the toaster on, the voltage jumped up to 16.4 volts AC and continued rise up to 19.5 volts before I pulled the plug out.  I took the toaster to other electric sockets repeated the test with the same results.  For the final test, I took the toaster to a Ground Fault socket in my bathroom repeated the test.  I turned on the toaster, this tripped the circuit breaker on socket.  I called GE's customer support, gave my and all of contact info and explained my issue.  The support agent asked me for the model and serial number.  I found the model# on the bottom of the toaster base but couldn't find a serial number label.  The agent told me there was nothing she could without a SN.  The line was disconnected.  I expected to get a call back.  I waited for ten minutes, then called GE back.  An automated voice stated that my wait time exceeds 45 minutes.  Horrible GE support.  This toaster is a DANGER!!  I returned it to Amazon for a refund and bought a Cuisinart toaster."
"Pros = Low price, ease of operation, wide slots handle regular size grocery store sliced bagels.Cons = poor heating element, uneven toasting of both sides of bread."
Although it has a bagel button that lights up it toast both sides We eat more bagels and muffins then we do anything else and that is one of the reasons we bought this we have contacted customer service but yet to be rectified
"Bought this toaster in April (try to find one with decent reviews!) and it never really met our expectations for a company that has made appliances for years!If you pop the toast up and it’s not quite done, it will burn it the next time.Very inconsistent and frankly I don’t trust it. It has set off the smoke detector more than once.Are there any good products out there anymore?"
"I have the same looking model that I bought years ago. It's a heavy, well made workhorse! So I ordered this newer model for my son, and though it works well so far, the exterior is very shiny and hard to keep clean, it's lightweight and the materials are cheap. The clean out is also not in the front. I would not buy this again!"
"The toaster is nice looking and probably why I bought it. But it takes forever to toast a slice of bread, and the setting has to be all the way up for it to be even slightly brown. I just don’t think the heating elements get very hot. I would return it but I bought it in July and I don’t eat toast very often."
"This toaster is not made of metal it’s all plastic. It is not the quality I expected from a GE product. As other reviewers have mentioned the Crumb trays are not effective. If you move the toaster at all, crumbs are all over the counter. Overall, not worth the money and I would have been better with an unknown brand at lower cost."
"The one massive downer for me was finding out that this toaster from GE -- a company once synonymous with American Exceptionalism -- was made in China. If I can help it, I refuse to give money to The People's Republic. It's not worth the trouble of returning it, but GE can do better. I am sure Jack Welch agrees with me."
"Takes way to long to toast anything. It takes a good minute or more to toast anything and I simply do not have the patience for that. Also, it only lasted 2 years. We bought it May 22, 2022 and it kicked the bucket May 18th 2024. Not impressed."
"Feels super sturdy and high quality, looks the part as well. Unfortunately the actual toasting isn’t great. The bottom half of the bread toasts significantly more than the top, resulting in very uneven toast."
Nice style but does not evenly toast both sides. Paid a little more for a name brand toaster and I’m disappointed.
I really don’t like this toaster- it does not brown. Have it set in highest and it still doesn’t brown unless I send it again and manually monitor it. Will be getting a different brand.
"This was the third toaster we purchased in the past 6 months and not one of them can toast evenly.  Every single slice is darker on one side than the other.  I can't believe that in this age of technology,  overseas manufacturers cannot master the simple task of toasting bread evenly."
Works great as a toaster as well as a fingerprint magnet. Suggest leaving it in a single location if that sort of thing bothers you.
"Given the GE name and the price,  at a bare minimum I expected this to be able to toast both sides equally.  No such luck.  Definitely expected better quality for this one.  One side is perfectly toasted, and the other has no color at all.  To toast the other side,  it requires the first side get burnt.  Not a fan."
"The toast gets a little darker on one side than the other and there is no way to clean the bottom of the toaster out. The bottom doesn't open. Next time I buy one, that's something I'll look for. It's a nice looking toaster."
This toaster is works but has a few caveats.1) Toasts slow2) Not very hot. English Muffins don't toast well. Way too lightBread seems to work fine.
I bought this toaster when my Amazon toaster started dying at 2 years old. This one won’t even make it that long. Takes forever to toast a bagel or English muffin. Toasts bread unevenly. Not worth the money . I was hoping for better from GE.
"If you like one side of your bread toasted and the other side just hot bread, then this is the toaster for you!  Indecisive - no problem, with this toaster you can have burnt on one side and lightly (and I mean super lightly) toasted on the other. Enjoy both at once guaranteed at every use!  :)"
"Another toaster with a non functioning bagel setting, it toast both sides of a bagel.If its not white bread, which takes very short times to toast, is very uneven and slow.When the coils that do the toasting are viewed, there glow is very uneven. This translates into longer toasting times ie. will create very uneven toastingIf I was an appliance  designer, I would design the crumb tray as wide if not wider than the combined toasting slots and not rely on diverter plates that catch more crumbs than the slide out tray.Which when removed allows the accumulated, shelved crumbs to fall onto the counter top. Has to be a better design out there for a crumb tray!"
Don't buy this sorry excuse for a toaster!!  Extremely limited adjustment range for dark and light shade and all of the range is in the darker 20% of the adjustment dial.  The range of adjustment was bad at when new and has become worse after 6 months.  Cleaning doesn't help.  Bread with the slightest moisture content must be toasted on the next-to-darkest setting and the result is unpredictable.  It won't toast an English muffin or bagel to golden color.  Bagel setting only darkens the overall shade of both sides but not darker on one side and lighter on the other as you would expect.  No orientation marking for bagel (as if that even mattered with this awful toaster).  Normally GE appliances are pretty good but not this one.  This thing is strictly eye candy for your counter.  You have been warned.
"Since this was so highly rated I thought everything would work great, but the Bagel function on this unit doesn't work anywhere near as well as the one on my old Kitchen Aid toaster. With this one, the non-toasted side gets well toasted, too, which is not the purpose of a Bagel setting."
"Updated on 5/16/23: I found the crumb tray, it’s kinda’ hidden and I’m glad I kept looking for it. I still think the tray could be wider, I still have crumbs on the counter after toastingAlso, it doesn’t fit large (long) slices like for fancy breads.It doesn’t toast equally on both sides.It looks good so buy it if you want.Previous review: Like the shape and design two issues:1) it has no crumb tray so expect a mess.2) I eat sprouted grain bread, even the highest setting does not brown or crisp the toast. I’m ok with my toast not brown at all, however I would not recommend this appliance if a crisp toast matters is important for you.Paid too much money for it to be poorly designed. Expected more from GE. I missed the return window so I’ll stuck  with it."
"Did not like the chemical smell emitted from toaster prior to initial use per instructions. Had to go through the procedure four times in well ventilated area but a light odor was still present.  Inadequate shallow bread crumb tray with large holes didn't help keep crumbs on tray even with light use as crumbs were always falling out.  Didn't find the slots that wide for thicker items.  Inadequate lift function where there was no lift at all as I have been accustomed to using with previous toasters.  For the price of this toaster, better quality was expected based on reviews, but this experience demonstrated that quality was lacking."
Consistently toasts bread very unevenly and takes longer to toast than any other toaster I’ve owned. Would not recommend.
What is it with today's toasters? I have to turn this up to second to last setting to get a piece of bread to toast properly.
"The toaster has a bagel setting that should only toast the ""cut side"" of the bagel.  Selecting the setting as per the instructions and facing the cut side of the bagel toward the center heating elements (also as per instructions) does not work.  Instead, all four elements get hot just like it does for normal toasting of sliced bread.  I had this problem with the first toaster I ordered and so I had Amazon send me a second toaster.  The second toaster had the same problem.  Having a replacement sent by Amazon is what the GE customer support representative advised me to do.  I have noticed several other reviews mention this defect.  This toaster has so many excellent qualities however, at this price, I expect it to function as advertised.  Buyer beware!!!"
This toaster works. It does take a little too long in my opinion. It is larger than I've used before but I'm getting used to it. The sides do show fingerprints so it has to constantly be wiped down.
Looks nice...has some nice features but hard time getting different breads toasted properly. Bottom of the bread comes out much darker than top and just looks like there is not enough elements inside to toast the upper sections. Would not recommend. CigarDave
Good product except it doesnt catch all bread crumbs.
"At max (#7), my toast comes out on the light side of medium.Wish this went to 11 .  .  ."
Can’t attest to the value so far but I was so disappointed in the finish. Fingerprints everywhere but I know they make stainless now that won’t show them. Who uses this fingerprinty crap anymore?
"This is a nice looking toaster and easy to clean especially on the outside, looks very nice on the counter. It only toasts on one side of the bread in each slot and is very slow to toast the bread."
"Nice toaster, well made, toasts evenly and efficiently. Just no bagel function. I've been trying to find a suitable toaster for two months now, thought this would be the one. Alas, this was not meant to be. The search continues.Don't be teased by the ""bagel"" button on this toaster, it doesn't do anything. I assumed the button did what a bagel button has always done, turn off one of the heating elements, but no. Burnt buns and bagels for everyone."
"Returned, the toaster was not wide enough for bagels and didn’t toast evenly"
Does not toast evenly. I’m disappointed. I’m sure this will be retired soon.
"Had a GE toaster for 19 years,  sooo I bought another one,  when it finally bought the bisquit.  What a disappointment, the rim around the top collects crumbs. The crumbs cathers are in the rear, making easy to forget and the heat controls  are uneven, making it hard to gage the toasting level."
Doesn’t toast evenly on both sides in addition it takes a long time to toast the bread.Expected more at this price.
"It was great having a 4 slot toaster for a month. It worked well, although I felt the highest setting was a little low, but I could always toast something twice to get it to brown more. A month after I bought it though, one side stopped working, so now it's just a regular 2 slot toaster. Still decent for a 2 slot though, the silver looks sharp."
Bought this a year ago. Pieces are falling out of it when cleaning out the crumbs. Started out good 8 months in started to toast way more at the bottom. I clean often and there was nothing obstructing it. Do not recommend.
I had a 4 slice GE toaster for about 8 years. It was great. So I stuck with another GE. This toaster is not what they used to be. It does not toast evenly at all. Very disappointed.
This toaster was not expensive but had pretty good reviews. What I've found is that it doesn't toast evenly. I've tried changing the settings but it just doesn't seem to matter. I guess I got what I paid for.
It does not toast evenly. The bottom half of the bread is done and the upper half is not.
"Like most toasters today, it doesn’t toast both sides evenly. I have to turn the toast and run it a few more seconds to get it to toast properly."
"I bought this toaster less than a year ago.  We use a toaster at least once, often twice daily. Right at the start I found that the toaster performed fine for single uses only. As soon as back to back toasting was necessary, the subsequent toasting was lighter and lighter. Over the next few months, toasting quality degraded markedly.  While frozen waffles once toasted beautifully at setting 4, now the setting needs to be at 7 and often that is not enough. This GE toaster claims that there are a low number of returns. Since you can only return it for 30 days after purchase, I’m not sure that this claim is relevant."
Very sturdy and attractive toaster but the settings are way off and it takes forever and a day for your toast to be ready.  Ok as long as you have plenty of time on your hands.
Lightweight and doesn’t toast evenly but seems fine
"I've had this toaster for over six months and it is by far the worst toaster I've ever had. The only good thing about it is that it turns on.The first awful thing was the smell. It was this terrible synthetic smell that filled my whole apartment every time I used it. Eventually I cleaned it thoroughly and let it dry but that only dulled the smell. It took about three months for the smell to go away completely.The second, and more important thing, is that this temperature has one mode. Yes, it has all these fancy buttons and the dial, but I guess it's all for show. I've tried every setting on this thing and it always gives me the same amount of ""toasting"". This is especially unfortunate since I freeze my bread, so I have to toast my bread *twice* every morning.The only reason this gets two stars is because it turns on and it looks and feels nice. However, functionality-wise, this thing is way worse than my girlfriend's $10 toaster from Ikea. Truly disappointing."
The toaster seems to toast one side of the bread better than the other - I would prefer a the same level of “toastiness” on each sideof the bread
"I am very sorry I bought this toaster.  There are 7 settings for darkess.  I use the darkest  (7) which is not dark enough so I have to push down again then be careful or it gets too dark.  It is not easy to clean the fingerprints off at all.  I used ii several times thinking maybe because new but it did not get any better and now I feel I should not return so will keep but very disappointed.  For the price, I expected a decent toaster.  This is not.  Look elsewhere."
"My old toaster made one side of the bread much darker than the other, which I hated.  And this one does exactly the same thing so it's going back.  Is toaster engineering really so complicated that both sides can't toast evenly?  Anyway, in response to the person who didn't like that the cord comes out the side, turn that baby over and you'll see you can adjust where the cord comes out to the back if you want.  Doesn't fix my problem but if that's what's most important to you, then there you go."
"Doesn’t toast evenly, one side is always much darker than the other side and also the bottom half of that side is dark, not so much the top"
Toaster set to 2 1/2 on bagel setting. If you like your bagels burnt on one end and barely toasted on the other then this is the toaster for you!
It does it’s job but seems a little cheap lightweight
"Remember when General Electric was the gold standard for home appliances in USA?  Yeah, those days are long gone.Toaster received, used for a week or so.  Bagel button lights up but all elements still heat, so bagel mode isn't actually initiated.  Add to that, much like other reviews, it toasts the lower half of things MUCH more than the higher, so you can have burned bottoms and nearly raw bread tops.  Lastly, when it use it emits a terrible smell, which I assume will gradually dissipate with use.Hoping it's just poor quality control on their part, so I asked Amazon for a replacement.  Will update the review based on how that performs.UPDATE: Forgot to update!  So, got replacement from Amazon, had the exact same problem as the first one (bagel button lights up but doesn't actually have a bagel mode).  This time I call GE directly.They give me hopes of a better replacement for the inconvenience...make me wait nearly a month...then tell me to just return it to Amazon for a refund.I did so, and then used the money to buy a better toaster for cheaper from another manufacturer.I'll toast my bread on an open flame before I buy a GE toaster again.  Same goes for the rest of their junk."
Bagley feature did not work. Bought  different models  first from target and Walmart and the bagel feature did not work either.
"Love the look, doesn’t work well. Yesterday it burnt my English muffin on 3 and today it barely toasted. Not all the elements heat up ever!"
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Love how it looks but my old toaster of 8+ years toasts better. Toasters usually toast one side more than the other but this one is a bit unreasonable.
The toaster seems to heat fairly even not perfectly.  But the bagel setting does not function like our old one did. It seems to toast both sides of bagel instead of just the inside as it should. Bottom and top of bagel end up too brown.
"Thought I was going to get a fast toaster to replace mine that was wearing out.  Not so.  This thing is very slow to toast.  And, the 4 slice version is a battleship on the counter!"
"Just received yesterday. Tried 3 times, would not toast bread on both sides. Bagel setting worked a little better. Looks good, doesn't work very well."
"I bought this toaster in May. With light use it didn’t even make it until the end of June. I was within my return window but felt like I was ripped off. I reached out to ge to see if it was a faulty machine or if there was a known issue but was redirected to Amazon. I bought it from the ge company on Amazon so it felt a little dumb to get redirected. I have had the replacement for a month and it hasn’t died yet but I’m obviously concerned. I was replacing my previous toaster from another company that lasted me over 10 years. I only wanted to replace it because the markings were all gone, I don’t think I’ll make it 10 years with this one, I’ll be lucky to get 10 months. For reference, yes I do use it daily but only once a day on a medium toast…"
Doesn’t toast evenly on both sides of the bread. This is the 3rd toaster I tried. They all seam to be this way.
"I had previously purchased the 435 model of Cuisinart toaster and it lasted 12 years. One of the buttons melted, but it was my fault, so I can't fault the toaster, but did want a new toaster as we were going to be remodeling my kitchen. I saw this model and saw many great reviews, so after reading about man other toasters, I decided to buy this toaster.  First off, it is not as sturdy as I expected, compared to the previous Cuisinart model. Everything about it seems kind of cheap. I am from a generation where things were actually made to last, so things these days most of the time do not fulfill that from the jump. This toaster simply does not toast correctly. It burns the edges and the center is cooked correctly. It doesn't matter how much adjusting you do, it just doesn't toast correctly, so that is a bare minimum requirement for me. Secondly, the bagel setting does not seem to work like the other model and just toasts the bread exactly like regular toast, so not sure why it is even a setting. I will be buying another toaster soon as I don't like burnt toast or crummy eggo waffles when I make them on occasion. I wish I could give another recommendation, but I will be back to the drawing board when I start my search again in the near future. Even the most expensive toaster brands seem to have negative reviews, so this was why I went with this brand and model. I do not recommend it for others to purchase and I'm not sure why there are so many good reviews as I don't think I got a lemon, it just isn't that great."
"Purchased because it looked exactly like our older Cuisinart , but when it arrived it was smaller and clearly not as robust as older model.  It operated okay for a few days then the left two slots would no longer stay consistently depressed.  We returned the toaster and purchased another from different mfg."
This one is much flimsier than my old toaster which we had for years. Then the right side stopped working.Looks identical but the mechanisms inside of the push down buttons are flimsy. I have always loved Cuisnart products still have my food processor of 35 years that is used constantly. This new one just not made to the old standard. Keeping but disappointed.
"I agree with many other reviews:  why can’t one find a quality toaster anymore? They are all made so cheaply these days, but even after looking into buying a more expensive one, I found they did not have great reviews either, so I just settled for this one. But I’m not thrilled. It’s ok, but probably just a matter of time before the cheap plastic parts fall off… And I tried very hard to find a toaster that allows you to completely open the bottom to remove stuck crumbs and bread bits, but no luck. Why do they make them with these individual sliding trays at the bottom? You can dump some of the crumbs that way but if any bigger chunks get stuck, you are turning the whole toaster upside down and shaking it violently or sticking some type of metal tool into it to break up stuck chunks. Just not practical."
"I had a previous version of this toaster for 12 years before it died. 12 years is a good run for a toaster so I got a new one of the same model. The new version’s knobs are extremely cheap feeling compared to the old model. The annoying thing is I thought it was defective, until I finally realized you have to slowly and gently push the toast lever down and let go, rather than push the toaster mechanism down as i have been doing since 1980, and for the previous 12 years. Apparently they decided on a new way to toast toast? No mention in the manual, I actually returned the 1st one thinking it was broken Why? Why do you need to reinvent the toaster. At least mention the way to push down the lever in the manual."
It does not toast well even set on a higher number.  I also have to cut a piece of bread in half to fit it in the slot.
"For a cuisinart, it is so cheaply made."
"This is our second one. The first lasted 5 years with no problems. This one feels lighter, and the right side slots cut off when toast is done, but it doesn’t pop up. Will not buy again"
"We originally bought the CPT-180 model in January of 2020 and LOVED it.  It was a great toaster.  Consistent toasting.  Solid control.  Easy to clean.  We even had to wash it out once after a minor kitchen disaster.  After almost 4 years, it sadly got knocked off the counter and separated into several pieces that we could not safely reassemble.We purchased the CPT-180P1 in Nov 2023 to replace our dearly departed, much loved, earlier generation of the product, thinking it would be equivalent quality.  Could not have been more wrong.  The new generation feels cheap as soon as it is unboxed.  The control knobs have a ton of play, making it hard to consistently get the same done-ness in a family of 8 where it is constantly getting changed to personal preferences.The thing reeked when toasting for almost 2 weeks.  Smelled like burning plastic, even though I assume it is whatever they coated the elements with for protection during storage and shipping.  The smell actually permeated the bread that was being toasted making it smell really un-appetizing.  After about two weeks of almost daily use the smell did finally mostly go away.  The toast down lever only latches about 60 percent of the time, meaning that we are constantly having to hit the lever multiple times to get the bread to stay down for toasting.I have not yet tried this new generation for the wide variety of breads/bagels/buns/etc that we were toasting in our old toaster.  But it seems to work OK-ish for things like pop-tarts and stuff that the kids toast in the morning."
"I am hard core loyal to Cuisinart but this toaster is one of my least favorite products of theirs that I own. You have to be very slow when pushing down the handle or it pops back up, and the toasting is wildly inconsistent. Fully toasted on one side and ridiculously light on the other. Not always, but often enough that it's worth mentioning."
I bought this to replace my old one which was exact model. My older model had the ability to push button and make toast pop up early if necessary; this one does not allow me to that so you absolutely need to make sure your setting is perfectly accurate! Disappointed!
This unit does toast bread and bagels fine.  However after a month of use the left side has a hard time staying down when bread is put into it
"When we first used this toaster, it was fine. A couple weeks into it, we found that one side of the toast burns and the other side of the toast isn't cooked. All I want is a 4 slice toaster that cooks booth pairs of toast the same."
"I am extremely disappointed with this toaster; it burns the bread even with the medium/low settings. I bought it because I only have an oven toaster, which is extremely good at toasting bread. The bread comes out evenly toasted and simply perfect. However, it is a large oven toaster/Air Fryer, and too big for just a couple of pieces of toast once a day. I only used this new toaster once, three times in a row, trying to find the perfect setting for a nicely toasted bread. I never did. It burnt every time. And it doesn’t even burn evenly, only parts of the slice of bread. It tasted awful. So, I put it away. I continue to use my oven toaster/Air Fryer. What I find interesting is that the oven toaster is the same brand as this toaster—a Cuisinart! I would not buy this toaster again or recommend it to anyone."
"Like everything else these days, the quality has slipped. We had the exact toaster over 10 years and it still works great but had to replace it for other reasons. It does take a longer time to toast but we got used to that. But this new one? It take 3.5 on the dial to even start to brown the toast and we have to push down the lever to toast multiple times before it sticks! You also can’t hear the toast pop up. We only kept it because every other brand got bad quality reviews also. Very sad that you can’t buy anything dependable anymore. At least it’s still working 2 months later."
"It is hard to pay just a bit more for a nice toaster. You don't want to buy a cheap unit that you replace every year or two, but you also don't want to spend hundreds of dollars to make Eggo Waffles. So you try to find something in the middle. Maybe it holds more toast. Thicker slices of whatever. More settings. A nice finish. Hopefully, better build quality.This unit looks nice enough for sure, with a satin stainless and black exterior, and it isn't overdesigned or full of a million functions and features I don't need. That's all good. But it seems to run a bit hot, meaning at a 3 (of 6) on the scale, it's giving me almost completely blackened toast. Medium is 2-1/2 unless it was just run, in which case it's a 2. And if you're running all four slots at once, be extra careful you don't annihilate all four slices with the power of a fully operational toaster array.I've used it enough to get used to it, and I'm not going to go through a return and learning a whole new toaster's quirks, but I wish it heated less so I could use more range in toasting and get a more thoroughly toasted piece of bread as well. Ultimately, it's a fine toaster with a bit of a learning curve. But the slots aren't all that wide and it is very easy to burn your toast, so it could have been better."
We have had many products from this company and never been disappointed.  Until now.  The lever to put the toast down takes many times to lock down? The browning is half brown and half pale.  I would not recommend this product due just to the problems with the locking the bread down to toast.  I expect one day after multiple tries to see it being thrown by my husband.  Very frustrating.
"nice toaster, but not easy to get the lever to stay down"
"I had a Cuisinart 4 slice toaster that was 16 years old that recently died so I thought that I would stick with Cuisinart to replace that old work horse of a toaster.  We use the toaster every day.  Well the new one arrived and I could immediately feel and see the cheap quality of the new toaster.  I hope it lasts half as long as my old one.  It works okay, it's just very cheaply made.  Very sad."
"I was a little disappointed with the quality of this. I expected more from a cuisinart. It feels flimsy and cheap.  The toaster bar that you use to push down the toast doesn’t want to easily stay down so I have to keep pushing it down to get it to latch. I’ll keep it, but I don’t recommend it, and I wouldn’t purchase it again if I had it to do over."
"I purchased this toaster to replace a toaster that I have that's 20 years old. Wasn't looking to re-invent the wheel, just wanted something a little more consistent in the browning. Great reviews on this toaster so I figured I would give it a shot. Here are the problems that I found:1: Bread slots are too small for good bread. Even the premium store brand bread is too wide at the top, causing you to jam it in to fit. Probably great for wonderbread or poptarts but not decent bread.2: You have to push the carriage lift several times before it actually locks in the down position.3: You have to lift the carriage lift manually to get the bread to a level you can get it out.4: If you want to lift the bread early, the thing doesn't want to give up the bread, almost flips the toaster over if you want to end the cycle.5: Browning (although better than my old toaster) isn't super consistent. This toaster is functional and for smaller slices it works ok. Not sure how it does on bagels but the slots are wide. I just wish they would have made them a 1/4 inch or so longer."
"Bought this to use in an assisted living kitchen for 70 residents. Used for toast and Belgian waffles every day, plus the occasional BLT.  On one side of the toaster the prongs got bent somehow (probably a cook being rough with the bread) and then that side wouldn't work. I straightened out the prongs so the toaster goes down but it won't stay, so that side is useless. The other side works, but you have to press the handle 2-3 times to get it to stay. Once it does, it toasts very well and I'm pleased with that, but I've only had this since last February and it isn't worth the $ I paid. I'm not making 200 pieces of toast per day: maybe 16. I really think that amounts to pretty light usage and it should have held up better than this. I'm buying a $20 toaster to replace it."
"So, fundamentally it works.  Still, from the research I did I expected a very nice toaster and instead I got something that feels cheap.It doesn't really heat evenly, which isn't a surprise because when you look down the toaster slots you can see the heating filaments are wildly uneven in how far in and out of the grate they're woven in.  Overall toast darkness also isn't entirely consistent- the same product at the same heating setting any given morning might come anywhere from slightly under to slightly over.It's basically adequate for the job of thicker slices toast.  There might be some lighter or darker spots on the bread, but it's forgiving enough that you'll get toasted bread.  However, your standard frozen waffles can be hit or miss, defrost mode or no.  A standard slice of grocery store cinnamon-swirl raisin toast is really hard to crisp up without burning.  Thinner frozen waffles like the kind that's four tiny slices of ""toast"" per waffle are basically impossible- your choices are warm but soft, or sort-of toasted but with random burnt patches across the waffle."
This is good but the only issue I have is that you have to keep pressing down the right side until it stays down. I'm disappointed because it's hard to find a good toaster. I thought this would be a good company but I should have learned my lesson from the 5 in 1 griddle I bought from same company. The griddle is good but the Botton on the right side keeps popping out. So now I need to use my finger to press the metal instead of having the cover to protect my finger. But toaster works that is my only issue.
"Bought this ""returned to Amazon"" unit to save a few bucks.  After unboxing, I realized why it was sent back to begin with which speaks volumes about Amazon's recertification process on returned items.  The right side slide lever would hang when the cycle finished.  Rather than send it back and have someone else deal with the issues due to Amazon sucking at fully checking an item out before putting it back up for sale, I took the four screws out of the bottom and removed the top.  It took me a few minutes to figure out what was going on with it than realized that a bur of metal in the stamped out guides on the back side was the culprit.  I used a razor knife to scrape off the bur and then retested it.  This solved the issue.  Put it back together, Plugged it in to test it, and voila, good as new if new would have been sufficient to start with.  This is definitely something that QC from Cuisinart should have caught before it was sold.  Other than the above, it works as most toasters do, uneven browning but overall does the job."
The previous generations were superior to this one. My last 2 versions were much better at toasting and the shape accommodated the bread and muffins a lot easier. There is no English Muffin setting on this model! I am disappointed.
Seems to burn a little on bottom of bread
"*update* I called Cuisinart and they are sending a replacement.I have to toast an English muffin on either the right or left side for twelve minutes.  My previous toaster, before it wore out, only took four minutes.  I attempted to submit an inquiry on the Cuisinart site, but the site did not accept my inquiry.  Do not purchase this toaster."
"I had no idea finding a good toaster would be so hard. It's just a toaster, don't they all just toast? Nope! Most of them are awful. After a few serious fails getting awful toasters, got this one after seeing it on almost every single ""best toaster"" list out there. I'm a Cuisinart product fan but, not sure why this toaster is rated so well. It's decent, does a good job, price is nice. It's not terrible like many others, but doesn't wow me either. Have had unevenness on everything we've toasted so far. The wells aren't that deep so thicker or larger bread doesn't go far enough down to toast it evenly. Also, the temp/time knob is really loose, feels super cheap when you turn it. There's no feeling of it holding along the way and if you let go, it wobbles because it's just so darn loose. Can't even set it exactly because it'll move when you let go. Was expecting more quality from Cuisinart but the cheap flimsy knobs sort of show it's true colors. It's a good toaster and a good price but nothing to get excited about that's for sure. Bet it won't last more than a year or so."
I gave 2 starts because it worked great while it was working but it recently stopped working. We purchased it in 2022 and expected to get more use out of it instead of just 2 years. Another thing to consider is wasn't used everyday. It was quite expensive to be disposable.
"Decent toaster but the dials give no resistance when selecting 1 to 6 levels of toasting.  The dials are extremely loose as if they are detached from anything mechanical inside the toaster.  Not sure if they are suppose to be like this or they are defective.  Have used the toaster just a few times.  Turning the dials does seem to create degrees of toasting but they seem way to loose, almost as they float though the settings 1-6.  Would prefer to hear a clicking sound when selecting browning levels.  The defrost, bagel, warm, and cancel buttons are too thin and impossible to see at a comfortable distance.  I don't get the feeling the dials and settings were designed well.  This is the second toaster I've had in a few weeks.  I guess I'll have to live with it because I will not return yet another ill designed toaster.  Too new to make a recommendation but if I had to I would give it two stars.  You would think Cuisinart would make a well designed product but in the case of this toaster it is NOT!UPDATE 1/13/22  I was hopeful but turns out to be a piece of junk.  The click-less floating dials are impossible to deal with.  The dials are at the maximum and the toast barely toasts.  This is the third one I tried.  Will not order another.  To late to return. Not sure why it got raving reviews.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."
It’s only been a couple of months and even with infrequent use it barely works. Nothing toasts evenly. And a single piece of bread can take 3-4 cycles to toast. Save your hard-earned money and buy something else.
"I thought I'd try it for a few weeks.  We like our toast extremely crispy so I set it to the highest level (#6) and it was toasted lightly on one side and other side was barely toasted at all.  Tried it on the other side and it was the same.  The only way I get crispy toast is to do it twice.  Very disappointed, especially after I depend on the reviews.  Should have sent it back but it had been used.  Won't buy Cuisinart again!"
"We've ordered this toaster 3 separate times and the bagel button doesn't work on any.  Additionally, the lever doesn't catch half the time as others have mentioned in their review. When the stars align and it catches with a normal piece of toast it works fine.I don't recommend purchasing."
We purchased on of these years ago and it has been great. Purchased a new one hoping the quality was similar but sadly it was not. This was one of the more expense toasters so we a very disapointed.
Was replaci d same toaster that lasted 4 years. This one on second lowest setti g burns toast
"For the price I paid for this toaster I think it would be better. Don't get me wrong, it does what a toaster is supposed to do and pretty dang good and very even on both sides. My hangup on it is the latching mechanism when trying to toast just doesn't latch to turn on and this happens way too frequent for the price of this toaster. I would definitely not buy it again but it works so it is what it is."
"I would rate this toaster a zero, if I could.  It's, basically, a piece of junk.  Its status as a best seller and the rave reviews it receives don't reconcile with the actual product.Just beyond 90 days of purchase, with minimal and appropriate use, it, literally, stopped working.  It's a four slice toaster and the left side depressor doesn't stay down. The only option is to stand there and hold it down, which is ridiculous.When I contacted Amazon about the defective product the customer service rep told me, nicely, it's no longer eligible for return.  To be clear, not a return because we don't like it or no longer need it but a return because it doesn't work.What's most shocking is that, supposedly, this is a Cuisinart product.  Our last Cuisinart toaster lasted for YEARS.  In fact, it was still working when we purchased this ""replacement"", which we only got because we wanted a four, versus, two slice toaster.Other reasons for classifying this toaster as ""junk"":  It's a flimsy tin box and it does NOT toast evenly, not even close.  Also, the temperature control knobs don't stay where set.  A mere brush of the hand, or maybe even bump to the unit on the counter, shifts the temperature control knobs.  So be prepared for unexpectedly burnt or undercooked output.Amazon's offer to ""assist"", after 45 - 60 minutes on the phone with their customer service rep, was to arrange a three-way call with the manufacturer.  Given time zones, the manufacturer was not yet open for operation.  The Amazon customer service rep offered to schedule the three-way call for later in the day, to which I agreed.  When the proposed time for that call conflicted with another appointment on my work calendar, I sent a reply email to the Amazon customer service rep asking if we could do it an hour later.  I've never had a reply.  That was two - three weeks ago.I've bought another manufacturer's four slice toaster from another retailer.  Do yourself a favor and do that first or, at least, don't buy this specific toaster from Amazon."
"UPDATE: It’s been a while, and our disappointment with this toaster has slowly but steadily been increasing. It’s never toasted as evenly as its old cousin despite our efforts at being careful positioning bread, bagels, toaster waffles, etc. We ended up using a permanent marker to make it easier to see what the darkness settings were, and the dials for this function have always spun very loosely in a way that makes it feel they’re about to come off. (Note: they have not, it just *feels* that way.) The toaster works about as well now (a couple of years after purchase) as it did on the first day - but after the umpteenth “put it back in” or “don’t bother, just throw it out” result we’re looking to replace it.  Will definitely NOT buy this one (or any of its stablemates) again.Original Review: We bought this unit to replace an older Cuisinart toaster that finally stopped working after at least 15 years of near-daily use. The new toaster seems solidly built, although the selector dials used to adjust the darkness of the toast spin rather loosely and can easily be set darker or lighter by accident with a very light touch.  Having to push buttons for certain features/actions took a little getting used to but is absolutely not a problem, and having an actual ""cancel"" button (which works!) is reassuring. We've fit some fairy hefty bagels & slices of pound cake into the slots with no problem, but some ""country"" or ""rustic"" style bread slices are too long to fit well & have to be fiddled with a bit. The only real disappointment is that it does NOT toast as evenly as its predecessor, with some slices noticeably darker on one side than the other, or one area being slightly more or less toasted than others on the same side of bread. We decided that none of the problems was bad enough to warrant a return, but are undecided if we would buy another Cuisinart toaster in the future after using this one for a while."
"I bought this toaster because it has a bagel option. When toasting a bagel or bun, the toaster toasted both sides. Not acceptable."
It lasted about a year. After that it became unusable because the toast wouldn't stay down. First one side and then both sides.
"It is a beautiful toaster and work fine but what a bad feeling when You used the heat control butons. It look like it has any kind of mechanics behind. It feel completely loose. It mean, it didn't stay in place and it just feel wrong. It is a shame because cuisinart is normaly a quality brand..."
"Function: The toaster seemed OK to start with.  As others have noted, the dials are pretty loose, so they're fiddly to set.  But we recently tried toasting bagels, and the bagel setting didn't work.Customer service: I contacted the company, and after three days, they got back to me, and agreed it was a problem.  They sent a replacement.  The replacement's bagel setting also didn't work.  This time, contrary to their previous comments, customer service informed me that they intend for both sides to toast on the bagel setting.Conclusion: If you're looking for a toaster with a functioning bagel setting - which normally means that only one side gets toasted - this is not the toaster for you.  I replaced this useless appliance with one made by Zwilling, and it's perfect."
It looks nice out of the box.Kind of light and flimsyBagel function doesn't seem to toast the sliced side more than the unsliced side leading to burnt outsides.Not sure the defrost function is doing anything different than regular toast.Basically it requires a lot of trial and error and even then I don't consistently get the toasting I'm looking for.
"I have traditionally been a big Cuisinart fan and have purchased many of their products over the years including several 4-piece toasters.  I purchased this one two years ago and am so fed up with it that I had to share my experience.The overall quality is low.  Uneven browning, flimsy (almost comical) rattling dials, strange push-down locking mechanism that you have to hold down for several seconds to engage.  However its the insides that annoyed me the most.  The heating wires are weaved through slots in the supporting housing to provide the heat in little arcs. However most of the arcs have shifted back behind the support housing likely contributing to the uneven browning.Overall the whole product feels cheaply made.  The previous version of this 4-slice toaster worked far better and felt like higher quality. I recommend looking at another brand."
periodically requires dunking down a few times before the toaster latches in
"I purchased the same exact unit I got over 10 years ago which had worked, and still works excellent. I wanted to give it someone and replace it with the same product, same manufacturer and model. This new one: Quality is not in it, it does not toast even, one side almost does not toast, if you increase the number on the dial then it burns the other side. Unfortunately, the return window passed. I DON'T recommend it."
"We had this Cuisinart model for six years with no problems., The toasting/heating elements simply weren't working consistently.  We ordered this replacement based on Cuisinart quality and longevity.  We plugged it in and, yes, it toasted but did NOT push the bread up when finished!!  Had to use tongs to retrieve - but it would go back into toasting mode each time we reached in!  Finally, got the bread out - thankful at least that it did stop toasting and did not start a fire.  Hard to believe that this was not checked during manufacture.  We will be ordering a different brand."
"I would not purchase this toaster again.  After less than 6 months of typical use, one of the two frames that lifts the food broke and became unusable.  I submitted a warranty claim on the Cuisinart website, which has been accepted, but in order to receive the replacement, the terms of the warranty require sending a picture of the toaster with a sliced cord.  One side of the toaster was still functioning, but when I asked the customer service rep if we could send the picture once the replacement had arrived, I was told no.  Unfortunately, that means that my family will be without a toaster for the next 10+ days.Even before it broke, the toaster was only average.  The food doesn't always seem evenly heated.  You need to be very careful to put the bread in a particular slot if you are toasting a single item or it will get burned.  The sound when the food is done is a twang -- really not very satisfying at all.Overall, when I'm in the market, I will purchase a different toaster next time.  I do appreciate that Cuisinart will replace the faulty toaster, but I am disappointed that it wasn't a higher quality product, especially given the cost."
Purchase one returned due to plunger not sticking. Now plunger works but the bagel setting does not work.  Day 1.  Day 3.  Bagel setting does not work  Toaster is not as expected
"For the price, I would have expected better. The metal chassis of the toaster feels nice and looks attractive, but the plastic levels themselves feel so cheap that I can imagine them breaking one day. What's even worse is that the dial has no resistance to it, which makes the construction feel even worse. The width of the slots themselves are well-sized and perfectly usable for thicker cut slices of bread, but I'm not sure about doing the chunky types like Italian or French loaves.The defrost feature is okay, but really, I would just wait for your bread to defrost itself and then have it put in the toaster before trusting it to work entirely. The only other thing you'd use it for is frozen waffles, and personally I think putting it on high heat is a lot more effective, since after the defrost you'll need to toast it again anyway. Why add the needless intermediary step? As for the reheat feature, it certainly is nice if you did forget your toast and want it warmed up, but again heating it at the lowest toast setting is just as good.Really, the thing just looks nice but all the added ""features"" don't really matter much and can be supplemented by using the dial at appropriate temperatures instead. If this thing goes on sale, I'd say go for it, but unless you NEED a toaster that does four slices at once (which I didn't in retrospect), pass on this overpriced product."
"I purchased this to replace a cheap Black and Decker 2 slice toaster, but I'm not sure why this cost  over 50 dollars.  Like most toasters you can set a dial for the darkness of the toast, set features such as defrost or bagel, and raise the bread slightly to make it easier to lift out. It looks good, yes, and it will toast 4 pieces of whatever at once but the quality of the toasted items doesn't seem any better than my cheapy toaster.For example I've been making toast with frozen bread and waffles this week.  I realize the settings need to be different for dry bread vs fresh bread vs frozen, so I've been setting it on 3, with defrost.  Today with that setting, my waffle came out burned on one side and reasonably toasted, if uneven, on the other.  I've attached pictures.  You will notice that the side that is not burned was toasted very, very unevenly.3 is also not even half of the darkness on the scale, so who even knows what it would look like at the max setting.  Charcoal, probably.When it pops up the bread it's barely high enough to lift out so you pretty much have to use the bar to push it up high enough to grab.  That's not good.I'm also in the habit of slicing and freezing a bakery raisin pecan bread.  I like freezing to eliminate waste on bakery fresh products.  Also on the 3 setting with defrost, my bread is only very very slighted toasted.  This is with a slice much thinner than my waffles.  I usually run it through a second time at 2 to get a deep color (just a hair before burned) color on it.Don't get me wrong, I like a rather dark color to anything I'm toasting, but dark does not mean burned, and my results have been so inconsistent I should have just stuck with my 20 dollar toaster.Update:  The bagel setting does NOT work.  I set it on bagel to toast some buns, and it toasted both sides.  I tried it a second time and looked inside, sure enough, all sets of the wires turned out instead of just the insides, and it toasted both sides.  Worthless junk."
The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because the right-side panel is upside down!  I would have returned it but we needed a toaster.  Whoever is checking the product really needs to take a good look to confirm it has been put together properly.
Nothing spectacular. Works like every other pop-up toaster I have ever owned.
"We received this same toaster as a wedding gift 10 years ago and it’s was great. We had a tallow explosion in the kitchen and couldn’t get the toaster clean so we wanted to replace it with the same one. This new one is garbage compared to our previous one. It’s flimsy, cheep feeling, significantly lighter, you have to push the tabs down multiple times for them to stick and start cooking. Super disappointed, I wanted to return it but my husband said we’ll just deal with it. Would not recommend."
"Overall the toaster is average. The down handles are difficult to keep down, for some reason, and the temperature distribution and width/length of the toaster slots are inadequate for larger pieces of bread/bagel. The aesthetics are good."
Kind of cheap quality
"I'm having the same issue as many of the other 1-star reviewers. When you push the levers down to activate toasting, they don't stay down. You have to push and hold several times before the mechanism does what it's meant to do. Silly how something so small can be so frustrating, especially when you are busy making breakfast for four hungry children. My family is growing tired of me saying, ""Get down, toast!"" as though it were a dog. I also don't like that I have to fish the toast out with my fingers when it's done, dodging the hot parts. This is disappointing coming from Cuisinart, a brand I have always considered trustworthy."
"Great toaster but NEVER, pick it up by the toaster slots!!! I store my toaster in the cabinet and have sliced my finger wide open twice trying to pick up out of the cabinet. The most recent time it bumped the door of the cabinet and knocked it off balance in my hand and slice my finger open as it slide thru my hand."
"But after 6 months the text wore off the buttons and we couldn’t read them anymore. And that’s with using it only a few times a week. Now, 2.5 years later, the toasts don’t stay down when you push the lever down. On both sides. My last toaster lasted forty years.  Time to shop for a new one."
This toaster feels cheap. It is very lightweight and made of plastic. You put the lever down and it doesn't work half the time and you got to do it again. It's not any good.
"Just received this within the past week and started using it. Immediately, we found that one entire side of heating elements was not properly working. It was always under-toasted compared to the other sets of heating elements on each other side of the four slices of bread. Basically, we now have to avoid using one of the bread slices, since you will either have one side under toasted or the other over toasted."
I expected top quality from Cuisinart but am disappointed in this toaster. I don't know if this is just a lemon but I will be returning it.
The slot marked best to use for one or two slices doesn’t toast both pieces the same.
"I’ve only used my new toaster 4 times, so far. I have yet to have an even toasting. Not really happyUpdate 2/28/2024Even toasting. Absolutely NOT recommend"
"I bought this toaster to replace what, I believed to be, the exact same toaster that we'd had and loved for almost 10 years. Though this new one looks the same as the previous one, it's a lot lighter and like ""not as tight"" as our earlier model. It just feels overall cheaper and you have to use much higher settings for toast. Disappointed with whatever changes the company made."
"I purchased it because of the reviews. When I got it,  I thought it was rather flimsy, but it looked good so I kept it. It was light weight and the dials rattled around. Did not toast evenly. Finally, the bagel did not pop up and started to burn. The toaster did not shut off. I unplugged it and plugged it back in, but it was still came on.  I tossed it in the trash. I had it 18 months. Time for a new toaster.😒"
"We had this exact (appearing) toaster for years. It was sturdy, worked great until it eventually broke down. In searching for a new toaster, I saw this and thought we would get exactly what we had before  but that is not the case at all. It is so cheaply made now. The buttons don’t always stick/stay down, it is more rattly that the “old” toaster. Probably weighs a third as much. Wondering how long this one will last. *sigh* disappointed"
"Toaster was great while it worked, but this annoying glitch now means we can’t use both sides and leave the toaster unattended, otherwise our fire alarms start going off. Why does the one side not pop up OR turn off anymore?? It just toasts/burns indefinitely unless we force it up with our hands. Super annoying"
"We had this same model toaster for 10 years until the handle broke and we needed a new one. It was a great toaster, so we got the same model. But the new one toasts very uneven. One side gets burnt while the other barely gets any color. Also, the bottom gets burnt while the top doesn’t get any color. The new toaster model is not good."
"For a technology that has been around for 100 years, this toaster is pretty poor. It does not toast evenly on one side, let alone both sides. The knobs have little resistance, so they change when you move the toaster around. There are 6 settings, but this one burns toast on the ""2"" setting, so I'm glad I was only trying to lightly toast my first slices, the last batch I did on the ""1 3/4"" setting. The result was from light areas to golden brown. This replaced a 15 year old GE that broke, you would think a new toaster would be better, not worse than one that was in use for over a decade."
"I picked this toaster for my mobile coffee shop business. There was so many great reviews. It toasted well. But in less than three months, one of the toast arms will not stay down. It still will not get hot when the arm is held down so I feel it’s something electrical. I would not buy this again. Good luck to all if you do."
"I was attempting to replace a Cuisinart toaster that I had for 18 years.  I wanted to get the same exact one.  The one this seller sent me was a little different than pictured.  I reached out to them and it went unanswered.  Its been about 4 months and one side doesn't work any more.  You have to pull this thing down repeatedly to engage.  It is such a piece of junk.  The last one lasted so long so I wonder if this seller is selling knock off/refurbished merchandise or if Cuisinart has gone down hill.  Either way, best to look elsewhere for your toaster."
"We had one before and it lasted 5 years with no complaints. The newer version, which looks exactly the same is so horribly constructed it makes you want to scream ""make it in America"". This is our second new one after calling Crusinart and complaining about the construction of the product the first time. The pop up mechanism does not go down and stay down. You have to push it down multiple times before it catches. When it is done toasting it does not pop up. The toaster dials on the front spin around like pin wheels. They feel like there is no fastener behind the dial to give it come stabillity. Extremely dissatisfied with this item. Crusinart another great brand tarnishing its reputation by choosing cheap Chinese labor over quality. Quality is the strongest endorsement for a brand. Buyer beware!"
"Like the look and ease of use.Don’t like that the levers to lower the bread don’t operate smoothly and sound cheap. Also, it doesn’t seem to toast evenly."
This was my second purchase of this product  After a year the left side dial didn’t work. Felt like it was not connected. Now right side dial not working. Have always liked this brand but now looking for another toaster and will not consider this brand  quality is no longer there. Was not worth the money spent
"I bought this toaster in January 2023  and have used it almost every day for the last 6 months.  It is has very cool retro look and a solid feel. Unfortunately, my praise stops there.  My first observation is the temperature control. It gets very hot, very fast even on low settings which results in burnt, uneven toasting, especially in bagel mode. The reheating mode is fine, and I’ve never used the defrost mode.Operationally, especially in toast mode, you have to press the levers several times before the bread stays down. Yesterday, the heating unit on the left side of the toaster stopped working completely. I still have the right side but since I wanted a 4 slice toaster, needless to say,I am disappointed. I would be careful if you are considering purchasing. Nothing against Cuisinart. I love the brand and will continue to buy their products. I just can’t in good conscience recommend this model."
"I was surprised to realize I have owned this toaster for 5 years, but it did not get hard use. It has been used only a few months a year, so maybe the equivalent of a year and a half in total. It started to get temperamental a few months ago, with the toast not wanting to stay locked down when I pushed the lever down. Today my husband showed me that half of the toaster is only toasting one side of the bread . We've owned a few Cuisinart toasters, because they seemed slightly better than the average toaster, but they aren't all that. I'm replacing it with another brand."
"Wanted a good toaster.  Surprise, surprise!!  This is not the easiest  to operate.  The single slice slot never really works.  One side of the bread gets dark and the other side hardly toasts at all.  There is a lots of thought one has to put into every thing you toast and it never seems to come out the same way.  I gave it a chance, decided to return it.  Helpful son threw out the boxes it came in so I now have a toaster that sets my mood for the day.  Not too happy with the Quisinart but it is mine."
"I was so disappointed with this toaster.  I usually buy cuisinart because I like the quality of thier products. This toaster is a hugh bomb. First, the cord is in the front, really weird. If I had known that I wouldn't have even bothered buying it. Second, when I put toast/bagels in, the lever dies not always Stay down and I have to push it down again. This toaster is a CHEAP piece of junk."
"This was the worst toaster I’ve ever owned, yet not cheapest. The number dial spins if you bump it. Toast burns at setting higher than two. I’m not sure why it has different levels of burnt toast. Wish I had returned it on time."
"This toaster never worked properly.  First it did not toast evenly.  Then it kept shutting off.  Finally, on Thanksgiving while trying to toast bread for family, it sent up dark black smoke in the kitchen.  Shame on you Cusinart."
"You have to flip the bread about halfway through and watch it constantly if you want toast that is even close to being toasted the same of on each side, otherwise you get one side toasted and one side completely white still."
"Had an older long slot cuisinart, that just wore out after years of good service.This one just is disappointing.First: it’s very slow.Second: it toasts from the bottom up.An English muffin takes more than 1 cycle (yeah the dial is up to 11).As a child of the 60’s, I remember having a hardware store purchased black and decker toaster.  Damn thing was fast and uniform.Now it’s a challenge to make your eggs and toast concurrently.I will say the bagel setting is pretty accurate. Though it’s still from the bottom up."
"I’ve had this toaster for several years at home and it’s been great. Ordered another one for our vacation house from Amazon and it never worked straight out of the box. Sent it back and got a replacement. The replacement will work about 30% of the time and when it does it will burn one side of the toast and not even start to brown the other side. Please don’t waste your money, the product and brand has lost all of my confidence and I’ll never buy another product with this brand."
"Toaster is OK, but even having the toaster set to maximum darkness does not toast well. It takes at leaast 2 times to get a goo dark color."
"Purchased this toaster less just under 3 years ago (November 2020). From the beginning we noticed It didn’t toast evenly, one side was always much darker than the other. Here we are less than 3 years later and is burning today at the low settings (Black at the 2 of 6 setting ). Was fine but seems like it should have lasted longer."
One of the knobs was loose. We had to return the toaster. We purchased the same model about 10 years ago. The quality then compared to the one we just received is very disappointing.
The item worked but was disappointed in the quality especially for that brand name.
Our previous Cuisinart toaster was approximately 10 years old when it died.  We were happy with it so I decided to just replace it with another 4 slice Cuisinart.  The quality is not there anymore.  This new toaster is lightweight and tinny.  Neither side toasts evenly.  The slide bars to put the toast down don’t feel like they will last long at all.  We are very disappointed with the purchase.
"Update:  Just now remembering to update this review. We finally gave up working with Cuisinart customer service; we were just given the run around. So frustrating.  I was able to get the left side working after many episodes of shaking the unit upside down and rapping the sides - this dislodged quite a lot of stuff that didn't fall through to the crumb catcher. Never was able to get the right side working.  We will use the toaster until the right side permanently goes too, then we will go and buy a bargain toaster. :-(We purchased this toaster from Amazon.com on January 25th.  Today it is DEAD.  Dies in less than 3 months.  SMH  It worked fine right up until this morning - nothing special.  We didn't expect a magic toaster, but we expected reliability, and a certain amount of quality in workmanship that would give it a reasonably long operating life given the Cuisinart name (we have many products from Cuisinart including a Coffee Maker that has got to be 7 years old if not older).  In addition - have you seen the selections of toasters these days?  Sad Sad that it's come to this in these modern times. I've contacted Cuisinart customer service.  I'll be updating the review once I get a result.  It is still under warrantee, but that is not the point - - what a hassle regardless.  I expected much more from a $60 toaster.  This makes me just want to buy a $10 piece of crap since I would probably get the same quality/lifespan these days."
"We have owned toasters by this brand before and I am not sure if we received a defective one but this is cheaply made, the controls don't work well and it feels like it is going to fall apart very easily.  Not a fan."
Uhm. No. Cheap. China cheap
"Bought this to replace my old toaster, which we loved. We mostly do bagels, but also English muffins and bread. Unfortunately, we find the slots on this toaster slightly too narrow for most bagels.  This means we're cramming them in there, which means stuff like onion, garlic, or whatever is on the bagel gets lodged in the side rails and wires, and constantly burns. The bagels themselves toast fine, it's just that something is ALWAYS burning every time we use it, and it stinks the house up. The controls themselves I find a bit ""loose"" for my liking, and it's ""too easy"" to adjust for different settings, and it always feels like they may just spin on their own. Overall it's not a bad toaster, it DOES toast consistently,  I just wish the slots were wider, and the control knobs had more feel positive settings. I would not buy this particular model again."
"I so wanted to like this toaster. I feel like reviewers on this item are gaslighting several people's experiences. The springloaded handle on one side never worked properly. The toast only popped up part of the way. To say toasting was uneven is an understatement. The two sides were different shades AND on one side, it looked like the toaster printer ran out of toasty ink. Literally it was an ombre from toast brown to bread color. If I am going to pay over $60 for a toaster, if it's not going to dust my baseboards, get me coffee in the morning, and tell me I'm beautiful, it very well should toast my bread to near perfection. I went to a brick and mortar store and bought a toaster for $40 less. Buyer beware."
"Burned fingers, burned or underdone toast, that’s what this toaster is best for. I am surprised by all the great reviews, makes me wonder if I expect too much.In any case here goes…The toast does not come up to the top of the slot when done. It is ALWAYS necessary to stink your fingers in the slot to retrieve your toast or use a fork.You need to unplug it to get your toast out.The slots are not that wide, wide toast or bagels need to be smashed flat before toasting.The control knobs are loose so you can’t be sure where what setting it is on.Sorry I took it out of the box, I am looking forward to it breaking completely so I can justify throwing it away. Junk"
"Flimsy, inconsistent"
When toasting anything in the toaster the top portion of the bread or bagel does not seem to get toasted. Doesn’t matter if you use the bagel setting or not it still is not toasted on the top.
"My main criteria for judging a toaster is the even application of heat over the whole surface, results even toasting. To do this is reasonably easy. As all toasters have a common design (ie. Horizontal heating wires held in place by vertical metal strips) the evenness of the toast is almost totally dependent on all the wires heating up evenly. In addition they should be the same on both the left and right side of each slot for equal toasting of both side. This is easily visible with the toaster in a dark place and On. (No bread). Just look in, and if all the wires are of the approximately the same red/orange glow the heat (toasting) is uniform and evenly distributed. As this is a ""higher end"" toaster I expected that to be the case. Unfortunately it is not. As an example in one slot the left side is 100% even glow and on the right side about 20% of the wires are not glowing at all. It toasts better than my old $25 toaster but not what I expected for this brand. Disappointed"
"Review updated: I called the company just as the instruction booklet told me to. Although I had problems with the toaster, Cuisinart could not do a better job to correct the issue. They have a system worked out so that returns and replacements can be done very quickly and without a lot of hassle. On top of that, the warranty on my unit was good for three years, so I still had almost two years of warranty that the problem could have developed.We bought this toaster in March 2022. After about 8 months the toaster made a loud ""pop"" and after that the left two slots no longer heated up. We didn't use that side very often as it is only used when toasting four slices. Now, when pushing down the handle to start toasting, we have to push it down three or four times before it sticks and begins to toast. Looking inside at the metal strips that heat up for toasting, many of them do not heat up. My wife and I did research and thought we were getting a great toaster.The warranty is for three years and I will check on a replacement from Cuisinart. If it is replaced by the company, I will update this review."
"I truly wanted to like this toaster though should have known better, you definitely get what you pay for& this is worthless. The smell alone when heating it is nauseating (took 6 times of restating to ride the plastic smell). The leaver doesn’t go all the way down easily, you need to push firmly & even then it only went down 3 out of 5 times. As you can see from the over head photos, only random coils are actually in place on the grid & operate when tried on all 6 settings,  making only one side of the toast brown.Also, this is definitely NOT safe to have near young children due to its weight, it tips easily. The cord is short for what’s touted as a safety feature. No way! First off you can’t see the settings once plugged in because the cord is in the front area & needs to face the wall to be plugged in. Ridiculous!!! The ad photo shows the setting indicator with a color wheel arching the knob. NOT SO in person! It’s all black so it’s had to see what number is indicated. I’d return this toast though I don’t drive & the nearest return center is too far to walk. Have placed it out for donation & ordered a different one from Best Buy.Save yourself some time, money & frustration and purchase a name brand toaster."
I didn’t realize how much of a difference my old toaster was until I got this. This toaster is very small but if you are looking for a basic toaster for normal bread this is it. If you like large bagels and croissants this might not be for you. For the price it works but I definitely see the difference between a quality toaster now.
"I really don't like toasters, but I don't have room right now for a toaster oven, so I got this.  It has a very strong release and will pop the toast right out of the toaster if you aren't watching it.  It works for what it is supposed to."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I purchased this toaster because it had a plastic exterior. Our previous toaster had a metal exterior and I was always afraid that the children would burn themselves while taking a piece of toast out. As you can see by my pictures and my video this toaster is designed with the cord positioned in the front-end-side. As it is I would not want my kids using it with the cord sticking out like that. The cord is somewhat heavy duty and very stiff. It fits through the rear guide okay, but because of its stiffness it does not fit through the front guide and then into the rear guide without causing the toaster to become unstable on the counter and to rock back and forth. I believe you can see that in my video. What I did like about it is once I got the toasting level where it should be for us,  lightly toasted, it did a good job. I keep the toaster pushed back and with the cord the way that it is the kids would have to pull the toaster forward to use it. I don't really feel comfortable with it like that. A feature that I do like is; there is a cancel button so that at any time you can stop the toasting process. I haven't used it but I do like that feature. I wanted to try to troubleshoot the cord with the company however that is the design. Their website is about 7 days behind on responding and suggested if it was an Amazon purchase to return it. It's too bad it seems like it could be a nice toaster where it not for the features that I mentioned. The position of the cord is not shown in the photo on the page where I ordered it. I do feel that is defective for my use. And dangerous for my youth."
"Not going to fit a slice of bread normal way, you need to go upright and accept that 1/4 of your bread won’t be toasted or you then can flip it and it will fit once the bread has shrunk a bit from toasting. There is no way this will fit a bagel and the dial marker to see where you are setting it is barely visible, I just felt for the line like braille and set. It does toast, so it’s got that going for it.Long story short, skip this toaster and get something else."
"18"" cord...that comes out the front of toaster. WTH??? You automatically lose 6-8"" turning the cord to the rear.Otherwise, if yer plugs are on the front of your counter, it's a great toaster."
I sent my first one back because one side of the toast was dark the other side lightly toasted. Got the new one and it does the same thing. Decided to keep this one because of the hassle factor and also I like it otherwise. I like the countdown timer.  Now I flip it once for perfect toast. Kind of a first world problem.
"It's usable. Though not efficient. It takes 2-3 attempts to get things to my desired shade. And that's even after putting it on 6 the first time. Sometimes it toasts unevenly so you need to pay attention as it can burn the edges quickly.Other than that, it's a nice looking toaster. The touch buttons work well."
"This 1 star rating is NOT a ""don't buy this toaster"". Probably a very good toaster. it is certainly a very good price.But the slots are too short for me. I buy ""oversized"" bread. Trader Joe's bread is too wide (slots are too short). And Dave's Killer Bread is too wide (slots are too short). Which means that Trader Joe's and Dave's breads just won't fit into this toaster. Which makes it unusable for me. It does not make it a bad toaster.Trader Joe's can be found in 42 states. Dave's Killer Bread can be found in Amazon's Whole Foods as well as Costco and Sam's. Odds are you can buy bread that won't fit into this toaster.Sadly, slot length is not listed for this toaster or any other that I have browsed here at Amazon. Seems like an oversight by manufacturers based on the availability of ""oversized"" bread.I guess I will have to actually go to a store -- with a ruler -- and look for a toaster with slots long enough for my oversized bread. Disappointing."
It doesn't toast evenly - but it's great for the price.
We have had a hard time getting toast the correct darkness we like. It is not the same twice in a row. I like the digital settings I just wish they were accurate.  I wouldn't buy this again.
"Works as it should but the bread slots are small, two silicone feet on the bottom were missing, and the plastic button launches off the entire toaster often."
"This was not very expensive.  The old saying, ""you get what you pay for,"" comes to mind..  The knob popps off.  The toaster works, but it takes a special push to keep the toast down to be toasted.  The knobs may.come come off when pushed or may come off when the toast is ready.  The toast browns fine and everything else works fine."
"It's a very small toaster, very basic. We have an air fryer which has a ""toast"" feature but just wanted a plain toaster. And plain is what we got. You can fit regular white square bread. Bagels get squeezed in there and you'll be missing some toasting in the center of oblong (rye bread) as you need to flip to toast the other end."
Toast bread well but not even a month old and I have to hold the handle down or it just instantly pops up
"As far as toasting goes, it does a good job.  Bad part is that the area between the slots gets hot enough to sizzle water so getting burned is easy.  I don't recommend it if you have children using it without adult supervision.  The sides and bottom do not get hot."
"This is the worst toaster I have ever purchased. Returning it after using it twice. Advertised as having ‘wide slots’, it doesn’t. You could barely squeeze a prepackaged bagel in it, and forget about one from an actual bagel shop. Worse still, only small slices of bread will go all the way down. Larger slices, which are most common nowadays, only get about two-thirds of the way down in the toaster, so you have to toast them partway, then turn them over to toast the other side, which results in them being too light on the sides, and too dark in the middle. The only thing that is true about this toaster’s description is that it is cool touch. I will buy my next toaster in a store, where I can see it first, and not be fooled by inaccurate descriptions."
Toasts ok. It's very small.  Probably give it to someone that doesn't have one
Have to use 4 to 5 to get bearers half way toasted
Small size great for space saving however does not take larger size bread slices
So far so good and it’s been almost two months.
"It's fine, it works, and it's cheap. As long as you don't expect too much it's fine. I wish I read the review that mentioned that Dave's Killer Bread doesn't quite fit because slots aren't long enough (the description boasts ""wide"" slots, but not long ones). I, too, eat Dave's Killer Bread and have to smoosh the bread into the slot, haha! It also toasts unevenly and inconsistently, and something that really bothers me is that the little marker on the knob to mark which number you are turned to is black, just like the knob, so you basically have to feel where it is to turn the knob to the desired number. But all in all it works and it is simple and basic."
Poor quality.
I bought this for the low price and that I don’t use a toaster that often. I don’t imagine it will stand up for  years.
Not fancy one bit. The most basic toaster you could imagine but does the job and super compact. We’ll see how long it lasts
"Slots are wide enough for bagels, but the lift has limited range so getting toasted items out of the toaster is awkward."
"I really like this toaster; however, I bought it for my Camp Trailer when traveling.  Unfortunately, the cord is Soo short, I have to put it On Top of the Box that it came in to plug it in, and it Barely reaches then!"
"A little uneven browning, you have to be careful of your placement of the bread slices.  Fits larger sized slices of bread but not 4 at a time ( unless regular size loaf).  Our cancel button works only sometimes."
"Good product at the price point, however the first few times to use it will definitely smell like burning plastic? Unsure if that was something I did on my end - though I’m unsure how that got messed up - or just the fact that it’s new. Perfect for bread, waffles and bagels, but be wary of the thickness as there is a bit of a restriction for how thick it can be ! The little tray for crumbs is also super nice and easy to access in the back; very easy to use and nice temperature control of which toasted level you want. Got it in black!"
"For the money, this is good. However, the toasting of bread is often uneven."
"Con'sTends to toast one side more than the other.  The button to pop up toast is a little hard to access.  The toaster likes to slide easily on the surface,  so it was necessary to place something under it.Pro's - Very inexpensive.  Does the basics."
"We really liked this toaster until yesterday, when there was a (very) loud SNAP sound. Since then it doesn't do any toasting and there is an acrid burning plastic smell.  Out it goes."
"It works, but not well. It does not provide a nice even toasting, so I always have to flip it and toast it again in order to get it fairly evenly toasted on both sides of the bread. Also, the lever does not lift up while it is toasting if you want to stop it before it is finished. Instead there is a little button low down near the bottom that you have to push to pop it up. However, if you try to push it takes too much force and pushes the toaster itself back, so you are forced to use both hands to pop up your toast before it is automatically popped up. Lastly, it has a very short cord so you have to put it very close to the outlet."
Worst toaster I have ever owned..Should have sent back
"It’s a little small, so you can’t put really thick things in it.  Also, you can expect to run it at least 2x to toast a bagel or muffin."
One side of the bread is way more toasted than the other side.  This toaster is lame.
"Good toaster, very plain function. No bagel settings"
Difficult to see to adjust settings
"This is an ok toaster for us as we don't use often.  Lightweight.  But if I used regularly or several times a day, a heavier duty one would be better."
"I had to update this review. I no longer love it. It's cheap.  Look at the picture.  Its just a bad design because the top of the taster around the openings melted and warped.Original ReviewMore room for toast and buns in the toaster, yet it is smaller and lighter weight.  Love it!"
"he Elite Gourmet ECT1027B Cool Touch Toaster is a budget-friendly appliance designed for basic toasting needs. It features six temperature settings and extra-wide 1.25-inch slots to accommodate various bread types, including bagels and waffles.AMAZONDesign and Features:Temperature Settings: The toaster offers six browning levels, allowing users to customize toast to their preferred crispness.Slot Size: The 1.25-inch wide slots are suitable for toasting thicker bread slices and bagels.Cool Touch Exterior: Designed to remain cool during operation, enhancing safety during use."
"This toaster is good if you're only going to make waffles or regular sized toast. Anything thicker will touch the heating elements and cause a burning smell (bagels, buns) Possible hazard?"
It does the jobs but smells like something burning
Only wonder bread will fit in this toaster. It is not tall enough for rye bread or pumpernickel bread. Just perfectly square ⬜️ bread 🍞. But it does toast well 🙂
"I'm about to give up and just stick a fork in a piece of bread and hold it over my gas range. Like so many others, this toaster does not brown evenly. To get an acceptable brown, it has to be set to number six, but watch it because sometimes it will burn! So I switched it to number five, and it was way too light. Let's get our stuff back into the United States so we can get some quality! It looks nice, and it will fit long slices of bread, or two regular sized pieces of bread, side by side."
Nice toaster for the price but not quite wide enough for bagels
Just a heads up... The power cord is not even 24 inches.I could not find anywhere in the description a cord length.
"The price for this toaster along with it being a cool-touch toaster was the attraction however after using it just once - compared to my old basic toaster (Hamilton Beech) - this toaster's slots are much smaller such that my standard size bread barely fit into the slots (so forget about any bagels), and the heating elements didn't get as red-hot so it took longer to toast bread.I just received it and I'm returning it asap."
Uneven Toasting of bread
"I am sorely disappointed in this toaster. It is the perfect size, smaller footprint. Like the xtra heat setting at the top.  Love seeing the time count down. However I’m finding that I have to re set the timer and re-toast the bread as it does not consistently give the same toasting. It worked for about a week before I noticed that I’d have to re-toast the toast to get it to the same color.  And that means having to watch that it doesn’t burn. If I still had my old toaster I’d return this one. The purpose of purchasing this model was to get consistent toasting. It fails."
"For the price, it's OK that's why I gave it three stars, but it broke in the first use. The thing you pressed down to heat your toast broke off. I ended up returning the product."
"The toaster certainly does toast, but the whole time it smelled like the plastic case was burning or melting"
"Not the best toaster, feels cheap and does not cook evenly. But for basic use, it gets the job done."
"In my opinion, it is cheap looking. But it toasts fine and the crumb tray is useful. I appreciate having the button to stop the toaster ."
The only reason I bought this toaster was because it said it had “extra wide” slots.In fact they are not extra wide. They’re 1/4 inch smaller than the toaster we just replaced that was 15 years old. But it worksUpdate- after 2 months it quit toasting
"Half of the coils don't turn red, burns the top of the bread, I guess you get what you pay for, does work better than the one had so, can't complain too much.  Would buy a better one next time for sure. If I get a years' worth out of this one I'll be happy."
"I bought this toaster for our trailer for camping. It does a really good job toasting, but the lever pops off pretty easy. That is really all that is wrong with it."
Work for a while now it works every now and then
"I like that it was MUCH smaller than my old regular sized toaster,  but it is definitely very basic . It fits regular bagels but not sure if it will fit larger / longer breads or larger bakery bagels. Toasts ok, not evenly all the time, but it works. NOTE: they all seem to be missing two of the rubber grips on the feet. The first one I got was missing 2 so I returned it for another, and the second was also missing 2 of them! The company had nothing to say about it, except to return it because they do not have that part. For the price I’ll probably just find some sticker grips because I need the space and this was the smallest toaster I could find."
Toasts bread unevenly
"crums spill-out and the dial to set the temp or toastiness is so, so hard to see the raised plastic to set it to a temp. I will need to put a nail polish dot so I can see the spot to line up with the desired doneness of the toast."
I thought it would be bigger but it works great for the price! Regular size bread fits well. The longer whole wheat bread needs to be pushed it. Bagels won’t really fit.
"Bought this as cheap toaster to keep at work. So far this toaster works okay, but if you try to toast something thin like a pop tart, or pita bread, be careful because it can get stuck inside the toaster. For  the price it does the job."
"I bought this to replace a toaster that fizzled out. The slots aren't very big. Sourdough bread slices don't fit. It's fine, and I'll keep it, but it's nothing impressive. You get what you pay for. I'll buy a nicer toaster and keep this one as a back up."
"I bought this for our RV, but it didn’t last the 45 day trip. It started smoking last time we used it, so in the garbage it goes!!"
Very short cord
The price was right but the slots are not wide enough so I have to coax the bread in. It also toast well but takes time
"The toaster is great except a piece of rye or pumpernickel bread is too long to fit in the slots.  As far as I can tell, none of the toasters have slots long enough to hold rye or pumpernickel bread."
"I love the design of these toasters but it didn't seem too toast evenly at all. Also the weight was so light it just felt flimsy. This is about the fourth different kind of toaster I've returned and finally settled on a Zwilling, even though it was much more costly. It just was Better Built and toasted better. I was disappointed because I really liked the design of this toaster."
"I like that this toaster is lightweight and small.  It is easy to stash in a cupboard; however, it doesn't always toast evenly, especially when just one slice is put in, one side darker than the other."
"My toast always comes out not toasted (regardless of how long I put it in). Then I put it in for a second, much shorter round to get it to toast, and it comes out burnt (regardless of how long I put it in). You have to keep an eye on it or you’ll be eating burnt bread. That said, it’s a $15 toaster - so you get what you paid for."
This toaster has two large slots that can accomodate slices of homemade bread.  The digital controls are a bit difficult to understand at first but after a few uses it's okay.It seems to toast the bread unevenly though.  One side of the bread will always be cooked more than the other.When I make toast I move the toaster out so it is not directly under the cabinets.  That much heat is not good for the cabinet above the toaster.  The tray that holds the crumbs does not work very well.  I have to clean the counter surface under the toaster to pickup all the crumbs that fall out the bottom.
Works fine - I would spend a little bit more money next time
"Pretty disappointing toaster: if you turn the heat dial (which is as good as invisible on the black model I chose) to 5 out of a possible 6, you might possibly notice some browning (just barely). Also, there should have been 4 rubber feet; mine came with 2 right out of the box. Would not buy again but would invest more money into something of higher quality."
"This thing doesn't cook evenly. One side is burned and the other side barely cooked..It's a toaster, how can you screw that up.But they did. It's cheap and I wish I'd paid more for something that works right."
"Beware! the costco bread slices does not fit, neither bagels. It is a pretty small toaster."
"Good little toaster, except the plug is on the front?"
I should’ve paid closer attention to the measurements of this toaster before I purchased it.  You have to cut the edge off many slices of bread to get them to fit.  I wanted a small one so it wouldn’t take up much counter space but not this small.  It does toast well so that is a plus.
Purchased for guest use during the holidays . At first it mostly only toasted the outer sides of the bread with the insides warm and pale. After 5 uses it stopped working entirely. Would not recommend.
I like this toaster even though I have had oven toasters for the last few yrs. Took a whileTo get used to it.
"The long slots are nice, the warming rack is great, the lights are pretty. The actual toasting started out nice and even, then gradually kept toasting lighter and lighter, even at the highest setting."
"As others have noted, toast is almost always far lighter on one side with toaster set on “toast”."
"Toasted well, but smelled like burning plastic so had to return."
"Not sure why it has toast settings 1 through 4: using those  settings are like not toasting at all.  Toasting is very inconsistent. Never the same twice.  Frequently it makes toast as if the bagel setting is stuck on; cooks only one side, then you have to toast again at which point it burns the outside edges. I tried turning “bagel mode” on then off but that makes no difference.  The amount of toasting across the face of each piece of bread is irregular. Doesn’t seem to matter where in the toast slot you put it.  I am 1 week outside my return window, due to a trip,  otherwise it would be gone.  Having said all that, this is the third brand I have tried.. one big brand 2 lesser known known brands.  Others were largely the same. Apparently modern toasters suck. Previous one  I had for 10 years"
"This 1 star rating is NOT a ""don't buy this toaster"".  Probably a very good toaster.  it is certainly a very good price.But the slots are too short for me.  I buy ""oversized"" bread.  Trader Joe's bread is too wide (slots are too short).  And Dave's Killer Bread is too wide (slots are too short).  Which means that Trader Joe's and Dave's breads just won't fit into this toaster.  Which makes it unusable for me.  It does not make it a bad toaster.Trader Joe's can be found in 42 states.  Dave's Killer Bread can be found in Amazon's Whole Foods as well as Costco and Sam's.  Odds are you can buy bread that won't fit into this toaster.Sadly, slot length is not listed for this toaster or any other that I have browsed here at Amazon. Seems like an oversight by manufacturers based on the availability of ""oversized"" bread.I guess I will have to actually go to a store -- with a ruler -- and look for a toaster with slots long enough for my oversized bread.  Disappointing."
I you like your toast cooked even on both sides do not buy this toaster. Works good for muffin's. I even use to toast burger buns since when set on bagel mode just the inside of the buns toast.
"If you tip the toaster upside down to clear the crumbs, they get stuck in the plastic viewer screen!This shouldn't happen with crumbs getting stuck between the screen. If it's an ongoing issue then let us open up the screen to clean it out.The little crumb door under the toaster is NOT enough to clear the crumbs. The crumbs got stuck between the plastic viewing screen and now you can't even see the screen properly. Also it gets TOO hot when using the toaster. The look is great just NOT enough for a functional toaster. VERY DISAPPOINTING!"
"It’s pretty basic compared to my last toaster, but I like the color in my kitchen and for the price it does just fine. Nothing fancy, but we mainly just do toast or bagels."
"THIS TOASTER WAS GREAT FOR ABOUT A MONTH THEN IT STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS FIRST IT WAS ONLY TOASTING ON ONE SIDE NOW AT LEVEL 1 YOU GET NOTHING, AND IF YOU USE LEVEL 2 THE TOAST IS BLACK I AM PASS THE RETURN DATE SO HAVE TO LOOK FOR A NEW ONE... DONT THROW YOUR BOX AWAY"
Guess you get what you pay for. Toasts bread fine but the crumb tray was not in it
"Been using it for a while, but that slight burning smell doesn’t go away, it’s been like that since I started using it."
"It is small. It is lightweight. It is NOT wide (most of my bagel halves do not fit). There is no easily-visible marker on the knob. It does not evenly toast (as others have mentioned and provided pictures of).All of this was fine to me because it still did the job, but I've discovered that one of the treys is stuck at the bottom (see picture; compare left (not broken) to right (broken). This makes the toaster's sliding ability very difficult (if not impossible), since the right side cannot go down anymore - the right is already stuck at the lowest stage.I definitely feel deceived by the ""EXTRA WIDE"" marketing, but whatever. I'll pound my bagels into bread if I have to (which I do), but I am very disappointed that it broke so soon."
"It's adorable.It makes toast - SMALL pieces of toast - or you have to flip the bread around to finish cooking.No big deal - I mean what do you expect for the money?It's a cutie but if you're looking to make large pieces of toast - you'll have to take that extra step or you'll not like it at all.Did I say it's adorable, lol?"
"It was just delivered so I took it out of the package and tried it out putting two pieces of toast in the toaster pushed it down not quite understanding all the controls and let it toast when it popped up for the first time one side of the bread was toasted the outside of the bread which was closest to the outside of the toaster was not toasted, so I'm willing to give it another shot to see how it does the next time I have toast hopefully I don't have the same issue."
"My toaster of 30 years crapped out, so I had to purchase a new toaster. I read through reviews and this toaster appeared to be a good candidate. I purchased it on July 2nd of this year. It lasted 4 months. The mechanism that allows the toes to go down and then pops it up quit functioning. I reached out to the company via their website through Amazon and spoke with support. They asked me to send a video of the issue, which I did. They then told me they couldn't watch the video and would I resend it. I indicated the video is going to be the same video maybe the issue is on your end, and I never heard from them again. I notified them prior to this review that I would be leaving it. I then went to Walmart and bought a Cuisinart. I guess you get what you pay for."
Made great toast but the crumb tray doesn’t catch all the crumbs and there was constantly crumbs all over our counter after each use.
"What do you want, it was cheap! It toasts one side, the unit set off this weird plastic smell and has the worlds shortest cord"
The toaster works great but will not accept large bread such as pepperidge farms bread.
"My daughter has this same toaster and we liked it when we used it at our recent visit.  Our 15 year old toaster was no longer working right so we decided to upgrade to this toaster.  We liked the increments of adjusting the level of toasting as it has several clicks between setting that really helps customize toasting.  Unfortunately, and when toasting bagels it toasts both sides.  Previous toasters we've had when using the ""bagel"" button toasts one side only.  Also, it seems that not all the heat wires work either.  Figured if we just did an exchange we might get one that worked, but discovered the issues too late. (by weeks)."
"This toaster was great for a couple months. It is nice looking, and I love that the outside doesn't get hot when in use. 2.5 was the perfect setting for toast.But..... it was Purchased in mid September it is now mid Dec  (3 months) toaster will not engage. We are an occasional toast making family so it has definitely not been worn out.  I am very upset with my purchase...  live and learn."
"So this is the SECOND same product toaster I've received.Neither color is as advertised. (Green (""sage"" cough bs) was better for my decor than the (way brighter than shown) blue one i ordered initially,  but still not right, anyway...The cord FOR SOME REASON is in the FRONT CORNER of the toaster making it NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE to plug in unless it's directly in front of an outlet.Sigh..."
"It's a toaster... it works fine. I like my toast pretty toasted, but not black. This on max gets nowhere near what I consider toastes. I push it down for another 1/2 cycle and get the end result I want but I feel like this should be simple like a toaster."
"It's cute and it's safer than the one my granny had, however, it doesn't toast super evently. The bottom portions get crispier and one side gets crispier. I remedy this but toasting for have the time and then rotating the slices. It works, but I would not buy again."
I bought this model specifically for the bagel model and the heating coils still come on toasting the outside of the bread. It looks very nice and works out side of this function.
Color is nice. It burns your toast after #3. The cord is extremely short. Have to push toast very close to the wall.
"It's a decent toaster, but the material listed reads only ""stainless steel."" That's the reason I bought it. When it arrived, I found that it's actually made from a rather flimsy, lightweight and soft plastic, not stainless steel. Only the silver metal parts in the photo are made from steel. That needs to be listed in the product description."
Gave away as gift as I went and brought myself a better one
"It works well. But not deep enough.  In order to toast since I buy free form bread you have to toast hald of the slice of bread and turn it over to toast the other half, or cut the slice in half to toast it at the same time. More work for me😜"
"I did way too much research trying to find a double toaster that wasn’t huge, landed on this one. It looks nice and the price was right but I’m not impressed with how it functions. It takes soooo long to toast. At least double the time of my old single black and decker. Additionally, the buttons appear to be just for show, they don’t make any difference when doing a bagel or something frozen."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It’s a cute toaster but regular slices of bread don’t fit in the slots. You have to force the slices in and push them down after lowering the lever. It also toasts unevenly but that seems to be improving with use.
I will be surprised if it last 6 months.
"Toasts well, but bagel setting doesn’t work."
When I put frozen bread to toast the top part of one one side doesn’t toast right. I’ve not bothered to send it back so it’s not too bad. I just wouldn’t buy it again. I've never tried the other setting.
The toaster is pretty and is good for toasting small bread. To toast rye I had to flip the slice around to toast both ends. I only used the lowest setting because the middle setting burned bread. Not the right toaster for me.
"It's toasts bread like any basic toaster.Would I buy again, no. S ive done before I'd flip a coin for any of the other toaters built in  same factory with different labels  and yada yada ads.Please do recycle."
"Lightweight and small, but you get what you pay for.  Bagel function doesn’t work.  All toasting needs to be carefully watched and turned!  Just missed the return window or this would have been returned!Buyer beware, the positive reviews cannot be accurate….."
Seduced by the color.  But very cheap plastic.  What a quality comedown from my old Oster.  Disappointed!
The toaster was great until it just quit working one day after 1.5 years.  It wasn't a huge expense but still kind of disappointing.  I live alone and am the only one who uses it so it doesn't get a lot of use.  I did really like to look and color of it and it worked just fine for a bit.
Might as well kept the old one one side light one side dark cheap though
It is my fault that I should have actually looked up to see if they had more choices as there are no pastry or any kind of button it is basically toast and bagels and that is it.It looks nice but it still doesn't evenly toast there are some spots that are not as toasted as the others
"Seems a little “tinny” with sharp edges. Works OK, but doesn’t toast evenly."
"Bought this because of all the great reviews and the price.  We love the color, but as a toaster, it fails.  Maybe we just got a bad one.  First, it does not fit a lot of bread or bagels.  I make all our own bread and the bread is normal size, but this can not fit a whole piece and a quarter of it sticks out.  If you cut it in half, the slices are down in there and hard to get out.  Second, it does not toast both sides evenly.  You have to pop it up, turn it around and do the other side.  Sometimes the already done side gets burnt.  We've tried different settings with no better result.  Finally, our daughter likes bagels and most of her bagels do not fit in.  I'm past the return date, so we'll just have to accept this as a sunk cost."
"When I got my order, there are a couple of broken pieces at the bottom of my box. I’d looked at the toaster and could not figure out where they were. Inside one of the slice deposits was not connected. It took me about 20 minutes to reconnect it. All in all it’s OK."
"Color, has different toasting features"
I like the toaster. Its compact and fits in bottom cabinets. With the exception that my bagel almost burned at 3. The wires and backing inside the toaster burned. I kept the toaster and just press the bagel to thinen it.
The quality not as expected.
"The toaster works okay, but slots must be longer for multigrain bread.  I have to squeeze the slices down into the slots. Because I do not use the toaster often, I believe it is past the return date."
Toasting slots too small
"I was looking for a quick toast toaster. This might have been even slower than my generic Walmart toaster I had before for ten bucks! Looks pretty, I guess, but not at all what I was hoping for."
"I have yet to have BOTH SIDES toast the same!  I tried bread and English Muffins and one side gets toasted right and the other side of it is CHARRED!IT would be nice  to have markings of where is med. and where is darker.  THE names on the tabs. are hard for anyone with any vision problem to read (small print).BUT mostly--I want evenly toasted bread and I am not getting it from this toaster. Due to health problems We couldn't return it on time.  I would IF I COULD!  I think I got the bad one of the bunch!Company's warranty company sent request FOUR (4) times for receipt and I had sent what I thought was a receipt  AND tag on bottom of toaster among 3 other pictures-----and NEVER ONCE told me I was sending the wrong receipt to them.  I didn't know about the pale white print where you can get invoice with price/taxes.  (Have vision problems with light colored, low contrast print.).  FINALLY I used the 800 # and got (amazingly) a person with NO accent and she explained (not really friendly) what they wanted!  NOW I'm waiting again to hear from them.  UPDATE: after settling about the ""receipt"" meaning  to them INVOICE------11/02/2023--within ONE DAY of my sending  the last in the series of requests (a picture of the cord cut off the toaster)  they replied and say the refund is in the mail!!  SO that IS GOOD!!"
In all the photos it look aqua blue.  But it’s actually more mint green.  Doesn’t match my other decor.  Bummer.
"It does the job but it's like 1/4"" short so that I have to push the bread down each use.  Really poor detail and makes the thing a dud and set to be replaced after just 3 months.  Price was right, it works in all the modes and looks good.  If the slot was just that little longer it would be 5* but like this it's a very poor 3* for me."
"The slots were to ""short"" to take a normal piece of bread. They were "" wide"" enough but a normal piece of bread would have to be trimmed to fit length wiseWho designs these things?Also tired of everything I order these days is "" MADE IN CHINA"". Wish Amazon would put the actual of country products are made in in their descriptions. Not just "" imported""."
Must use with caution. This toaster gets very hot fast.  I used on the lowest setting # 1 the toast popped up as it should and did not burn. I would not leave it unattended until your sure its safe. There's a warning in the manual saying not to set on certain counter tops as they could discolor .  Still not sure about this purchase
One side won’t stay down after 2 months and it worked fine until then
"Lots of crumbs from bottom , not sure wht"
"I purchased this for my mother for her birthday.  She's a simple woman going through chemo and other cancer treatments and often survives on peanut butter toast.  She had needed a new toaster but wanted to wait it out,  when she gave me the go ahead to get her a toaster I decided to gift her one for her birthday instead as she NEVER wants or needs anything so gift giving to her is difficult.The one I really wanted from a big box store was out of stock so this was my fall back.  The running joke would be that ""Bella made her toast""... as her grand daighters name is Bella.This arrived and she giggled when she opened it but we were both soon disapponted in the quality though she tried not to show it, I could tell.  Her concern is that her partner would not be so kind and he would break it in a heartbeat.This is great in a pinch if you don't make today often though there are cheaper ($$)Products on the market.Will be returning this for something far sturdier as my mother's toaster is nearing 20 years old and this might last 2."
all plastic but it does toast
Love this toaster for the color red & how compact it is. Easy to use.  Its just a tad too small.  Have to shove bread in (all bread types) or cut the sides before putting in. :(
"It toasts. I’ve had this toaster for 8 months now. I came back here to see other reviews after the fact and I guess I’m not alone. After about a month of having it, we started turning up the dial to get the desired color and it still has a mind of its own. Sometimes it burns, sometimes you can’t get color unless you toast it twice; then it’s too dark. The bagel function has never worked. I have never tried the frozen function TBH. So no review on that. And I don’t even know what a gluten free setting is supposed to do that is so different from the other buttons, so I never messed with it either.All in all, it was a good price and held a lot of promise but sadly, it just toasts inconsistently and I am looking for a better quality one now. I don’t really recommend unless you just want something to maybe color your toast and don’t want to do it in an oven."
This says extra wide slots but I can't even fit Franz bread in there. Get a different toaster.
"I loved the vintage look of this toaster. I was skeptical because the price was so low. I should have paid attention to my instincts.The toaster is a pretty vintage color, and it's a good size for bagels. That's all it has going for it. It stopped working a few weeks after I received it. The slots are thick for bagels, but I couldn't fit your average loaf of heartier sliced bread into it. So if you eat cheap white bread you'll be okay. The silver parts on this toaster started peeling where the toast goes in.I contacted the company because both this product and another one were malfunctioning. When I heard back from them I got a long list of all the stuff I would need to do to get help with the issues. I don't know if it would of been a refund or a replacement. It wasn't worth the headache! I can't recommend this company. I'm really bummed because their stuff matched my kitchen."
I end up buying cheap toasters often but now I should probably spend more and buy a good one. I have to stop mid way and flip the bread to get a even toasting. That was the whole reason I got rid of the last one. I guess a few seconds out of my life won't kill me to flip toast over. 1st world problems.😁
Cheaply made cheap price. Kinda small but it toasts so who cares
"This is the second toaster I have attempted to purchase on Amazon. I did not think I would need to measure my bread before buying a toaster. If you toast bread that looks similar to what is shown in the photos, you will need to put it in lengthwise to fit this toaster and then the mechanism does not retract enough to toast the entire slice so it will need to be toasted twice. This is, otherwise, a nice looking toaster and seems to heat OK.The opening on this toaster measured barely 5"" in length. This information is nowhere in the specs and is mischaracterized in the ""answered questions"" as 5-1/4"" which I did not see until after the purchase. I did not think I would need to measure the bread but the slices we needed to toast were 5-3/8"" wide. This is a common size for bread slices from a supermarket. In my view, this is a design flaw that limits the types and size of bread that can be toasted in it. This will work fine if you only toast Wonder bread or similar sized items such as English muffins, bagels, etc.We ended up returning this toaster also. We finally went to a ""brick and mortar"" store to buy a toaster in which this bread will fit. In this case, a Toastmaster."
Cooks how it wants to. Not very big
very lightweight-not impressed-will see how it holds up
What I didn't like the fact that it's brand new just took it out of the box went to toast 2 slices of bread and the knob you pull down to start toasting would not stay down.  So there is no way to make the bread into toast. This really upsets me as it had never been used. What good is buying and from out of the box it does not work. I pulled a video on YouTube and the guy showed things to try to get the switch to stay down none worked. Then he said as a last attempt you have to open the toasters runs into removing the items blocking the part. I don't like having to go to this extreme to get the toaster to maybe work or to realize you have return or pay someone to repair it. Now I have the matching can opener and a non working toaster. This is rediculous. They are lucky to get a one star I would give it no stars.? Also no special screw driver included to try to getting a brand new toaster to work. Bella should be ashamed . Apparently it's has a bad review on you tube. Enough to make videos on how to try to do there job rght.
"I ordered Blue and the company sent me the wrong color (Aqua).It’s very cheap feeling. The whole case is plastic.  For the price, it’s not bad. But it definitely feels like what it cost (I.e. cheap!)"
"I bought this toaster specifically for toasting bagels for my son after our old toaster (a Black and Decker we had for almost 16 years) started having heater coil issues. The old toaster had a bagel button as well, which fully toasted the inside of the two sides of the bagle, while lightly toasting the outsides. We normally used a setting of 4 out of 6 for the old toaster with the bagel setting (dark brown, but not blackened), just to give you an idea of how crunchy he likes his bagels. This allowed for us to hold the bagels in hand without it being too hot to handle.This toaster however is super hot no matter what button you press. I tested it with and without the bagel button pressed, and it toasted both sides the exact same amount, which means holding it in hand to spread anything on top is impossible.I called the customer service number that Amazon has on here today (Friday) and spoke with someone that basically stated that the button doesn't really change anythingfor the heating settings and that it's probably set up for frozen bagels (even though this toaster also has a Frozen button), but she'd have a manager call me back after the weekend to speak with me about it because she didn't know anything about this model (wtf?).If this is how it's supposed to function (which is to say the buttons don't do anything) I'll be returning this. Currently giving a 1 star rating. Will update after I hear back (or don't) from the manager at the company on Monday (supposedly) depending on what happens."
Quality wasn’t what i had expected.  Color is nice but product seems flimsy and may have to replace after a year of use.
"Went to use this first time today stinks so bad only had the toast in it for barely 30 seconds before I had to shut it down pull it out and I’m refunding this thing. Oh and bad design 2 skinny crumb catchers don’t even cover the slices, go figure!"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I got this toaster a few weeks before I moved in with my girlfriend, specifically because we wanted a toaster that we could use at the same time if needed in the morning when we go off to work. Our first morning here my girlfriend used the right side of the toaster and said it worked great. This morning was my first time using the left side, and I discovered that it doesn’t work. The panels on the inside are glued down on the right, but not the left and the lever also does not stay down on the left side. We are very disappointed as we like the look of the toaster and were looking forward to having a nicer, bigger one that I had at my last apartment only to find it doesn’t change much for us. I decided to give two stars instead of one because the right side works great and it would be a great toaster if the left side was assembled properly. In theory, we can use one side of the toaster and make it work, but not having both sides working defeats the purpose of why we got the toaster in the first place."
"This toaster is Ok. It does the job. However it does not toast both sides of the bread evenly. The biggest problem  for me is that the slots  could be longer. If I have a large piece of artisan bread it does not fit. I have to put it in vertically, then put the other end in briefly and watch that it doesn’t burn. For regular sized bread it fits fine."
"We bought this after our Bella toaster died around the 6 year mark. We’ve had this toaster now for about 9 months. It looks nice on the counter, doesn’t get hot but the toast is very inconsistent. Say you put the toast in at 1, it pops out just warm not toasted so you go for another round on 1, now it’s over toasted. Okay next toast goes in at 1, this one is perfect, next one burnt. All at the same setting. I understand that now it’s warmed up but I’ve owned a lot of toasters over the years and never had one that was so inconsistent! Well keep playing the toast roulette till it dies but won’t be back for another Bella."
Cute little toaster but arrived damaged the metal is all jacked up and not straight
"This works fine for regular size ""wonder"" type bread, but if you eat the longer slices it's about 1/4"" to short and you have to either wedge it in at an angle and then watch it so it doesn't burn or don't bur the larger loaves. I wish I had caught that fact before I used it because it's really annoying"
"The Bella toaster is a very attractive addition to our kitchen counter. We couldn't wait to try it out. We toasted two slices of whole wheat bread (set at 3). The toast was very uneven, and the interior of the bread was so dried out it was like eating Holland Rusk. We tried again with white bread and the results were the same. Uneven and dried out. We returned Bella to Amazon."
"I don't like how the openings are so small, it does not fit all normal bread from Costco.. I have to cut off parts of the bread... frustrating.. Sometimes it works great - tomorrow it may only toast a portion of the bread..  I just want a toaster that holds normal bread not tiny loaves."
I like the color of the toaster it was not designed too well though the plug is upFront and has to go under toaster towards back to plug it in. It should be in the back like my old one. Not sure about the settings either not marked on knobs of the time.
I guess I got what I paid for
Toasts well but it is orangey red in color.
"I purchased this with bagels and toast in mind, it works well for bagels and frozen items but the slots are weirdly short and don’t fit a lot of bread that’s slightly larger, like Oroweat potato bread. I’ve never had this problem with my past toasters"
"Liked the design and features, but the slide to pull the bread into the toaster stopped hooking in - wouldn't stay down to toast. The toasting part works, but we have to hold it down for it to work. Unfortunately, it's too late for me to return. Seems like it would be an easy fix, but who repairs toasters anymore?"
"I bought this mostly because of the color, but was disappointed. The blue part is plastic and looks cheap.The toaster works fine, but the toast slots are about 1/8” too short for the bread we toast most.Would not recommend."
The line on the temperature dial is the same color as the dial. It's very hard to read plus the numbers are partly blocked by the dial. Regular size bread (like Brownberry) barely fits into the slot which is too short in length.
"I got the impression from the pictures it was going to be a shiny plastic, imitating metal - it is not. It's more of a matte finish.I still need a toaster, so I'm keeping it, but it's not what I wanted."
Very light weight.
I like the simple features and aqua color but the plastic and metal is so thin and cheap on this toaster; How can things go so down in only twenty years when I last purchased a toaster!
Everything about the product is OK. It has one obvious flaw: slot is too short- Italian bread slices fit poorly; slot is not deep enough- whole grain bread slice is 1 inch too tall. Liked my Keenstone better.
"It's a really nice-looking toaster, but unfortunately it doesn't have slots long enough for the bread we use.  You have to cut about a half an inch off one end of the bread to get it to fit inside.  I can do this, I'm just not sure I want to.  I toasted one piece of bread, got a nice even brown on one side, but it was much lighter on the other side.  Toasters only have to do one thing, so it surprises me they don't do a better, more consistent job of it.  The slots for toasting and a piece on one end are stainless steel, but I think the rest is plastic."
"It was affordable and I needed one for my work. First of all, not all bread fits in it, even just normal sized bread.Then, it doesn’t toast evenly. I provided pictures of both sides of my bread on about level 4.Next time I’ll be spending a little more for better quality. So disappointed."
It toasts just fine. But it is more narrow than the  slices of bread. So the end of the bread has to be cut off in order to fit into this toaster.
"At first I liked the quality and the color but then less than three months after getting the toaster, one side completely stopped working. I think that is ridiculous that something would last for only 3 months. I decided to go for a replacement but this is one of those items you have to contact the manufacturer for instead of amazon. It took them a bit to get back to me, at which time I opted not to replace the toaster because I was expecting a replacement. When they finally responded to my request They had me take a video of the issue, a picture of the sticker, I had to provide the receipt and a description of the issue. I did that but then they kept responding saying they still needed the sticker picture but that was included. I had to keep resending it in. Eventually they verified they got the picture and proceeded to tell me they didn’t have it in stock so I would have to get a refund which would be issued via check and only once I cut the cord to the toaster and took a picture and sent it to them. They claimed it was for safety purposes but I wasn’t born yesterday and I know it’s because they don’t want you using it after you get a refund. They already know it doesn’t work since I sent a video of it NOT WORKING. I had to buy a new toaster before cutting the cord. Now I am waiting for them to tell me to hop on one foot while patting my head and rubbing my tummy before I can get a refund."
So my kitchen is red red coffee pot red bread box red designs and I saw this awesome red for ice toaster that my husband would love for our kitchen he loves toast get it and it comes with a big chip in the plastic and it's disheartening because I threw away our old toaster so I have to keep this one that's chipped because then we won't have a toaster very disappointed very sad for the money I spent on this item I wouldn't recommend it.
I bought this because of the great reviews but didn't do my homework. There is no crump empty tray. I have never bought a toaster without one before??? And although it can take a thick slice of bread if you have a loaf that is wide like many now it won't fit. I have to push my slices down into the toaster. Not a happy camper with this toaster but will use it untill I can convince myself the irritation is worth buying a new one. UGH!!
Only toast half of the bottom of my toast while the other half is untouched. At least it didn’t burn my toast like the previous one. Universe please send me a good toaster soon.
"This toaster is cute. Love the color, what I don't love is the huge crumb mess it leaves on the counter every time you use it. Almost like it's missing something but everything seems to be there. I get up to a lovely mess every day so not overly impressed"
After a few months the lever on one side  wont stay down. And takes too long to toast and only one side works. Wouldn't buy this brand again.
"The toaster itself works well, but idk where this plastic piece came from. I assume it's what has been causing the plastic burning smell I assumed was just breaking in a new toaster and I'm now out of my return window plus its been used a decent chunk xD"
"I really like the color and the stay cool outer case. It toasted ok when it first arrived, but after 2 weeks I had to keep turning up the dial to get the desired toasting level.The slots on the toaster are wide and can accommodate thick pieces of bread or bagles, that is a plus. The frozen button works ok, again had to turn up the dial.I will keep the toaster,  but you may want to spend a few more dollars and get a name brand."
I ordered a blue toaster and got a white one instead. It's just a cheap toaster so I am keeping the white one. Kind of bummed about it.
"Why on earth does the plug come from the front end of the toaster? Are we suppose to be using it from the side? The back? Horrible placement. Impossible to hide.Overall it feels very cheap? Like thin? I don’t know how else to describe it. I just used it for the first time and it toasted fine, but according to reviews that may change so I’ll mark my calendar for 25 days and send it back if it starts acting up I guess."
"Every time we use this toaster in my office, it sets off the smoke detector. We now open doors and windows (even in 20 degree weather) whenever we use it."
"The lever doesn’t want to lock at the bottom and the toast just pops up.. after messing with it for a minute I can get it to lock, but it takes a while. Very inconvenient but I feel like I just got a defect."
"I love how it looks and the multiple compartments. It toasts everything and all that jam. But it does have an odd plastic burning smell? The same smell a glue gun has. I'm hoping that is just a ""newly used"" smell. I will update. The smell doesn't even last long, I smell a bunch a yummy toast soon after it starts.UpdateIt's been several months and the smell has faded away over time. I'd say after a month of using the smell has thankfully passed."
Buttons are janky and it smells bad when you first turn it on. Only has rubber stoppers on 2 feet so it doesn't sit flat.
The slots are too short to fit slices bigger than a small square.
"This toaster is dangerous!!!! It caught fire and exploded into a ball of flame and the entire toaster burnt down to the metal pan.  I had purchased it on Aug. 1, 2024 but didn't get a chance to use it very much. My kitchen is small so I placed the toaster to the left of the stove but would often move it to the glass top stove in order to use the vent. I didn't turn on the vent but put 2 thin English muffins into the slots and pressed the lever down and went to the bedroom to retrieve an item.  Within 5 minutes I heard a whoosh and there was a ball of flame engulfing the toaster.  The fire was so intense that it destroyed the vent, burnt part of the butcher block, and scorched the stove.  The fire department had to be called!  But, look at 2 other reviews.  One from the 25th of September and I believe one from the 5th. These people had fire hazard concerns about this toaster within about a month!!! NOT Acceptable"
Works but wont fit some bread I would have expected it to.
"We got this little guy because we don't have a lot of counterspace. The upside is that it is compact and light-weight. The downside is that it's pretty poor quality. The heating elements are completely inconsistent; one side of the bread will be nearly burnt, while the other side if toasted to a normal color. Not upset about it for the price, but I certainly wouldn't purchase it again."
"Well, I would go to her for one because it’s the color of my kitchen two it was a for slicer. It says I ordered it or I received it December 24 as of February 7 one of the two sides no longer stays down to toast toast you have to hold it down not even two months old and I already have issues with it, but of course the return part is over with I understand, but I think the product should’ve lasted longer than that."
"This thing sux. On the lowest setting it either burns my toast or doesn’t toast and in the same amount of time which is very odd. The only good thing is that it looks nice. I’m gonna have to throw it away and buy one that works. In attached pictures it’s the same piece of toast, one side is darker than the other, it never toasts evenly."
"It sure is pretty, but the working quality isn't great. The BAGEL button DOES NOT WORK!! It toast both sides of the bun or bagel equally, so it doesn't matter of you put them in facing eachother or not. I bought this toaster because of the Bagel toasting feature, it's a 4 slicer, and the color. I bought another one to see if it was just this one and it did the same thing. Unfortunately it was passed the date for me to return the 1st one, but I did return the second one.Also, when it's set to 3, the toast is almost burnt, but 2 is not really even golden brown. 4 is burnt, I haven't tried any number passed that.I'm really bummed. I used to have a toaster before my house fire that had the ""Bagel"" button and it was so great to use for not only bagels, but hamburger buns, that way I didn't need to broil or use a pan to toast them."
I was disappointed in the size.
I bought this a few months ago.  Worked well until yesterday.  It smells like burning plastic.  I cleaned it throughly and the smell was worse.  A shame because it was a great toaster initially.
"This was pretty disappointing, as once again it illustrated just how products are racing to see how cheaply they can possibly make them, while giving the illusion of a quality product.I got this to replace an old, but good, toaster. It wasn't the old heavy duty metal types, though it was metal. But just a boxy basic toaster maybe 20 years old. Worked fine. Toasted fairly well, and popped the toast up so you could grab it. Couldn't complain.But decided I wanted one that could do English Muffins and Bagels, so chose this model.As I say, it's disappointing.1. Heating elements are visibly uneven, very hot in some spots while not in others, and uneven between sides.2. Controls are confusing. There's three buttons for different functions, and takes a bit to memorize them as mine is in a fairly dark spot where I can't get close to read what the buttons are. (and it's hard to see anyway.)You have to push one button to do bagels/english muffins.Another pops up the toast, and I'm not even sure what the third one does.3. Toasts unevenly.4. Worst of all, when it pops the toast/bagel/english muffin up when done, it pops it up and then goes back down so that you can't even grab the item to pull it out of the toaster! You have to use two hands and physically push up on the level to raise the thing just a bit and then there's barely enough of it sticking above the top to grab onto and pull it out. This is maddening and a bad flaw. I guess it keeps the stuff in the toaster to stay warm, but would prefer if it pushed toast up an inch or two so you could actually grab it."
"I had high hopes for this model based on feedback but it will not toast an english muffin completely with one pass on the highest setting, ditto bagels. Frustrating."
"this said it was a update of the last one i loved. just got this 10 days ago, turns out for some unknown reason they put the cord leading out the FRONT. This makes the cord 6 inches shorter from where you need it and its always in the way.  maybe they put the bottom on backwards?  ive never seen a toaster with a cord coming out the front before. id love to have someone explain the why of this to me!"
Looks like some of the coils don't work. Shade settings don't make any changes .
Gets the job done
"I received the product and right away I set it up outside in order to run it a couple of times to get rid of the chemical smells before really using it.  Once I did that I set it up where my old toaster was, looks good, a little cheap in the material but ok.  I also don't like that it doesn't have a removable tray to clean, it's only a flip door that's attached so you'll need to walk it over to the trash each time you clean it.  It's not heavy at all so it feels like a toy.  Day 2 of usage and the spring does not really work.  I tried canceling a toast and it got stuck, I had to pull the bread out and then the mechanism sprung.  If you are a patient and careful individual who treats things with care it might last you 2 years but, if you have teenagers (like I do), good luck! I don't think it will last 6 months but I'll come back and update my review if it does."
"I tried toasting spelt sourdough, its thinly sliced.. will not work with thin slices"
"I replaced a toaster that had a bad section in the heating elements. But it would toast at about half the speed of this one. And I had to turn the heat range knob to about halfway. Still takes a long time to toast. It works, just not very fast."
Toaster was fine when purchased but less than 2 months old and the toast won't pop up when finished. You can feel the handle scraping and catching when you push it down and when you use it to pop the finished toast up. Sent message to manufacturer with the issue and waiting for response.
"I don’t want the hassle of returning a toaster after three weeks of use, but we’ll be getting a different one. This toaster gets way too hot. Our toast was actually smoking on setting 3, goodness knows what setting 7 is for. Setting 2 will also cause black toast now. We have to use setting 1 for everything. Ranges 2-7 should not burn everything to black (and yes, this includes bagels and waffles we’ve tried so isn’t just thin bread being an issue)."
It does the job but tends to toast unevenly.
Crap only toasts one side of toast!  You have to torn it around and toast again. Stupid
"This toaster is fairly small compared to many other toasters, which is why I wanted this one. It is not so wide, for one thing. It can hold thick sliced of bread or bagels  but not bread slices that are longer than usual. The slots are wide but not long. The slots also closed in on the pieces of bread if they are slim, so they don't just flop around in there. So that's good. The lever that you push down to start toasting can also lift up the bread just enough to be able to grab it, so that helps.My one complaint is that it heats very unevenly  enough that I plan to contact the company to see if anything can be done. I can't return it at this point because I'm outside of that window now. But it bothers me enough that I want to get a hold of s different one that heats more evenly (doesn't have to be perfect, just better than this one. One side barely toasts at all.) Also I do wish the slots were longer to fit longer slices of bread."
"The only explanation for this toaster having such a high rating must be that people reviewed it too soon after buying it.  I, too, was somewhat pleased when I purchased it in March, 2024.  I was somewhat disappointed at first that it didn't have a digital countdown so I knew how close to being done my toast/bagel was, but I at least thought I had a durable product...based on the positive reviews.However, it didn't take long for my pleasure to disappear.  I could even tell by pure observation that the heating elements on the outside of each slot were losing their effectiveness, and the end product proved this...at full power meant for frozen goods, an ordinary piece of bread would come out normally toasted with the other side hardly touched.  By all accounts, both sides should have been burned to a crisp.So my journey continues for another new toaster, and it won't lead me here!!!!"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I don’t know what’s going on with toasters these days. This is the second one that doesn’t toast both sides pictures show both sides of bread and elements in toaster elements on inside a toaster get redder than outsideIt’s like it’s stuck on permanent BagelTo its credit this Hamilton beach felt very solid when I pressed the button down to start the toasterThe darkness knob also felt very solid compared to the last name brand toaster that I bought in the same price range, but so what if it doesn’t toast what’s the point?Only three stars for value for the money because it doesn’t matter how much it cost. If it doesn’t toast I’ve ordered a $200 toaster now and we’ll see what that does because all these $20-$30 range toasters are the same they don’t toast."
"Was hoping to like this toaster but had to return, one side didn’t work & the other side only toasted half of slice. Looks great and was happy with that, too bad had to return"
"I’m sure the toaster probably works fine. I didn’t use it because it’s too cheap and flimsy. I’m afraid it will break lowering the handle to toast. It’s like thick aluminum foil.  The toaster I bought for $5 15 years ago is solid and sturdy. I think the bottoms are cute, so I thought I would upgrade.  I’m keeping my old and faithful"
"I know this was in expensive, but still / uneven toasting and setting 1: barely toast, setting 2+: burn to a crisp. Have to watch to get the right toast - not recommended."
I do like the way this toasts but unfortunately one of the slots broke in less than 3 months. It still toasts but won’t pop the bread out. Not a huge deal - but my kids need a fork to pull out their toast or bagel now and I’m not a huge fan of that.
"The spring was weak, making it hard to get the toast out of the toaster.2nd. Bad design, who puts the power cord in the front of the toaster, where the controls are.I never seen an kitchen appliance when the power cord is in the front.  Most people try to hide power cords, especially if you have small children you certainly wouldn't want this one."
"Burns, the edges and the middle is uncooked. I tried this in both slots with more than one bread product. It’s being returned."
"It’s $27….so we didn’t expect much to be honest. The first few months it worked great but then the heating elements started going toasting things unevenly. That started around month 4, then some sides would heat, others wouldn’t. By month 6 it would either burn stuff or just not heat at all. If your looking for something cheap that wouldn’t be used much this should be ok, but it’s not for a family of 4 who uses it about once a day."
"I've never seen an appliance, especially a counter top one, have the plug in the front. The plug is always in the back so it's a shorter distance to the plug, not in the way, doesn't get snagged, and doesn't go under the appliance. With the plug in the front, someone might want to run it under the toaster to get it out of the way. Toasters get hot under them and this could be a fire hazard."
"I saw the amount of reviews and thought, this is a good brand with plenty of positive reviews, so it must be a good toaster. Well, it's not.It looks cool, and it does work. However:1- The pushdown mechanism is flimsy and works selectively. sometimes it engages, sometimes it doesn't.2- There is no indicator light telling you if the toaster is on or not.3- The toaster is very lightweight, so when you push down on the leaver (and you push hard because you want it to engage) the toaster will flip, sending your bread across the kitchen.This was a bad purchase, and I regret getting it."
"Broken, bottom of toaster stays open"
"Compared with an ideal toaster it's mediocre. Although good enough for us. It toasts unevenly and the second toast, after it's hot already, tends to burn a little. We are just waiting for it to break in order to buy something better. After some time we tried the bagel feature and discovered it's M.I.A."
"Hamilton Beach is supposed to be a good brand name and toasters have been built for decades so it shouldn't be difficult to manufacture one that works out of the box reliably, but perhaps Hamilton Beach is having some spotty quality issues as of late and some more recent reviews seem to reflect this.I typically use a toaster to toast sliced bagels. This toaster has wide slots and easily fit the bagel halves I put in. The problem encountered consistently the 3 to 4 times I tried, was when the toast cycle completed is that I would hear the toaster click to release the mechanism, but the mechanism and the bagel remained in the down position. To get the mechanism to raise I had to use the lever, but to do so required an amount force that I'm surprised something in the toaster didn't break. At a guess, I'm thinking it's something to do with the mechanism that closes to center the bagel position hanging up when it attempts to raise and open up. To the toasters credit, it toasted the bagel to my liking with a setting on 4.If you recently bought of these I suggest trying a bagel to ensure the toaster functions the way it should.This toaster is being returned for a refund. The Cuisinart toaster we previously had lasted 5 years until a heater winding burned out, it is still available on Amazon, and that will replace this Hamilton Beach."
This toaster is no better or no worse than others we found here. Is there a toaster that toasts evenly? I haven't found one.
"Toasters are not big ticket items and you get what you pay for. This is the second toaster in 1 year. The other one I purchased had the center between the two slots collapse. This one toasts VERY unevenly. Also the darkness setting are not reliable. If you toast a second or third time in a row the toast gets darker and darker until they burn. I suspect it is because once the heating elements are hot the toast quicker and the settings are no longer reliable. Will I send it back? No, for $30.00 I can live with it now that I know how it works.. Would I buy it again, NO."
"Man, this toaster didn't even last half a year! It was always pretty fiddly when using the plunger to depress the bread. Sometimes it wouldn't stay down, and you'd have to do it again to make it ""stick."" Then yesterday, the inner metal part that hold the bread (which is pretty wobbly on the best of days) popped right out of the toaster! Total hunk of junk. Felt lightweight, like a crappy toy, and really didn't even perform that well in the first place. Avoid!"
"I followed the instructions for first use of this toaster, but it doesn’t work.I’ve been a steady Prime customer for years, but it seems that there is no longer any quantity control.  I don’t know whether this toaster was tested, but I keep receiving orders missing parts or items previously returned to Amazon not working.  It has happened so often that I am now considering other sites in place of Amazon.  I don’t want to continue wasting time and money trying to do business with a site that doesn’t value customers."
"I was happy to find this model as I like the fact that the slots are wide for toasting bagels.  How can I go wrong with Hamilton Beach brand, right?  WRONG!  Unfortunately it doesn't stay down.  I checked on YouTube for help and most all of the videos advised cleaning the crumbs out of the toaster.  This is brand new.  No crumbs.I made a mistake and threw away the box before testing it, so in the trash it goes.  Money flushed down the toilet."
"The cord comes out of the front of the toaster and while that isn't a REAL  big deal, it would have been helpful to see it online, other than that though the toaster works fine  it toasts really light which is quite helpful to us but there is a dial to make it darker.  It doesn't pop up real high but it makes a sound when it DOES pop up, so I just stand and listen for it."
"I know that we are getting less for the same money these days....but.... we had this same model for about 8 years and finally had to replace it.  Saw this and thought ""Why change""?  The toast doesn't evenly ""Toast"", we need to do one side  and then take the bread out, reverse the slices and do one more time.  We think it may be stuck on ""Bagel"" setting.  We'll keep it for now as there are only two of us and we don't even use it every day.  Threw the box in our recycling so can't return it.  Oh well,  first world problem."
"May add pictures later, This toaster is made very poorly. the flimsy grill that supports the toast is held by a bracket similar to the design concept of a cheap metal hanging shelf but it's terribly designed, it does not have support on the other side.  Our toaster's grill fell out and now there's nothing to pop the toast out.Buy this only as a wedding gift for someone you hate."
"We bought this to replace our last toaster that worked well for more than a decade.  This HB unit cooks very erratically.  When making toast it cooks the bread with lines of uncooked bread, if the bread is too far back it doesn't cook, the settings may not toast one time and burn the bread up the next.  This morning was the last straw.  It is going to Good Will and I'm buying a different brand."
"Purchased this to replace a high end toaster that simply wore out after years of use. This works okay and it’s cheap, which suits me fine for now."
Worked ok but isn't really wide enough or deep enough for larger bagels. Had to rotate sliced bread for even toasting.
"I bought this toaster a year ago and it has been a disappointment. I turn it up to 6 and can barely get a toast on a slice of wheat bread. I will be replacing. Bummer, for the price."
"Works, but on highest level it doesn't make very crispy toast. I might need to upgrade to a higher quality."
"Bought this toaster because I trust Hamilton Beach and the Amazon reviews were positive.  I don't know if it's just this one that is defective, but the temperature control doesn't seem to work.  Even on the lowest setting, one side of toast burns.  And that's another problem... one side is always more done than the other.  Uneven toasting."
"Really wanted to like this - while it’s not hot on the sides and is somewhat wide slots (would prefer wider), the biggest problem is uneven toasting of something as simple as bread. Toast that’s burnt on one side and pale on the other (with the lowest setting). Its past the return window and used, so I’m stuck with it - but please think about it before purchasing."
"I gave up looking for an under-the-cabinet toaster oven; they don't seem to make them anymore. So I tried this table tip unit, selected because (1) it said it had a slot for bagels, and (2) it was small and did not take up much counter space. While the second point was accurate, the slots are really too small for bagels, and in fact too short to toast larger sizes of bread. Great for English muffins, not so good for sandwich size bread. Kind of disappointing."
"The toasting time varies no matter what you set the timer on. I set it on the lowest setting and the toast still burned. I have to estimate when it's done then hit the cancel button.If the toast does not come up to the top, Pushing the handle up does no good. You have to use a fork to fish it out. I guess it serves the purpose for a single serving daily. You get what you pay for."
