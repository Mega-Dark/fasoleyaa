This device overheats terribly. It has been happening since I got it. I have tried even putting up off of desk on a grate. It gets so hot I have to turn it off. I am afraid to leave it running
"This is great little laptop. Lightweight, decently fast, easy to use. However, it is the bare minimum build of HP laptops. It will not support a docking station for multiple monitors, even HP brands. The most you can do is use an external monitor through the HDMI port."
"The hardware is working well so far (although it would be nice to have a type-A USB port on the right side), however I wasted a lot of time on the setup process.  It forces you to create a Microsoft account prompting for personal information.  Afterwards I created a local account and deleted that of Microsoft, but the process still screwed up certain things for me on my home network.  The whole thing was extremely annoying and I continue to dislike Windows 11."
"Mediocre performance. I know a fair amount about PC's. Read the product description and it had the specs I was looking for. I got this specifically for my parents to use on a docking station to project to keyboard, mouse, monitor, ethernet ect... Guess what this laptop doesn't have the capability to do........ Yea.... THAT. None of the USB ports are compatible with charging or docking / extending the display. So if you are looking to do those things, look somewhere else. I wish that was in the description of this thing or else I wouldn't have bought it."
"I just bought it and it drained the whole battery in about 3.5 hour. Also, you can barely do multitasking, it’s just for basic stuff like office work."
"I dislike the power efficiency for this laptop. I am not sure if it is specifically this laptop(the one I own) or it is the brand itself. But besides that, everything is perfect!"
The HP laptop is fine but Windows 11 has no address book and it is a royal pain.
A little heavier than expected . Great lap top EXCEPT the on/off button is very hard to operate. It is so tiny and you never know if it is energized. It takes sometimes ten times for me to get it to turn on. Not good for someone with big fingers.
I thought it came with a year of 365. Turns out it was a month and then only if you gave a credit card for $15.99/mon for a year. Computer seems to work well though
"Used this laptop for 3 months, horizontal lines starting appearing. I spent over 20 hours over numerous nights talking to techs as they tried everything to resolve the issue. They determined it was a software issue and had me send it in. The repair center called, they put a new operating system on it but couldn't replicate the issue so they sent it back with a letter saying it was being sent back unrepaired because it was damaged and no longer under warranty! I spoke with my 2nd case mgr. he said I could take it to a service center and they would reimburse me for the repairs, or send it back to them. I asked for a loaner so I didn't go another month+ w/o a laptop, he said I would need to provide my CC info for collateral! They don't stand behind their product."
"I do like my HP laptop but when it arrived on December 15, I found out the battery is dead. I also found out that the warranty expired in November, before I purchased the laptop. How can that be?? I have never had that happen before and I am in my 70s!I thought you should be aware of this most frustrating situation!!Jan P."
"I use this for streaming and solitaire. Nice display, Good sound. Battery lasts maybe 2 hours and takes about two hours to recharge. My needs are simple and this machine doesnt even cut it for me,"
"I bought this computer for school (Physics software + light Python coding). Exactly a month after purchasing, the laptop's RAM spontaneously died. I sent it in for repairs, and it turns out that Amazon took out the original 8gb of RAM and put in a non-HP version of RAM that amounts to 16gb. After sending it into HP, I was told the warranty was voided due to this change in hardware, which Amazon does not clearly disclose (I'm not sure if they disclose this change at all, but I haven't found them mentioning it yet).I've been out of a laptop for 3 weeks now, and will still be out of one come this finals week. Honestly just blown away by the whole debacle."
"I would not recommend this model, go with a pavillion or better model. Every time the internal fan came on ithe one we received it disconnected the wifi, the keyboard as mentioned in other post is about as cheap as they come. I was shocked they put this in the computer..."
The keyboard feels really cheap. Like it doesn't belong on the product. A lot of play between the case and keyboard. I will get a video uploaded in the near future. Would never buy this product again. Should have spent the extra $200 and got a good MSI laptop.
I could not read the gray on silver keys. Totally useless to me.
"Purchased this computer new from Amazon for a new business.  Right out of the box I noted the keyboard felt much cheaper and ""clunky"" than most others I looked out in person.  It was light in weight but cheap in feel.  I went through the entire process of setting up accounts and then, upon turning on the computer on the second day, there was a vertical line the entire width of the computer screen.  Returned the computer as directed and will not be repurchasing."
"I am a 3rd party IT tech and the mere mention or lack of mentioning that the memory has been altered and that voided the HP warranty was bad enough but a restock fee on a broken part on their behalf, considering we had it 2 days before the blue screen memory dump and we sent to HP because it was under warranty, so they put extra parts voiding their warranty.  Bad Business."
"I bought this for my daughter, who is a freshman in college.  The Wifi icon continually disappears.  We have followed every possible troubleshooting recommended on the hp site and taken it to an IT service.  Still it does not work consistently.  I'm very disappointed and will try to get a refund since it is still under warranty."
"I've only had this computer since Nov 5, and it is Feb 6 and a black line is going down the middle of the computer. This is disappointing. Only 3 months and problems already. NOT a good sign! Too late to send back though. Wish I had bought a different model"
"I have used this laptop probably 6 times... last week it said, ERROR occurred.  Tried to reboot it myself, and no luck!  I took it to the GEEK SQUAD at Best Buy, they told me it had MALWARE, but they fixed it.  NO SUCH LUCK... it is a total lemon and I will never purchase an HP again!"
Battery drain and internet connectivity issue and more
So we’ve had this grey spot on the monitor but can’t seem to get in contact with anyone for help. The computer was a gift for my daughter after graduation but she didn’t set it up until after the return date had passed and she went to college. There’s been no damage done nor did any water get on the computer. It’s been this way since day one.
"Do not buy from this seller. Very high chances that we get defective product. I got a over heating laptop and returned in the very next day. Still was charged $150 as restocking fee. The seller not refunding the full money paid. Escalated multiple times to amazon, till now no solution."
I bought this laptop because it said it had more memory than what the laptop specified.
It just doesn’t turn on now
"I have to give up on HP, at this point they are costing me too much."
"Unit is without a functioning ssd drive / OS, first boot out of the box. On-line diagnostics verify no SSD."
I purchased this for my granddaughter for her freshman year of college. Did not last a semester it will not turn on. Don’t buy one.
Not impressed. I feel lucky if the battery stays charged for 4 hours. Probably getting a new laptop over Black Friday weekend.
every week i have to spend 1hr in with HO support to connect to the internet
The screen locked up upon start-up and was never able to unlock at any point.
The laptop has scratches on the outside
"HP 15 inch Laptop, FHD Display, Intel Core i5-1235U, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, Windows 11 Home, 15-dy5399nr (2023)==Performance==CPU - This is where a majority of the budget for this device went. At 10 cores this thing is a above decent productivity machine. Can run Chrome blazing fast and have dozens of tabs and applications running at once without breaking a sweat.GPU - Intel's Iris Xe graphics is not meant for games. Will run potato games like League of Legends at max graphics easily, but anything else higher will not be possible. Not a gaming device.RAM - 16gb and above average speed, which should be the norm.Storage - 512gb and also runs at ~1000mb read/write speeds, which again should be the norm.==Hardware==Screen - Anti glare, good for use in bright lit environments. But at max brightness, direct sunlight will still make it hard to see none the less. Color and contrast wise, the colors doesn't really pop and might seem bland some times, but that's a trade off for a matt anti glare screen at 1080p. The tradeoff is that the screen is 15.6 inches giving it more screen real estate for people with bad vision and need stuff zoomed in.Track-pad - track-pad is a bit small and the physical click is average feeling at best. It's tactile but not as satisfying as Dell's.Keyboard - Big and wide keys with a dedicated num-pad. Down side is there's no backlit keyboard, which is not reasonable for msrp; The keys are also a tad bit wiggly and not as tactile as Dell's or even Acer'sI/O - Decent selection of I/O from USB-C to USB-A, SD Card, Headphone jack and HDMI. But USB-C is unable to be used for charging. A dedicated Ethernet port would've been nice considering the size of this device. A HP tube style charger is necessary to charge this device, which means that you'd need to get a additional charger instead of using usb-c cable chargers, making this device not ideal for achieving usb-c universal compatibility.Web-Cam - as average as most laptop webcams, will work but don't expect good colors/qualitySpeaker - Very loud upwards firing speakers, at 50% the entire room is already filled with noise, but does not have very bright sound. Lacking in terms of detail and bass.Battery - Battery life is rated at 7 hours, during my usage of testing this device, uninstalling/installing apps and benching software I was able to use up 75% in 3 hrs then. Recharging takes about 1.5-2 hrs from 0 to 100.Cooling - Cooling chamber is in the top middle side that blows the hot air out bouncing on the side edge of the screen up and downwards. Cooling is well placed and well done such that during heavy load you do not feel the system getting hot at all around the palm rest and typing area. At max load the fan will sound loud,  similar to the loudness of an air purifier at low speed.Body - All plastic build system wide. Won't feel as premium as the metal frame bodies, but will help the computer feel lighter.Upgrade-ability - Taking out the bottom plate requires you to rip off the rubber legs to access the additional hidden screws, meaning HP really didn't consider making it up-gradable friendly and you should not get this expecting to upgrade it without it being a hassle.==Software==Windows 11Bloatware - Out the box the device is packed with HP apps, around 8 of them with some already pinned to the taskbar; on top of that there's McAfee, which is set to default and you'd have to pay for in the long run follow by Express VPN. Furthermore, all those are set to auto start when the pc boots, causing it to be quite demanding on the system during startup if not turned off or uninstalled. Has a decent amount of bloatware. While it is easy to use this device as plug and play right out the box, about 30min of tuning and cleaning is necessary to clear the crap, which takes some Windows 11 operation knowledge.==Conclusion==Overall this laptop screams to be a productivity and light entertainment machine given its specs. It has the power to crush Chrome related tasks, light gaming, media entertainment, and sub heavy Microsoft Office software. I can have dozens of tabs, PDFs, emails, & messaging software open at once and this device would still be fine. For light potato games, this thing also performs well as along with watching movies and listening to music. For the average user just looking to browse the web, get office work done, or do school work, this device is an absolute beast for that. For anyone looking to get more juice out of graphics, better screen quality, and anything premium in the hardware department, this is not it. During time of review this device is rated at $613.93, which is not worth period. You can probably get a better spec up Acer Swift for the price and have easier upgrade-ability to scale the device.  I can only recommend this device with its specs at around $300-$380."
"Bought 2 of these 1 1/2 ago and the hinges are breaking off. Never dropped. , gets harder to open and close now no warranty.I guess you get what you pay for. Looked online and I'm not the only one."
"Update #2 - After a few weeks of usage, RAM upgrade, and more thinking on the value of this $750 laptop, NOT Recommended.I really don't like the keyboard.  It does work OK, but it feels and sounds really cheap while you are typing (solution, I am planning on getting a Bluetooth keyboard for around the house usage - another $50-$100 spent).  Also, any thing beyond basic web usage had the RAM maxed out, so I spend another $100 on RAM.  The screen is OK (but not great) the speakers are OK (but not great).  The bright spot for this PC is the Core i5 processer and SSD drive.  But even they needed the extra RAM to really shine.  (with the extra RAM, boot time is half, and games that took 3-5 minutes to launch / load levels now launch / load in under 30 seconds).So updated score = -1 for general cheap build, -1 for the keyboard, -1 for needing a RAM upgrade right away, 2 Star.  I did get this PC thru Vine Voice for free, so I will keep it and use it, but if I had paid $750 (list price when I ordered it) for it, I would return it.NOT Recommended.Update#1 - Of my 2 new laptops that both have Win11 and 16gb RAM (this one and another HP), both have issues with running out of ram.  I dropped $100 on a 64gb RAM set for this PC.  This makes a huge difference in speed.  While I hade the case open, I snapped a pic of the motherboard layout, if anyone is interested. Picture is with the stock ram installed. (my other HP laptop was upgraded to 32gb of ram, that still makes a big difference, and is a must-do upgrade, for Win11, IMHO).Original Review-TLDR; I don't like the keyboard or speakers, but other than that, it is a good general use PC.Longer - This is my third HP laptop in the last year or so, and the cheapest of the three.  Ordered it to replace a +10 year old Dell XPS.  It really feels cheap compared to the others.  The other two are a high end Z-book for work and mid-level (under $1k) for my wife's school work.  I also have a pair of older sub $200 chrome books in the house for the kids.The version I have is ""HP 15 inch Laptop, FHD Display, Intel Core i5-1235U, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, Intel Iris Xe Graphics, Windows 11 Home, 15-dy5399nr (2023)""Overall, I feel this a good general use laptop.  It has middle of the road specs, which will keep it from feeling outdated in a year or two, but still keep the price affordable.  It is plenty of computer for general MS Office / web / movie type stuff, but then, none of that really stresses a PC.For games, the lack of a proper video card will hamper it a bit, but the few games I play work OK.  Of the three games I have played so far, only BeamNG.Drive has issues.  It will max out the ram and kick a in-game low memory warning.  OK that warning, and it will kick a second warning about not having a dedicated video graphics card.  Ok that warning, and the game plays mostly OK.  On ""Normal"" Graphics, the FPS is low, around 13-15FPS (somewhat playable, but not really enjoyable).  Setting the graphics to ""Low"" gets the FPS up to 25-28FPS.  This makes the game not as pretty, graphics look like a 2000-era driving game, but it is very playable. The other games I play are the 2018 HBS BattleTech (runs great) and Juno (a space flight / rocket simulator, runs good, but have not played much on the new PC, just a quick test)Other issues -The biggest issue for me is the keyboard.  It feels very hollow, cheap, every key stroke feels a bit rattily.  It works, but feels cheap enough to be distracting when I first sit down to the machine after spending the day on my Z-book.  I realize they did this go keep the price down, but my 2 sub-$200 chrome books both have better keyboards than this laptop.Speakers - they are fine, I guess.  In the same way you ask your wife ""how are you"" and she says ""Fine"". All my other laptops have B&O or JBL speakers, and this laptop has unbranded audio. I know I should not expect great sound, and it is not really bad, but it is not good either.Screen - no complaints.  Works, looks good,  It is not a touch screen, but I was not looking for a touchscreen, so this is OK, and save a bit of money on the purchase price.Battery life - I have not tested it, so far I have stayed plugged in.  When I get a chance to test, I will update this review.Update#1 - Of my 2 new laptops that both have Win11 and 16gb RAM (this one and another HP), both have issues with running out of ram.  I dropped $100 on a 64gb RAM set for this PC.  This makes a huge difference in speed.  While I hade the case open, I snapped a pic of the motherboard layout, if anyone is interested. Picture is with the stock ram installed. (my other HP laptop was upgraded to 32gb of ram, that still makes a big difference, and is a must-do upgrade, for Win11, IMHO).Overall - 4 stars. due to the cheap keyboard.  Other than the keyboard, it is a good machine."
Looks like fake performance bad keep freezing even we have not install anything
"I got this phone when it was 'on sale' for around 800$ (I forgot the exact amount but I payed 940 in total for a phone case as well. Not really a bad price compared to Samsung) I use this phone nearly everyday ranging from 6~8 hours of listening to content or doing something on here. The battery life is really good for what I do needing to charge it every now and then. The pictures that can be taken on this are pretty nice. I love the amount of details. look up YouTube videos on this phone. I don't use all of the features on this phone but I use most of them. As well as game just a bit.I've also got pretty small hands so the size and weight of the phone is a bit to big for me but the screen is really what I got it for when I'm outside. It's easy to use as well and simple. I wish there was more to the flash light because you can dim the light to a low level.I'll probably update this more as I use it but if you want a phone forever I'm keeping this.Update 6-29After using this phone more I've noticed some bugs/problems.If you're using developer mode I've noticed after a reboot it turns off certain things.One time the battery couldn't read its own percentage and the screen wasn't working (if this happens hold power and up volume for 10~20 seconds) but still phone shouldn't do this.People have said about this found that there's a problem with infinite loading, close out of the app.7-25I don't really know how to feel about this phone. It's buggy with certain apps, it crashes on its own installed apps. I enjoy some of the features of this phone but I'd actually want a phone I can use. I hope google keeps their word with the updates they're going to give. But giving it's google.Been having so much trouble just transferring files onto a USB stick. Errors after errors, at one point I sent 110 files through quickshare onto it and 90 of them were corrupted on the computer. It's a bit disappointing since these were photos. I had more of a better time individually dragging each file and making sure it transfers. I didn't have the patience for that. I'll do it again another time but here's your warning for if it happens to you. This phone is both smart and stupid at the same time. I dislike most AI models even Google's had some controversy in the past months for telling people to put glue in their pizza from a Reddit thread. You can text the AI it's good for small things like asking a questions. I don't know how smart you can get with them but always fact check. It's horrible with conversations, it's okay at first it shows interest like a person asking questions about what you're talking about then if you reply wrong it throws a monkey wrench and goes based on the new thing you typed.Typing... Everyone says typing is really good on here. Yes and no. Yes in the way that it's smarter because of some of the AI and the proof read. Voice typing can be amazing but it has it's problems that make me a bit frustrated. I hate when I'm doing it and it mishears me or it doesn't get what I say. You're still better off if you can type. But about 85% of the time it works right.I don't absolutely hate this phone I just have my slight annoyances with it. I love how fast it is and the camera is amazing (not the selfie camera.)8-25 update: with the Google pixel 9 out hearing that there's more problems and the AI is just so  stupid. It makes me hate how companies put AI into everything nowadays. This phone is great sometimes. Takes good pictures. Rarely gets slow but it does have its problems. I've had inconsistent camera issues, the battery isn't really the best. There's cheaper phones that have good cameras and upgradeable storage. I recommend looking for them."
"I really, really wanted to love this phone but honestly, having experienced both, Samsung does Android better than Google does which is pretty sad.I'm coming from an S20 so much of my review will be in comparison to that.Pros- Screen is very bright- Face unlock is very good- The glossy back is beautiful and not such a dramatic slip-hazard or fingerprint magnet as online video reviewers make it out to be.- That's it. Seriously.Cons (brace yourself)- Absolutely no idea how they managed this, but there is not even half the customisation ability as Samsung's version of Android and the stock Android experience is uglier and less logical than Samsung's version of it.I cannot express this enough, it's unbelievably irritating. Things you could change on a Samsung you're stuck with on the Pixel and many of these things look ugly or make things inconvenient. For example, want to quickly turn on/off mobile data? You can't with a easy button in the quick settings panel, you need now open a submenu called 'internet'. Want to change your quick settings tab colour to anything other than black? Too bad. Want to quickly switch your phone to vibrate? There's no quick setting for that either, it's a 3 step process now....You can't get rid of their mostly-useless 'at a glance' widget or even move it anywhere.- Entire UI on the default launcher is almost deliberately unintuitive and clunky. To change the brightness you have to swipe down twice, whereas it's right at the top with a single swipe on other phones. Just imagine the most logical place you'd expect something to work, and it'll be the exact opposite on this phone. e.g. do you want to clear all the recent apps? It won't be on a convenient button as soon as you press the recent apps navigation button, no, instead you have to swipe aaaaaaaall the way to the left through the 20 or 30 or so apps you may have opened and then the 'clear all' button will be at the end of the list. Seriously, has anyone who designed this launcher spent even 10 seconds thinking about any of these things before they implemented it???- The only option for a torch shortcut function is to double-tap the back of the phone.... it's exactly as reliable as you'd imagine - so absolutely terrible - the action you need to do leaves you teetering your phone in your hand so it's a huge drop risk and it actually responding to those taps only works 10% of the time at best so you just end up hitting your phone like a nutcase trying to get your torch to turn on. Samsung lets you double-press the power button - how much simpler and more logical is that?!- Battery doesn't have a charge limit feature like Samsung and other brands do. Instead it uses 'adaptive charging that forces your phone to charge suuuuuuper slowly when it thinks it's appropriate to e.g. in the evenings so that it's only fully charged by morning. Fine, except if you plan on topping up before you go out, you have to keep snoozing the function. If you happen to forget to snooze it, you'll come to grab your phone after an hour of sitting on charge and find it having gained only 5%.... brilliant, thanks Google... I would rather my phone charge super fast and stop at 90%. Give us the option at least. If I put my phone on charge I want it charged ASAP so it's ready to use when I need it. What's the point of rapid charging if it hardly uses it.- Basically the exact same dimensions as a Samsung S20 except for thickness and weight. Those differences are noticeable though as this thing feels like a brick in the hand. Feels very thick and very heavy whereas the S20 or even S20FE feels super sleek and light in comparison.- Despite the extra thickness and weight, the Pixel 8 is objectively worse spec'd and featured than many other flagships on the market, even some older phones. It doesn't even have a dual-SIM - I knew this before purchasing but it's standard on many flagships and laughably even mid-range phones have this so be aware of that if you intend to use this for work.- The screen has a nice subtle roundoff at the edges....that leads straight into a pointy raised metal lip of the chassis the whole way around. It feels sharp and unpleasant to swipe off the edge of the screen in any direction. It's already accumulating dust and I imagine it will get gross over time because it's nearly impossible to clean properly. It's such a large lip I can literally pull the phone along the table with my fingernail using just that edge.- The camera visor edges are also very sharp and can be uncomfortable depending on how you hold it, and when gaming. They are also easily scratched with how it sits on the very edge of the visor on the table.- The camera is missing a whole tonne of features qnd settings that again, are present on other phones. It doesn't even have an anti-flicker correction so videos with LED lighting in them will look like you're at a rave...The quality is also decidedly average, night mode is significantly worse than Samsung's and barely an improvement over regular mode. They have a night mode for video but software lock that to the Pixel 8 Pro just to make the 8 Pro more desireable. Why should 8 Standard owners get less features when it can handle the software just fine???- Thick bezels around the screen edges. Nothing major but most phones have managed near edge-to-edge screens 6 years ago... These bezels are actually slightly wider than my HTC One from a decade ago.- Doing intensive tasks or asking much of it will get it hot. It also freezes and becomes unresponsive while doing average things like browsing Chrome. It'll suddenly freeze for a solid 10 seconds for no reason.- Every time you enter your PIN you have to manually press ""Enter"". Coming from a Samsung you just typed your PIN and it unlocks instantly. This may not matter to most but it's a minor annoyance and adds seriously minimal additional security.- The alternative is the fingerprint sensor which flashes this large, insanely bright dot to illuminate your finger which if your finger is even slightly not covering the sensor will flash you with the power of 1000 suns which is the absolute worst at night. It's also not very reliable in the first place, the face ID is significantly better.- The only SMS app is Google's intrusive one which switched RCS on despite me specifically chosing not to.- Google's phone app is clunky and unintuitive. There's no way to make the default page the dialer instead of your contacts list.- Notifications in the main notification tab don't even use the whole screen real estate even when in landscape. The whole screen is filled with the tab background but the notification itself remains the same width as in portrait which ends up looking like a novice wrote the code for the UI.- Always-On homescreen minimises the huge clock numbers if you have notifications come in...or it's supposed to. This works about 50% of the time so you end up having to wake the phone to check for new notifications anyway.- No 'routines' function like Samsung has where it will automatically switch certain settings on based on a GPS perimeter e.g. arriving at work will put your phone on vibrate, switch the background and change other settings - don't expect that here, logically of course, the makers of Android give you LESS features in their flagship device running their own flagship software. Thank you, very cool.I'm sorry if this sounds like a rant or like I'm fanboying over Samsung. I seriously wanted to like this phone and was so excited for a flagship compact phone, but I'm going to tell it how it is, I don't care about the brand I care about a phone being worth the money we pay for it and this has been a thoroughly disappointing experience. It's like the software was designed by someone who's never used a smartphone in their life which is utterly baffling for the company that MAKES Android. This should be the epitome of the Android experience but that title goes squarely to Samsung.If you're a Samsung user I think you would have a very good chance of being disappointed if you upgrade to this. You are literally losing features and functionality for absolutely no reason. It's genuinely not any better than the A34 I use for work and that's half the cost. If you're an iPhone user, or someone who's a basic user that doesn't do anything other than browse Facebook, Chrome and make calls, you'll be fine. It's probably closer to an iPhone experience than it is to a version of Android from any of the other manufacturers.If I experience the shutdowns and freezing any more than I already am, I will be returning this because it's the topping ontop of a totally average phone.In summary the phone is average. It'll do its job and nothing more and it's definitely not worth the price. It doesn't hold a candle to the other flagships and Google's software-limiting of certain features to the Pro for no reason other than to split the product tiers is incredibly disappointing too. This is the first Pixel phone I've ever bought and without a doubt the last I will ever buy. A thouroughly rubbish experience.Considering the phone is physically subpar spec'd compared to the competition of compact phones like the Zenfone 10, Xiaomi 14, Sony 5V or even the now older Samsung S23 I would highly recommend looking at competitors' offerings before buying a Pixel 8. In fact I would just say buy a Samsung and enjoy your purchase. The Pixel 8 should be very last on your list."
"This post is about disappointment. Below, I will describe all the problems I faced in a month (a little more) of using the Google Pixel 8 PRO with 256 gigabytes.I'll try my best not to be bitter, but I'm not sure if I'll succeed because I expected something completely different from a $1050 phone.I bought the US version on Amazon. As a pre-order gift with the phone, they offered the Google Pixel Watch 2. In total, all this pleasure cost me $1050. I wasn't particularly interested in the watch and planned to sell them, thereby reducing the overall cost of the phone. In fact, currently on ""Black Friday,"" the phone on the official website costs $859. So, there was no gift in the form of the watch, and I paid for the phone + watch.I consider $350 for the Google Pixel Watch 2 an absurd price because there are many cool watches on the market cheaper.Let's start with the most important: Calls. In ""vibration"" mode, there is no audible notification in TWS headphones. The call volume in the headphones is tied to the ""ring volume"" in the ""sound and vibration"" section. Before switching to the Google Pixel 8 Pro, I always used the vibrate mode, and I could hear all incoming calls in the headphones. For people who talk a lot on the phone, this will be a very unpleasant moment. This problem extends to all non-Google TWS headsets. Next, take Pixel Buds Pro, connect them to the phone, and encounter the following problem: the audio notifications during incoming calls work only the first 3-4 times, then disappear. You need to disconnect the headset and reconnect it.The side buttons are not tactile.Weak processor. In synthetic tests, the processor delivers 1K. I consider this a very low indicator for a phone that positions itself as a flagship. Currently, it doesn't feel noticeable, but the fact remains. There are Chinese brands that have Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. There, the performance is approximately twice as much. If you are taking a phone for a long time, such a performance indicator is not great.Accessories. No charger and SIM ejector tool. SIM ejector tool, seriously. I opened the SIM card slot with a needle and a door frame catch. I just have no words, only emotions.Battery life. The phone is new and lasts for now. My Xiaomi, which I used for 3 years, held up about the same. If you look at reviews comparing battery life with other phones, it's all sad there.Charging time. My previous Xiaomi phone, bought in 2018, had a 38W charger. Besides being included in the package, it also charged faster.Raw operating system. Approximately 2-3 times a week, I reboot the phone. The notification shade doesn't come down, the button doesn't respond, black screen during incoming calls, and there are just tons of such bugs. To understand how tragic everything is, you need a month with this phone.Rattling. If you shake the phone, you can hear the optics (lens) hitting the phone's body. And this problem is not only on my phone. A friend has the same issue.Speaker sound. It's not bad, but on the iPhone, it's better. More midrange and low frequencies.Wi-Fi problems. Doesn't always want to connect to the access point. No matter what Wi-Fi standard it operates on or the authentication method on the access point. It might disconnect from the access point, might say the password is incorrect. A friend has the same issue. This problem was detected on Mikrotik access points.Well, there are a bunch of downsides, but now I can't remember them.Well, and I want to highlight a couple of positives so it's not all that tragic.Camera. Beautiful photos, very good in night mode. Magic erase is a cool thing. It doesn't always work 100%, but sometimes it really surprises with what AI can do.Conclusion: Before switching to the Google Pixel 8 Pro, I had the Xiaomi Mi 10 Lite 5G. I bought it for $260. For that money, I got an excellent phone that worked flawlessly for 3 years. MIUI shell, in my opinion, is much better than this Android on the Pixel.I'll probably sell the phone. Even if all the software problems are fixed, the impression of the phone is not very good anymore, and I don't want to use it."
"I've been using the Pixel 8 Pro as my primary phone for just over 1 year now, after previously using the Pixel 5 and Pixel 2. The Pixel 5 was amazing, so I am extremely disappointed by all the problems with the Pixel 8 and will consider switching to another brand for my next phone.The biggest problem is the Pixel 8 freezes and restarts randomly while using it. This happens seemingly at random times, sometimes not happening for 2 or 3 months, and other times happening every few days. I did not root the phone or do install anything outside of apps from the Google Play Store. I'm mainly a PC user so the only apps I use on my phone are Chrome, the Google news feed, a few messaging apps. I also have a few games installed like Genshin Impact, but I only open it on my phone rarely to make purchases for bonus Google Play points and I do all the gameplay on a PC. The freezes happen seeminlgy at random, including with Google maps and the built-in camera app that comes with the phone when I was trying to take a picture.The Pixel 8 also heats up a lot and burns through battery very quickly when actively using it, even though I disabled the full resolution and 120hz. When travelling and constantly using my phone to look things up, the battery couldn't even last a whole day from morning to night. The Pixel 5's batter was actually better and could last a whole day. With light use though, I can get 3 days of use before having to charge my phone - my Pixel 5 was the same when it was new, but after 3 years the battery could only hold about half as much charge since I had used it for gaming before switching to Android emulators on PC.The fingerprint scanner also doesn't work well in completely dark rooms, or right after picking it up after a few hours of inactivity. It seems like it always fails the first try or two. I registered my both my thumbs twice, which normally works fine throughout the day.I considered trying to upgrade to a Pixel 9 to see if it wouldn't have as many problems, but it would be a gamble as well and Google's trade-in only offered $200 for this $1000 phone 12 months after launch. Guess you don't get anything for brand loyalty lol.I'll probably stick with this phone for another year or two since when it's not freezing and I'm not using it heavily, it works well. However, I feel like all the problems are unacceptable considering its premium price point. I definitely do NOT recommend getting this phone at this price point - try your luck with the Pixel 9, or try another brand."
"The first 6 months of owning this phone, connecting to anything with bluetooth was a nightmare. They finally fixed it with a software update in June. But now the Internet connection (any wifi network or data in any location) will randomly go out for just my device and no one else. I have to turn off the connection for a minute to reset it and then connect again. It's 2024 and these should be basic features that just work. Yes it can be corrected fairly quickly but I really shouldn't have to deal with this whatsoever. I still love pixel phones, but would not recommend the 8 to anyone."
"After 6 months having this crap, I really wanted to dump it. it's not worth it. I regreted that not buying iPhone. This Pixel 8 pro keeps dropping mobile network, no matter how many time I restarted the phone. Bluetooth is acting up and down, on and off with my car. You can't just restart the damn phone 3-4 times a day. It is not designed like that. Not sure how Google can sell this phone to people. The most important thing about the phone is connecting to the network, not the CAMERA!!!"
"DIFFICULT TO LEARN HOW TO USE BECAUSE IT'S LESS INTUITIVE. STARTED DOING TUTORIALS TO UNDERSTAND IT. SMALLER SCREEN THAN PREVIOUS PHONE...NOT GOOD. SHOULD HAVE PURCHASED THE PIXEL 8 PRO. TAKES GREAT PHOTOS. DOES WEIRD THINGS WHEN YOU DON'T EXPECT IT TO...LIKE LISTENING TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND TYPING IT ON THE SCREEN. HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO TURN OFF. HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET IT TO READ ARTICLES I SEARCHED FOR, UNLIKE MY OTHER PHONE THAT DID IT AUTOMATICALLY, ALTHOUGH IT DIDN'T READ LONG ARTICLES...BUT WOULD GIVE ME DEFINITIONS OF WORDS. FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO USE GOOGLE. CONFUSED BY GEMINI. HEAR IT'S BEING DISCONTINUED. I HAVEN'T FOUND IT USEFUL. NOT LIKE TALKING TO A REAL PERSON. I SHOULD HAVE PURCHASED THE PIXEL 8 PRO FOR THE LARGER SCREEN....THAT I'M USED TO. WHY PEOPLE LIKE SMALL SCREENS BEATS ME."
"I own a pixel 6 pro. The battery would no longer last a day so I decided to upgrade to the pixel 8 pro during prime day.ProsThe camera is improved, I have a 2-day battery life with my usage.ConsThe negatives with this phone have made me almost want to go back to my six pro. I can be using an app or on Chrome, and all the sudden I pressing on app buttons or on website links or scrolling quits working. I or will need to close and reopen the app to get a screen press to work again. This happens a couple times everyday. I also do not think the processor is any faster than the six pro.I bought this phone for improved battery life which I did get. But if I could do it all over again I would have bought a different phone due to the issue. It's very frustrating."
"The Pixel 8 Pro XL was not a bad phone, but I just upgraded to the Pixel 9 Pro, and it is so much better!!!I wanted the smaller 9 pro vs another XL which is just too large for my very small hands. Everything about the 9 is very nice.  I was able to get a substantial trade in on my Pixel 8 Pro. I highly recommend the Pixel 9 and the Pixel 9 Pro XL."
"Heads up that I am posting this review a fourth time after it was removed by Amazon.  This could mean that the seller is attempting to remove bad reviews of this phone, but I cannot be sure.  Here is the email I received:""Thank you for submitting a review of Google Pixel 8 Pro - Unlocked Android Smartphone with Telephoto Lens and Super Actua Display - 24-Hour Battery - Bay - 512 GB; we are sorry you did not have a positive experience. We investigated your concerns about product authenticity, and the information we have indicates that the product you received was authentic. As a result, we removed the review you submitted. This ensures that customer reviews remain as accurate as possible for the benefit of future customers.""The color range and depth of the Pixel 8 Pro is remarkably bad.  I have seen better screens on $200 phones, and I'm not making knee-jerk exaggerations about it.  I really want to love this phone, and I do love most other aspects of it.  But for some reason, Google decided to put a screen on it that's so bad, I wouldn't trust that I'm taking good photos until I saw them on another phone or a computer display.I understand that this is a bold claim, so let me prove what I'm saying in photos.  In each photo, the Pixel 8 Pro is on the left, and a OnePlus 7t is on the right, both at 100% brightness.  The photos were taken with a OnePlus 8t.  Keep in mind that these are photos of screens, and cameras aren't fully representative of what we see.  Additionally, screens emit some light that gets picked up by cameras that we cannot see, and you (the reader) are looking at these photos through yet another screen.  Regardless, I believe that these photos do a satisfactory job of displaying the the poor color range of the 8 Pro.I included three photos of a website displaying pure primary colors (red, green, and blue), and included one more photo of an image that displays a range of colors.  Both of these phones use OLED displays, so the ""red"" areas contain pixels where only the red subpixels are at 100% brightness, while the blue and green subpixels are fully off, for example.  I verified this on both devices firsthand with a jeweler's loupe, just to be sure.  Primary colors are supposed to be ""pure"" colors, meaning that the ""red"" photo is the phone attempting to produce the most ""red"" color it can, for example.I really don't need to explain much more, since the photos deliver some pretty solid justice.  Notice that the red especially looks like tomato paste on the Pixel 8 Pro while they look like ""pure red"" on the 7t.  And the blues and greens of a ""good"" OLED screen almost look ""fake"" from so much color, but again, this is with the primary subpixels of their respective color on full brightness, so the ""redder"" the red is, the better the color depth of the red is.  Additionally, dark colors on the 8 Pro are much too bright and washed out.Needless to say, it's lousy.  What was Google thinking?  I am so disappointed in the screen, that I'm returning the phone on this basis alone.  I am distracted by the screen quality anytime I use the phone for any occasion.  Returning to my 7t feels like a breath of fresh air.  This screen simply should not be sold on a ~$1k device."
"I bought this as a gift, so it's been somewhat stressful first day.It does feel and look good. UI very responsive.It took forever to sync from old phone. Installing and setting up old apps took forever.My migration from a Nokia 8 Sirocco (Android One), to Xiaomi 11T Pro a couple of years ago was FAR faster and smoother.I wanted pure android and a good Android One phone is nonexistent anymore.From unboxing and first power on it was advising there was dirt or moisture in the USB port.The camera is good, but does not seem to save every snap. Would take several pictures and some did not seem to save.The finger print reader almost always requires a second attempt to unlock. Using a pin requires hitting enter to submit. Previous phones never required this extra input.The most concerning point - It would not charge over night. I woke at 4am to find the phone had not progressed past 10%. Had to power off device to initiate charging and then power back on. Once rebooted it would detect the power cable being connected / disconnected a couple times and start charging. This was after a system update was performed. I'll try disable adaptive charging if it happens again. If this persists it may need to be returned.Battery only really lasts a day, I'd expect closer to two, if not more like my 11T.We'll see how day 2 goes ... Started the day with a message saying the phone was 0 days old and required a security update.So far not overly impressed, especially with this being a Google product.Follow up review:After a week it has grown on the person I have bought it for. Intuitive UI and easy to use.The biggest failing point is the battery and really slow charging. Struggles to last a full day. Coming from a near 4-5 year old phone that still allows you to skip a day and charges significantly faster.The person does not like charging over night and has still not gotten used to it. These big brand ""premium"" phones need to adopt 90 or 120W charging. It's pure and utter freedom and peace of mind. Zero stress life. But then they'd need to package an included charging brick ...Tl;Dr - would not buy product line again unless much faster charging technology adopted."
"I don't care if the tech specs claim the Pixel 8 is superior to the Pixel 5.  I'm not seeing it.Having had it for less than 24 hours, I'm shocked at how not-better it is than my Pixel 5.  It seems like the same exact phone.  Only worse.I can already say the camera is not better.  I take a ton of pictures for eBay listings.  The old Pixel 5 didn't have great close-up (macro) range on its lens, but it focused quickly and took great photos.  The Pixel 8 struggles to focus, is slower, and produces way more out-of-focus pictures.  The megapixel claims are ridiculously false.  The sensor may have that many pixels, but that absolutely does NOT result in a higher-resolution photo.  It may make it more sensitive in low light.  Quality is not better.Nor is the crappy on-screen fingerprint unlock.  The old sensor on the back of the Pixel 5 was significantly more sensitive, fast, and reliable.  Most of the time the delayed response on the Pixel 8 results in having to enter my PIN instead.  Terrible design, and for me that is already a huge negative.I enabled the facial recognition to unlock the phone.  That works a little bit better, provided I don't have my glasses on.  But that is just another way they are taking personal information and doing ??? with it.  Also, not that I am a criminal or anything, but having facial recognition allows the authorities to access your devices without your permission, just by holding it up to your face.  Not cool.My Pixel 5 was four years old, and the battery life wasn't what it once was.  It was time to get a new phone.  So far I'm not super happy with the Pixel 8.  Glad I bought it on sale and didn't spend much.  Probably should have just found a super cheap Pixel 5."
"Pixel 8 pro, flagship, top phone, best of there best and Google has chosen to omit message reminders from this phone. I had spent a lot of time trying to find this feature through the vast amount of settings options. 3 support chat attempts, one request for a phone call which I didn't receive. Last chat person confirmed what I suspected, some morons omitted this feature. This is cell phone basics. So if you miss a call or text you won't know it until you pick up your phone and have a look. And take a good look. The dots on the app icons are small showing you there is a call-text for you.  To me this is a big deal since I don't care to have a phone on my body at all times. With this basic mode being ommited I have to wonder what other ilogical choices have these developers made. I do like that the phone can be set to flash when receiving the initial call or text, but that's all you get. Phone functions fine otherwise. Can't say I was blown away. Coming from an old, outdated, Samsung 8 active. I had no issues with Samsung just thought I would give this a try. The camera on this phone is wildly over rated. It's good but with all the hype I was expecting to say wow. In fact I said that's it. My old phone must have been leap years ahead of its time.  Battery life is fine for me. Pandora will run on my phone most days all day. No a huge battery drain there but it's not better than my old dated phone. And I decided to replace that phone because the battery is showing the signs of its age. If this is on par with my old phone now, what will this phone be like I in 5-6 years... I knew I would not be crazy about the camera lens bump and ya I am not, at all. I went with this phone for the photo editing. Reviews put it a bit more user friendly than s24. Again not impressed. And since I was directed by this phone to a 3rd party app, what's the point. Finger print reader is nothing more than annoying once a screen protector goes on. Really like the speed at which the phone powers up. Charges fast with a faster charging block. Had to buy that since it doesn't come with a charging block. Not a big deal to me. Everyone should have charges around by now. Not a fan of the key board. No long press for a dual purpose letter. Such as letter sharing a symbol of you press and hold to get the symbol. So many setting I don't know what a lot of it is for. That maybe the norm these days. Long story short, good chance I will send this back. I am completely hung up on how dumb are the developers to get ride of message reminders, which I guess Google calls Nudges, and concerned about long term battery life."
I like the phone and the ease of use.Battery still kinda sucks on this one but not as bad as the 6  pixel proA lot of the google features don't actually turn off when you tell it to.There's a bug that silences incoming callsI've turned off all the settings that would silence calls but still no luck
"use within one year occur the problem like the photob(white line cross from  top to bottom) ,google didn't respond to my request of repair cause i live in the place without dealer ."
"I admittedly didn't do much research before buying this phone, but I've been quite disappointed.  I previously had a Moto X4 with Android 9 but wanted a phone with esim capability for a trip I was taking.  I've been using this phone for about 2 weeks now and the only two new features I've found helpful are the esim capability and when receiving a call being able to send it to an automated assistant (I haven't actually had a use for it yet, but it does seem like it could be really handy to find out what a call is about while occupied in a meeting).  Everything else has pretty much been a disappointment.When setting up the phone it was supposed to be copying my settings from my previous phone.  I'm not sure what copied, but it didn't copy many useful settings, it didn't copy any apps,After setting up the apps I typically use, they didn't work as well on this phone as they did on the 5 year old Moto X4.  When I open Google Maps, it won't let me type in to search for something.  It has a voice option, but never opens a keyboard.  When I receive email messages they often show up as separate notifications for 1 email message each instead of showing one notification that there are 3 new email messages (all the email messages are received in the same account).  When playing music in my car with a bluetooth connection, the old Moto X4 would display the song title, artist, etc on the car display; the new phone plays music, but apparently doesn't support sending that additional information.In addition, the defaults for the phone seem to be trying to imitate an iPhone which I find obnoxious.  If I wanted an iPhone interface I would have bought one of those.  I also found it very disappointing there is no headphone jack or slot for an additional memory card.So overall I've been very disappointed with this phone and would not recommend it.  I'll likely go back to my Moto X4 and see if I can get a few more years out of it."
"I'm not a fanboy of any particular brand and have had many over the last 15 years. However, Pixel is definitely a disappointment, even after coming from a 2018 Samsung device.The good is limited to the hardware advancements after a 6 year jump in tech for me:The camera is great, not even worth comparing to my previous one.The fingerprint sensor is far more responsive (That was noted as a common complaint but no issues here)This version of Android is lighter, not loaded down with weird Samsung apps that can't be removed.The bad consists of the features I most frequently used or relied on before:Chat bubbles are a mess and seem to lack the seamless flow I am used to.The blinking LED indicators for power and notifications I relied on for so many years are non-existent.Closing out of all apps at once is a chore, requiring the user to scroll across everything open.Just getting to Settings or simply adjusting ring/notification volume is a multi-step task.The vibration (Even at max) is so weak I don't even notice it.In short, this phone lacks what I want most from a device and doesn't have enough advancements to even out the losses."
"Bought this phone 10 months ago. Now my screen starts flickering green then goes black. Apparently it's a known issue and had to send it back for RMA. Other than that the phone is ok, nothing crazy in terms of performance. Pictures are quite beautiful."
"I've had this phone for 11 months now, and I can finally say that I truly hate it. I tend to hold onto a phone for 5 years, coming to the Pixel 8 Pro from a Galaxy S9+. I'll be switching to an iPone as soon as possible.The first major issue I had was upon opening it and starting it up. It took hours, and nothing happened.  None of my apps transferred, nothing was downloaded, it was a mess. It two 3 calls with their online support to find that there was some sort of Google Play Store bug that locked me out of being able to install apps. After a few days of not being able to use the phone I was finally reinstalling apps one by one. The gesture controls are truly terrible. The button use for pulling up the assistant is annoying as hell, and now after a November 2024 update, I have an extremely annoying haptic response on touching the screen that can't be turned off. This has been the worst phone I've in decades."
"I bought this phone and thought long and hard about keeping it.  I shouldn't have.  In the short time I've had it the battery has started running down in a day.  Sometimes it doesn't charge.  The heat is terrible, I can feel the heat really hot in my hand, and I have to let it cool down before I can use it or recharge.  I'm so disappointed because I paid for something that doesn't deliver.  I'm probably going to be forced to buy a replacement, but it won't be this kind. Not sure how it can last long with the heat. I'm like so many people who can't afford to keep spending money on an inferior product."
"So I had a Google Pixel 4 and now just got the 8....well I don't see any improvements!! I had issues with it being slow and I thought audio and video was mediocre. Now I have an 8 and still feel the camera, speakers etc are not better. I had to take upgrade only because some of my apps stopped working.  Not impressed for the money spent and upgrade from 4 to 8."
"I had a 4 year old Moto G7.  It worked great, up until about a year ago.When I needed updates, the phone would act unpredictably.  For example, it gave a 6 mile route recommendation on Google maps for a 1-mile straight line route with no traffic, construction, or other obstacles.Then about 6 months ago, even when fully updated, it would bog down or respond oddly all the time.Google maps would almost always send me on long routes, like it had lost all ability to calculate route distance for determining fastest route.  Other apps were malfunctioning too.I use very few apps.  Virus checks came up with nothing.It seemed to be more obsolete and unusable with every update.So, I replaced it, with this one.The Pixel works fine.  When you are in range of good cell signal.If you're the least bit off the grid, this phone is almost worthless.  Where I used to be able to call text, and occasionally get internet with my old phone.  Now, when I'm out of town, I can go all day without being able to make a call or get a text with this phone.  And, forget about internet.I do like the biometric fingerprint sensor on the front.Yeah, otherwise, it's just another phone."
"Actual customer/user here. Google phones' hardwear was always junk. I used pixel 1, pixel 5 for years and had google replace them several times for power issues several times, as i recall. recently, i bought pixel 8 from google store and pixel * pro from amazon. Both have the same problem, they are impossible to  use as phones, at least on t-mobile service. the sound will drop off on your end or for the other end of the call. whats up voice calls work fine. google replaced pixel 8 once already, went over with google and T-mobile customer service, tried eSIM, new physical SIM. No use."
"Replaced my dead Pixel 6 with this incredibly disappointing overpriced ""upgrade"" that is actually a downgrade.Basically they removed basic features that Pixel Users relly on such as the headphone jack and the power button....well there is a power button, but instead of default turning on and off the phone it activates Google's handy dandy privacy violating wiretap device, Google Assistant.Also switching between apps is incredibly frustrating, as well as returning to a previous page because the swiping doesn't register half the time.After hours of searching the web and messing around with menues (mostly hidden or buried) I was able to get the power button back as well as the proper menu to navigate apps. Phones this expensive should be convenient, not waiting hours of my time so I can get it to function properly and turn off their privacy invading features (you want my data, you gotta buy it from me, not charge me to steal it away).And no headphones or mic jack? The standard that made folks even consider buying a Pixel over an iPhone.I mean I hate apple too, but why would I spend more money on a phone that has the same crappy stuff everyone who avoids iPhones hates.And yeah, I know you can get a headphones to work with an adapter, making the phone no longer fit in your pocket and an easily breakable add on that you have to pay separately (even though they increased the price of the phone).The second you start requiring add on adaptors for a smartphone your business model has instantly become stupid and worthless. It's no longer a smartphone if you have to carry a case of accessories just to use it the same as the phone you had a year before without all that add on crap that is just more to break, get lost and pretty much stops the mobile phone from being mobileA mix of greed and stupidity really caused Google to screw the pooch on this one. Don't they ever do user testings or consider user experience?Planning on returning this garbage as soon as I can and get a real phone."
"It pains me to criticize what is probably a very good phone, but I've pretty much reached my limit with products that are sold with absolutely no regard for the consumer.This cell phone is boxed with no charging cable (only a data transfer cable) and no Instruction or User manual.  To shell out $1,000 for a phone that you cannot charge or find out how to use without purchasing additional items or going on YouTube to watch a video is near criminal, in my opinion.  There is not even a diagram that shows where the power on/off button is located, where to insert the SIM card, where the volume control button is, etc.  I'm sure the phone has a lot of wonderful features, but good luck guessing as to what they are, or how to take advantage of them, without any type of insert or manual to read.I've gone through this problem before, and it seems that the more expensive the item is, such as a computer or television, the less assistance is provided at the time of purchase in terms of its usage and functionality.  Enough is enough!  To not even include a wall adapter to charge the phone is the height of ridiculousness and absolute cheapness on Google's part.  You just spend $1,000 and their response is to thumb your nose at you, with the gall and assumption that you can just figure everything out on your own.  Google touts all these wonderful features such as a Telephoto Lens and a Super Actual Display (whatever the heck that means), in addition to Artificial Intelligence and then leaves you high and dry as to how to use those features.  Granted, most people can probably figure a lot of it out on their own, but this smartphone is considered by critics to be among the Top 3 phones of the year, which means it has stats and capabilities that far exceed the typical throwaway burner phone.So, help us out a little, will you?  I just spent $1,000.  Why did I spend this much money, to just throw a product at me and then ask me to just figure everything out on my own, or do the work that you should have done for me?  Shame on you, Google!"
"Bad fingerprint reader (a widly known issue). Clunky UX, all around. My base level anxiety is up all the time because of how badly executed this device is, where even the most simple interactions are fumbled. It's constantly irritating, just like having a rock in your shoe, or a hangnail. The only reason I'm sticking with this is because I hate iPhones even more, and LG stopped making their flagship G series phones so long ago that they're too outdated. This model is so half-baked it's not even funny. Do more research and find something else, and then give that other one a shot."
It's an upgrade over the old phone I had. More tech and bells and whistles which is good in a way but in others not so much. Thought I'd give google a try. Don't like that it transcribes everything that's said and is very annoying when your texting and your text also includes what's being said around you.  Don't have a person to provide answers on how to stop this.No customer service.  Found out on my own to turn the microphone off whenever I need to text. Then in the middle of  texting I get a phone call and have to turn the microphone back on. Hate to know Big Brother is listening.  I'll definitely go back to Samsung in the future.
"The camera is ok, but the screen is terrible. I changed it twice because a black dots appear after a few time. The pure android really uncomfortable for use. To charge the phone for 100% takes 24 hours, I don't know why. The Google support is terrible."
I don't know if I'm just used to Samsung or what but this phone sucks. The battery life is 6 hours tops. (NOT great for traveling!) It's practically impossible to intentionally see all open tabs at once. I just have to keep trying until I accidentally perform whatever magical operation makes it work. I will say the facial recognition unlock is stupid fast and easy. The fingerprint reader does not work in the dark though.I came from a Z Fold 4 that may or may not be repaired. I was told the camera on this phone was exceptional but I have not experienced that yet.  I think I'm going to return this and go back to my old Note 9 until I can afford a Samsung again.
"Global Connectivity Hurdles: A Formal Review of Google Pixel 8's 5G LimitationsAs an IT engineer, my profession not only demands but relies on the bleeding edge of technology, particularly in terms of connectivity and mobile computing. Recently, I embarked on a business trip across Asia, with scheduled meetings in Japan, Hong Kong, and Thailand, carrying what I believed was one of the most sophisticated tools in mobile technology—the Google Pixel 8. However, my experience highlighted a critical and disappointing oversight by Google: a software lock on 5G connectivity, an unexpected flaw for a company at the helm of Android development.Upon arrival in Japan, a country known for its cutting-edge mobile networks, I was surprised to find my device restricted to 4G services. Assuming a temporary issue, I proceeded with my tasks, only to encounter the same limitation in Hong Kong and subsequently in Thailand. Each location, despite having robust 5G infrastructure, was a reminder of my device's unexpected shortcoming.Determined to find a solution, I reached out to Google support, only to learn that this was not a malfunction but a deliberate design decision—a software lock preventing access to 5G networks in certain regions, regardless of local network capabilities or user needs. This restriction is particularly perplexing and frustrating given Google’s role as a leading developer of the Android platform, which is supposed to champion accessibility and user-centric features.This limitation not only hampered my ability to work efficiently—relying on slower data speeds in bustling metropolitan areas—but also reflected poorly on Google’s commitment to serving its customers, particularly professionals who depend on seamless global connectivity. As a first-party developer, Google has the responsibility to ensure that its devices are not just competitive in terms of hardware but are also free of unnecessary software restrictions that can cripple functionality.In this instance, the Google Pixel 8, although impressive in many aspects, falls short in a fundamental area that directly impacts professionals in IT and software engineering. The inability to access 5G networks due to a software lock is not a trivial matter but a significant oversight that undermines the utility of a device marketed as a tool for developers and engineers. This experience serves as a stark reminder that even the most reputable technology companies can make decisions that profoundly affect user experience and not always for the better.Go buy an IPhone, don't be stupid."
"I bought this thinking this would be a great purchase for the next years. I was super happy with my previous smart phone (OnePlus 5) and don't feel this Pixel will come as close to the performance i had with the previous one.Cons- Battery lasts day and a half, so that will only decrease. Dont think it will be able to live the 7 year service promised by google.- You can't customise the default launcher- Chunkier than expected. The phone does not have a weigh balance, camara side is way heavier and that makes holding the phone (i.e. video watching) a pain, since your index fingers will hold more weight than your palm/thumb.- Back button does not work properly at times, specially when the phone is lying horizontally- You cant mirror a picture with the default apps.Pros:- Good camara- 7 Year service/update promiseOverall, i would not buy this phone again nor recommend for the price."
"The Google Pixel 8 is a solid very very well built and very good looking device. My issue came with the tuning of the software. I lost track of how many times I'd go to open my YouTube app and it would freeze stop stutter just not open. Now this is a device where Google designed the phone designed the SOC designed the software and made the YouTube app and their own app wouldn't function properly on the phone. Other apps suffered similarly. My point? At this stage 8th in the series no less, the jittery stumbling hiccuping software is just too much for me to put up with I mean it's great that they are doing a better job with bug fixes and updates but for a brand new phone it's performance out of the box was just not at an acceptable level. I'm sorry, but that's lame and they need to do better. How can you control every aspect of a phone's production and still produce a product whose software isn't fully baked and tuned to perfection?"
The older version was easier to use.  Dislike having to tell it to turn off instead of just pressing the button to turn off.
"Phone functions well, camera is terrific and the updates are nice. However, the screen flickers quite often while watching videos and playing games. The battery life is awful, there is no fast charging and I am usually down to less than 10% before the end of the day."
"I like the case a lot, but the screen protector interferes with the touch screen sometimes. I'll have to tap multiple times or press really hard just to get the signal through to the phone."
I haven't tried the face recognition so can't rate it but the fingerprint reader works poorly.  Previous phones came with user manuals but this one has no instructions at all.  Very poor decision there as different phones work differently.  Phone's camera seems to work well from what little I've used it and the battery life is excellent.
"It's ok. Took absolutely forever to transfer everything from my pixel 7 to this 8 pro. Literal hours. That's the biggest annoyance with h android ( life long iPhone user before this) updates take forever and so does transfers even pixel to pixel. And the settings say 60-120hz. Not 1-120hz like advertised. Also I went to use the photo editor features this photo was advertised with and it says ""some editing tools need to o be installed. Connect to WiFi to start installing"" so I had to wait hours before even being able to use the few features of the 8 series.Overall just a very second class experience coming from an iPhone in my opinion. Google just gives half effort again and again. Finger print reader is also hit or miss as well.-STILL GETS REALLY HOT-FINGERPRINT READER IS HIT OR MISS-FACE UNLOCK DOSNT WORK IN ANY LOW LIGHT SITUATIONNOT WORTH THE FULL MSRP NOT EVEN CLOSEWAIT FOR THIS  TO GO ON SALE BEFORE BUYING. DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS PHONE."
This handset feels very good in the hand and is easy to use single handed most of the time.  The features could put the phone a leg up on all of the phones but for some reason they decided to be self limiting.... For instance the Tap Back feature is cool but Apple just gave you my iPhone 13 this feature w a 2 tap and 3 tap option.... Voice response to Hey Google or Ok Google is inconsistent. And it just feels like it isn't ready to go to work for me right out of the box.  Downloads inside the camera app to get that cool advertised features.  Charging... Why??!!  Why be so self limiting to make this the slowest charging phone I've ever had in the past 2 years.  It's a brand new model and slow As... Terrible.  Please Pixel please get up off the couch and get these tweaks fixed... Boom you'd blow out all others
"Viaje a Estados Unidos en octubre, aprovechando el viaje, quería comprar un Pixel 7 Pro. Me encontré con la oferta de lanzamiento del Pixel 8 Pro y el Pixel watch 2, al volver a mi País, note que mi teléfono no conectaba a la Red 5G, consulte con el operador y este me dijo que  el Pixel 8 Pro es compatible con los servicios 5G de la red. Al consultar en la página de Google, confirme que, efectivamente, el teléfono es compatible, pero es Google, quien decide inhabilitar esta tecnología (Por la cual pague), en países donde el teléfono no tiene venta oficial. Lo que es peor, vienen con esta práctica desde el Pixel 4 5G. Un mal chiste. Hubiese devuelto el teléfono de inmediato de haber contado con la información. Amazon debería activamente advertir a los compradores viajeros para minimizar las malas experiencias.En cuanto al Pixel Watch 2 y sus funciones de salud no son nada versus a las de samsung y su Galaxy Watch, Google te cobra por todo, incluso limita el uso de las funciones del reloj en otros países.Traducido con bardI traveled to the United States in October, and I wanted to take advantage of the trip to buy a Pixel 7 Pro. I found the launch offer for the Pixel 8 Pro and the Pixel Watch 2. When I returned to my country, I noticed that my phone could not connect to the 5G network. I consulted with my carrier, and they told me that the Pixel 8 Pro is compatible with the carrier's 5G services. When I consulted Google's website, I confirmed that the phone is indeed compatible, but Google decides to disable this technology (for which I paid) in countries where the phone is not officially sold. What's worse, they have been doing this since the Pixel 4 5G. It's a bad joke. I would have returned the phone immediately if I had had the information. Amazon should actively warn traveling buyers to minimize bad experiences.As for the Pixel Watch 2 and its health features, they are nothing compared to Samsung's Galaxy Watch. Google charges you for everything, even limiting the use of the watch's features in other countries."
"The camera is great on this phone, but otherwise it feels like having an iPhone. If you want android, you probably want the versatility it offers as opposed to the iPhone. The Pixel has great photos, but not the versatility that Android should have."
I've owned about 12 different cell phones over the years ranging from cheap $50 phones to the more expensive latest iphones and this pixel 8. This phone is by far the most delicate of any phone I've ever owned. As I was setting it down on the table it fell out of my hands and dropped a distance of no more than 2 feet. This was enough for the back of the phone to crack. The screen cracked the next day even though nothing else happened to the phone. Google's warranty does not cover any damage to the back or the screen. It will cost a couple hundred dollars to replace the screen. I have decided it isn't worth spending another $200 to fix the screen on a phone that is so delicate it will likely just break again. And I don't want to have to keep it in some kind of protective case all the time so I'm just going to get a different phone. I've dropped iphones and cheap $50 samsung phones many times from much higher distances without the screens cracking.
"Some decent features, the camera is generally good but lacks some really basic features like being able to take a picture while videoing. Also the camera tech overexposed backgrounds sometimes. The Bluetooth doesn't connect to my car. I'd go for the s24 which my wife has and it just seems better all round."
"Battery life:The Pixel 8 Pro's battery life is the most inconsistent variable in the phone. I got 5 hours of SOT that landed me on 68 percent, but the next day it was 2 hours of SOT with 47 percent by the end of the day. The phone while being used has great battery life, but the idle consumption with 5G on kills the phone super fast. Yes this is the reason why its only three stars.fingerprint reader:The fingerprint reader is great on this phone, and it has a night-and-day difference after coming from the Pixel 6, but the screen protector that I got made it very inconsistent. (not the phone's fault)Value for money:The Pixel 8 pro features are gimmicks that don't justify the price difference from the normal Pixel 8 so go for the normal 8 and save some money."
"This phone will not pair with any of my devices, including my car. The microphone does not work at all. I'm returning it for these reasons. I sure wish the phone would have worked correctly, I liked the phone because it's big and the speaker has the best volume of any phone I've ever owned. Too bad it has some problems with pairing and the microphone"
"This phone is a beauty, great build quality, great screen, great sound quality. Super duper easy setup from my old phone. I did not use the camera much although that is why I bought it.I expected to have an adjustment period with the phone, getting used to this one after using Samsung and Sony phones, but this one was so, so annoying and the OS is very invasive. I expected this as Google exists to suction all of your personal information. But I believed the assurances that I could stop the vacuuming and adjust the permissions. I adjusted the permissions but felt harassed by the constant request for permissions anyway. Every Google app wanted location, access to all photos, all files, and the entire contact list. No.I returned the phone. Thank you, Amazon! I am going to get the Samsung S24."
"The default software on this phone is like malware, or maybe more aptly described as digital cockroaches (my apologies to actual insects). The folks at google want you to do the stuff that they want you to do, the way they they want you to do it. For example, the power button to turn off the phone defaults after update to activating google voice assistant, even if you have gone through two or three submenus to disable it. That is because you have to deselect that as an option in the another sub menu that assigns gestures to buttons, and defaults to using Google Voice. Multiple unintuitive menus predominate user 'experience'. Essentially the OS seems to be spyware designed to get your habits and data onto their servers. You'd think that updates might improve it, but they are not interested in giving you control over this device, and each update changes the menu. Beyond frustrating. Never again. There are reasons why Google phones are cheaper than Apple or Samsung, and none of those reasons are good ones for users."
Screen always black even when I I reset the phone
"While it has a lot of value for the price, it doesn't mirror to the TV without wifi. It is actually impossible to mirror to the TV in a hotel room. This is something that my Samsung phone does with ease with Smartview. There are rumors of a HDMI cable but that was short-lived in a beta firmware release. This is a huge disappointment for me as I otherwise like the phone. I ended up returning it."
"I ended up returning this phone because it kept constantly restarting everyday five to eight times per day without me prompting it to do so. Also, the OS was glitchy when flipping between multiple pages on a browser and would occasionally just freeze up for 20 to 30 seconds as it processed. I really thought the larger RAM and new tech would be worth the purchase but I found myself wishing I bought the pixel 7 or 6 instead. Best way it redeems itself is in the extended update guarantee of 7 years. We'll see if Google updates in the future fix any of these problems."
"Ships with Android 14, not Android 13.  Android 14 will not install old apps but will run them.  So migration of old apps fails.  Android 13 would migrate old apps, then if install Android 14 after migrating old phone to new phone, old apps will be installed and working."
"Things I like:-$800 good price-7 years of support-fantastic camera system-great battery life-speakers sound goodThings I dont like-no sd card slot-audio source switcher nonexistant-cant customize navigation buttons-changing the brightness is a hassle-gallery app is mega garbage; cant sort or group photos, cant nest folders, cant change cover photo of album, cant change size of thumbnails, cant sort by media type-phone is making random calls without input and playing audio in the bg with no apps openI've come from using Samsungs for nearly the past decade and decided to switch it up since Im not really fond of what Samsung is doing with their latest phones. The stock Android experience is just awful, and feels like an iPhone with how pittle customization and control you have. Now I can hear you through the screen saying ,""just root your phone and do what you want."" No, I should not have to go through hoops to have features that I have become accustomed to. It feels like Google put way too much time and effort into the AI features that I am not reaply going to ever use and forgot all about the things that make a phone pleasant to use. We as a society have severely reduced our expectations and accepted that ""things just are"", but I promise you that they aren't, and we can vote with our wallets to make a substantial difference."
"I really wanted to love this phone, but I cannot recommend it based on my poor experience. I don't know if I received a defective example or if there is a bigger quality issue. When I received my phone I proceeded with the usual setup and data transfer from my old Samsung. All the apps moved over without a hitch, but the transfer failed on moving over my pictures. There was nothing that worked, not even a hard reset would make it happen. I did not want to download apps to do it so the option was to download my pictures to Google drive and then to the phone. The issue is, Google only gives you so much space for free before you have to pay and mine was filling up fast, to the point that now Google was asking me to pay for more storage. Not good, and I am wondering if this is a ploy to make more money... Other problems continued to happen as well. The screen rotate function would not work even though the functions were turned on. The screen lock wake up to touch would not work even when the function was turned on. The camera app would be slow to engage to take a photo, literally 3-5 second delay before you could take a photo. Sometimes the camera app would open, but then close for no apparent reason. Google maps would stop responding when a route selected, literally no response to touch whatsoever. A hard reset would fix one or the other issue, but not all. Another hard reset would again fix one issue, but not the other. I contacted Google support, but all they could offer is another hard reset or a replacement under warranty, but they could not guarantee if the phone would be brand new or refurbished. I decided to return my Pro 8 and have no choice but try my luck with another device. Wanted to love my Pro 8, but it left me disappointed."
"I have had ongoing connectivity issues,not resolved yet with updates. I hope it will eventually be resolved. I would not have bought this phone if I knew of its issues.The battery does not last long either, unfortunately. I find myself charging it at least once per day."
The screen has a curve around the edges that makes it hard to keep a screen protector on without bubbles.  There are times when it does not respond when I'm trying to reply to a message or when opening an email.  I have to restart the phone in order to correct this issue.  I like that there will be 7 years of updates on this phone.  I just hope it lasts that long.
"Phone has a bright screen, great camera and is very responsive. But it has artificial intelligence and they should capitalize the word artificial because the phone's constantly trying to get ahead of you. And you have a lot of pop-up ads and stuff happening that you really don't need. For instance, the microphone doesn't turn off when you quit talking so anything in the background gets recorded. It just really actually takes some getting used to. This is not your your Grandad's Android. This is an Android on steroids. I'm going to give it some time."
I've been trying to reach someone but my phone service keeps telling me my phone is not unlocked and not compatible to use it
"Not sure if I got a defective phone or notMy phone has been over heating since day one and now it's starting to freeze continuously.I've upgraded from a Flip 5G and it's like night and day.The battery life is amazing, I can get a solid 18 hrs with constant use ( total upgrade from the 7 hours I would get from my Flip5G)The camera is amazing, comparable to the new iPhone 15 pro or Samsung.I've seen other say you get free GoogleOne for 6 months but I did not receive that offer.Finger print does well, if your screen is wet or your finger is damn then it won't read itMy only concern is the fact that it's over heating and freezing"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            My experience with the Pixel 8 has been a complete nightmare. Despite the Pixel series' reputation, this phone turned out to be one to avoid at all costs.The first issue was a factory defect in the screen: an annoying purple line that completely ruined the visual experience. This problem, which wasn't caused by any impact, surfaced just two months after purchase, rendering the phone practically useless.Battery life is another sore point. Despite expecting a device of this caliber to keep up with daily needs, the reality was disappointing. The battery drained quickly, even with moderate use, requiring constant recharging throughout the day.The only redeeming quality of the Pixel 8 is its camera, but honestly, what's the point of having an excellent camera if the rest of the phone is a disaster? The camera's quality doesn't outweigh the fundamental issues with this model.To make matters worse, the post-sales customer service from both Amazon and Google has been abysmal. It's as if you need a manual on how to navigate Google's website to find the exact section that connects you with the warranty department. This frustrating process only adds to the overall disappointment.In summary, my experience with the Pixel 8 has been a real letdown. I cannot recommend this phone to anyone, as factory issues, poor battery life, slow performance, and terrible customer service make it a misguided investment. Not even Google's reputation or purchasing through Amazon can salvage this disastrous device. Avoid the Pixel 8 at all costs."
"I loved my Pixel 7 Pro. Aside from the missing headphone jack and non-replaceable battery, it was everything I could want in a cellphone. That is until it overheated and shut down while wirelessly charging in my car. Then I noticed the volume switch was missing.I returned the 7 Pro and a couple months later replaced it with the 8 Pro. It had to be better than the 7 Pro, right?  Well, I don't know about overheating because the weather is much cooler in December, but at least the volume switch didn't fall offUnfortunately the 8 Pro wouldn't wirelessly charge while I was listening to the headphones, which I do every night. I never had this problem on the 7 Pro, or on my two other previous Google phones. Google Customer Support was absolutely no help. They just wanted me to sell me their brand of charger. Best Buy, who I didn't even purchase the phone from, was kind enough to confirm I had a hardware issue, so now the 8 Pro has also been returned.Before the models 7 and 8, my previous two Google phones performed flawlessly. Though I have zero desire for another brand of phone, I am purchasing my first iPhone, the 15 Pro Max, which falls far short of the Pixel 8 Pro in many ways that are important to me. I just don't see that I have another choice. I can't keep buying and returning Pixel phones and waiting one-to-two months until I receive my Amazon refund. And I don't care all that much for Samsung phones.I only wish Amazon would provide a replacement instead of a refund. I would gladly give Pixel all the chances they need to get me one that works. Unfortunately I was never given this options so reluctantly on to Apple I go."
Gets overshadowed by the 15 pro max or s24 ultra little weaker on performance.
"I have had a Pixel ever since the first one, also brought them for our IT users. I love how my entire digital life is tied together. I also loved every time an Apple user was complaining that they had to delete photos to back up their phone.  This was not an issue with Pixel because Pixel had free photo storage until now.  So I upgraded to a Pixel pro and lost my free photo backups, which really sucks.  I will probably start using OneDrive since 1terabite is included in most office packages."
Phone works great but battery life is short. Heats up often.
"Replaced my four-year-old PXL 4 that I paid $220 for.Pros: Camera, screen brightness, processor.Cons: PXL 8 Pro is a little larger than it had to be. When set to show display by touching screen or picking it up, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. The touch screen has nowhere near the accuracy and sensitivity of my PXL 4, this is even more important with the additional screen real estate and even less understandable considering the price difference. Moving the fingerprint sensor to the front was a bonehead idea in my opinion. Less user friendly and more difficult to use with a screen protector and easier to drop. The first phone I received wouldn't even recognize my print through a screen protector, even after setting the phone for higher sensitivity and the phone had accepted the print. The replacement phone worked.Insufficient upgrades over a four-year-old model to be classified as a ""flagship,"" and cons that should have been eliminated in R&D before the phone was released is inexcusable. Especially for a phone costing at least three times as much as a model from four years ago when you factor in inflation."
"All the time it either frizzs or does not recognize the SIM card. I need to restart it several times a day. Some programs crash when I open them. This phone cannot be the original pixel 8, it is refurbished I guess but when I was buying it nowhere was written about it."
"Purchased in January 2024. Was great until a couple of months ago. It dials a number even when no one is  touching it, converts speech to text and scrolls across the top of the phone also entered it into my text messages making it almost impossible to text. That's an example. I contacted the company and was told to reset to factory defaults which I did but it still isn't working right.They want me to take it to a repair center even though the nearest one is an hour away and I can't."
"I have always assumed pixel phones had the best cameras. This one was not noticeably better than my s22, but it still very good.Build quality seems good and the shade of blue was pleasing.However, I had to factory reset this thing three times in four weeks. I also routinely lost functionality requiring reboot. I'm going to assume it'll get better, but didn't want to bet that purchase price on it.AI features were excellent, loved the texting options."
"I used the Galaxy S20FE before using the Pixel 8pro.I wouldn't have bought it if they hadn't given me the Pixel watch 2.The Pixel has finally taken shape as a phone.There are many things that need to be fixed in the future, such as software bugs, support for folders on the app item screen instead of the front screen, and the back of the phone burning when charging wirelessly.However, looking into the future, it appears that a normal mobile phone will be released in about 5 years and will take a large share of Galaxy's market share.Work harder, Pixel managers!from a korean person"
"Overall the phone is okay.  I regret ""upgrading"" from my Pixel 6 pro.  I followed all google's instructions for backup and restore of information and got less than half of my stuff. What is frustrating is the failure of the Kindle app.  I use it nearly as much as I use the phone/texting frequency and far more in the total time of useage.  This is the Pixel 8 with Android v14 on it. The Kindle app will no longer open books that were not purchased from Amazon.On my other phones and tablets, none of which are Google Pixels or Android v14, the Kindle app still works with Non-Amazon books.I am trying to pin down whether it is the Google Pixel 8 or Android v.14.Has anyone else experienced this?If so, do you have a solution?I reached out to Amazon and Google and got no help.I read on my phone all the time and it is annoying to carry an old S8 just to read my books."
"The only reason I bought this phone is for pure Android and the direct Google updates. Otherwise, I would have purchased something else. The quality is just not there and it can be glitchy. My Pixel 3A worked better. If I could have updated my 3A I would have never purchased this phone. It seems every new Pixel Google puts out gets cheaper and cheaper."
Certainly a nice phone. I bought this to replace my 3 year old Pixel 4a. Obviously a good bit more expensive than the 4a was.I'm not sure what i was expecting but maybe other than the camera i could not tell the difference in the performance of the two phones. They really seem exactly the same.
"I've been buying Pixels 5, 6, 7. The 8 is much smaller than the prior models. Pay attention to size. Most likely a marketing ploy to get you to buy the larger phone. Regretful purchase, I should have gotten the Pro."
"The Pixel 8 seems like a great phone but the one I received randomly shuts down and won't turn back on for a few minutes. It completely locks up and then turns off. Isn't clear what causes it but looking online this is not an uncommon problem and none of the possible fixes worked.The real issue is that Google support requires that I take the phone to their designated IT shop and will not give a timeline for how long they have to keep it. They will not replace it even though this is a known issue. They also said to talk to Amazon but Amazon will only let me return it and buy a new one. Luckily the price hasn't gone up since black Friday so I'm only out the money for a few weeks until the refund processes. Google says talk to Amazon, Amazon says it's a Google problem. Typical lack of ownership of a faulty product and bad quality control. I'm hoping the new phone actually works but it doesn't give me a lot of hope switching to Google phones. Might just go back to Samsung."
"This may be different from the Pro model, but the overall - software and hardware - experience left much to be desired. In this case, the software is not properly tuned for the hardware prowess. There are slight lags, jerks, vanishing navigation arrows, etc., creating a jarring experience.The battery life could be better in the smaller Pixel 8, and you'd be hard-pressed to get it through the day especially if you have the 120 Hz motion set to on.I can NOT recommend Pixel 8 in its current software-optimized state."
"No matter how hard I try, I'm getting no notifications from twitter no matter what. I easily received notifications from all my other phones except this one. First time getting google pixel. Camera quality is good, and no lag while gaming, but this one defect really upset me :("
"Had this phone since January, switching from a Samsung Galaxy S20. It was a painful transition process, but I had hoped it will work better as it doesn't have all the Samsung customized apps and features added. It did work as expected at first, although the camera isn't as good as advertised when comparing with my spouse's S23. I can live with it. But now after more than 2 months owning the phone, out of a sudden, my phone stays warm all the time even when not in use. I thought it was the Google Assistant feature I finally set up a week ago. Turning it off didn't help. I searched online and tried all the tips I can find. Nothing worked. I finally contacted Google. The rep just blamed me for not using a Google charger. But the phone didn't come with a charger! And this battery issue just appears to be a known problem on Pixel phones and it doesn't happen right away. It only happens several months after activation. In my case, almost 3 months after I started using the phone. I can't return it now and Google support is useless. I will now try to recover my costs through purchase warranty on my credit card. In any case, I so regret getting this phone at such a premium price. Disappointment doesn't say enough of my experience. Now I have to back up everything again then buy and switch back to Samsung Galaxy!"
"The pixel 8 pro seems like a nice phone but with this new phone, there were bubbles in the main screen and the rear camera throws reflection of any light present at night.. It looks weird. The photo looks noisy though that's not noise, rather, the grains are copies of the source of light.Other things are good, but camera's performance at night is disturbing and not nice."
Cannot individualize text notifications. Other features are a lot more difficult to find or navigate. Not what I expected from a fairly expensive phone. My old Samsung was much much easier. The only reason I gave a 3 star rating was because of the camera and software.
"This is my first time trying a Pixel phone and I have been using it for 4 months now. It was going great and I loved everything about it. Pictures are great, and battery life is great. Since about a month ago, I noticed that the screen occasionally gets green and looks like static of all the pixels in the screen; however, the phone is still usable while this is happening. Well everything works except the finger print reading when this is happening. This keeps happening for some reason and the only remedy is when I press down hard on the left side of the screen. So this appears to be a hardware issue. I need to return this device before it gets worse because I spent a lot of money to get it and it has not yet been 5 months. I am very disappointed."
"While the screen was on for 1 hour, I lost 40% battery. I was not watching videos, downloading apps, or installing updates. This was after all the phone's setup was complete, and I was simply arranging apps onto the home screen and logging into various apps. 40% in an hour.As it turns out, 3 people I know all have the same phone, and could confirm that this was very much not normal. Their batteries last them a full day, sometimes two, at the very least. I can readily confirm that I received a unit with a horrendously defective battery. With the screen off, it will lose 5% battery every hour while not receiving any notifications at all. This is with 5G disabled, too, which many say is the cause of the battery draining.More over, the bluetooth was broken straight out of the box. Music stutters constantly and randomly mutes songs. I tried the ""fix"" people have for it, but it didn't help at all. My unit just came broken.The real issue is that I can't just send it back since I setup an Esim, and have no other phone that is Esim compatible. If you don't know, setting up an Esim bricks your physical sim card, making it useless. I would have to first buy yet another Google Pixel 8 before sending back the current one. This is stressful and a hassle since my phone is vital at work. Really don't recommend risking buying one through Amazon after this."
I like it. Couple of mishaps. The finger print sign in when I have a screen protector on regardless of pressing that function that allows fingerprint sign in to be better with protection screen. Doesn't really do anything. Also. No way to go back and forward on the Internet. That's annoying. Apple beats you there. As for camera. Sure amazing. But I don't care about cameras.
"I upgraded my pixel4a to this phone... don't notice much of a difference at all. Actually the 4 is better in a lot of ways. The 4 is lighter and it has a real finger print reader.The camera on the 8 is slightly better (not by much) but its clogged with so much AI that none of the photos you take with it even feel genuine. The camera ""features"" are just photoshop like taking out sky and replacing it with a completely different background... you can even replace your entire face. I don't like any of the photos cuz of how unauthentic they are.Wish I returned this and kept the 4a as I actually liked it better. If I had to do it again, I'd save the money and skip the 8 for sure."
The Phone would Freeze Up and The Touch Screen  would Not work From Time to time...  I wanted An Exchange for another one.... But They said I Couldnt.... and said I have to  it return it back...
Battery does not last long . Not happy with this smartphone.
"The phone is fine, works ok. But whatever bug was hitting it with weak wifi is still present on most recent software.  Unless you are on a really strong wifi signal the battery lasts, maybe 2 hours."
"My primary driver for buying this phone was Google's software update policy.  After having lived with it for over a month (and past the return window), I am having regrets.128GB storage is proving to be ridiculously small. The android OS uses a huge chunk of the storage.  Google charges an insanely big premium for adding storage that only costs them a few bucks.Wireless charging barely works, while the same wireless charger works fine on my other phones.Signal strength is lower than on my Samsung for the same tower and the same service."
"I was really looking forward to purchasing this phone due to all the hype and the free smart watch but it's been a nightmare. There are too many software glitches that render it un-usable: for example the Zoom on the camera stops working, the flashlight won't turn on, the screen won't wake up even when I smack it, fingerprint rarely works and the video camera auto darkens in the night, etc. These glitches are not only annoying but embarrassing since Google makes the software! Other glaring problems are battery life is terrible and recharging takes several hours whereas other flagship phones can recharge fully in as little as 10 mins!The only positive was the price: $799 for 256GB because the free smartwatch was un-deliverable and issued credit."
"I am so bummed with this phone. It is very glitchy. I'm hopefully it's something that can be fixed over time via software upgrades. But, right now, I really miss my Pixel 4. :("
"LIKED THE WAY THE PHONE WAS LAYED OUT AND ANDROID 14, BUT COULD NOT PUT UP WITH THE PHONE GETTING REALLY WARM, ESPECIALLY DURING CHARGING,ALSO VERY POOR SIGNAL .PHONE FROZE SEVERAL TIMES ,THAT WAS THE LAST STRAW!!! FOR THE ISSUES THIS PHONE HAD IT.."
Don buy this phone if you don have backup camera. Operating System is good. But phone camera back and front is not good. I had Samsung S20.  If Samsung is 10/10 Google camera is 1/10
"There is something wrong with the phone, it works something and something it freezes and I need to wait 2 minutes to use it again. I tried to do a return and the seller does not allow it and trying to go to google to find a solution for this, never found any help. In other words I have to live with it and that’s not cool"
"To start with, I'm annoyed that Google provides a charging cord and adapter which requires an additional adapter for the phone to be charged which the phone did not come with so I'm having to use my old phone cord (which needs replacing) until I can make this additional purchase. I'm upset that for the price I paid, the manufacturer can't even provide the correct charging piece.Next, I'm very unhappy with the functionality. I would like to get rid of or move the calendar that's stuck in the top left of the home screen and move the Google search bar from it's location at the bottom of the screen to the top  but so far nothing I have done has allowed for these changes which is annoying.Ease of use, the screen seems dimmer even when on bright than I'm use to and the swipe function to unlock the device is a bit finicky so I almost always end up having to swipe multiple times. I HATE that to open or close pages/apps you need to hold and swipe up.. I end up swiping over and over not getting the phone to do the function I need or want. If I could do it over again I absolutely wouldn't go with this device. This phone reminds me most of the I phone functionality which I also hate.Can't wait to switch back to a Samsung!"
Software and camera is top-notch but the battery life is abysmal. It has to be charged multiple times throughout the day.
"The finger printing works 50% of the time. The battery is underwhelming and the same if not worse than my old phone. Camera is underwhelming. Random loss of cellular connection which is very annoying. Doesn't feel worth what I paid for it as my old phone which was half the price functioned just as good.Update: every day I have this terrible phone, every day I hate it more. The settings don't function as they state. The signal is always sporadic and causes me problems in work and personal life. For example, I can't log in to my work computer if I can't get calls. This phone has so many problems I regret with every fiber of my being that I gave pixels a second chance. There is no redeeming fact about this phone, just frustration and hate. I cannot get a new phone because I just got this in December. If you hate yourself this is a great phone for youI hate this phone so muchEdit: 7/24 i hate this phone ever more than last time. I regret giving pixel a second chanceEdit: 12/11/24 still hate this phone. Now I'm having screen issues. Never in my life have I had this many problems with a phone. I've treated my older phone even worse and they've held up much better. Can't wait to get a new phone"
"I have tried 2 different Pixel 8, neither will activate on tracfone. They can't find a valid IMEI #. I don't know what to do. I like Pixel & Tracfone, but now the two won't dance together. I am really disappointed in this bad situation. It has been time consuming to load data and then find out about no phone service, because it won't work. All my previous Pixels have worked on Tracfone without a problem. This really sucks. I guess the blame rests with Google, so I will have to fine another phone."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This phone is not brand new and nowhere on the ad does it say it's ""a used phone"" besides it cost the same as a brand new one on Google store anyways. Also it came in a garbage packaging with no protection but one layer of bubble wrap in a loose box. The phone probably works but its messed up that I paid $1000+ when I could have the same phone for brand new. I would recommend you don't buy here. I added a video of the rattle noise not sure if there is audio on reviews."
"As a end user, I tend not to write low scoring reviews. Google to me has a name recognition to safely say they deserve a low review if their product does not meet a level of expectation.The Pixel 8 is not a finished product. Mainly because simple commands are difficult to resolve.A good example is, if you are doing a search on the internet and you receive a phone call, you may be challenge to find the screen to be able to take the call.The list of things wrong with the phone is lot longer, I just summarize by saying, do not recommend this phone to a friend."
"This was my 2x trying Amazon Renewed. This time I purchased the LAST stated available 2023 described as ""In OEM box, Box shows wear from opening"". The Moto Razor Flip phone was described as ""Like new"". Immediately upon arrival w/o even opening the box I knew it was wrong as the package was far too light. I opened it & there was a Moto Razor w/obvious discoloration on the case from use + a CHIP in the bottom screen. Packaging was similar to a top end Samsung I ordered from Amazon Renewed & fulfilled by a 3rd Party in FL 2 years ago. I saved due to credit only $20 @ checkout over a NEW One.  WORSE there's NO WAY to return this immediately (There' are 2 Amazon Return 2 locations within 2-5 minutes of my house. Just came back from one & CS stated ""I've never seen this"")). Instead Amazon MAY notify me when they'll ONLY pickup from my house in 3 days.I had this EXACT same problem with a $700+ Laptop that was supposed to be Brand New. I'm beyond a coder or tech guy & ran a battery cycle count software on that as the battery lasted 2 hours less than advertised. It was obviously a RETURN, re-sold as NEW, unless Compaq sells Laptops w/over 200 battery cycles already on them. Same thing w/2 PB's & a CH Android Tablet which still had the previous User's name & account information installed. Seriously, WHO is doing QC? I'll NEVER use Renewed again. Period. Even when you buy a NEW item it's 50/50 now you'll get someone else's return sold as New! eBay here I come again. Worst thing this was supposed to be a gift. OBVIOUS Screen CHIP really ticks me off. Since 2022 I'm now 2 for 8+ on purchases of tech devices.  Buy with caution!"
"I've waited for years for the right moment that foldable are common enough to a tad cheaper than $1,200. Even at $700, it's still not really worth it. The Mediatek chip in the standard, non plus model is slow as crap. It lags, and hangs on even the simplist tasks, like using the camera. My cpu is spiked at 100% most of the time, even if it's JUST YouTube or Instagram being used. The build quality is decent, and screens look good, but the viewing angles in bright sunlight are terrible. The battery life, kinda mid. Sometimes I'll get home from work and have 55%, and sometimes 25%, it's really irregular. The device also gets concerningly warm while on a wireless charger for too. The case selection is also terrible, and no rugged or tough cases are available. Yet otterbox makes them for the Z Flip.  I seriously wouldn't buy another foldable unless it's shockingly better than this. This was a humongous waste of money. And, to add insult to injury, Motorola dropped the price to 499 literally 2 days after I paid $700. 3/5, not terrible but not great. They should've at least put a snapdragon 600 series in here."
"I am a very average smartphone user and just can't justify spending the $1k or more that most phone manufacturers want to charge for their flagship phones. I just need a phone with a good camera, decent storage and enough oopmh to be able to quickly browse apps and social media. I don't do gaming or use a lot of the bells and whistles most phones come with. I was intrigued by the flip form factor and old enough to remember how much I loved my pride and joy, a Motorola razr phone circa 2007. I thought I would try a Motorola again since I haven't had one since that original razr. I found myself irritated almost on a daily basis with my Pixel phone not fitting into my pants pockets, so this return to the compact flip phone has been an absolute pleasure. I find that I don't lose my phone anymore because I'm not constantly setting it down in random spots, it's always in my pocket.The phone is zippy enough to load webpages and photos quickly when browsing. The user interface is really similar to my Pixel, which I loved. It's uncluttered, simple to use and intuitive (unlike my husband's Samsung which I hate using). I truthfully haven't used half the bells and whistles I'm sure this phone comes with, but that's one of the reasons I didn't buy a super high end phone in the first place.I have dropped it a couple times in the open and closed position with no issues, even though I don't have a case on it. The texture on the back of the phone makes it really nice to handle and keep hold of, as it's not slippery like most phones. I went into a store and test drove the Samsung Flip 5 phone and hated the feel of the crease in the screen. On the razr the crease is honestly so incredibly minimal you immediately forget it's there. I was worried switching to a flip phone that the crease would drive me nuts while scrolling but it's been a complete non issue. Battery life is pretty good so far. I can make it through the day without a recharge unless it's one of those days where I'm doing a ton of browsing. I basically don't use the tiny outer screen for anything except checking the time, but I knew going in that I wasn't the kind of person who enjoys using a tiny screen, which is why I didn't spend the extra on the razr plus. One annoying thing if you happen to have a Tesla, this will not charge properly on the Tesla's wireless charge pad because the charging spot inside the phone is too low to align with the charging spot on the pad of the car. I've worked around it by putting a little wedge on the pad to boost the phone up to the right spot, but it's annoying for sure. It charges fine on a normal wireless pad, although a bit slowly. It charges very quickly if plugged into a charger. Overall a really solid user experience, except for...The camera. Ugh. I'm not savvy enough to know if this is a hardware or software issue with Motorola's but the delay time from when you press the capture button to when the picture is captured is excruciating. For someone who is often taking pictures of little kids and animals who never hold still, that means I basically never get the shot I wanted. It's honestly so painful that it may be a deal breaker for this phone. I switched to this phone from a FIVE YEAR OLD Pixel phone and the razr camera is SO much worse. Shots are often blurry and it struggles so hard in lower light conditions. I have had this phone for almost a month now and I am already keeping an eye on new flip phones coming out because I can't wait to upgrade to one that has a decent camera. I will likely hold onto this one just long enough to find something with a better camera but I am truly disappointed because I feel like this phone had it almost perfect for an average user like me who is interested in getting into a flip smartphone without shelling out the big bucks."
"I loved my 2023 Razr so much that I decided to buy a new 2024 Orange Razr with the bigger battery and gave my 2023 Razr to my wife, I received my new 2024 Razr in perfect condition and delivery was quick and no complaints in that respest.  But i started to experience headaches and blurred vision and eye fatigue as soon a starting using this new phone, I read later on, on some online reviews that motorola increase the brightness on there 2024 Rasr to help with outdoors viewing, but they didn't provide any option to adjust in back to the 2023 model settings for people that would just prefer that option , there are no option to adjust the Contrast and Sharpness for example, yes there is brighness adjustment in the Display settings and on the widget ,but the brighness jump in increament of - + 10%  and trying to get a perfect brighness setting is difficult and for that reason I'm only giving the 2024 Rasz 3 stars"
"Bought the phone mostly because of the screen and the form factor at this price point. Purchased in orange. Feels really good and looks even cooler.Overall a good experience. Phone flips open very easily one handed but doesn’t feel flimsy. Very snappy during day to day  and all of my apps work on the outside screen, including apps that I couldn’t get to work on the z flip 5. Battery is darn good, but testing still in progress. The crease is almost non existent when in useNow my nitpicks.- Was promised a very bright screen (3000 nits at certain times I believe)…my iPhone 13 is brighter , so not sure what’s going on there- given the flip action you’ll be using your thumb to slide the phone open for daily use, prepare for the fingerprints. Not sure how good the oleophobic coating is, but in direct sunlight I’m just staring at a greasy plastic screen with unreadable text.- games that fly on my iPhone 13, barely run on this thing. Not sure if it’s a mediatek chip or an app issue.- mediocre photo quality during the day,, but absolutely terrible during the night.- video quality is not a term I would use as there is no quality, it stutters, hiccups, artifacts, blown out colors. Definitely not the phone for video.- not sure if this phone will ever get updates, given Motos track record.Overall a good phone. Maybe at 599 this would be a must have, but for this price, I might just spend the extra 100 for a galaxy s24 and get an amazing camera, a bunch of artificial intelligence and a way brighter screen …but that’s just me. If you absolutely need a flip phone at a decent price and decent performance while not taking any video or pictures in non ideal conditions i would buy this."
"I'll preface this by saying it's a fine enough phone. There's nothing technically wrong with it, the display is clear and crisp, the speakers are surprisingly competent, and the overall build is far sturdier than I expected. This is my first foldable phone, and there was about a week where I was just impressed with it, especially since I'd never seen one in person. Now to the frustrating things: The battery life is just awful, maybe I just got a dud, but it drains in just a couple hours. And not while doing anything intense, most of the time it's just sitting there closed. The worst power intensive thing I do is watch youtube, and that drains the battery in what feels like minutes. The power and volume buttons are also frustrating. I feel like it would have been a better decision to put them on opposite sides of the phone, that way you don't accidentally turn it off when you're just trying to adjust the volume. They're also ridiculously sensitive, I barely have to scrape past them and they'll go off. I also am not a fan of how tall the screen is, it's next to impossible to reach the entire screen with one hand, not to mention that it feels misaligned. I press on one part of the screen, and it actually clicks on something a few millimeters down. That sounds small, but it's a huge feel difference. I never feel quite in control of what I'm doing. Overall, it's a pretty decent phone, and I'm glad to have tried a folding screen, but I'm probably going to move back into a phone that isn't quite so frustrating for me."
"I have been an iphone user for the past 4 years and decided i wanted to try an android phone.  The fold phones were interesting so when Motorola was offering this phone under $400 i thought i would give it a try.  I realized that the biggest problem switching from an iphone was losing the rewards in various reward programs since i used the iphone option in creating accounts vs email address.Regarding the phone, the battery life does not last 8 hours.  I took the fully charged phone at around 8 am and it was dead around 3 pm.  i played PokemonGo for most of the time which drained the battery.  The good news is that this phone charges fast compared to my iphone.  The screen is taller and the crease doesnt really bother me.Another bad thing is that after 7 weeks there is a black round dot where the crease is.  It looks like a pixel went dead.  I have not dropped this yet so I guess the display is fragile."
"I purchased this phone on Black Friday because it was a GREAT deal.  My carrier is Xfinity Mobile (which uses the Verizon network).  They sell a Razr 2024 for use on their network, so I assumed this phone would be compatible.  Sadly, based on the IMEI, Xfinity Mobile says it is not compatible.  They could not really explain why, it's just not compatible.  I'm returning it, and will have to pay an extra $150 to get the same phone from Xfinity."
"An amazing phone, I love not having a long slab phone in my pocket. The phone is perfect in the hand, it is great to prop up and watch on a tabletop. Very responsive and the hinge is holding up well for the time that I have been using it with no cracking of the screen.The only major problem is that the screen suddenly stopped responding with a white bar on the right side and bottom of the screen. It was working fine at night then I folded it and set it on my nightstand, next day not working properly. This is a nuisance, but the final problem is that I cannot request a repair because the Motorola service website keeps throwing an error when I select the phone. Sucks, I miss the phone."
I liked the phone. The issues I had were my bluetooth ear piece kept getting unpaired. I actually returned the ear piece to Best Buy thinking it was defective. Nope. A bug in the Razr? My 1Password would work sometimes and sometimes it was very slow. So even though I liked the phone those were 2 things I couldn't work around
I've had this phone 6 months I love it but stopped working for two days I have not been able to use my phone the screen is not working or allowing to do anything I was told to replace the part is $340!
"Love the nostalgia. I was excited to give it to my wife. However, she found it very heavy to open the door and flip open. Additionally, she also found it quite irritating when trying to open the door and perform a function. The unit tends to overheat, particularly around the camera area. On the positive side, it is definitely fast. The refresh rate is amazing, and the processing speed is impressive. However, there is a noticeable bulge that almost looks like a wave, and it has only been used a couple of times. Somehow, we are unable to send a text using the digital SIM, but we're still trying to figure that out. Overall, her switch from a Xiaomi to this hasn't been exciting, which is surprising. So, while it was a great idea, I don't think she's going to keep it long term. And this is only our third day. So, what can I say? It's not for everyone."
I have had this phone since July and it will overheat. I have to turn it off or cool it down somehow. This is concerning!
"It pains me to write this review because I absolutely adore this phone.I bought this in mid-April 2024 and as of the end of August 2024 the screen is completely unresponsive to any touch. It didn't just lose pixels or become finicky around the crease--I can't get it to respond to any touch on any part of it. I can hold the power key until it reboots, but I have no way to turn it off completely, or try factory resetting it since those options require you to touch the screen. There's no reset pinhole.Touchscreen phones are great until you can't use them even for emergency purposes.This is frustrating and heartbreaking though, because this is such a fantastic form factor! I LOVE how tiny it is when folded. I love the small screen on front--just enough to glance at when needed but not so big that it's constantly crying for my attention, getting scratched, at risk of getting broken, etc.I love the unobtrusive design, so refreshing in comparison to the bigger, heavier, and increasingly more expensive phones out there.The speed and responsiveness of the OS was great when it was working, and the external color and texture are fantastic! I rarely talk on the phone so I can't say much about that, but obviously none of this matters since I can't use the thing anymore.It is a great price, and theoretically I could just buy another one. But if that one also only last about 4 months, I'm effectively paying $100 a month to use a phone. And that makes it just as expensive as the more popular ones out there.Personally I'm not willing to pay more for a phone than I do for a laptop, so I've reverted back to my old Samsung Note 8."
This is day 2 with my new phone and while scrolling through Facebook a black box scrolled along the page. This just happened 2 times. This makes me nervous. It is gone now... I will come back in a month with an update unless something bad happens sooner. 😐
Advertised for 2023 razr is actually for 2024 and is a little loose
"It's a nice phone but it isn't compatible with my old razr aux adapter and it didn't come with one. It also didn't come with the base for the charger, just a c-type to c-type connector. Luckily I have a base that works. If it didn't come with these things it would have been nice to know in the description. Not sure how to connect aux now."
I was excited to get the phone ...I received it yesterday and it didn't come with the piece to plug in just the wire and I notice the phone gets hot quick so am disappointed 😥
The phone was great just died after one week. No hard reset would work. One minute it was working then it wasn't
I thought I found my dream phone and I never really had any problems the problem I've occurred with the razor even though it has a lot of gigabytes and all that stuff must the apps that I have to use when on fine and Etc after I started using the phone half the apps won't work I downloaded the updates I did all the updates and having my apps still is not working properly and this is a brand new phone otherwise if everything worked I would be keeping it but no return
"see title.that seems to be a common problem. extremely cool and compact phone,  dont expect it to last years."
I bought two 2023 razers and the first one would not let me send pictures and would echo when on speaker phone. The second one had a dead pixel and there was a green dot on my screen. I let it go be cause the phone worked and a dot would not bother me. Now the fold crease has a black line going through it. I guess we get what pay for. I paid 334 and it was a really good phone. Oled smooth video fast processor. I bought the 2024 and I'm hoping they ironed out the kinks. I bought used again.
"Battery is charging slowly and dying quickly. I had a phone exactly like this, different color with the same apps on it and that one charges quickly and battery lasts just fine. Hoping it fixes itself soon but if not I will sadly have to return.Update: Seems the issue has been fixed. Honestly it wouldn't even power on for a bit after reviewing it. Might've needed to adjust to everything but never had a phone do that before."
"This phone is super cool! It flips, it sits up it has these super cute displays that people can see. I love wearing mine like a cross body purse as an accessory:).  There is one major downfall .  I may not have gotten this phone if I knew that it would form a crease in the middle.  I mean like a bubble crease.  It leaves a line across my photos ( not the actual photo . that's just what you see) but it's annoying.  Or MB my OCD is just really bad;)  I love the phone but I hate that bubble crease .< Btw, the bubble crease happened just one month after buying.  Great phone  if you don't mind that"
"The top of screen is dark,it was good then I had it charging, opened it up to use it, and the top of the screen was dark. Sent it back yesterday with the label that I had printed, gave it to the UPS driver he said he could take it. Now it’s I don’t see anything on it no tracking like it just disappeared. So I tried to get in touch with customer service. See if they could help but I could not get through to customer service and that’s Amazon customer service I’m talking about I tried to use the chat but it just is too difficult for me to use because I’m a senior citizens I guess and I don’t understand all of this computer stuff , I wish they had a part of customer service that would cater to seniors. But they probably don’t care as long as you’re spending money."
"I do not have an opinion yet about the phone itself, but have a suggestion for Motorola.  Please put a notice on the outside of the box the new phones come in, to not try to put an after market screen protector on.  It is in the manual, but it might avoid problems, if it was on a sticker on the outside of the package, since it says inside that doing this could void your warranty.  I am not one who reads the whole manual before I try using the phone and I imagine there might be a lot of people like me, so this would be helpful."
Nice phone. I love the form factor but it overheated like crazy for the 2 days that I tried to use it. Issue with push notifications from Gmail which was odd. But I'll try the 2024 with the Dimensity chip as I seem to have more luck with Mediatek.
"I loved this phone. The design is sleek and I Love the folding aspect of it, it fits right into a shirt pocket. The specs and performance of the phone are great too, it runs fast from browsing to gaming and charges really quickly.That said, my phone is totally useless after only a couple months of use. I noticed today that there was the smallest little bump at the side of my screen where it bends, I was worried there was something under it so i turned my phone to the side and bumped it ever so slightly and the tiniest piece of dust fell out, smaller than this period.I noticed a small black spot on the screen where the bump was but the rest of the screen worked fine. I continued using my phone normally over the next hour.Suddenly one of the times I opened the phone up it formed a black bar directly across the middle of the screen and now only the bottom half of the screen works at all.Needless to say, the phone is now useless, and would be Very costly to fix. I have to buy a new phone and it definitely won't be this one again."
Had this phone for two weeks it works fine it's just not as smooth as iPhone tbh. Google assistant always turns on when the aux is plugged in so can't listen to music in peace. And flipping it is kinda tedious
"The phone was great while it lasted, but 2 months after purchasing it, a minor mishap cracked the screen (our Galaxy phones have been through worse, dozens of times, and always come out unscathed). The damage is beyond cosmetic: the touch screen is non-responsive. Now, I didn't buy the Protection Plan coverage, and that's on me. But I can't get this fixed out of pocket, either! Local cell phone repair shops told me they can't get replacement parts for the Razr. Motorola won't sell the parts to them. They said they can only get replacement screens for the Razr Plus, not the regular Razr, and even if the one I had was a Razr Plus, the part alone is so expensive that the repair guy recommends just buying a new phone instead."
"I suspect I got a lemon because other reviews don't describe my experience at all. The phone is slow, sometimes when I open it and try to use a messaging app the keyboard won't pop up, and occasionally my data just drops out. I am currently typing this review on a spare phone because I am having so many problems just with wifi. Really disappointed and frustrated with the phone."
Motorola Razr 2023 was great until one day (4 months after purchase) the screen stopped working :-(
I have used Motorola phones for over 15 years and loved them.  This one I loved for 3 months then the screen quit working. I had to go back to a previous phone and could not use the razr anymore.  I talked to motorola tech support about this and they said they would call me back the following day.  I finally called them after 2 days with no call.  I got to the point of them sending a replacement.  I gave my address and they were asking about shipping options and they hung up on me.  I repeated this and was hung up on again at the same point.  I have read other reviews of this phone and they are similar stories.  They know there is a problem with them and are trying to avoid it.  After so many years as a loyal customer I will now have to buy a different brand of phone.  And apparently have to eat the cost of this phone after only 3 months of use.  JUNK!!!!!!!
"If this is your first flip, you want something brand new and you're on a budget, go for it. It's a solid entry flip device, and I'd be happy with it if it was my first entry.If you have a flip phone already, I'd pass on this one here's why:- Feels slower than my ZFlip 3 5G (2021)- Camera exposure is abysmal- No good cases on market- Hinge feels way to stiff and crunchyThe only real benefit I saw was the fact that the screen was nearly perfectly flat when fully open, which isn't worth an upgrade for me either. Overall it's an average budget android that has no snap. Not nearly enough power to run a 144hz display effectively in my opinion."
"Loved the phone until it failed. It was working, then unresponsive when I opened it a few minutes later. Did a restart, did a factory reset, screen does not respond to touch. Six months."
Phone does not last.  it was never dropped or mistreated but I started having screen issues after 7 months.  Motorola wanted almost 380.00 to fix it.  A new phone is only 450.00.  Love the form factor but it is simply to fragile and I cannot afford a new phone every 7 months.  I should also note that this phone was never dropped or mistreated and was only opened when necessary.PROs:Form factor - flip phone fits in front pocketgood memory and processorvery thin for even when closedCons:Front screen too small to be usefulsmall black spot on side of screen near hinge.does NOT last - screen issues started after 7 months and not worth fixing.
"shuts down even when it's on 24%. Only turns on when it's plugged up. I bought the product twice because i thought it was a one time occurrence and the second  one has the same issues. I called Motorola  and the only option they gave me was a refund that was the  1st round, 2nd round  I just went and decided to go ahead and place another order on the  same thing since i like the design and features (also hoping its just a one off experience) i opened the box had it on for a while thinking everything was fine and it powered off at 24%.I'm not sure if it's transit problem or the product itself, but it's insane that it happened twice. Now here I am stressed and without a phone for work.Aug.12:Fixed it. (Thanks YouTube)Decided to try to fix the problem since I had to wait for a postal carrier to pick it up. Seen a couple YouTube vids and save you the trouble of research I had to let it die then charge it multiple rounds till it finally hit 100% and let it drain naturally. You'll  have to restart the whole process over if it dies again with no warning. Its a hassle but it works and haven't faced anymore problems after.I would give it 5 stars if I didn't"
"As other reviews have stated, this is a really good phone until it isn't. Bought it for my aging Mother for it's small folded size (why are women's pockets so tiny?) and she loved it. The phone is fast enough, very little bloatware, decent screen, good battery, wireless charging, etc; workED very well.Not 8 months later, the screen decided to leave the chat. The middle area around the fold stopped responding and soon after, began registering constant ghost taps. The problem continued after factory reset, so it isn't software related. I can't even set it up after the reset now. It's a very high tech brick."
"I actually liked the phone itself. However, I had to call Motorola for customer service.  After two weeks of waiting on hold and having my calls dropped I returned the phone.  This is the first time I have ever returned a product due to poor customer service."
"Phones have been mostly the same for a while now, so when needing a new phone I figured I'd take a chance and try something with a fun gimmick.Mistake. Not because of the flip part--that was actually useful and I miss it, even if it didn't have the ease of flip of the original flip phones and required both hands to flip open.No, because whatever programming Motorola does for their software on their phones, it's trash. I outright stopped using the camera because for some reason pictures now suddenly took FOREVER to take, no matter the settings or lighting conditions. It was constantly turning on nonsense gesture settings I didn't want and kept having to manually disable. And they were so concerned about screen space the screen goes over the flip part, but can't seem to communicate properly with apps the dimensions of the screen so it was constantly cutting off parts of videos. The only thing I miss about it is the flip capability--if Google made a flip in addition to a fold, I would have that instead right now, but I'm NEVER going motorola again.Oh, and the deciding factor for me trading this in for a Google Pixel? The screen randomly developed a green line one day, which is apparently a known issue with Motorola phones they've not bothered to fix and has no solution."
"My first experience with a foldable phone was quite disappointing. I was initially impressed by its design and features, but things took a turn when I tried to transfer my data from my iPhone 13 Pro to the Motorola Razr 2023. I connected the two devices via cable for the transfer, and suddenly the screen went black. I thought it was a device reset for a complete transfer, but all the information didn't go through. As a result, I had to turned it back on and manually set up everything on the new phone.Things didn’t improve when I contacted my carriers, AT&T and T-Mobile, to activate the service. They informed me that the device was locked to an unknown carrier and couldn’t assist me. Neither the physical SIM nor the eSIM worked, which added to my frustration. Overall, it was a really disappointing experience"
I was excited to try a different kind of phone that was a smart phone that folded.  The phone worked without issue for a couple of months and then out of no where from just normal use a long white line appeared down the center of the screen.  I attempted to send it in and was turned down because of a small crack on the back of the phone (Which i could live with and caused no issue to the front normal use).  They said i needed to pay $375 to fix the entire phone!  I payed $325 for this.  Unbelievable.  Do not recommend this model of phone or company to anyone.
"I generally love what Motorola does. I knew this foldable phone would eventually break, I figured after a year or so of abuse at the hands of this IT guy. Unfortunately, it only lasted 4 days, and it was not a drop, or liquid, or even my wife's reckless throwing of items, it was a lint free cloth that killed it. I was wiping down the screen at the end of the day before I put it on charge that I heard a pop and a pink line appeared vertically on the screen, just left of the camera all the way down. Amazon took amazing care of me though and I purchased the plus model. so far it has made it through the days since. I think this was a fluke, so don't let it deter you if you are looking to try a foldable phone, these are great: but just be super careful."
"i purchased the phone new in July 2024, initially i loved this phone.  My co-worker told me about the concerns some previous owners had with the crease appearing on  the screen after awhile.  Fast to the beginning if October, out of the blue a thin line appeared on the right side of the phone and then 2 black spots appeared. Well the line and the dots decided to connect and now the phone is useless.  I didn't drop the phone nor was it water damaged, apparently this phone has the glitch that Motorola can't seem to resolve.  I won't be buying a flip phone again because this seems to be the problem with all the flip phones regardless of the brand!  Money wasted!"
"This flip concept is not new, but the first flips were not touchscreen.  You cannot put a screen protector on this Razr flip or it voids the warranty, but this renders the sensitivity of the screen defenseless.  This new Razr malfunctioned 4 wks after receipt.  Sent it to Lenovo/Motorola in Fort Worth, TX for repair under warranty. They repaired and put in a new screen, sent back within 7 days.  Today is 6 months from purchase date and the  upper half of the screen is dead again, the liquid inside the rest of the working screen appears to be slowly leaking.  No more Motorola.  I just ordered a new Google Pixel, which I had before this Razr."
"THIS PHONE IS TRASH. battery is dead halfway through the day and I'm never really on it. The screen just quick working all together had to send it in for repairs and it came back just as bad and guess what that screen is starting to glitch out again. Save your money, shop somewhere else. Oh and the mic is junk no one can ever hear me."
"Overall good phone,only issue is that the screen doesn't last long..6 months in and cracked right down the folding seam.."
"I was looking forward to this phone. One of my coworkers had a similar one for the last couple years. Unfortunately, the battery life was not good enough for the little bit I used the phone daily. The worst thing is that there is no way to contact Amazon and they have not credited back my money. I returned the case at the same time, and I was credited that money a couple weeks ago. The phone was sent back in excellent condition."
Since I've received this phone it's been babied pretty hard only to get a dead zone on the folding screen near the hinge and reboot constantly throughout the day. I wanred to believe and move forward but this has made me not want another foldable. 700 bucks down the drain!!!!UPDATE: a black bar has appeared right along the crease and now has to be sent in for repairs or replacement after only two months. I'm afraid to even get the replacement at this point.
Purchased this over Samsung due to price.  Sadly it would not read my Glucose sensor reliably. Had to go to Samsung.
"After 13 days of use, a dead spot appeared on the screen where it folds. A small black line that quickly expanded. Only a few days later, a bright white line appeared across the left side of the screen, followed by another black dead spot in the bottom left hand corner. I have never dropped the phone, it has remained in a case since the day I received it brand new. Aside from the glaring issues of screen problems, the camera is also extremely slow, taking 3 seconds to actually take a picture. I haven't had it long enough to notice any other big issues, and I'm definitely not going to keep it long enough to find out. Going to return it tomorrow for a different brand of phone, never buying another Motorola. Complete piece of junk. Don't waste your money on this."
"I was very upset, after spending 2 hours with my carrier, transferring my service to this phone, to find out that it was not unlocked. It is set to T-Mobile.  I thought buying a phone from the Motorola store, saying it was unlocked, that there would not be a problem like this.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
There was a defect in the phone. The brightness went up by 1-2 % every time I opened the phone. Even with adaptive brightness off.
I have had this phone for almost one month and the screen protector has lifted where it holds and traps all kinds of dirt in it. When you purchase the phone there are numerous warnings that you are not to remove it! Well I have not and it's almost embarrassing to use in my workplace.The phone and operation itself is really nice although it will run hot. Not sure if that is also a defect. I'm so disappointed.
I purchased my Motorola RAZR 2023 in later January 2024. In approximately 7 months the screen began to have hairline cracks underneath the Motorola screen protector.Calls to Motorola warranty and other representatives of the Company; revealed Motorola refused to repair the screen under warranty. Instead Motorola wanted to charge me over $376.00 for them to repair it.This cost was getting close to the original price of the phone. This was all due to Motorola's equipment being defective.I now have a better understanding as to why Motorola can sell these phones cheaper than their competition.Stay away and buy a different brand of flip phone.
"The top half of the case fits, but the bottom half one side sticks up higher than the rest so the case doesn't fit correctly"
"Cool phone, loved it. For less than a day. Barely used, put right into a case, never left my car or dropped remotely. Inner scren broke, and even started chipping in the corner on its own! WARRANTY UP, tastes like lemon..."
not unlockedThis item is listed as unlocked but it is not. Do not buy it if you are looking for unlocked phone. I bought it for someone that is living overseas. I spent about $314 for this phone and when I received it it was not unlocked. Amazon has not informed the seller to update the listing and it is over a month.
"Had this for all of one month, literally 15 minutes ago my phone decided to break on me and the screen turned black like a liquid was spreading under screen, mind you all I did was sit down and place it on my bed like I always do and it was broken. Total waste of $400 do not buy"
"The warranty expired this month, and out of the sudden my screen has a bright bar across the phone. It seems like the screen is damaged exactly when the warranty expired. The screen also starts to crack after 5 months, even when you are careful. This is a cheap phone and it will stop working. Don't buy it."
"Phone failed after 2 days,  1st, a line appeared between screens and upper screen would not react to scrolling soon I could not make a phone call. Then the lower screen went dark! Already sent it back!"
This is the second phone I got that had issues with dead pixels. It was a fun phone otherwise but they really didn't do well creating a screen that will last. It's been ten days and I woke up with a dead pixel on the fold that radiates a line to the top of the screen. Very disappointing I was excited about this phone and even gave it a second chance after issues with the first one.
"I mostly like it, but outer small screen is so useless I leave it open a lot of the time.  So don’t get the benefit of the folding screen.  I should have just bought the more expensive model.  I also have an issue where it sometimes won’t detect that the screen is open so the screen stays off.  I have to soft reset it to get the screen back.  Have had this happen several times.  Guess I will see how good their support is."
external screen not operable
"I really wanted to like this phone but unfortunately when you live in a rural area like I do, you never really know how they will work out.  Because I never have any issues with my IPhone I called my cell provider about conversations keep cutting in and out & after running some diagnostics, they said the problem was not on their side, so it must be the phone.  I don’t know if the antenna is placed differently than on my iPhone but sadly had to return this phone due to connection issues."
Used this for personal use.There was nothing I liked
"I open my phone yesterday to a black spot covering at least 80% of the screen, can't see to get it open to use.  Useless, not happy at all !!!!"
Do not advertise this product for something it's not. Clearly you can see a black blotch on the screen. What a inconvenience it is for consumers to spend hundreds of dollars on a product that has to be returned upon arrival.
"Nice how it fits in your pocket but this is not ready as a commercial product.Just 1.5 months of normal use and the screen cracked inside. No outside damage, just a black spot that within one day grew to the folding area.On top of poor quality of the flip screen, there is a huge compromise on the camera - very disappointing quality, basically can only take decent photos on bright sunny days."
"Bought a phone, it was a defective piece of junk.Returned the phone.They received it 30 days agoSTILL NO REFUND ISSUED $380!!!!GIVE ME MY MONEY!🖕"
My phone doesn't work with my DexcomG7 glucose monitor
"I bought the phone in July. On December 3 the screen was black. It will not charge, reboot or show any sign of life."
I have never had a phone totally stop working for no reason until I purchased this one.  Will not power up at all and it was not dropped or damaged but just stopped working.  What a pain - luckily I kept my old phone that still works.  Guess I am just out a few hundred dollars!
Phone is very nice but quite on the 30th day. So I can not return it to Amazon ( bummer)  Would like to talk to Dealer for exchange. but do not how to contact seller. Would like to talk to the seller
Worst deal ever I bought it on August 7th and on September 10th the screen went all black I went multiple places to try to replace the screen and it cost $300 to replace replace it I ending buying another phone and Im pay $440 for the phone it's not worth it I ending buying another phone.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Got a white vertical line going down the whole phone. A black film going over the bottom of the phone. I thought it was something in between the screen protector and the glass so I took off the screen protector to see. Well I called Motorola and now since I removed the screen protector and void the warranty nowhere in the box or the when I bought it told me not to remove it or voids the warranty. I've had Motorola phones since it came out love them not anymore we'll never buy another Motorola again.My wife's got the same one her screen cracked in the Middle where it folds so does that tell you something.Now I'm out of 500. Dollars
Don't waste your hard earned money. No different than any other phone.  Eh..
"Product seems nice, but arrived with a crack on the small front screen and zero charge - very different to my typical experience!"
Flaslight did not work returned. Also Amazon hates giving refunds once it's back in their hands!!! STILL WAITING!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Worked for a month on my old SIM card then stopped. Found out It's not able to be activated in my area - Out $500 Dollars because it worked for over 30 days, and it is now outside the 30 days return window. Won't be buying a phone that's not on carrier website or in their store ever again. Had to get another new phone AND had to change my phone number which I had for 2 decades. What a big mess!"
"really bad about this phone won't recognize sim card, not one but three different onesDon't buy"
"I dislike I was sold a product that was supposed to be unlocked and it's not, also my screen already went out and Amazon said oh well, don't buy this product from Amazon"
"Owned the Razor 2020 for over 2 years with no issues. Figured I'd upgrade and the Razer 2023 lasted 3 months before the main screen touch functions stopped working. Have to send in for repair, so we will see how that goes."
The phone powered off during setup and had to be put on the charger to start again. Would read 0% battery life.  I called Amazon to get a replacement and they told me to return it and buy it again when I get the refund. I bought the phone on Prime day for over 50% off so that's not an option.
"I purchased this phone after owning an Apple XS. The Motorola Android 14 operating has a few bugs that are show stoppers. 1st, popup messages appear to be leftover debug remnants that cannot be turned off. These messages are annoying.  Customer Support from Motorola is slow and the support staff is hard to understand. Don't buy - Do not Recommend."
"The ""Vegan Leather"" started to peeled off 6 days after being received.Does anybody has this issue?I kept the phone in the case since the day it was received.I love every bit of the phone but this, makes it hard to enjoy knowing your phone is feeling."
"Less than 3 months and its a brick.I am so tired of having to return items and lately it seems like every two items purchased need a return for repaiThe phone overall is okay, but I would expect do much more. The worst part is the screen, I had to double tap and sometimes three times to get a response, now the screen is doing what is referred to as ghost touches; Where the applications open and close automatically and back and forth without touching the screen."
"My phone would not text in my pick up. I thought my GPS was broke so I’ve got a new GPS which cost me close to $1000 installed in my pick up. After several days many many phone calls to Motorola they finally told me Motorola razz 2023 cannot text over pick up GPS. In order to text in my pick up I have to open my phone and unlock it, I might as well just text and drive. I was told by two different employees of Motorola the Motorola, 2023 does not have the capability to connect and text over your vehicle. Had I known I wouldn’t have been out $500."
"Frequently the Razr phone goes to a black screen, requiring an hour-long reboot process.  Phone does not always ring on incoming calls.  Have to press multiple times to call someone on the occasions that the Razr allows calls out.Battery life good so far; speed and responsiveness less than adequate... pushes on doors marked 'Pull.'"
Most of this has line across the screen after a few months.
A grain of sand or something hard got in the corn in my pocket and damaged screen. Very fragile phone.
dosent seem to be as durable as the Motorola's of old
It was pretty alright for a couple months but now there's a black circle in the middle of the screen that makes it so if I flip the phone it freaks out and I can't touch anything. I should have just bought the galaxy 24 plus
"I have had this phone for only 4 months.  I've only dropped it once while it was closed and that was from the couch to the hardwood floor, not a dent or scratch, but now the bottom half of the screen is black, but oddly the top of the screen won't respond to touch.  I'm not a heavy phone user so for this to have happened after such a short time is ridiculous."
I purchased this phone near the end of February 2024 and now it will not charge. It's been in a case it's entire life. Very well taken care of. I'm not happy. Now I have to purchase a new phone 5 months later.
"It's a shame it's a really nice phone, but has zero durability.  Dropped it once (in a case) and it now is dim with lines across the screen.  Only 2 weeks old.  That's crazy."
"I got my used Razr 2023 in used like new condition, and when I received it, I confirmed this was the case and setup my phone. I've enjoyed the experience and especially loved how small the phone becomes when folded. Then it's amazing you can just text or do what you need on the closed front screen.I use the inside screen so little, I didn't realize that the screen has become damaged at the crease. I haven't had anything happen, haven't gotten into sand, water, or anything. Just bought this phone in July and now in November, it's still usable, but there's a bunch of lines in my crease that are obvious damage, and you can even feel them with your finger. I can't recommend folding phones any longer. I had a Galaxy Z Fold 3 before this phone that lasted a solid 2 years and is still going, but after about a year also developed the same screen damage I have on this Razr on the crease. It appears that these folding phones can really only operate for 2 years at max, 1 if you want them in perfect condition the whole time. As an avid Folding phone lover, I don't know where to go next or what to recommend anyone for a good alternative. If you really want this phone, buy the newest version used like new. I had a great experience getting a used Z Fold. I recommend getting a Z Fold 5 Used like New on eBay or here on Amazon. I think I just jumped the gun getting this phone, especially with the new version coming out so soon after I got this."
"This is a very nice phone.  It doesn't have all the bloatwear like a samaung.  I loved it.Problem is,  first day of use, screen went black with green light behind it with no damage done to it.  .  Returned it for another . Second phone the screen projector bubbled over where it bends all the way across and was spreading after less than 2 weeks of light use.If they fix the screen it would be perfect.  But it's basically guarantee to break ."
"This has, in many ways, been my favorite phone I've used. It's screen is beautiful, it looks slick, especially in the green I chose, the battery life lasts forever, even while being used. Beyond that, it charges absurdly fast.However, none of that quite makes up for my biggest issue- in less than a week of standard use, a massive dead spot appeared right on the hinge. While it's in a spot that it can be easy to ignore, it's distracting and disheartening whenever the screen has any brightness at all in that spot. For a product that costs this much, I find this entirely unacceptable."
"The phone itself is fine, and the flip was novel for a few months.The more I've used it, the less I like it. The flipping action doesn't quite feel nice - it doesn't scratch the fidget itch old flip phones scratched. The camera takes pictures that are better than older phones, but it is worse than several generations of Samsung phones. I didn't think this would bother me, but it definitely has, especially since there aren't really any point and shoots that are of a similar quality to the Samsung phones available.Performance and battery life hasn't really been an issue, but I've found that the trade in value for this phone is abysmal compared to other similarly prices phones. Also, the screen hinge area will crease. I have several crease lines, and the warranty does not cover anything regarding the screens. I would not purchase this phone again."
"I bought this phone thinking it would be similar to my Note10+ because they both operate on Android systems. I was wrong. While the operating system is similar, the phone functions are different and not as good. The gesture features are not smooth. The camera is pretty cool, as is the ability to turn it into a camcorder but overall it's just not for me."
I bought it a month back and the hot pink vegan leather started to wear off quickly. It felt cheap quality.
"This phone started out great from the box, however after only a couple of months it started to have a flashing screen and lines appeared. Sent in for the Warranty repair and they returned the same phone. It worked for only a couple of weeks. Now is blacked out center screen and bright flashing white lines all over.  No case truly fits and is prone to not closing completely when folded. No headphone jack. Not great overall. Stick with a standard smart phone, these need more research to prefect."
"Very nice phone, I like it very much. Unfortunately, I suspect that the item is not a brand new one. When I opened the package and took out the phone to turn it on, it had a screen lock, a pattern lock. As a result, I could not continue to set it up and use it."
"I'm overall quite happy with this device. The design is solid, I love the color, battery life is fine, not exceptional. Camera is quite nice. I love the outer screen, it is genuinely useful, I love being able to fold my phone and have a lot more room in my pocket.However, frankly, it's a terrible value. When I pay 1000 dollars for a phone, I expect flagship attention and support, I have never dropped this kind of money on a phone before, and I'm very disappointed. The software is incredibly buggy, locking up several times a week, I have 8 gigabytes of RAM, which is an upgrade over my last phone. In theory. In practice, my memory seems to be full at all times no matter what, apps struggle to stay in memory, and I'm constantly reloading everything.I have been especially disappointed with the updates. Or lack thereof. This phone launched shortly after Android 14. Android 15 is now well underway and there has been absolutely no news of an update, but plenty of rumors and hints of a new phone to replace this one already.Unacceptable in my eyes given the sticker price. Buy it on sale if you're willing to put up with what I mentioned, or if you plan on unlocking and maintaining the software yourself."
"The phone worked really well for about 5 months. Out of the box, the hinge was a little weak, but that was my only issue at the time.About 2 or 3 months in I noticed that the smart charging feature stopped fully charging my phone overnight, leaving me with the same issue I tried to solve by upgrading from my previous phone in the first place - that being poor battery life. I am not a power user. I listen to podcasts and use the calculator throughout the day as I do my work and need a phone that won't die after 8 or 9 hours of continuous use. With the smart charging feature ""working as intended"" the battery would barely scrape through 7 1/2hrs.2 months after this issue developed the screen develops a black spot where the phone folds and within a day of that development, the entire upper half above the fold becomes unresponsive while the middle of the screen has a thick row of black pixels along the fold.Luckily, or so I considered, it was still in warranty, so I sent it in to get fixed or replaced. I received the replacement today and immediately I noticed the hinge is stronger but this phone turns itself off at random and acts as though it has no charge... These are 2 different devices, both brand new out of the box, both defective either immediately or degrading pretty rapidly.It's a pretty paper weight but you should go buy something else."
"I bought this phone during Prime Day 2023. It was great until this weekend when I woke up and flipped it open to check it only to realize the screen stopped working. I checked with local repair shops and they would not touch it. Motorola gave a price of $589 to repair the screen. So a year later, I am retiring this phone that I really enjoyed. To be clear, I did not drop it or have any accidents with it. I just opened it one day and I guess the constant opening and closing is a critical area of wear and tear over time. So just be prepared for that. The front screen is all I'm using to check my phone until I buy something else. For how much you pay, this phone should last longer than a year."
It's a great looking phone but a bit more complicated than other phones. But my wife is usually the worse for technical support and asking for help to use it but if it was more 'Plug- n -Play' she would be far happier. She's has been very frustrated with it but she hasn't thrown it out the window yet. There is that. So it must be better than average.
"Although this is a nice looking phone, nice and compact, fits well in my pocket, I did find some issues with it.  I noticed right away that it is awkward to power it down.  You basically need two hands to do so by holding the ""volume up"" key and ""power"" key at the same time.  The power key is just below the ""volume down"" key.  Why couldn't they make the ""volume down"" key for this action.  I also found the phone overall a bit heavier than I thought it would be.  It is also a bit of a struggle to open it(definitely not a one had operation).  The battery lasts barely a day which I feel should be at least 36 to 48 hours.  The phone just wasn't quite what I expected.  Unfortunately,  I will be returning it."
"Bought this razr 6 months ago. The factory installed screen protector is coming off. Customer service send me to ""ubreakifix"" to get it replaced. When I was there, I was told that they don't have the screen protector or the equipment to replace it. Called customer service again. First I was told to go to a different location, and try there. Then, since ""ubreakifix"" doesn't do this, then they told me told mail it back to Motorola and to pay $74.95. I disputed this and now they ""waived"" the charge. I also asked if I, at my own expense, could have it replaced some else. I could, but now I be voiding the warranty. Now I am stuck with doing a full factory reset, erasing my whole set up, mailing it in, waiting for it to be fixed and mailed back 7-10 days).Don't get me wrong, I like the phone, compact size etc, but probably will NOT buy again due to this hassle and bs."
"This phone is a waste of money and the customer service is horrible. The phone was fine when I first purchased it and I loved it however two or so weeks out. The screen started to lag, not responding to touch, the screen would black out. I figured it was normal and kept restarting it every so often. Never thought anything of it. I'm in month 2 and a half about to be 3. There's no return option at this point. There's a repair through warranty and if they can't repair it they send you a ""like new phone"" which is total bs after paying this much for a phone that barely works normal to begin with. I should've stayed loyal to apple. The camara quality is mediocre at best. Not worth the hype. I'm very gentle and protective with my phones. I'm really sad this turned out to be a POS"
"Ive had this phone for a short time im very gentle with my phones i was extremely excited to get it and i paid a lot of money for it!!!! The other night i close the phone when I open it where the hinge is on the screen it cracks across not even 24 gours later half the screen is now discolored and half the screen doesnt work! Before this it would glitch every time id try to watch a movie on disney, hulu, netflix and you would have to restart the phone it would do this no matter how many times ypu restarted it about every 20 to 30 monutes on i rarely leave reviews but i was heartbroken about this! As we know 900 dollars is a lot of money to basically throw away!!!! Also battery life is crap it last 1 day maybe! Which is extremely disappointing i absolutely loved motorola but this phone has 100 percent changed my opinion!!!"
"So far like the phone but there's so much to learn it's going to take me awhile of playing with it. The one thing that bothers me is the short battery life I'll have to see how it works for me other than that it's a great phone, had to send the phone in twice fortunately it was covered under warranty honestly don't trust the phone anymore bad along with it's very short battery life I would not purchase again, I will keep until it breaks the next time and then throw it in the garbage I've always liked Motorola phones but doubt I'll buy another one in the future looking to buy reliable phones I keep my phones a long time"
"Had for 3.5 months. Really great phone. One day I flipped it open and a small black dot formed at the phone screen crease. Stayed like that for about a week and then when I flipped it open it developed a solid black line across the middle and nothing above the line was interactive/touch responsive. Shipped to Motorola for manufacturer warranty coverage. Representative from Motorola contacted me and said the hinge on the phone showed evidence of ""aggressive folding"" and the company would not honor the warranty. Motorola offered no repair for the phone and I'm out $500. Won't ever own another Motorola product ever again."
"I really wanted to keep this phone bc it has some nice features like duel screens, compact size, good battery life, minimum bloat ware, great main screen. BUT it is riddled with glitches and bugs, mainly random black screen 3-5 times a day. That requires a total reboot to be able to use it again It also has random screen freeze that also requires a restart..so annoying👎🏼 so this phone will be returned and I'm going back to Samsung."
"I have wanted this phone since I first heard the rumors of it. But unfortunately after just a few days, I have to return it. I am really heart broken, I was not given the option to exchange it which makes me think that this is a known problem.  This is such a unique design and I was so happy to finally have it. How ever the reception is a problem.  If I am in an area with weak signal, and I close the phone, the external screen shows that it looses signal. If I open the phone, the signal does come back. I tried resetting it and turning it off and on. As long as the phone was open, I had ok signal in weak areas, but what is the point of having a folding phone if you have to keep it open. I tested it against my old One Plus Nord N30 ( a cheap phone compared to the Razr) and even with it open, my cheap old phone had better signal strength. I would have preferred to exchange it but both amazon and Motorola suggested I just return it. I am really heartbroken that I have to give it up."
Absolutely LOVED the phone for about 5 months.. so much so that even now I’m considering just getting another but won’t because I know it’ll break the same way just as fast.. my front screen started peeling off because it’s held on with cheap plastic. Once it started peeling the screen stopped working entirely and now only the front screen works
"Motorola, has been around the product is not cheap. but like every other new product there's going to be fails before there is success.  the razr+ has potential, with the large unfolded front screen your able to access just about anything with out flipping in open. with awesome graphics. that's why i bought it for the gaming aspect of the phone with high resolutions. its the flipped glass. once the phone is opened the glass barley stretches to fit the protective siding. which leaves it open for failure. I have two of them and both same issue  thumb nail or caught on zipper and screen glitched and was unresponsive. once this issues is fixed. golden"
Good phone but Visible’s IMEI checker rejected it so I was unable to activate on Visible despite the listing claiming the phone would work on all networks.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                The concept of a folding smart phone is a good one, but the reality and day to day use of this phone didn’t work for me. If you are coming from an iPhone, this phone will feel like a downgrade. Facial recognition and fingerprint unlock are terrible. What a chore to use the phone between facial recognition that may work 50% of the time if you’re looking at the phone at just the right angle and fingerprint unlock that’s even less reliable. Facial recognition is something you don’t even have to think about with iPhone. It just works and it works fast. The crease of the phone can also get annoying. Do yourself a favor and stick with iPhone. The pros of the Motorola Razr Plus just don’t outweigh the cons."
"As I said it looks great BUT. I bought this in October using 5 payments through Amazon. This happened 2 days before the final payment. I ignored a lot of the negative reviews because I felt I do not use my camera for everything and use it more to monitor my Dexcom G7.  When this happened it was out of the blue and because of the location on the screen It made the main screen useless. Motorola has a full year warranty but this doesn't cover the screen . If you want to cover the screen you must purchase that within 30 days @ around $300, but this coverage has copays as high as $350.  That's like buying 2 phones! Motorola is Chinese and their support shows it."
I bought the phone in February and it was great at first and then one day I woke up to a few dead pixels and then those dead pixels because black splots and then just this morning I woke up to the main screen no longer working at all with a line of dead pixels on the screen and even more black spots. The touchscreen no longer works and I can only use the phone with the tiny screen. And this all happened after only 2 months of owning the phone.
"Hi. Motorola's implementation of Android is phenomenal, I have never used a phone that is as easy and intuitive  as the Razor, it almost seems to anticipate what I want to do, and is constantly giving me suggestions that are helpful.  However the hardware is junk.  the BT is unreliable, the camera is awful, it takes lousy videos that contain more that just the basic motions, and the microphone is terrible.  I had stopped sending people voice texts for how bad they sounded, until I realized that only sounded bad on my phone....."
"After approximatley ten months light use the hinge failed.  For several days I couldn't open the phone at all.  Now the phone will neither fully open or close.  I loved this phone at first - but now its useless!  I am a 70 year old man who doesn't go on social media - No Tik Tok or Facebook.  I had just used the it for occassional calls, texts or emails.  Because I am now living in England Motorola won't help me!"
"The phone is absolutely beautiful and feels good in the hand,but, I found myself having to open to the full screen quite often. I was hoping the outer screen would be more efficient for me. But it is a really great phone"
Screen protector is failing two months in. Phone did not even last 4 months went back and forth with Motorola at about 4 months the screen open acted up after about open and closing four more times the complete LCD in projector came off the phone Motorola said to be covered under warranty once they received it they phoned me saying that the phone was damaged I had a case on the phone the phone was not dropped the screen failed over a period of time and they would not honor the warranty I would not recommend this phone to anyone. I am also to the point to where I will not recommend Motorola to anyone I have been a big fan of Motorola pretty much my whole life from the Nextel I then series phones. I will add pictures when I'm able to at least they could have done is fixed the phone they refunded me the $70 they were going to charge me but the claim that the phone is damaged and there's not even a scratch on it is ridiculous.
I purchased this phone last August and it worked great. Unfortunately for no reason wifi calling keeps getting disabled. I sent the phone in for RMA and they said there was nothing wrong with it. Since I have really bad cell service I was forced to destroy the phone and buy a different brand.
"Have owned this phone for less than a year, it is in a fairly stout case and very well cared for.  Zero drops, no water damage.Today both screens began flickering / screen tearing, and then after about 25 minutes of this behavior, both the main display and the external display have completely stopped functioning.  Troubleshooting steps are not fixing the issue.  It seems to be a poorly made device.Contacted customer service, explained my phone is non-functioning.  They insisted that I have to call in in order to reach elevated support.  I can't call because my device is not working.  The response, ""Unfortunately we cannot help you then.""Choose a different brand of device."
The phone was very fast and responsive. The screen on the inside broke on both sides of the hinge just from opening it normal. Will never buy a flip phone from Motorola I'm back using my ancient moto stylus that never had a case and has been dropped no issues with it but it's time for an upgrade too bad I wasted $900 on what I thought was my new upgrade
"Turns off an restarts intermittently, screen locks on whatever is on screen, has message that startup failed. It's a lemon. Activated 9/14/24day it arrived). Seemed ok but trouble started on Sunday monday today i took it to tmobile and they said its rare but happens that a phone is just defective. UGH I was so looking forward to finally getting a flip phone and bought unlocked to get color i wanted. Had them switch back to old phone. Im very disappointed. First phone i had 1996! Never ever had ANY trouble before in 28 years!"
I wanted so badly to love this phone but just couldn’t go from apple to android(personal preference)It’s a well made phone and brought me back to the good days of the early 2000s when the OG Razr came out.Wish I could’ve made it work !
"I was worried any being able to see a line in the fold area... No line visible on the screen.  It's great.I was also worried about getting a refurbished unit.  Seems to work perfectly, and I saved some money.Update:  WiFi calling was wonky, and I use this feature the most for calling.  Not good.So I ordered a replacement, and the unlocked phone that I ordered, came locked.  Called Motorola, they have me calling at&t.  Waiting on hold forever.  Not impressed with the process of jumping through hoops.  Maybe refurbished is not not not the way to go.Update:  they can't unlock a phone.  The seller sold me junk."
Specs are good. Camera is decent. Screen is good. Tons of system bugs and app bugs. Lack of accessories. Would choose flip 5.
"It's a fun phone, but I've already cracked the outer screen while the phone is in my pocket.This wouldn't be a big deal but the cost to repair the outer glass is the same as just buying a new phone.I'll be replacing mine after only 6 months with something completely different."
I returned the product within 7days.
"I bought the razr because it was a bigger flip than Samsung flip. 5 months with the razr and I had to send it to motorola for screen repair. I was told that I'm being charged $620 for repair. $620 for repairs, 5 months of use? Going back to Samsung. Do your homework with Motorola."
"Wanted to love this phone however, couldn’t get face recognition to work. Tried multiple times, stated over, rebooted etc.  I was hoping to switch from the iPhone but in my opinion, this phone is not ready for prime time."
Been having it for just a couple months and the screen is already damaged! I been very care With this phone but is just bad quality do not buy! I’m so disappointed
"I got the phone as I was getting bored with iPhone and wanted to really like the phone but once I received it and as I was getting everything set up it just died and would not turn back on no matter what I tried so I had to return it. I was not going to risk getting replacement, Phone felt good in hand."
I had this phone in loose fitting shorts as I walked around for a little bit. I pulled it out to use it and it was extremely hot. The CPU monitor app said 50⁰C(122⁰F). I had to open it up for it to cool off. Same thing happened when trying to customize the cover screen. Also happened when streaming music from Spotify for 30 minutes.People are saying the it gets hot because the phone is thin and the heat has to go somewhere but I had the z flip 4 and it never got this hot. I think 42⁰C was the hottest mine ever got.The magenta color is gorgeous. The cameras are average at best. The cover screen is excellent.Maybe mine is just defective. Good luck to those that try this phone. Hopefully yours doesn't get hot.This phone has been out for almost a year and doesn't have android 14. Motorola is terrible at updates. Glad I didn't keep it.
"Not worth it buy a Samsung instead waste of time and money, the screens are old and will wear off."
Follow up.  Zero stars!!! DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!  screen had cracked and software internal screen did not respond.  I had to send it back to Houston so 5 days without a phone.  They called and said it would be another $620 to repair!  I paid 799 for this phone three months ago.  AND they refused to warranty the repairs.  A COMPLETE SCAM AND POS!!!!!  Worst purchase in my life!!!  Fair warning to othersWarning!  when your screens crack (and they will my razr plus outside screen cracked after barely 3 months of normal use with no drops or impact) motorola will not pay to cover the cost to repair!!  Avoid this phone.Update:  I took it to a outside pc repair vendor:  $489  minimum repair.  Avoid this POS at all costs!!!
"This phone is beautiful. The screens are great. The height is better. It’s lighter and feels nice. But, it’s not ready for mass market in my opinion. I made a personal choice to buy the Motorola over the Samsung in part because I appreciate Motorola as a company and really loved my original flip phones from them as well as it’s overall goodness. The phone failed after a month. I started to increasingly lose inside screen touch responsiveness and then lost it altogether. This then led to the screen turning green and also on and off. She was in a case from the start and was handled respectfully the whole month. I would have given it two stars but it completely croakedon me lol. Hopefully the Samsung fold comes today. Come on Motorola, 80% doesn’t cut it."
"If you buy this phone, make sure you get the insurance. Because I've had it 8 months and I've now used the insurance. And I'm back to my Samsung phone. Red line across the face trim peace around the outside of the glass broke out. Shut up spent the extra money for the samsung"
Missing the sim card tray paid 500 for a phone that didn't even have a sim card tray how can I used the phone without the tray
it said it come with a charger but it does not
Unable to format phone for return. This is likely the cause of not being able to credit my credit card.
"My first brand new phone in 10+ years, broke in less than 30 days. Did not drop or damage phone but one morning a black bar appeared across the center of the phone, with nothing on the top half working or responding to touch.Cannot factory reset phone as it keeps getting stuck on Android boot screen.DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!! going with flip 5 and should never have tried out this company... Moto should be bankrupt by now"
Pro:I absolutely adore how small this phone gets when it's folded (and how much I can do from the front display).Cons:Bad battery lifeDisplay is questionable (streaming is out)Serious software bugsWifi Calling does not work.
"Had phone for 3 months and main screen puffed up and went completely blank, never wet or anything just happened from opening phone. Motorola won't even look at phone for warranty. Says I have to pay even though the phone is under warranty. I had Samsung flip before. It's a way better option. Much more durable and much better quality."
"I had this phone about 2 weeks. One day I was playing golf in Florida. It was a hot day. The phone died that afternoon. I sent it in for repair, and they said it had water damage and refused to do anything for me. Water damage just from being in my pocket on a hot day. So I had this phone less than a month, and it is destroyed just from being in my pocket. I paid $1000 for it. I'VE had about 10 much cheaper phones that were always in my pocket on hot days, and they all were fine. But not this inferior piece of crap. Don't waste your money on this defective garbage."
"For a phone coming in at $900 I expect it to be a little more robust.  It worked okay although the front screen is more gimicky than anything.  The real problem is the fragility.  I noticed after a month that the glass was showing light scratching just from going into my pocket and out.  At around a month and a half I dropped it ON THE CARPET and the front display became spiderwebbed with cracks.  I went to Motorola's website and learned this not covered under warranty and the repair would cost $600!  So, I decided to go back to the Samsung Galaxy Z flip.  This RAZR phone is using substandard glass -- stay away."
No charger...just cord
"better watch out, I got this in Oct. and yesterday I wanted to change my provider and found out the IMEI was black listed as stolen, I ordered an UNLOCKED Razr plus from Motorola. I talked to Motorola and the provider and both said they don'y block phones. Funny that Motorols sold it so they must have gotten it from someone. Moto won't do anything but Amazon is taking it back, now I have no phone  and have to wait for the next one I buy. I have had Motorla all my Cell life with no trouble, now don't know which to get."
This has so many glitches.  Where do I start.  Dropped it once and outside glass broke.  Inside screen has vertical lines up and down it.  Some notifications don't work.  Warnings every few seconds.  While talking on the phone it'll hang up with the person you are talking to and dial someone else.  Etc........
"The main screen has failed for no discernable reason.Motorola support did not respond, and their chat AI ran in circles without any resolution.The recommended trouble-shooting PC app will not connect to the phone, and I am six hundred some-odd dollars in the hole with nothing to show for it. This was the last Motorola product I will ever purchase."
"After barely a month, and overly babying the phone knowing the screen can be delicate, the pixels in the fold still died. This phone was kept in a pocket with no other items AND in a case. Was never dropped or damaged, and the screen still died. Really sad as we were excited to have a folding phone again."
I saved up to get this phone. I bought it and turns out to be defective. It odd that Google assistant can't installed on this... Amazon has been ugly to me about returning this. I need a phone and i don't have extra money to get another one.. Not exactly cheap!!!!! I am on edge of not using Amazon bc they barely speak English and are not that nice... FYI that was me putting it nicely. It sure is strange that all my accounts just about have been hacked since this phone
"for the price, nah.  there are some things that don't work as advertised.  takes great photos but, the volume fluctuates and sometimes it turns off by itself.  Not worth the price.  trying to get a replacement is a PAIN"
I bought this phone without knowing that it will be a disaster. People never hear me well my voice just cuts off in the middle of the call. The speaker doesn't work will. Price reception is not good. I honestly won't be buying never another flip phone I. My life.
"I decided to try to go back to Motorola after many years of samsung galaxy phones. BIG MISTAKE. Phone is glitchy, it doesn't flow good from outer screen to inside screen, signal is not good. Could list more but why. Just not a good product"
Worked good for about 12-13 days then the middle began getting a crease and a few days later got lines down my screen so In my opinion it's definitely not worth it and good luck getting a refund
"I received the Motorola Razr as a gift for my mother at a great price of $699. Upon activation the phone was overheating and extremely hot to the touch. I am returning this and having to purchase a new one, as Amazon does not allow for exchange. It will take up to 30 days after the return in received to get a full refund. In the meantime I'm out of $699 twice, not a great experience."
"Bought it listed as new. The box had 'mom' written on it and the seals were broken. Opened it up and the front screen was cracked.  I'm returning it, but won't likely be trying to order another one."
"Phone was fine during set up, however, the sim slot on the one I got was defective and would not read the sim card. Could not actually activate the phone."
"This was returned within two days of using.  The battery life is ridiculous.  You need to charge it more than once a day. Not worth the money.  Even though it folds in half it's still huge in your pocket and even extra wide with a case on it. Definitely needs a better battery.  I don't like not having the ability to have an SD card either, just internal memory. Also when I first opened it, it looked used and had fingerprints and dust all over it."
Screen protector cracked at inner Fold area.  ( Mfr defect) Motorola informed that phone is under warranty. Free shipping return label However $75.00 cost to customer to replace screen protector.  Motorola said Warranty does not cover screen protector…. How can a manufacture warranty not cover due to manufacture defect??  That’s just bad business! Buyer beware !!
Great phone but the screen was damaged with a red line down the center when I received so I returned it. It is a nice looking phone though.
Well it was working fine but month later there line from top of phone to middle won't go away even if I reset the phone and freeze up once while. I search this been happening to a lot customers. I going return it back I hope once they receive it for they can see what I saying. I hope I can my refund back
"Purchased the new RAZR Plus to replace my razr 5G. Speakers are horrible, very muffled and muted. Returned original phone and ordered a second RAZR Plus and had the same speaker problem.  Googled the issue and found numerous videos and warnings about this problem. When I contacted Motorola to ask them about the issue, they said that they knew of No such issues."
Great design and finally a better hinge comparing to the previous models. Having said that phone died after 3 weeks of using it. Phone was wirelessly connected to the Google Auto while driving to work suddenly got extremely hot and power off  and never turned back on. Tried everything without success.
Worst made phone I’ve ever had. Main screen unresponsive after one month. Sent to Motorola for repair/replacement and the phone they sent back stopped working after 4 hours. Amazon made an exception and allowed return but charged me a 20% restocking fee. Avoid this phone like it’s the plague.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Did not like quality of videos static noise
"My first Motorola phone. This phone leaked liquid that gave me a burn, yet there was no assistance from anyone. No wonder people choose Samsung over Moto"
I've had this phone for 5 weeks and the screen broke in the hinge. Absolute waste of money.
"This phone is trash. Screens blacked out, overheats and powers off randomly. Please save your money. It's too expensive to be this crappy."
"screen cracked right where the hinge, have had it since December.  not worth the 699.99"
Phone fully charged would only last 30min. I don't know what all the hype was over this phone I was not at all impressed.
"How to contact the seller I had many dysfunctions in it , you can not depend on it , turning of suddenly ,and also jumping from app to app with out even open the app?"
I did not get Power Adapter as stated included in the box. Very Disappointed.
"When run the Imai, said is Locked."
"Outer screen is bigger on this one. Other than that they removed wide angle photos slapped ""AI"" on it and haven't upgraded the storage options since the 2020 RAZR. At this point at least add an sd card slot for people that want more storage without paying a monthly fee."
"I purchased 1 in 6 month ago.  The hardware is great.  Solid, you barely notice the crease.  However, Motorola support is terrible.  Many other and older phones already have been updated to android 14.  All I get from Motorola is that they will let me know when I am eligible.  That is NOT acceptable and they lose 2 stars for that.  This may be my last Motorola."
"I've been an iPhone user for 15 years, and this is my first experience with an Android phone. It took me nearly a month to get comfortable with the Android operating system. One thing I do appreciate is the phone's lightweight design, which makes my iPhone 14 Pro Max feel like a brick in comparison.The screen quality, both on the front and back, is impressive, and the battery life is outstanding. I can go 2 to 3 days without needing to charge it, which is a big plus. However, the phone feels overpriced for what it offers. There is no MagSafe, and I’ve noticed occasional lag. The biometrics are inconsistent, and the face recognition feature is unreliable. The speakers are another major letdown as they sound like an old AM radio. The Wi-Fi connection is stable, but nothing exceptional.The biggest disappointment for me is the camera. Both the front and rear cameras perform worse than my old iPhone 7. If you plan to use this phone for social media, it is a bad choice since your videos will look like they were taken on a 2004 flip phone. Despite all these issues, I'm keeping the phone simply because I like its compact size, which fits comfortably in my pocket.I’m also frustrated with the misleading advertising about the camera and camcorder features. Motorola's ads made a big deal about these features, but they don’t live up to the hype. I regret not going for the Samsung Flip instead, although I’ve had bad experiences with Samsung products in the past, even though I loved my old Motorola Razr and Pebble from before the smartphone era.Another drawback is the lack of quality cases. The official cases are made from cheap, low-quality plastic, which is disappointing.In summary, the Razr+ 2024 had the potential to be much better. I don't recommend it, but I'll keep using it for the next two years until something better comes along. Motorola should be embarrassed by this phone as it looks great but performs poorly."
Absolutely junk!  They need to recall this crap.  Dead pixels in my screen.  Folded lines in the middle.  Phone bends slightly backwards and makes it awkward to look at the screen.  And now my phone has no service due to a faulty mother board.  Never ever will I get a foldable phone.  Don't waste your money.
"I bought this phone new from the store (cricket wireless) a mere 6 weeks ago. I was excited about it because I had an original razr back in the day, and I treated this phone as if it were made of gold! Even still, only 6 weeks in, the screen developed a crack underneath the glass, right where it folds! Within an hour, over half of the screen was black and it was completely unresponsive! The idea of this phone is awesome, but the quality is just not there. Not even close. It is an absolute waste of money, the battery life was half that of my s21, the speed of the processor was okay and the sound was mediocre."
"I love the look and feel of this phone. But I think I am going to return it as I'm already seeing issues. First one of my apps does not show notifications. It will at times and other times not. Granted, it might be the app itself. But then I was watching a prime video and the movie would disappear when I had the phone horizontally for viewing. I could hear the audio but not the video. I unflipped it and video would appear. It was annoying to have to do that throughout the movie.During a video chat, the person said the quality of the video was horrible, it was hard to see images..Now I am reading reviews about cracked screens and the fold messing up. I'm starting to regret the purchase. And this is not a cheap phone. Do your research before buying it and determine if you really want the phone. The concept is great and the look is sleek. But for the cost, I don't want to have it unusable in the first 3 months. I expect the phone to last 5 years"
"After almost a year, a big brown/black circle appeared on the lower right side of the screen just enough to make the phone almost unusable.  A small fortune to get the screen replaced. Not a happy camper there."
I love the form factor. I like the way they allow you to run any app on the cover screen and see if it works.I don't like their water resistance and the fact that they don't support stereo Bluetooth sounds like they're just lazy.
This is my second 2023 razr+ my first one developed a horizontal crack right where the phone creases and this is doing a vertical dead spot this phone is only 2 months old and I rarely flip this phone they told me not to do it so much with the new one. Called Motorola they want you to send the phone in and put a $500 hold for them to send you a phone to borrow until they figure out what wrong with yours. Battery lasts about half a day.
"Second time I've had to send my phone in for warranty work.  AVOID THIS COMPANY!!!  2.5 hours on a call only to find out that the extra expensive warranty plan I paid for has another deductible, they won't cross ship a phone, so now I lose $114 and I don't have a phone for 2 weeks.  Motorola will die as a manufacturer."
"This is my first Smartwatch. Didn't order more expensive Fitbit. Ordered this less expensive watch instead. Real downside: Accompanying instructions have limited information. YouTube instructions shows a very fast video process without audio. Useless for a person who needs audio, as well as, hands on instructions. Still trying to understand all of the functions by trial and error."
"The watch comes with 3 bands using quick connect pins which makes for easy changes. The setup was pretty easy using the app.  The functionality is great for the price you pay.My one uses issue is that when I tried to charge the watch using the supplied charging cable it did nothing. I had it connected to cable for 2  hrs and the watch lost 3% of its power.  I tested the power output from charging block thru the cable and it was 5w and should have worked.It may be something wrong inside the watch, so I will need to return it.  It would have been great for my daily cycling workouts."
"Several functions do not work, such as lift arm to light up dial. Messages don’t show. Cannot load contacts. Downloaded the app, but not sure it’s helpful. The watch is a nice size, and it’s nice it came with extra bands."
I had to return because set up was not happening. So I don't know if it is good or bad!
It work fine… but it is huge on my arm.
I purchased two.  One for my husband and one for myself.  My husband is very happy with his.  Mine does not keep correct step count.
Good price but would not stay linked with phone and hard to see outside
"I like that the step function, & everything works, EXCEPT for the sleep function.  It doesn't work at all.  I bought this watch to track my sleep patterns, & it is not working.  ALSO, it was shipped in a box, along with two bottles of vitamins, all separate orders.  I didn't care about that, but nothing on the box, showed it was a lithium battery, & there was no packing to cushion anything inside the box.  UPS delivered the box, torn up, & smashed.  I am surprised anything in the box survived the trip.  I wouldn't order this watch, if you expect all functions to work. Very disappointed!"
"The watch itself isn't half bad. Multiple faces, decent sized but not too large of a display. Band fits good.But the phone interface software is terrible. Not customizable at all. My Fitbit died and I am looking for a watch that shows me texts, keeps my sleep time and my workout heart rate. That's it. 3 features.Sleep mode, you can't change/edit. So if it doesn't pick up you're laying in bed playing on your phone, it thinks you're still sleeping and you can't change it (I keep track of total sleep).Working out? You can't start/stop/edit a workout.Text message font on the watch? It's tiny. Non customizable.It's just not there. Guess I'll go back to fitbit."
The app you needed to download was confusing and made me download other apps which completely messed up my phone arrangement of the apps I already had. My computer guy erased the app in order to get my phone back to normal.I returned the watch
Watch is not reliable for delivering text messages.
Quit syncing to its own app. Watch is not user friendly. Never did fina an option for the battery usage. Waste of money. Wasn’t expecting much for price but more than two days would have been nice.
In order to set time you have to register and leave your credit card. They billed me 34.95! Rip off!
Too confusing can set the time or anything
Poor instructions  Cannot connect it
"This affordable smartwatch offers impressive value with its comprehensive feature set, though it comes with some notable limitations. The sleek design catches the eye, though contrary to product images, the screen isn't truly edge-to-edge. The watch excels in basic fitness tracking, monitoring steps, calories, workouts, heart rate, and blood oxygen levels with some level of accuracy. Sleep tracking provides useful insights into sleep quality and patterns. But take those results as an estimate and as for reference.The Bluetooth calling feature works well, and the watch seamlessly connects to your phone for notifications. Battery life is commendable, charging is quick, and the inclusion of two extra bands adds value. The user interface is intuitive, with plenty of customization options for watch faces.However, the voice assistant functionality is limited – while it processes commands, it doesn't provide audio responses like similar smartwatches at this price point, instead displaying results on your phone. This might disappoint users expecting a more interactive experience.Despite its shortcomings, this smartwatch serves as a solid entry-level option for those seeking basic smart features and fitness tracking without breaking the bank. Just adjust your expectations regarding the voice assistant and display specifications."
"I loved the watch, but I didn't realize that it wasn't going to last.  I got the watch not too long ago and I was wearing it every day but all of a sudden it broke.  It doesn't want to turn on and the charger cable doesn't connect to the watch.  It is a very weird charger with magnet that doesn't stick to the right area on the watch.  ahh....  bummer"
I liked it for the first week but already it won’t turn on or take a charge.
Band was too small hard to understand how to set it. Will have to return
"It was a really nice watch, but I had to send it back. It gave a tingling sensation down my arm."
"Nothing related to what they publish, the price is exaggerated for the product they offer.I would recommend looking for another option... on the other hand, the device worked the first day. The next day I failed.Nada relacionado ao que publicam, o preço é exagerado para o produto que oferecem.Eu recomendaria procurar outra opção... por outro lado, o aparelho funcionou no primeiro dia. No dia seguinte eu falhei.Nada relacionado con lo que puiblican, el precio es exagerado por el producto que ofrecen.Recomendaria buscar otra opcion... por otro lado el dispositivo funciono el primer día. al día siguiente fallo."
"I bought this watch because I thought it would be a good buy. Because of all of the wonderful reviews, it has well me and my husband have both been working on this watch for about two hours now trying to get the notifications to come through and my husband is very smart when it comes to computers and he can't figure this out. Worst experience ! There is no number for customer service . So i csnr get no one to help us . The style of the watch is beautiful and I really wish we could get it to work, but unfortunately we've done everything we know to do. Please help !!!!!! This watch was $60 !!"
"Unfortunately this watch which is massive by the way did not live up to expectations I wore it along side my Fitbit for 24 hrs and the step difference was huge 94 steps Vs 2517 Fitbit I know I did more than 94 I also had a sleep time of 8 hrs and 4 mins but I was only in bed for 5, so I started the return, next day noticed the rash on both wrists where if worn watch so avoid if any metal allergies"
"This watch is designed terribly. The set-up process is not intuitive. Thank god for Google. We will see if it works now. It’s a low cost option but know it reflects it. You can’t change the time on the watch itself.  You may want to put that in the instructions since that’s what I spent a lot of time trying to do. You have to download the app and pair. What kind of watch makes it so you can’t adjust the time. Anyway, if it works it will be worrh it. I just want to count my steps and see the time. Nothing fancy."
I can walk around for 5 minutes and it won’t track any steps. Heart rate tracking is not immediate. Does not measure heart rate variability. Wording on app is awkward English translations. Watch screens took a while to learn how to navigate to where I wanted to go. Otherwise it’s cute and comfortable but I liked the data from my old Fitbit better.
The pros: holds charge for days; attractive;sleep data seems accurate;keeps good time; 3 bands. Cons: inaccurate step count by 50%; difficult to change fitness activities; gps location is incorrect much of the time; weather is incorrect.I haven’t even tried the phone features as everything seems difficult to navigate/use. I would NOT recommend .
Will only show text or call notifications. Will not sync with alarm or other apps.
"It would not accurately read the calories burned during a workout. An intense 45 minute workout only read to 39 calories. Then it halted the entire calorie-tracking function completely. So by the end of the day, after 8 hours, it still stayed at 39 calories."
Watch quit charging after two weeks.
This watch has the utility that I needed at a great price functional in that it can alert me to text messages and handle calls without me taking out my phone . The speaker is very good on this watch you can listen to music on it also. It counts my steps automatically and the face can be changed easily. The issues I have are that it sometimes has trouble bonding with my phone initially but that's ok because once it's bound it stays that way so I don't have to keep checking the phone. That being said it doesn't have wear os so you can download apps and while the functionality is good the fun is lacking. I understand the price point is a trade off. I am glad I started with this watch but I intend to invest a few hundred on a watch with wear os in the future.
"Recently received the-Banlvs Smart Watches for Men Women with Call: Fitness Trackers with 24-Hour Heart Rate SpO2 Sleep Monitor 5ATM Waterproof 120+ Sport Mode Smartwatch Compatible with iPhone Android Phones (Rose Gold)Upon opening, noticed few selections of band, DONT WORRY, these are incredibly easy to change! Very creative “I’m a huge watch collector “ this is impressive!!!It does come with smaller bands, great thinking….Linked to iPhone very easy and fast….Mine did have a scratch on screen, upon opening…. Things in factories are either man made at times or placed so again things happen…Communication is clear, but I do feel could be just a little better!Main note! This was heartbreaking to me….So everyone lists these as KID/CHILDREN…. Safety for “whatever “ reasons… I didn’t think I guess but I did have to “UNDERSTAND” sooooo a child goes to school with this cool smart watch…. Safety or whatever you may have planned this item for? It will not be able to connect calls if they don’t have a phone “I know I know duh!” But I really wasn’t thinking…. So assume others won’t either! I’m sorry but my opinion is age limit , I have my own thoughts on when children should have a phone…Please know , watch will have to be connected to something to be able to use phone/textFor price? I think is on point! Technology has come a long way and here is proof! As describedI appreciate you taking time from your day to read this honest review! Blessings"
"Quality: basic features, not like your usual apple or Samsung watch. Nor your cheap android phone either. 7/10Color: the watch dose obtained good pastel pink with the tint of rose gold 10/10Weight: not to heavy on the wrist, lightweight is best to describe. 10/10Accuracy: may it did come with a warning, the accuracy for it's heart rate & blood oxygen would be off due to ""skin color"". For someone with deep melanin, it somewhat does have difficulty of finding it's accuracy of rates. The watch is pretty decent of tracking steps & distance. 7/10Screen sensitivity: poor, yet reactive 6/10Phone calls & messaging: very poor, due to its Bluetooth connection, majority calls that where on speaker tend to have issues. Also messaged was very difficult to send, due to ""voice assistant"" was very slow & couldn't understand me especially in a quiet area. my phone can be a problem with Bluetooth all the time. If your battery on phone cannot handle Bluetooth all day, it's best not recommended this type of device. 4/10Personalization: Minimal themes, yes you can upload your own images, and change color fonts. But overall, it would've been nice to have a bit more features. 4/10Thank your, for reading this review"
"Awful watch. Don't waste your money. I have had it for two weeks and it already stopped working. I thought it just needed to be charged, but I plugged it in all night and it's still completely dead. Very frustrated."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The watch design is stylish rememsent of more expensive brands. please ignore the jewelry, the watch does not come with jewelry its sold separately, but even without the jewelry the watches appearance is conversation starterThe design is nice but one of the main reasons I purchased this watch was for the health monitor features etc, but unfortunately the accuracy of vital monitoring are inconsistent for example my heart rate and steps were either over estimated or under estimated during various physical activity'sConnecting Alexa was a bit frustrating I had to go through the required steps multiple times before the connection was successful, additionally importing contacts was also disappointing as the watch only imported a limited amount of numbers some of which I don't use oftenA positive aspect, the watch can make and receive phone calls simply install the corresponding app and follow the steps, it's nice that I no longer have to fumble with my phone during multitasking errands, call quality is good no need to pay additional costs for cell serviceScreen quality is decently clear, and crisp, not as clear as some watch brands but nice enough it's pretty bright outdoors, as for durability? the watch is pretty durable able to withstand normal use, though I have never dropped or scraped the watch against a hard surface to know for certain that it can survive a serious scrape etc.Charging is pretty straight forward the magnetic charging cable is included in the packaging, battery life isnt bad the watch last a few days for me on a full charge around four or five daysConn if you have allergies and or your skin is sensitive you may want to consider getting a clear cover for the censors as the watch censors may cause skin irritation, I experienced noticable skin irritation and discomfort while wearing the watch which forced me to stop wearing it prior to applying a clear coverWould I recommend this watch? If the health monitoring capabilities, and overall functionality are important you this watch isn't the best you can get at this price point there are several affordable smart watches popping up on the market today that offer better performance, budget friendly doesn't have to mean poor or mediocre performance anymore."
"After a couple of weeks of use, two main complaints.  First time using outdoor run option, the information about the run was off.  Said my pace was 8-9 minute mile range, when the pace I was doing was definitely sub 7 minute mile.  Maybe it takes time to calibrate, I don't know.  It seems to be working better the more runs that I go on.  Another gripe is that the distance wouldn't stay on miles, it repeatedly switched to kilometers by itself.  Which required logging onto the VeryFit app and changing it back manually.  Matter of fact I need to do that again right now.  It's a little distracting to have to remember that a kilometer is 0.62 of a mile and do the required math while running.  Other than that everything else so far has worked as advertised."
I read good reviews online about this product and decided to try it. I’m on day 2 so I’m not totally done trying to figure out how to use it. So far it’s been pretty disappointing. Reviews gave the impression that this device offers the same functionality as Fitbit. That’s misleading. It has some similar options with the same labels but they do not function in the same way. For example you are only able to log exercises from their list of options and you must start and stop in real time. You can’t do a work out and enter the details afterwards and if you do not do the exercises on their list you have no option to add it at all. Also I am American and while I acknowledge our units of measurement are different from everyone else’s it’s still what we use- they offer the option for pound rather than kilo for body weight but not cups vs milliliters for water consumption. I’m not as interested in the phone and camera connections. I want an actual fitness and health tracker. So far this one isn’t well suited to that purpose. The cost is appealing but in this case I feel I got what I paid for.
"This watch is not compatible with Google phones. I have a Pixel 7 and I can't see any of the apps, contacts, etc I have on my ph. It disconnects from the VeryFit app regularly. I am not sure if this ph is defective or the description on compatibility is incorrect/deceiving. I will keep it for a while longer but if I continue to have issues I will return it"
"It’s a decent watch for the price but only lasted a few months. A couple times I’ve experienced it being completely unresponsive, and not turn on at all or the sensor stopped working. For the price it shouldn’t be surprising but it’s unfortunate it isn’t super reliable."
Great watch but no plug to go with charge cord.  Need one.  BAD when you can't even charge watch without it.  Shame on this company for not putting one in there
"This is a very nice product. It does more than my Fitbit does. However, it would be nice to speak a message to respond to texts. Also the battery doesn’t last more than 3 days so I have to charge it more than I like to"
"First of all, I have had this fitness tracker/watch less than a month.  I love the device itself, it does everything I want. However, I doubt the battery life will hold up - the battery has begun to require charging every other day or so.  All that being said;The most annoying issue is a “system glitch.”  It’s impossible to access the Fitness App’s privacy policy change updates. In the (attached) screen shot, you can see a drop down menu that constantly “pops up.”  When you click on the “blue” ((Privacy Policy)) link, nothing happens.  Since I can’t access the update, I click “Disagree,” and the screen. Instantly goes to black. I am forced to go through this process multiple times before I can see my data. I have found no way to access recent changes to the privacy policy.  I have additionally spent hours on this issue with customer service- via both chat and phone, to no avail.  I find this enormously frustrating, therefore I intend to return this product."
I really like the watch. Easy to use.  However it does not receive call or text messages 75% of the time because it keeps disconnecting from the bluetooth.  The whole point of having it is so I get notifications while my phone is on silent mode.  Phone is always in my pocket so it's not because I am to far away.  It's very frustrating.
"This watch isn't bad, but there's lots of issues. So first off, the Alexa completely sucks, I'm not trying to over exaggerate, it truly is bad. You have to be in a completely quiet environment for Alexa to hear you correctly. And when it does work, it is VERY slow. Next the screen isn't bad but the lack of animation is a little disappointing. For example, when you swipe between different sections, it cuts abruptly to that section. It isn't a big deal, but unsatisfying. While you do receive notifications from your phone, it's kind of strange. When you get a notification, the text appears in like an ugly comic sans font. The text on the notification also is spaced out in places where it shouldn't making it kind unreadable. Also, heart rate and blood oxygen level have to be taken manually, and even when you do, it take like 20 seconds. And finally, the haptics module (the thing that makes the watch vibrate) feels really cheap like it too is shaking all about inside. I don't really recommend this watch."
"The features of the watch work great. However, the band strap broke off in less than three weeks of wearing it. I was unable to return the watch because I was out of down during the return widow."
This watch doesn't fit my arm. So I sent them back and am waiting for a refund to order other.
"This watch preforms fine for the cost value, tracking sleep and steps reasonably. My phone connects to the watch itself fine, and the watch has its own app that works.But the description claimed it could connect to Apple health, and the steps do not populate in Apple. I called Apple support, who informed me the issue was with the app. So it works, but it doesn’t work well with Apple, and that was the reason I bought mine, so I am displeased.My husband likes the options for customization of the watch front."
"I wanted a  Watch that would show my  husband’s sleep patterns. Although it shows that he sleeps, it also does not show accurately, the amount,, but does give me an idea that he did sleep at some point. My Fitbit watch accurately recorded all sleep. This one is helpful and was also a quarter of the price. It has many benefits that I don’t need.. you can take phone calls you,  contact Alexa, or a list of those who called. Record your  heart rate, breathing, stress, etc. I am hoping the app can improve  The quality of sleep  Aside from that I am quite happy with it."
"My watch didn’t count my steps properly, compared it with my phone’s numbers and the Apple Watch and it was always a lot more steps than on any other device. It counted my steps even when I was asleep or sitting for a long time.Home screen that I had chosen disappeared at list once a day, Alexa was disconnected and didn’t work at times when my phone was around and nothing happened to cause a disconnection with her.But overall it’s an ok product for its price and does a whole lot of things while it’s a lot cheaper than the Apple Watch."
"I bought this mainly to track my steps. I like that it also tells you your stress level throughout the day. HOWEVER, I am quite dissatisfied that the sleep monitoring aspect of this does not work. It worked once. And, yes, I have it turned on to monitor my sleep quality."
"I ordered this in April and now it's September and I need a new one. It no longer ""wakes up"" when I raise my arm immediately but takes about 5 seconds to come on. The battery is charged but it still takes forever. Starting at my watch for that long waiting to see the time is too much."
"I wear a FITBIT on my ankle but wanted to buy something to wear on my wrist, this one fit the deal with price and features. The only feature i don't like is exercise/zone minutes, unless I refresh my pulse I never get any zone minutes. On my FITBIT I would have 104 and 3 on this device, that is the only feature I find disappointing"
"Received Smartwatch on time without any problems, set-up was easy to do, everything work fine for the exception of the phone when receive call unable hear them, tried so may things to fix it no results."
"For the cost of the watch, I don’t think it is worth it. It gets 3 stars because the notification feature, sleep, fitness and blood oxygen test all work fine while the weather feature did not work for me.  The dial pad works about 50% of the time and the same with the alexa. Other wise the watch is fine, Not super heavy, the screen is very durable and looks sleek. For the money it costs you could get better."
"I just got my fitness watch yesterday. As of now, it doesn't seem like the calories are accurate nor the heart beat. I can't give a 5 star or bad review right now because I've only had it one day."
"We have had the watch just under maybe 7-8 months and now it doesn't come on or work. Never got wet or banged or dropped, just stopped."
"The design, app, heart rate tracker and sleep tracker are all nice on the watch. Probably a good watch for walkers and runners. Unfortunately, I was losing a lot of data because the watch was having trouble synching with the app. If my phone was not in my pocket, the watch would lose connection and then the connection may or may not be able to be reestablished for the rest of the day. I ended up returning it after I could not reestablish connection for a whole 12 hours.I also do a circuit/HIIT workout for my workout, which is not an option (a free option, I should say) on the app."
"I have had a FitBit for years and it finally stopped working. Being on a budget I tried this device. The screen was fun and colorful and it was comfortable to wear. However, it would not easily sync to the app on my phone which was frustrating. Ultimately, I returned this and went back to a new FitBit with a discount due to being a loyal previous customer. I am now very pleased and it was worth a bit more money for my needs. :)"
It works great for tracking your steps. Used in Europe on our vacation and loved it. I do have issues with receiving calls. Some days it works other times not.
See above
Like the size and different components but it wouldn't  pair with the phone
"So far I think it is good, I really thought I could listen to music on my watch via the product video and since I can answer calls on my watch. That's disappointing but, it'll work for now.  And the product didn't show what kind of watch screen protector to buy so the one I bought doesn't fit like it should."
"After three months it started randomly doing the following without my choosing actions...starting the fitness tracker, linking to my music on my phone, randomly calling phone numbers on my phones contact list, trying to link with Alexa (I never linked it with Alexa because I don't use Alexa, randomly dimming the screen, changing my watch face settings, etc. I tried to simply return the watch through Amazon. They referred me to the manufacturer this morning. We will see what happens. I am very unhappy at present. A watch should last more than 3 months."
"First off, I as excited to receive the package early, only to discover that the shrink wrap had been opened and when I opened the box there was no watch 🤔. Amazon replaced the watch immediately..when I got the replacement, I was disappointed in the watch face being really big and the band clasp is made of a flimsy plastic that I fear would break the first time it hit something.. although I am not pleased with the watch it doesn’t mean you wouldn’t be."
"This is my first smart watch. It has nice futures,but I was hoping for more. But for the cost, it is decent."
"I set my watch up with minimal issues and was very excited about using it. The first time I synced it with the app was OK. After that, the app doesn’t show that it was set up and when I try to reset it, the message is that no device can be found. This is very frustrating and I wish I would have ordered another Amazfit device because I never had these problems"
It doesn't accurately calculate calories burned while swimming.  It does weird things with all the activity calculator.  I know I didn't burn 2000 calories in an hour swimming.
"Easy to setup, readability nice, lightweight.  Problem for me was the placement of the sensor was on a raised circle area... irritated my wrist."
"This watch caused a burn on my skin!  While cleaning my house, I noticed blood on my arm and upon removing the watch there was more blood!  It actually burned a hole in my skin! !!!  I advise anyone not to wear this watch while working and sweating, apparently moisture under the watch caused this injury!!!"
"Pros: I like the look of this watch as well as the various functions. 4 ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️Con: The battery runs down quickly. Charged it to 100% two days ago, it’s at 50% today. Previous watch held battery life at least 2 weeks.Because of this I rate this 3 ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️Overall: 3.5 stars"
Very complex to set/up and get it running
"I purchased this watch in July, and here it is December and the watch is no good. It worked correctly for about 3 months...then downhill from there. The watch continuously disconnects from the paired App ( VeryFit App). It also disconnects from the Bluetooth, frequently.There is an 'after purchase' Facebook group where you can get assistance with 'troubleshooting '... that group is an absolute waste of time. You'll get a response when the Admins feel like it, or not at all. I've asked for help with my watch issues... no success. Again, I've had the watch less than 6 months. I haven't used this watch since October because it will not connect to my phone again. I've done all of the disconnect phone, unpair, uninstall and reinstall, clear cashe, all of it. Do not waste your money. ( I have a Samsung Ultra)Im giving one star because I like it for the 3 months that it worked. Zero stars for customer service."
i thought i was buying a fitbit really unclear to what it does as i can not get it to hook up to wifi  all it does is pretty much tell time and half the time it is not even correct on the time
"I usually like watches with these interesting band colors, but it wasn't right for me, didn't feel comfortable, and it didn't have a good selection of watch faces. They look good on the ads but IRL they aren't so good. I returned mine."
"bought two units, one is working excellent, the other; I tried to reset the GPS as it was not reading accurate distance while walking, so I returned."
step tracker is not accurate by any means. Gave me steps in my sleep. Said I walked 2.5 miles when I only walked 1.2. Everything else seems to be accurate
The band keep getting unhooked & rolls around. Not very comfortable fit!
"The device is easy to set up and syncs nicely with app.  I purchased 2-3 weeks ago and the crystal developed microfine scratches after 5 days of normal wrist wear.  The read out can still be seen, but in a few more weeks who knows.  I will not purchase this product again."
It is stated in the product description. My watch does not have touch sensitivity.
"This product did not actively track my heart rate, blood oxygen, and stress levels. I would ask it to track my heart beat, it would take a few minutes to calculate my heart beat and then it would beep at me. After that it would stop tracking my heart beat until I did it again. This was the same for the blood oxygen and stress level features as well. I have gotten two of these watches, but have the same problems with them."
It's waterproof but does work the same afterwards
Watch face changes on its own. BPM does not work which defeats the main reason why I purchased and the phone feature will not deactivate and turns on automatically and puts my phone calls on speaker w/o prompt.
I water aerobic and this watch didn't count anything water exertion.
The magnet on the charger isn’t lining up exactly on the watch. Is this normal?
"Didn’t care for the band, just when trying it out my wrist was sweating and the thin hairs were catching on the rubber plastic. Nice pink color, but the band looked cheap and inexpensive. I returned it based on looks and feel of the band only."
I found it difficult to operate and understand and especially the app why can't you just make it simple to understand before the majority of the buyers even though it's from a different country?  I think the value is not there for what you're getting in this watch  i'm sorry I cannot recommend
Doesn't let you know u have a text msg..
Do t not hold a charge longer then a day
"Worked great when first got for about a month. Never could read messages. Am only able to see I have a message, but can't read it. Doesn't count steps anymore."
"Didn't function as I expected.  Doesn't continuously keep track of heart rate, blood oxygen or stress rate. You have to hit a play button and wait a minute or two for it to read. Doesn't accurately track stats within activity modes. Need to sign in to the app everyday to sync to in order see your daily. Wanted to like it but I just couldn't.Missed the return window by 1 day so I'm stuck with it."
"App keeps disconnecting from Bluetooth. Alexa doesn't  work, keeps saying she doesn't understand. I've wasted my hard-earned money on this watch after searching  so long and  finally deciding  on this. What a huge disappointment."
"Data watch provides is inaccurate, combing your hair should not count as steps."
"Watch was way too big, wider than my wrist."
"Watch will not charge. Tried charging on my computer, wall outlets, everything I could think of.  It also stopped syncing to the app. You get what you pay for and that's what I got - a watch that's not good for anything. Stick with the tried and true more expensive watches."
"I'd like to give this watch a better review however a fitness watch should handle it's main duty well. I've owned several smart watches going clear back to the Pebble. I also run 10 miles per week and have many well established routes. This watch is off by more than a tenth of a mile. That adds up pretty fast and really messes with the other info it spits out. I attempted to talk with an online agent about ways to recalibrate the mileage and received no response from. The human agent. I think the app failed to post her responses because I could see her writing but no response was visible. It's a shame because it's not a bad watch for the price.  Battery lasts for days and the health sensors seem to be good, but not doing the main job aside from timekeeping is a real shame.That combined with poor customer service leads to a 1 star."
"I waited too long to return it and now I have a watch that tells time, but the other functions are completely false.Very disappointed!"
the instructions  were hard to see hard to use and unclear. I’m not using it period! It’s laying on my nightstand . Money wasted!
"Very poor quality app. The app automatically logs me out, then tells me I cannot log in because it is too busy of a time to get access. The app searches for the smart watch, but cannot locate it in the search even though the watch is right next to the app. The app is terrible! I would prefer to return the watch because the app stinks!!"
"I really like all the features, glad i didnt buy the whole $80, and got it on a discounted price, works good for a whole day, then tracks you for stuff you arent even doing the day after. Whole purpose why i got it! But not bad for something very temporary"
Watch never connected to the app on my phone.  I tried all suggestions but nothing worked. Customer support referred me to “Just Answers” for a $46 fee!  When I declined the fraudulent payment my debt card was blocked + I can’t fix it until I can get to the bank!  What a huge hassle!  So disappointed in Amazon for this affiliation.  I looked to Amazon that this was a reputable company.
"I rarely write reviews but depend on them so felt I should share. I got this because I’m really trying to track all of my health habits and steps. It takes forever to sync. It doesn’t automatically show on your app, you have to refresh it a couple times to even get it to show the previous day or two. Doesn’t sync correctly with Apple health app or any other app. Highly doubt it’s accurate. Do not buy this watch. Wish I would have returned earlier but was hoping it was user error and I’d figure it out but nope."
After two weeks the watch stopped giving me my notifications did a restart and new download worked. Now it won't give notifications or anything but steps - not sure if steps are correct.  Never has been wet always taken care of . For $50 I say don't waste your money.  Return window is closed and I have a junk watch I can not get refund on.
"So disappointed that the steps tracking feature stopped working after a bit over 3 months. I have been very careful with the product such as not to get it wet or scratched.  I tried turning off and restarting the watch.  I bought this since 2 other friends bought this product with no issues.  Not sure if product had any warranty, but the return period is over."
I purchased an ID208Plus watch in July.  Today is 08/30/2024 and this watch does not give any time or provide any of the described features of a smart watch.  The two items that do show up on the watch are a QR code to set up the veryfit app (which ends up not setting up) and a QR code that gives a link to the setup for the veryfit app that does not set up.  I am very disappointed in this watch.
The watch doesn’t work about half the time. I can be sitting in my house and it will tell me no longer connected. I will have to go to the app and reconnect. Sometimes I see text messages but most of the time I don’t. Just never worked correctly. I guess you get what you paid for. Going back to Fitbit.
I've had this watch for 2 months and it just stopped working. I completely charged it and I put it on not working 😕 not happy with this product. Don't wast your money like I did. You only have 30 days to return. Now I'm out my money for something that doesn't work.  Not happy
"This product did not count steps accurately, which is why I purchased it. I walked three separate times and manually counted steps with a clicker. The smartwatch only counted about 1/3 of the steps taken each time."
"I found it very frustrating to use.  Sending it back... I could never find the stopwatch on it, only the clock for alarm.  The search was NOT helpful in trying to find the stopwatch function either.  I am sure that there are some things to like about this fitness watch. However,  I need a stopwatch, and lack of information on how to use this watch is just too annoying to waste anymore of my time!  Plus, the watch is uncomfortable for me to wear, due to the heat coming from the element on the back."
The time stayed on Military Time
"Was Sent someones used watch with their information already in it when I purchased a new watch for new watch price. When I tried to remove that information, it wouldn’t let me because it said I had to remove old information which I did not have access to. In addition, the app kept going blank. Also add never said you had to buy a membership to get all features. There’s also no shutter when it says there was for camera."
"I am glad I waiting to review.  I have had this for 3 months now and it is only good for time, calls and tracking steps.  Every 2 or 3 days I have to add it back to the VeryFit for tracing steps, when it disconnects it also disconnects text messages.  Have not used the music.  Cannot get it to hook to my Vitality for steps tracking which was one of the main reasons for the purchase, not happy with this purchase, would not recommend purchasing."
Not worth the money. Fitpoli does not stand behind their product.  I have emailed them several times!!!!!
The thing I dislike the most is my watch doesn’t ring when I get phone calls like it says it does and doesn’t notify me when I’m getting a notification
"I bought this watch, thinking it could replace my simple Fitbit inspire HR. It is a total piece of junk. The sleep tracking is totally inaccurate and it will not auto recognize my outdoor walks. A simple task that it is unable to perform. I’m returning it and I will go back to Fitbit."
Keep dropping blue tooth.  Don't waste your money unless you just want a simple watch.
No matter what settings you choose it connects with your phone to answer calls and invades your contacts. This is after multiple times selecting no to these features
Had to return  didn’t work for me
"I'm used to wearing an analog watch. Just crook your arm, and there's the time. With this watch, you crook your arm, and the time takes one to four seconds to display. One second is not instaneous; two is inconvenient; three is obnoxious; and four is worthless. What's  worse: the delay seems to be getting longer. Too bad!"
"This watch was great for the price for 1 month. Right after the return window closed, it quit counting my steps. It still keeps time and some texts and calls come through, but I specifically wanted it to count my steps. Highly disappointed!  Would have been great if it kept on working."
"I bought this watch April 28th and had zero issues with it until it completely stopped working around August 6-8th. It won't charge or turn on anymore. Now I have no watch. It days they have a 5 year guarantee, so I'd like a replacement watch now, thank you."
The watch quit working after 4 months. It jumps from screen to screen and will not allow you to touch an icon. It also makes random phone calls and will not allow you to stop the call. I had to delete the watch from my phone to stop the calling. What a waste of money.
"It never worked 100%. I always felt like the calories burned were off, the app NEVER worked and it finally disconnected and would not reconnect. 10/10 not worth the money."
"This watch can hardly be called a women’s watch, and it’s tightest setting. It is way too loose and clunky for me, and while my wrists are small, they are not the smallest by far. The only way to discover this is to open it up and try it on, and when initiating a return, there is no guarantee of a full return, because the package has been opened VERY disappointed."
"This company does not stand behind’s their shoddy products. I have gone through 3 of them in less than a year. I was promised a 4th one that never arrived. If you want a bad watch, and get the runaround customer service then go ahead and purchase this garbage."
"This watch worked fine for 2 months. Now that it can't be returned, it stopped counting my steps.Anyone know how to get the steps to start working again?"
"This watch doesn't work correctly. Some nights it will register sleep other nights it won't and then you have to log in to the app for anything to update. One day I walked over 10,000 steps and it said I only walked a half a mile 😂😂 I don't like this watch at all and as soon as I find another one it will be replacing this one."
"Magnetic connection on the back for charger doesn’t stay connected for a proper charge, when it does charge it a great watch. Need to revisit the charging issue."
After a couple of weeks the watch won't charge.  kept it charging all night and it's completely dead.  I should have bought an apple watch like i used to have.  would love to send this one back but i don't have any paperwork to send it.  It was great in the beginning.  don't know if it's defective or what.
"I like the fact that it did everything it said it would do. I don’t like the fact that soon as the window closes to return and messes up so it’s only good for about 30 days. That sucks. I give it a zero star, but unfortunately you gotta pick one"
I bought 2 watches the first one will not keep time can’t connect to phone not right tim or dad e the security Mr would not connect at all o phone got these March 27 the first stopped working the 4 of June so of like a refund
This is the second one I have gotten with a broken HR monitor.
This purchase was a scam.  Every time I tried to download the supposed app for this watch.  I got nothing but scam apps.  Each time was something different.  I didn't want my phone being hacked.  I sent this watch back.
Won't charge
I want to use it as a health monitor & swimming & aerobics monitor!Hope the waterproof works
"Very nice looking watch.  I like the size. The watch does not count your steps correctly.  Not even close.  If your looking for a nice looking watch, I do recommend.  If you are looking for a step counter, I DO NOT RECOMMEND."
"I was searching for many different fitness watches and my main concern was getting one that isnt too large on my tiny wrist. I choose this one based on the rose gold color. Its definitely gold. Its has some orange tones to it as well. The package shows the silicone band and I was concerned I was sent the wrong one. It was the right one just not the color for me. I ended up returning this because of the color so I am not sure how the functionality of this is, but wanted to show some photos of sizes to help others decide. The band is 15mm wide. The thickness of the watch is 10mm. The whole thing (as we know 1.47"" diagonally) but its almost 1.75"" long. Hope this helps someone decide if this is for them or not!"
"The picture seemed mint green, but it was a drab, darkish green, more like olive but not as nice looking. I don't like the buckle on it, but that's my own personal preference. I sent it back because the color was so horribly off. Could not tell you about the function because I never made it that far."
The magnetic band gets caught on metal at times and loosened the band. So I am not too pleased with that.
Very difficult to sync watch with iPhone app.  Have not been able to do even with support guidance.  Calendar lacks “31” causing Oct 31 to be one Nov 1!  Plan to return.  Not easy to set.  Have yet to receive a sleep reading.
"This watch although lovely was incredibly hard for me to set with my arthritic fingers, so I had to return it and will get a simpler non bluetooth pedometer."
This tracker does not maintain the watch face that has been synced to it. It has to be reset frequently.
"Very disappointed with this purchase.  Band is held together by a magnetic, any slight movement it has to be adjusted or tightened, as well as it snags any fabric it comes in contact with.  Not to mention, it does not keep an accurate step count.  Will be purchasing a different brand asap!"
Nice watch but the metal bank is not smooth and gets caught and snags clothing.  Forced to look for another product. The band has ruined several pieces of my clothing.  😡
It would not hold a charge
"Came used - damaged box, no cord, no instructions, protective cover for screen stuck to outside of box. Tried to pair it with my phone anyway to see if I should exchange or return, and it won't work anyway. What a waste."
"All watches do not display correct day, does not Match calendar date and year.2024 12 14 shows as Sun."
"The product doesn't work, it doesn't connect. It doesn't work. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone"
The counter was inaccurate and very difficult to put on.
This watch is no good. It has stopped working. The quality is too bad!
"I acquired this smartwatch primarily to try its blood pressure monitoring, even though this technology arguably has yet to mature at the time of review. I compared the smartwatch readings to a known-working, traditional BP cuff, and through multiple readings and comparisons, the watch consistently gave systolic readings of 20, 30, and even 40 mmHg lower. However, the diastolic readings were comparable to the cuff.Much more surprising, the heart rate monitor was way off. The smartwatch readings were in the 90 bpm range at rest when I separately measured under 60 bpm.I also compared step counts against my popular, branded smartwatch at the gym. On the elliptical, my branded watch recorded about 1700 steps. This new watch barely recorded any steps, which may be particular to elliptical. However, performing yard work while wearing both watches, I simultaneously recorded 2,332 steps on my branded watch and 1,678 on this new one.Regarding notifications, I did receive some message notifications, but not all of them. Also, the weather app usually reads 20 C regardless of the actual temperature, such as 8 C outside. As such, there is some communication problem with my phone regarding weather data.After installing the companion app on my iPhone, I successfully paired the new watch within minutes. There are a range of watch faces to choose from that offer readable date, time, etc. The watch was easy to charge with the included magnetic adapter. The buckle closure on the wrist strap was less comfortable than my silicone sport band, though that is a personal preference.As minor attention to detail, the box's cover showed a pink band, as pictured, though I ordered a black model that was correctly inside as ordered. As a positive, I like the form factor and physical design, and I would love to wear it as my primary fitness watch if only I could fully trust the technology inside.Overall, in my opinion, this is an experimental tracker for first adopters who enjoy experimenting with new technology. I would not rely on it for high-stakes health readings."
"For the price, there's a lot to like here. It does a good job of monitoring heart rate and oxygen from what I can tell. However, the blood pressure reading is wildly inaccurate. I didn't have high hopes for this working, and I'm glad I didn't. One compared to an actual cuff measurement, this registered significantly low for me. I would not trust the blood pressure reading in the least bit."
"The watch looks nice on the wrist - a nice, polished and unobtrusive look so in contrast to ""fashion"" watches with more dials than the cockpit of a - well, you get the idea.  And that pretty much wraps up my positive statements. Oh, yeah - you have plenty of options for nice clock faces, and it keeps accurate time.  but  Nothing seems to be reasonably accurate. The blood pressure and pulse readings are off - sometimes by a wide margin. The temperature provided by the weather app only updates hourly; so that means it is only way off once per hour. And the step counter doesn't seem to want to count, you know, steps. I wore the watch on a known distance route. The first time, just as a step counter. 4 miles later, I was given credit for taking 168 steps. The next time, I ran the app's activity monitor for walk. 4 miles later, I got credit for about 2.5 miles.  So if you wear this watch, and use it to meet your goal of 8,000 steps - you will be in fantastic shape! Of course, you will have to hike to the moon and back to get those 8k steps; but that's a small price to pay, right?  Wrong! Don't bother getting this item."
"I got this mostly for the band. I hate the silicone bands everything comes with, makes me sweat and grim builds up. I love the metal mesh magnetic bands like this, it makes it very easy the adjust, on and off, and it breathes better. I also like this shape and size of a sports watch the best. Not too big but still has a screen that can be read. The brightness is good to see in the daylight, it can be adjusted. You use it with the FitCloudPro app on your phone. This is the ""H95"". When you open the app, the watch will sync. There is more stuff than I need to track, but it tells me the time, the date, day of the week, how many steps I've gone, my heartrate, blood pressure, oxygen level, and sleep. Blood pressure seemed to be about the same as my Dr's, and O2, heart rate. The step count is off. If you walk looking at the watch, the steps are not counted. If I walk swinging my arms, I walk 30 steps and it counts 19. there is no way to adjust the step counter, like adjust the length of your stride. So, you should pace off say 100 steps, see how many it counts then use the percentage to find you end of day total. You pace off 100, it counts 90, then you know the watch will be 10% less than what you actually walked."
"The watch band is very difficult to put on one handed. I never actually got it on by myself, my husband had to do it, and he didn't get it on easily with 2 hands."
"I DO LIKE that the watch vibrates if I've sat too long and gets me moving. The heart monitor seems to work well.  Mine does not count steps accurately and gives lots of extras - well, it certainly helps with reaching my goal.  My husband's seems to count better. Mine also does not accurately read oxygen levels - my oxymeter is much more accurate. I like the faces available and have even used a pic from my phone.  It sends texts to me and yet says it is NOT paired with my phone and requires an app to work. I do have the app on my phone.  I'm keeping it for the time display and the activity reminder. If I could rate mine and my husband's separately, I'd give mine 2 and his 4."
This watch works great for the most part. When I received it the display was slightly miss alined. I didn't that that was a bug deal though. The bigger problems come with the app. There are lots of spelling errors. You can't track you runs in miles. And there's no counter for stairs. There are no instructions to connect the weather.
"It is still early; however, I found the directions written in such small font that they were difficult to decipher. I am still in the midst of the learning curve."
"This is a nice watch with decent features...decent except for my desire for an accurate heart rate monitor.  Between workout sets this will show anything from resting values in the 50s to values I know to be more accurate in the 130s.  I've tried wearing it like a normal watch on the back of my wrist and also on the front of my wrist.  It is just not a good heart rate monitor.  Neither does it seem to be a reliable sleep pattern monitor as it was recording sedentary periods throughout the middle of the day as ""light sleep""."
"I like just about everything about this watch but very disappointed with the lack of accuracy in step counting, which I like to track daily. It calculates way more than my actual steps.  Does anyone else have this problem?"
"There are a lot of great things about this watch, especially considering the price point. However, the step counting is wildly off. I have been sitting almost entirely since putting it on & it has shown I've taken over 250 steps. Step counting was my main reason for wanting it & just liked all the other perks. The app is okay. Not too many bells & whistles. Easy to navigate. Seems if nice quality. Everything is smooth & comfortable. I just can't with the step counting. So, it's either going to my husband or returned."
Watch has sleek design and item arrived quickly.  Battery life not great has to be charged every other day. Enclosed written  instructions for pairing the watch not easy to follow. .Thank goodness for youtube instruction videoes. I probably wouldn't purchase again. Step count not very accurate.
"works good , but i didn't get the magnetic band and the one i got doesn't work"
Band is uncomfortable and unreliable information
Product just didn't work well for me.
"I bought two, one for me and one for my husband. My husband needs to check his oxygen levels and heart rate throughout the day, so we thought this would be a good way to do it. Unfortunately, the oxygen monitor does not work on either watch. The watch says testing and you can see the numbers change, but when finished, it always reverts to 99. When compared with the finger oxygen monitor, it is way off. I also noticed that the information on the phone app is different than what is on the watch. When I contacted the seller, I was told the engineers don't know why this would be occurring and to utilize devices that are made for monitoring heart rate and oxygen, rather than rely on the watch."
This works pretty good with your pulse and that's it. When I get up in the morning it continues to have me in a light sleep for about four more hours. I sure wish I could sleep more. Steps aren't correct and it has my oxygen level 4-5 points higher that my pulse ox meter. So I would not recommend
I received my watch. It looked good.  I could not remove the straps.  It came with gold and a red finish watch band.  I wanted to put the gold one on.  I could not remove the other band.  I texted and they were no help at all.  So I am returning it.
"I got this to keep track of my steps, calories burned, and track my outdoor bike rides. It pauses for no reason, or doesn’t record the distance at all, or stops tracking in the middle of my work out. The heart rate monitor is not accurate, and it doesn’t count all my steps. Really wanted it to be as good as the other reviews, but sadly will be returning it. Gave it 2 stars because it looks fine, and keeps time."
This is a very stylish watch. The app is easy to use and connecting it to my phone was a breeze. The only downfall is that it provides an inaccurate step count. I wore the watch overnight to track my sleep and when I woke up the watch said I had taken 120 steps already. I noticed just waving my arms around would trigger the watch to count that as a step. This was the only disappointing thing about the watch.
"I recently began walking daily and bought this specifically to track my steps and distance. I know for a fact the exact distance I usually walk and it's telling me I walked 1.34 miles, not the true 1.7 miles.  The steps don't make sense either. And it says my blood pressure is 151/50.  Ha ha definitely not!  As much as I like the look, feel, app, etc, I'll be returning it."
Very disappointed i didn't get all the pieces needed to swap bands. I'm not a fan of the rubber/plastic ones. Customer service won't respond to my request for the piece I need. Deal breaker for me. Looking for different brand/seller.
"Cute fitness watch; however . . . The heart rate monitor is very intermittent and often inaccurate when it does function. For example, a heart rate reading of 75 bpm as I'm hiking uphill, with a 25-pound rucksack, and out of breath. The blood pressure reading is very inaccurate. For example, the watch regularly states that my blood pressure is 150/75 when in fact my blood pressure is well under 120/80. Also, the pedometer is highly inaccurate. I completed a 5-mile hike and logged only 3,000 steps according to this watch. Yet, my iPhone recorded over 10,000 steps, and I know for someone of my stature, 10,000 steps is equivalent to ~4.6 miles. Furthermore, I cannot reset the time/date or switch to mph/miles unless I create an account through the GloryFit app (which has less-than-stellar reviews). I'm not interested in creating yet another online account just so I can change the time on a watch. Lastly, the watch is capable of tracking calories, but it's impossible for this to be accurate when the pedometer is faulty, and my height and weight have not be inputted.I cannot recommend this watch. Fortunately, Amazon is offering a full refund."
"Watch right out of the box did not pair with my phone. Tried it for a few days, still would not sync/pair with my phone, so I returned it. Oddly enough I had received an email from the maker a few days prior to the watch arriving saying something to the effect please don’t return it back if there’s anything we can do our tech support is always there.I understand that I paid low money for this product and you get and you get based on the amount you spend. All I was looking for is a fitness tracker that does simple tasks of step counter, calorie burn, exercise options and seconds timer.Obviously it didn’t work for me right out of the box so I would not recommend, but best of luck if it works for you."
"I wish i could give this product 5 stars. Everything was great from shipping to connecting to my phone the only problem was I haven't even had it a week yet, on my way to work I look down at my wrist and my watch is gone...I'm sad sad sad"
It says there's a firmware update but you can't select it or download it.
"Not worth it. And because the box got thrown away , I can't even return it"
"This watch worked so well for me for about a month. The charge lasted several days. And then suddenly the battery would die in less than 24 hours. I would charge it to full capacity and then within minutes of taking it off the charger it would lose at least 7% battery. Now, it's been sitting on the charger for over 24 hours and it won't even power on. The 1 star is for the comfort and step tracking (which is all I bought it for). Other than that, don't waste your money. Maybe I got a dud but who knows."
"This watch tracked my sleep for one night and hasn’t tracked my sleep since then. I go on the app to check and it won’t load data for any nights except for the first night I used it. It also “tracks steps” that aren’t steps but me moving my mouse at work, doing dishes, or holding my baby. Those aren’t steps but the watch counts them as steps. Sure the battery of the watch lasts longer than my Apple Watch. But everything else about this watch is a disappointment."
"Vibration for notification stopped working, I don't know why"
"First of all I want to report that the step counter is not accurate. By end of day it was over 1,000 less than my phone counter and I didn't even have my phone on me all day.Second, the battery was down to 20 percent after a days use. The spects say a week. That's a far cry from what was expected.Third, I only get text notifications from people with iPhones. Anyone else texting me doesn't come through. Set up was difficult. Very little instructions.Very unsatisfied with this purchase."
"Pros:Attractive design.Customizable watch face.Extra band.Cons:Doesn't accurately track steps, sleep, heart rate or blood oxygen. It's basically useless and doesn't do what it claims to.If you want a cute watch this will do. If you want an accurate fitness tracker, go for something else."
"The first time I took it off to charge it, the pin holding thw buckle came out and dropped on the floor and cannot be found rendering tracker useless. I am unable to find contact info on the seller to be able to request replacement."
Fully charged it.  Started it using it and it’s already drained within 12 hours and will not turn back on. I want a refund but I threw away the packaging to return it.  Guess that’s my fault.  I really wanted to like this product.
"Unfortunately this watch didn't function properly. It detected steps while laying down, and didn't pick up my sleep not once in the few days I wore it. For the price, especially since it was marked down from original, you could get something much better. It features a lot of wallpapers but most are strange and unlikable. Liked the color and look of it, but that's not why I bought it."
Face is too small.Instructions are way too short.No way to set time without pairing to phone!!!  Not everyone is tech savvy enough to get it all done 👎
It worked well for 2 days. The sleep function just stopped working. That was one feature that was important to me in getting this fitness tracker.
This was really neat until the screen abruptly stopped working only 3 days after getting it. It's not really worth the hassle of returning it.
"really had high hopes for this, even bought the warranty.  heart rate is completely off, I have a resting rate around 68, it never read below 86.  pedometer was off as well.  I had a fitbit like this, so I know how sensitive/not sensitive they can be.  but went for 3 mile run and it was at 650 steps..."
"Not accurate. The steps are definitely off. It’s a cute watch but that’s about the only thing I like about it. I wouldn’t recommend buying it,currently in the process of returning it."
I bought this for when I workout because I have SVT and we’re trying to keep track of it. We checked it against a regular pulse oximeter and it was completely inaccurate. It also got stuck on a workout screen and wouldn’t go back to anything els. Honestly kinda just a mess. I don’t know if I just got a bad one or if it’s actually the product.
Infuriating how you can’t edit anything in the app since it’s so inaccurate!! So regret buying this watch.
My glory fit app totally crashed today. Will not open. It just drops and says to retry after bugs fixed and try to reopen app .
"I liked the watch, the App would not connect.  I sent it back. This is my second review sent to me."
"Even though it looks beautiful and fully charged, it’s not tracking steps. I walked a couple miles today, and it recorded106 steps, and within an hour dropped back to zero again. It also won’t sync to my phone. I’m very disappointed."
"Doesn't work, save your money."
I ordered this specifically for yellow gold finish as pictured. It is rose gold and so are the bands.
Steps not accurate
"Functionality was not great. The first time I charged it,  it lasted for a few days.  After charging it again, it lasted less than 24 hours."
"Sleep tracker did not work at all, and that is the main reason I bought it!"
Wore first time and not only did it not track my sleep it had a timer going and it would not clear. I could not view any of the other features. So frustrating. This is going back.
Features either don't work or work inconsistently. Device and app are in broken English.
Not easy to  set
"does not  reliably track steps, heart beat or sleep."
The app crashed twice in 30 seconds. Junk.
Do not trust what the heart rate says several occasions while I was active it said my heart rate was 52 and i put on a o2 meter and took bp during the same time as that reading and my heart rate was 86 so if your watching your heart rate as I do dont truxt this device also the bp reads higher then a cuff but about 10 points.
"Watch had a great Amazon sale price, now we know why!  When I went to set it up  my NETGEAR wifi router security gave me a warning about linking up my phone to the watches app/website (see attached picture).  Returning phone for refund, with all the data breaches out there why take the chance? (especially when apps can be so intrusive with that they have access to on your phone).  Avoid this manufacturer.  My advice to Amazon, run a new 'due diligence' on this company."
"Can't change the display face. Can't reply to texts/ messages but can see them. Can answer phone as watch has speaker.Syncing is good, app is okay."
"I literally only bought this for the heart rate monitor, unfortunately it is not even close to being accurate, like way off. Besides that it seems good, the build quality is good, the screen is good, so if you don't need the heart rate monitor then it's actually a pretty good deal"
"I bought this model to see how many steps I made a day and my sleep habits. It has been an absolute failure on all points. It never counts that. I walk over 9500 steps. Even though I have another step walker on my phone and I walk fifteen to sixteen to twenty thousand steps a day for my job, but the watch never goes past nine thousand five hundred steps. The sleep is not accurate, nor is the temperature or blood pressure. I would definitely advise ever buying this product"
"Tried about dozen times to sync my Pixel Pro with FitCloudPro and it never worked.  (Yes my bluetooth was on and working).  Sadly, without the app you can't even set the time."
"Can't find all the workouts.  Says 110, shows 8"
"I bought this speaker a year ago just to use in the shower. The battery was great the volume was great. Right about the 1 year mark the volume dropped to barely be able to hear. I don’t play anything at full volume normally and sis t with this speaker, but now at full volume I cannot hear what I’m listing to during my shower."
Picked this up for work only get 2 hours where we can play our music. So far haven’t had this speaker last more than a hour and a half
"I really like the size and sound of this speaker, only downside I have is the battery dies super fast, not sure if that's normal or just got a bad unit"
got this for my car because i don't have speakers in my car...wanted to love it but the bass was almost nonexistent and overall sound did not seem to fill up my car in a way that was pleasing. will swap for something with a little more power.this could maybe be a good speaker for you depending on what kind of music you like?for me it was a hard nope.
"I like this brand for sound and quality. They are reliable and this Bluetooth option is fine. I thought to save money as this item was on sale and my other Bluetooth portable speaker was not.  This speaker is fine, sound is good, but battery time not as good as my tri-bit. I will keep and perhaps the dust/waterproof factors will be more impctful over time."
"I have another speaker that is half the size of this, cheaper, gets much louder, and has better bass than this speaker. The brand of that speaker is EWA. I thought a jbl would've been nicer since they've been around for a long time, but it does not perform as well as the cheaper speaker I already have. I do like the loop though to hook onto my bike handle."
"The Go 3  Eco is better than the phone speakers by far., but not the best sound possible. It is good enough for us on the patio without disturbing the neighbors. We wish with the bass was better but we didn't expect it to be great."
This is a great little speaker. Super lightweight and durable. The sound is what you would expect for the size and price range (perfectly serviceable but nothing to write home about). It needs to be recharged more frequently than my other bluetooth speakers (also JBL)
"I bought this to replace an aging Oontz Angle Plus speaker that gets used for about 15-20 minutes a day.  The Oontz device would normally go for many weeks on a single charge, but after more than ten years of use it started to last for just a week or two.I bought this to replace it.  It advertises 5 hours of playtime, but under the exact same use conditions as the Oontz (15-20 minutes a day), I can get 3-4 days out of this thing if I'm lucky.So really, I'm getting less than one hour of playtime out of this thing on average.  My decade-old Oontz Angle Plus speaker still lasts 2-3 times longer than this does. That's just unacceptable."
The silicone pieces on the bottom of the speaker have already fallen off and continue to worsen. I initiated a return but had to pay to sen sit back so I disputed that with Amazon and they denied my return because I didn’t report the damage within 30 days of return it to the seller within two weeks even though I had four days left to return it. Pretty bad on Amazon’s part. I’ve never had such a problem with a damaged/defective object that I’d have to pay to return! Normally it’s so easy to pouring it to ups. Very disappointing. The speaker itself sounds very good.
I like that the speaker is small in size. It has good sound but the volume settings are not sensitive. When I get to where I like it one step up is too loud and one step down is too low. When I power on the speaker the volume is set on the loudest setting. I wish that the volume setting would stay where I set it once the power is turned off.
"The speaker works well, but the color is so far off from the photos. I would not have purchased this in this color if I knew the green would be so muted. The yellow looks odd with the grey background on the back too. I would stay away from the green- hopefully the other colors are closer to their description and photos."
"This size JBl doesn’t have the sound quality like the JBL 4 or 5. The sound is ok, but not the same sound as a larger version."
"Originally bought in approx May 2021.I admit, I bought this speaker for the brand. JBL has often been touted as among the best.The price for this little speaker was a bit steep for me at the time but I figured with the extra money I'd get better quality.And honestly? I preferred my old speaker to this. The older one just didn't connect to my new phone, which is why I purchased this one.Initially it was pretty good. I'm not a sound person. Typically comparing speakers it all sounds the same unless you're comparing bottom dollar to top of the line, of course. Still, I didn't care for the difference between the old and new speaker. I can't say one performed better than another, just that they sounded different and I preferred what I was used to. That said, I got used to the JBL and it was all fine.Until a few months later the speaker started randomly shutting off. I keep it plugged in all the time, as I use it with my phone, in bed, almost exclusively.I tried a different powercord and still ran into the same issue. In fact, the one I use with it worked just fine in my phone.I was able to overlook it for a bit, as I finally got it to behave a bit. I didn't have money for a replacement.But now I am putting an Anker speaker on my birthday wishlist because I simply cannot stand this JBL speaker anymore.It's little more than a year old. I'm sure I simply got a faulty one. But still I find that JBL isn't my top choice of speaker."
"Because of the sound quality, I upgraded to the clip4 and never looked back."
It is ok. It does not keep a charge long.
"The small size is nice, but not very much volume and battery life isn’t as long as others at the same price point."
This is perfect for in the shower or quiet spaces . This isn’t loud for a big crowd or for a lot of people to enjoy. But it is good for simple one person use. It is Bluetooth compatible. Battery life if decent . For the money it is at good value.
Honestly I love this little guy. Super cute and convenient.. solid sound and good volume. Buttt After about 6 months of use I’m realizing it doesn’t hold a charge like it used to. I use it a lot to be fair.. training clients and on bike rides/beach days… but I’m used to speakers laying me days before I need to charge. And I’ve stuck with JBL a for years. This guy fully charged only lasts a few hours now… that doesn’t work for my needs. Maybe for yours it’s cool… I’m definitely disappointed though.
"my husband loved this and used it while outside or just hanging out in the house - but after 13 months of use, the on / off button just quit working.  Overall not a bad product except for the on / off button  - Trying to find out if there is a warranty and now I am concerned with the JBL Flip 5 that I purchased for myselfin Feb - wondering if i should return it before the button stops working on mine,"
"After having it for a year and not even using it daily it doesn’t charge anymore. If this is something you’re looking for to keep long term, don’t buy this speaker. I’ve always like JBL but both my boyfriend and I have this same speaker and they don’t charge anymore."
This speaker does not work for calls. But besides that it is pretty great. The quality of the sound is decent. It charges very fast. And if you just want to use it for music I would say that it is well worth it. But since I solely wanted it for calling on the phone I returned it.
It's more of a light grey than white.
"Battery life is garbage. It says 5 hours, I get about 2.5. Not impressed."
"Sound is decent, about what you'd expect from a speaker this small. Battery life is so-so. When I ordered this speaker I didn't realize it was lacking the features mentioned in the title. As I review the product listing I realize it does indeed never mention multipoint as a feature. I mistakenly didn't specifically look for it as a listed feature because I didn't realize a reputable company would still be making any speakers without multipoint. Also missing is the back button when triple tapping the play/pause button. I also thought this was more or less standard in today's day and age but I guess not. Overall it meets my needs for an ultra portable speaker but I reckon as soon as Bose releases a micro with USB C charging I'll be upgrading."
I have agonized over if I should get the 3the 4 is it worth the $.  What color do I like for months now!  I finally settled on this little multi color gray unit.  I was so excited for it to arrive same day!! Until I opened the package and the speaker was black.  There's nothing wrong with black. I just loved all of the colors the other one provided. This all black unit is sort of dull to me.  But after waiting so long on my own decisions I dont want to send it back and wait longer.  So I'm stuck w the one I've got. Maybe I'll paint it neon yellow on the little rubber parts
"Let me just say that this item is well made. The sound quality is very good, compared to my phone or iPad. Anything is an improvement! I have only had this a week and was so excited to get it, but after using it over that time period, the battery life has been really bad. It does not lasts the five hours that it claims! It feels as though I am constantly having to charge! So if you take this out, you better have a way to charge it repeatedly! Otherwise, I like this speaker, but will not purchase another JBL. I will buy another brand of portable speaker, unfortunately."
"We put a man on the frickin moon 50+ years ago. Why doesn't this thing have a play back or skip button?!? So dumb. Battery lasts a 5 hour kayak trip, but that's about it. I bring a backup speaker just in case it dies. It's a JBL ... it should be way better quality than this."
"Decent sound, but the battery life isn’t 5 hours. I usually take 20 minute showers and by the third shower, the red battery light is flash. Which means it lasts 4x less than it should. I’ll put the extra money out next time and buy the good brand that starts with a B. The advertisement of 5 hours is deceitful. It should be 5 hours, on full volume, no exceptions. The sound is similar to that of an Alexa. No better, no worse."
"I mostly want to use this to listen to podcasts around the house, often when I'm in the shower. This speaker is designed to give booming bass, which might be fine for pop music, but it doesn't make for a very good voice speaker. Unfortunately the speaker itself doesn't give any way to adjust this.I had a Go 2 previously, which was much better for voice, much less boomy. I would recommend that over the Go 3 for spoken word."
"It was only $30 when I bought it, so I think I expected too much from it for the price. I HATE listening to music directly from my phone because it sounds like it's overusing the speaker...but this doesn't sound that much better to me. It does get a little louder than my phone, but when you turn it all the way up, it still sounds like it's struggling."
"I love JBL products and the way they sound, but this speaker only lasts about 2 hrs. Background noise is too much for the caller on the other end."
"Good price and built well. Disappointed with the sound quality. Very wonky bass response, strange EQ curve, and audible vibrations. Can't really complain at this price point though."
Great product but the battery life is closer to 2-3 hours not quite as advertised ( I bought two so I'm guessing it's not the fluke)
sounds great but that must be because it used too much power. Lasts about 80 minutes with a full charge. I would not buy again.
The charge does not last more than 2 hours every time I use it.
Very short battery life. Sounds pretty good for a compact speaker
"We are a JBL household and honestly I think we have pretty much all of the JBL speakers, except the really large party ones. So when I saw that they came out with this one I needed to sdd it to my collection, though I didn't necessarily need it. I don't like the way it sounds, and it's too quiet. It muddies the music and if you listen to lectures, or podcast it has too much bass and then the volume just doesn't get very loud. To compare it to the clip, it's like 1/2 as loud. So because of how much base is in the output of the speaker and how weak the speaker is if there's any background noise like a shower or Street noise it makes it really hard to hear any words to any of the music or really any of the high frequencies. I would recommend the JBL clip over this any day."
"Nice sound, definite improvement over my old, little one (not JBL). I set on the mantle in my living room and it fills the house with decent sound. And yes, if not secured, it will vibrate off of things at medium to high levels. I like the auto off when there isn't music playing. I have run down so many charges listening to nothing, that feature extends it some. The ""rope"" hanger seems durable, wish it was rotated 90 degrees, or a spring clip on the back to clip into a pocket or on the belt line. I use a small biner to clip it to my belt loop. and it wants to rotate, and bounces quite a bit when walking. As for the waterproof rating, not sure, haven't got it wet. I can say for a fact, it is NOT dust/dirt proof. Anything that doesn't have a cover for the charging port, CAN NOT be dust/dirt proof. I also wonder how much dust/dirt is getting into the speaker area. Unfortunately they did not provide a way to clean debris from key areas. I have had this for a short time and already have got dirt into the charging port. Difficult, at best, to clean out. And now it is getting increasingly difficult to plug it in to charge. We'll see how this plays out. I guess for the price point, something as simple as a cover for the charging port would have been a ""no-brainer"" for the JBL engineers. Oops.Update 7/29/21 ; I have changed my overall rating from 3 stars to 1 (only because I can't leave zero stars). After (less than) 2 months of use, there is now something inside the unit that has rattled/broke loose, and now at mid to higher volume there is a rattle coming from the speaker. Very annoying, and extremely disappointing. There was a time, years ago, that Harmon Kardon and JBL were known for high quality audio components that could be trusted. This is obviously not the case any more, unfortunately. Of course it is now past the limited return time, so I am now stuck with a $70 piece of junk that sounds worse (now) after less than 2 months, than my old $10 speaker sounds after over 5 years of use, and that this was to replace. Well, out with the new, (back) in with the old. ""First time, shame on me,..."""
"I really liked this speaker when I got it. I even ordered a few more for both my brother in law and sister in law. It's great for being small and portable.Somehow all the diagonal gummy plastic pieces came off..It doesn't look like it is responsible for anything. Cosmetically, it just looks kind of silly. You can still see some of the glue residue. I don't think it's impacting the sound, or at least I hope not."
"Not as good as the other JBL products I’ve used. Used them for years. But not the charging port is rusted out. How can a waterproof speaker not be designed to not rust, especially only after a few months?"
"It's ok but I wish bass level was adjustable. It rattles around so much from too much bass & even distorts at some points. If this could be adjusted down, the battery life would likely be better."
The battery last no longer than 1hr. The sound also isn't that loud
I didn't know about this speaker until i had them in my old car (2021 toyota mirai)People would get excited and rave about them.  I will admit the sound in car was pretty good. Decided to give these speakers a try partly for those reasons and the good review of 4.8 stars. The sound quality is good not great i would give that a 4/5. But the battery life just ruins it. Have to charge it every day if you use it for a few hours (like 4 or 5 hours) out of all of the bluetooth speakers I've owned this is hands down the worst battery life of all of them even the ones i had years ago. I remember the little amazon speaker i bought like 8 years ago for like 9.99 (before panademic inflation prices) that had better sound quality and the battery would last almost all day. How is this brand that so many people rave about so trash i thought technology and quality of products is supposed to be going up not down. Do yourself a favor don't waste your money on these.Update: july 7th changing rating from 2 stars to 1 star. If i put the volume up about  4 notches from max it starts to rumble and sound like empty cans banging together. None of the speakers from other brands did this. Haven't even had these speakers a year!! what a huge disappointment from all angles.
"We have the JBL Charge 4, so I was expecting sound quality similar to that speaker. I know this one is much smaller, but was still expecting better quality than I hear, especially after reading favorable reviews. I bought this during Prime Days, so it was 50% off making it $24, so for that price, I’m fine with it. It’ll be really nice to grab and take outside since it’s so compact. I’ll just be sure to stick with larger speakers in the future to ensure better sound."
I didn’t find this very loud at all. Very disappointed.
Volume decreased after 1 month
"I’m impressed by the clear full sound that this speaker produces. The small size is nice for taking it along. And, the loop on the side is a nice addition for hanging it on something. Here’s something to consider though…for the price, it’s odd that this Bluetooth speaker does not communicate battery level with connected devices. This alone had me second thinking my purchase. I have an Anker Bluetooth speaker that’s over 5 yrs old that communicates battery level. JBL must be using cheap or dated hardware. Another thing…the battery recharge time was pretty slow for a max battery life of 5 hours. I don’t know, maybe JBL and Anker could get together make a epic speaker with great sound, strong battery function, all wrapped in the mainstream tech. Just sayin…"
"It can't be beat for size. Battery seems fine, haven't really tested it out. I was hoping this would be very very loud, enough for outdoors. But it's barely ""loud"" by indoor standards in my opinion. It's loud for sure, but... I guess I was hoping for more. It was recommended somewhere as being the loudest compact BT speaker there was. Maybe there's just limits to size.So the fact that it's portable is sort of un-useful since you wouldn't be using it in a situation where that portability would be useful since it's really only ""loud"" indoors. And if you just want regular mild listening level, you can probably find cheaper speakers than this to do that."
"The sound doesn't compete with the Bose Micro. It just isn't that good. USB-C is a nice upgrade, but it isn't a great speaker."
battery lasted only 2 hours after a full charge each time . sending back for a replacement. sound was excellent.
"Easy connectivity, good sound, adequate battery life, and withstood steam-room humidity, but power button failed after 8 months.  I’ve begun a replacement claim process under the one year warranty."
"Not as loud as anticipated, I love my music loud, so..."
It's a got reasonable sound and won't get annoying for coworkers in shop atmosphere and quick Bluetooth connect. Battery life sucks is my personal opinion.
"The speaker is great. However, it does not connect with the charger. The speaker has a USB-C port and came with a cord to a regular USB plug. The charger has only a USB-C port and plugs into the electrical socket. I guess I need to buy a separate cord that is USB-C on both ends. Buyer beware."
"Not sure why this product cannot be assigned to multiple Apple devices.  This is what happened:  When I received this product, first, I connected it to my iPhone 15 pro and it went well.  However, after I disconnected it out of my iPhone 15 pro (and choose the 'forget this device' on my iPhone) and then tried to connected to my iPad Pro (2nd Generation), it was unable to connect at all.  I tried numerus times and it was never worked."
"I owned a JBL portable speaker previously and had no issues with it. This one is so disappointing with the battery life; it does not hold a charge very long. I have other rechargeable speakers, and they hold a charge for weeks and can play for more than 10 hours. This JBL does not hold a charge more than a few days at best, and then only has about 4-5 hours of playing time. The sound quality is just ok, a little tingy. I really should have sent It back for refund."
"Super portable. Big sound for a little guy. Too bad the labeling is falling off. There is rubber JBL labels and rubber feet that come off. I use it in the bathroom as I shower. Must be the steam? Maybe that's it. But, it's suppose to be waterproof?"
This speaker is amazing. It packs a punch especially for its size but there is a major flaw. You cannot connect 2 speakers together. most speakers now have TWS or a way to pair together via app or whatever but these do not. Returning both :(
"It blew up after only a few months. I think water got in the USB-C port, and then it got plugged in to charge. It melted the connector and nearly caught on fire. Waterproof? Absolutely not. What's really dumb is the rope hook you hang it by is next to the USB port, so of course water will drip down in it. Terrible design. At the very least it should have a rubber gasket to protect the USB-C port. Now it won't charge and it's a useless brick. Sounded good while it lasted!"
"For a personal speaker, this thing is amazing.  I've taken this down the river a few times kayaking,  lots of water on it.  Still working just fine.  Would not recommend submerging this speaker but ours had been wet a lot and still is working fine."
I lifeguard as a part time job and the speaker won’t last a whole shift. The battery like is about less than 3 hours
Such a bummer these are almost all loose or have fallen off.  They look like they used very thin glue to put these on.Sound quality is outstanding with really strong clear bass.  JBL has continued improve on the small speaker output!!it’s very surprising that this is having outside issues when the inside is so great.I would prefer a clip to this loop or it would be nice to add a clip or caribiner.
"My Wife Enjoyed using this in the shower. When it needed recharging, she plugged it into the charging cord and let it charge overnight. The next morning there was a strong “electrical odor” and after checking, the source of the smell was the JBL speaker overheated and melted the charging port and the charging cord. The entire speaker was very hot. Amazon replaced the speaker. We won’t leave it charging unless we can observe it or check on it and disconnect it from the charger."
"I've owned this for about 3 months now and finally thought I could leave a good review. Sound quality is fantastic however the battery life is absolutely terrible.I bought this because I like to listen to music while I'm at work and I'm not allowed to wear headphones for safety. I find myself charging this if not every day, every other day. I don't have access to outlets most of the time during my morning routine at work, so it's pretty frustrating when it dies on me after an hour or two. It also doesn't tell you when the battery is low, it just shuts off. The bass is also pretty intense and it will fall off of tables from the bouncing, which cracked mine at one point.I would recommend it if you have the ability to keep it plugged in all the time but if you use it on the go like I do, I would not recommend it."
"The sound is just ok, but nothing to really brag about.  I wanted to love it, but I only like it. The price is decent, but I’ve had better sound from cheaper. I’m not sure what everyone thinks is so great about it. I bought it because of the reviews and I’ll review it again if it seems better. It’s a nice little size, it’s good looking and seems well made and  super sturdy, so that’s the good part. There isn’t a “bad” part, just nothing impressive. Wish I could rave about it."
good portable speaker but was crackling when turned up loud
"Maybe a bit pricey, but good overall unless you're using it in the shower. The humidity made the glue weaken and pieces started falling off, and it became discolored as well. It still functions the same, but I'd expect more from a waterproof product of this price."
Volume is good and the sound is OK.
battery life is only an hour and a half fully charged
"This was bought as a gift for my Grandson's birthday.  The first time he used it the power cord that comes with the speaker melted where it inserts into the speaker itself.  A cube was not included with this product and it was plugged into an Apple cube which he already had.  It seems to have shorted out and sparked and melted where it inserts into the speaker.  It actually melted into the unit.  I see no reason why this should have happened.  This cube is used for other devices with no issue so I know it's not the cube itself, and it's still in working order.  Given the fact that a cube is not included when you purchase the product, and there was no information stating that it had to be a certain kind of cube to connect the power source so I would think I should be refunded. I feel like there was something faulty in the power cord itself that made it short out....Luckily no one was hurt.  I have, however, previously purchased this same product for another grandson who has had no problem using an Apple cube to maintain the power source.  I would love to get response back from the company on this please!!!"
"I’m a long time customer of JBL. I love how you can Bluetooth to multiple speakers to surround yourself and friends with quality sound. However this speaker would only do well in that setting and only as a tweeter. I could see if you just wanna go for a long hike and need to keep your weight down but still have music.. but this lil guy is not good for much else. No bass, tingy sound, not worth the $$ or the wait (shipping to Hawai’i)"
"Worked great for 4 months then it nearly caught on fire while charging. Cannot be sure if it was speaker or faulty cable, but the charging cable became physically fused with the charging port it was so hot and melting. Had to throw it away."
"The sound is great when it paired. But it won't work with my LG laptop, (that has no volume control for it's speakers). But I'm sure it's something with this laptop. My other computers it works great with. The sound quality is fantastic when it does pair though, IMO... Love that it is so portable also..."
The increase in volume is a SUPER ANNOYING trend that Apple started. If you press up on the volume button it increases By WAY TOO MUCH. See how that works? It’s a fantastic device that utilizes  negative bass space energy to deliver a well balanced and musical tonality that is worth of any audiophile/hi-fi nerd as well as the most obscene of portable DJ’s (their poor parents). It’s no wonder JBL keeps winning What HI-FI award after award for their portable Bluetooth speakers. I own the small Bose thing as well and I prefer this one better. THE ENTIRE REASON I took away THREE WHOLE STARS is because the volume increase/decrease is ABSOLUTELY ANNOYING and I’m tired of big box companies telling me how loud I want MY MUSIC.Updates to come cause this is so annoying it’s either way too loud or way too soft.
Purchased this product to replace an older speaker. Unfortunately I was disappointed with the overall sound and battery life. Was hoping for more advanced technology. Sound was ok and battery only lasted about 2 hours on full volume.
"Great sound, but the battery wasn’t even close to “5 hours.”  More like 2 hours."
"The sound is great. The price is right. The size is perfect for travel. The shirt battery life sucks. But if you need a speaker that fits my requirements, this is your speaker."
"I liked that it had big sound but my excitement stopped when it suddenly stopped working after only 7 or 8 months, bummer! :("
"PROS:(a) It's light and stylish looking(b) It's loud(c) Using it is really simpleCONS:(a) Waaaay too much bass. I bought it to listen to music while I'm in the shower and I can barely understand the lyrics or what people are saying in podcasts because the lows are so overpowering. Because of this, I can't recommend buying it."
"After about 8 months, the charging port was rusted, the sound muffled, and buttons were falling off. Not durable."
Sound quality is ok but I learned there is no way to turn off the startup/showdown sound. Ridiculous. The app doesn’t support GO 3. I was thinking to use this for calm music in the early morning while my family members still sleep but I can’t use it because of the annoying sound. Returning unfortunately.
I got this speaker when it was on sale for $29.  I was loving this speaker for the first few weeks.... and then the battery started dying very quickly. I've only had it for 8 weeks and the battery only lasts about 90 minutes at most. Unfortunately it's too late to return for a new unit.
"Lots of bass from this little speaker. It sounds good. My big complaint is the battery life. It's still new and only used a handful of times, but I only get about 2 hours out of it before it shuts itself off and needs to be plugged back in to charge."
"Very compact and portable which is very convenient but sometimes the sound will start to break, usually when the battery life is dying but also sometimes when it's freshly changed. Battery life not as long as it claims to be I will use it for about 2 hours and notice that the sound starts to break indicating that the battery is running out. Died on me once after about 2 hours."
Not as loud for a JBL and battery life about 4 hours
The speakers volume buttons just adjust the volume of whatever device it connected to it via blue tooth so the max volume the speaker can go is whatever the max volume of the device is. This was a bit upsetting to learn. Most speakers I’ve used in the past have there own volume and then you can also increase the volume on your phone to further increase the loudness. This speaker doesn’t seem to have that capability.
The sound quality is just not there. I’m typically happy with JBL. Not this time
"Unfortunately I did not start using this until well after 30 days.  The unit I received will not hold a charge at all, not even for 2 minutes. The only way it plays is when it is plugged into the charger, which defeats the purpose of a portable speaker."
Great sound but the battery last about 4 hours. I work at a coffee bar and I just keep it plugged in all the time. If you have it stationary and plugged in it’s all good. Would not recommend to take it out to the lake or grilling since you won’t get much use of it.
"This speaker didn’t work right when I got it and I tried to contact the company and JBL about a return or replacement or refund. I charged it fully when it arrived, It played one song and then never played again.  It turns on and connects to my phone and plays no audio. It arrived later then expected and then I couldn’t send it back in time for the return window because I work a full time job and only had a few weeks to get it back to them after failed troubleshooting of the device. I have had this broken speaker and no resolution or product replacement."
"Got this to use at the pool and boat, from the first use the battery only works about an hour and its dead."
"I received my speaker 3 months ago and have been very happy, until I put it on the charger and ran a quick errand today, only to come back to a burning smell and saw that the charging connection was smoking.  I use only the cord that came with the radio and I was gone for maybe 15 mins.  I have a dog and I'm so grateful that it didn't have the chance to start a fire!  Please be careful and never charge your speaker if you can't be there to watch over it."
The base is overpowering
"Keep disconnecting. Returned, got new one, still the same. I try to live with it. Less than 2 weeks that I own, this thing can't keep battery. If I don't leave the speaker charging the entire time, it will turn off within a matter of minutes even though it was charged for hours prior. How could you sell this junk for 50 bucks???????"
"As advertised as a portable speaker, Its not very portable. It doesn't fit in my pockets and even if I put it in a pocket the sound gets muffled and I can barely hear it. It doesn't have a clip or anyway to carry it besides putting it in your pocket or holding it in your hand. I guess if your just using it at home its not bad. But as for going outside I would feel silly walking around with this thing in my hand but then again I'm not the type of person to let other people hear my music because I find it inconsiderate. Ill stick to headphones. These speaker companies just can't get it right"
"The speaker has serious issues connecting to devices. Can't get it to connect to anything other than my phone now. A week ago, after 2 hard resets, it connected to my husbands phone, but now it will not. So very annoying. do not recommend buying this speaker."
"I don't see the point advertising 15 emulators when most of them only have under 20 games. The ones with thousands have multiple duplicates of the same game with a different name and when its the same name its different countries like USA version, Europe version, Japanese version etc. many of the games are not named correctly and hard to find for sega. My biggest complaint is the lack of games for a variety of the emulators and the inability to add games yourself.The controllers worked, the setup to the TV was super easy and it worked well. Save state worked fine and saving to your favorites as well. But for the price and lack of content for something that is supposed to have 15 emulators I would steer clear."
"I purchased this product with modest expectations given the price, so I can't say my findings are terribly surprising, but my opinion is that if you're a remotely serious gamer don't bother with this product.There were a few positives so I'll start with those, setting up the device and pairing the controllers was simple, and the controllers were of decent enough quality (a bit clacky but fine enough).The game selection was also decent, though games were often given incorrect titles which made finding them a bit tricky in some cases. For example, a Pink Panther game showing up as ""Pink naughty leopard"", which made me laugh my butt off.That said, there are some legitimately decent games on here, but unfortunately the quality of emulation was so poor that it wasn't possible to enjoy playing many of them.  This device may work ok for you if all you want to do is play old RPGs, or something that doesn't require quick reactions. I tried each emulator and the only one that functioned reasonably well was the GBA emulator.  The other emulators featured lagging and stuttering frames and controller input also suffered from a notable latency.  It was also impossible to correct aspect ratio for anything not natively 16:9, the device has an option to change the aspect ratio to 4:3 for the older games but the black bars on the side of the game show a glitched out constantly flashing version of the user interface which is highly distracting. Playing with the graphics stretched to full screen was preferable."
"First of all, I don't appreciate the fact that when I come to check my purchase it says that it was handed directly to a resident and was signed for, when instead it was left downstairs in front of my garage (out of sight of my camera), for anyone to steal because my front door is upstairs. No one was even home at the time. I would love to see ""my signature"". Are you guys forging now?!Secondly, when attempting to purchase, it gave me the purchase protection option, and I chose the 3-year. However, when I proceed to check out, it's not there. Tried 5 times more to add it, same thing every time.Last, but definitely not least, it doesn't work at all. Tried on every TV in the house. This was an awful experience."
Arcade games lag and are not playable. Console games are hit and miss. Some don’t have sound. Faster movement games are a problem and don’t play good due to constant controller lag. Games are not named right and not organized good so hard to find them as well. Gave 2 stars as there were some playable games.
"There ARE a lot of games. There are not clear instructions.  Mainly, though, there is a lag in the controller which is deadly in these games."
"Had a hard time navigating the system. And the fact that the instructions were in Chinese, made the situation worst."
Cons: same games on there multiple timesSome games freeze up.. the screen is too large and you can’t adjust it
"Did not know that you could get a high amount of lag being off the internet.PS games, not worthy, mostly asian games."
"Most of these games are not American games. They are Japan and UK. Also pixelated to an extreme almost hard to make out,  buttons need to be programmed in every game. This is a huge waste not worth $10"
"It shows all these games, some of them you play and you cannot physically play them, like Tecmo Bowl for example.  The controllers will lose sync often and not even path properly, I will be returning, it is not great at all."
"We got it hooked up to TV and that part worked, but there are  no instructions on how to hook up so it took us a while to figure it out.There are no instructions on how to pair the handhelds.  They do not pair to the device so you cannot operate the games.I am returning."
"Didn't work at all after it said loading, controls Didn't have any effect on the screen, tried on two different TV nothing happened at all. Give it no stars.had to give one star to continue."
Both remote controllers when powered on do not connect. There is a red and green light that flashes as though it wants to pair to a device but there are no instructions that indicate how to do so.
The box was completely smashed upon delivery. Hopefully the item still works.
Trying to return it but Amazon keeps saying check back later
Can't get controllers to connect to system
Complete crap. The controllers connect but do not respond.
Everything was going great but once you select a game you’re stuck playing that game and the only way to select another game is to turn the console off and on again.
"The graphics are not as advertised, and most games don't run smoothly. The controllers also stop working intermittently."
"Games take forever to load, which completely kills the fun. Way too slow."
This is definitely not worth the money. The gameplay isn’t great and the quality is lacking.
"For the price, this console offers terrible performance. Very underwhelming."
The console frequently freezes and forces me to reset it. Very frustrating!
"I've gotten one of these before and it has the exact same packaging but this one has a lag the graphics are not properly converted on some games and it's missing a lot of games some of the systems they even offer to have like one or two games and they don't work do your research before you purchase, I just needed this one quick and it came in one day."
The controllers operate with a delay making games impossible to play. Game list is hard to navigate. 4-5 versions of the same game so not as many games as you would think.
"The wireless connection is unreliable, and the console keeps disconnecting."
"We bought this TV to replace a 10 year old Samsung that was a great TV. This model not so much, it is beyond disappointing. The picture is just average, the sound is below average and the tiny solar powered remote is horrible. This TV will absolutely not turn off, you have to pair the remote before you try to turn it off each time and it normally takes 3 tries to get it to turn off. The instructions state you can turn it off at the bottom right side of the TV screen. Well, that doesn’t work either as the TV turns off then right back on as it does with the remote. We are planning on sending it back!Update:  Unfortunately the Service Quick technicians, who were great guys, did not fix our TV (that would not turn off without unplugging it) on August 2, 2024. After they left our house that day TV still would not turn off with the remote or at the TV. A Samsung supervisor (Janie) called me on August 8, 2024, and told me the Service Quick Technicians would be at our house on 8/12/24 for yet another service call. During the conversation Janie said she believed we needed to remove the ROKU box from the TV to get it to turn off. She was correct! As a result, I called Samsung on August 9, 2024, to cancel the service appointment and was asked if I needed anything else. I said ""yes can you help me with the ROKU Box Problem"". I was then transferred to Technical Support and THANKFULLY spoke to Scarlette, who asked permission to take control of our TV remotely. 10 minutes later, thanks to Scarlette’s efforts, the TV would turn off with the ROKU Box still in use! Thank you Janie and Scarlette!I also need to add that in addition to fixing the ROKU problem Scarlina adjusted the picture settings on our new TV and the picture is now fantastic.**LESSONS LEARNED: Amazon was of no help in this entire two week process, stating we bought The Samsung QN65Q60D 65” TV from a third party vendor and the best Amazon could do for us was to file a claim for us. (We have the Amazon ad for this TV and it states our TV was bought and delivered from the Amazon Store). ** No more major purchases from Amazon.As part of the Amazon purchase for this new TV we bought the 3 year warranty from Asurion. They were no help and specialized in apologizing for all the stress and inconvenience we suffered with this TV not turning off. Asurion finally stated that their warranty was not valid because our TV was defective from the factory, before we took delivery. ** No more warranty purchases from this company."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I bought this Samsung 50-Inch QLED 4K Q60D TV during Black Friday, mainly to add a TV to my study. I chose this model because its hardware specifications seemed superior to my Samsung Crystal UHD DU8000 in the bedroom.After setting it up and using it for some time, I found that the picture quality and sound performance were nearly identical to the DU8000. While the QLED panel promises better brightness and color vibrancy, the improvement wasn’t as noticeable as expected in regular usage. Similarly, the sound performance, despite the advertised Object Tracking Sound Lite feature, did not stand out compared to the DU8000.Although the performance was not a dramatic upgrade, I still find the Q60D a good product. The slim design and sleek aesthetics make it a nice addition to any room, and the integration of Alexa and the Gaming Hub is convenient, though these features are not game-changers for everyone. That said, considering the higher price, I feel the DU8000 would have been sufficient for my needs.In summary, the Q60D is a well-made and visually appealing TV, but if you already own a DU8000 or a similar UHD model, you might not see much improvement. For new buyers looking for a reliable QLED option, however, this is a solid choice—just be aware of the price."
"I love the picture and the game mode. However, about every 30-45 minutes it goes to a connected devices screen and shows me a list of connected devices.  I have to reselect my game console and it switches back to the game.This is more than annoying when playing online, real-time gamesI have looked at others that complain about this on the Samsung site and the basic is answer is that it is by design!  There are ways that supposedly work to turn this off, but the only one that really works is to turn off the automatic detection (CECC) and then turn EVERYTHING (console, soundbar, tv) on/off manuallyIf you bought it to watch shows, then I'm sure this would be okay, but as a game tv (which it is advertised as), this ""feature"" makes it difficult to play immersively."
"The picture on this TV is great, but I wouldn't spend the money again. Bought it for my senior father, and the remote is tiny and many of the buttons have multiple uses. I had to buy multiple universal remotes to meet the needs of a regular remote control. For what Samsung charges, that shouldn't have happened."
"I would have given this product 5 stars. However, it only took me 1 minute after turning it on to notice a dead pixel on the center of the screen. Frustrating because it is small but I see it non-stop. Every scene, every black screen, every transition or title page, it is there staring me in the face. Everything else was good, shipping speed and picture quality all seem good, just the dead pixel ruining all my joy. Kinda small but REALLY annoying."
"I have continuing problems with the Prime App.  It frequently fails to load on this TV.  Otherwise, the TV is OK, but not much better than my cheap 5-year old Vizio."
Maybe it's because I have the Roku box hooked up to the TV but I'm getting some lag and blurred images that I do not get on my 9-year-old Samsung TV with 240Hz
"No issues with the tv but the remote is so small it constantly is lost in the cushion. The buttons are difficult to read (again so small) and it was hard to figure out how to work it. The remote is cheap and for the price of the tv, they could have done much better."
"Having a lot of issues with the sound, it gets louder with gunfire  or any kind of sounds,  get louder automatically,,we cannot control it, constantly using the volume button."
We can not get our Samsung remote to sync up to our Direct TV remote - and the volume button on the Samsung is the only one that is causing us to have to utilize 2 remote controls.  Pain in the a**!  Get a more user friendly TV.
"Fantastic TV for the price. Great color and fairly good contrast on scenes with lots of dark and light mixed. On totally dark scenes the blacks are slightly grey but it's still LED LCD technology so that's to be expected. However, it's much better than cheaper competitors. My one BIGGEST complaint about the TV is the absolutely TERRIBLE user interface. If there was an award for an awkward, non-user-intuitive interface, Samsung would take first place. There's no reason changing inputs should take 4-5 button clicks and menu navigation. Seriously, our last Samsung TV literally had an ""input"" button the remote that scrolled through inputs. This remote has a directional arrow pad and 5-6 other buttons, that's it. Most of the buttons are useless. Why does the remote need dedicated ""Netflix, Amazon Prime, Samsung TV and Disney+ buttons""? I'd much rather have useful buttons like ""input"" for example. It's really a terrible design. TV is solid otherwise but jeez, Samsung, get your act together. This is the dumbest smart TV I've ever owned."
"Product arrived with damage, although shipping box is intact"
"I've gotten Samsung tvs and phones for awhile now to save time doing research when I upgrade because I always over-think things. I finally decided to upgrade from my old Samsung TV to a 4K version and figured I'd be happy with it. Sadly, no.My new TV keeps turning on my PS5 despite me having turned that option off on both the TV and the PS5. It will also keep turning on the PS5 if I linger on the HDMI input screen too long. It also also (not a typo) will automatically turn on other things I've disabled, like messages that my remote might be backwards (it's wrong 70% of the time) and ""Game Mode"", which causes some significant picture flickering. It will be fine for a day or so, then it will flip options back on. I even turned off the screen saver option just before writing this review and it turned it back on moments ago.The attempt at being user friendly by trying to anticipate what you want is like a beloved cat or dog constantly getting under foot, except the TV is not fuzzy and adorable.Oh, and you can see the refresh lines sometimes in the upper left half of the TV. Not sure why it's just the left half, it doesn't seem to be connected to viewing angle. I'm also not sure why it's not all of the time. It's also not just me, a friend could also see the refresh lines.I absolutely do not recommend this tv."
"I have another Samsung TV. They make you establish an account with them to set up your TV.I logged tried to log into my account. I had the right username (email) and password, but they require two step authentication which goes to my old phone number. To change your phone number takes two weeks AND when I tried to do it it said my new phone number wasn't valid. The only other option wasto provide some 9 digit baclkup code they supposedly gave me  when I registered my first tv years ago.Of course, all of this took over an hour I finally set up a dummy email acount. Again , all this takes time - my time.I did go online and got a live person on Samsung chat. More of a waste of time. I had to repeat my problem several times and they couldn't really do anything except tell me that this was for ""your security""  BSI don't know why Samsung thingks this ridiculous level of security is necessary to set up a tv. I manage my work account and bank accounts, both of which contain far more sensitive information than my TV registration. Neither take two weeks to change your account phone number.I have better things to do with my time than deal with Samsung arrogance and incompetence.All"
Picture not as good as our old curved tv
"This TV will recognize my PC, however it does not show any content from my PC. I’ve successfully connected my PC to a Sony TV as well as many monitors.What causes further issues is the lack of a proper manual that tells you about the connecting the TV. It’s very difficult to see what connections are on the back of the TV because they don’t mark them with white paint."
I think the cost of delivery is built into the cost of the tv because it’s a really crappy image. Sound quality not great. If you’re going to spend a large chunk I recommend going up a level for a better picture. I also don’t like the way Samsung makes you create an account in order to setup your tv. I’m guessing other brands are doing the same but I don’t like it.
"Nothing special. Quality is average at best, colors are okay."
"Watching the Paramount+ app is almost impossible. Cannot re-watch shows. Plus shows suddenly buffer and then shut down making it necessary to reboot the app. The remote is weird. You need to charge it instead of just replacing batteries. The volume control is buggy. If the picture wasn't so great, I would return this. But I don't want to go through the hassle. Samsung I am very disappointed 😔"
Rating low due to it arriving with damage. Looks like it is still functional but I have concerns that it will not last considering the damage to the top of it. Pretty disappointed.
"Love my other qled so just purchased this newer model for another room. tv has some led bleed, and has major shading issues"
The wifi connection power very poor if you connect with cable will solve the issue
"If I had my time over, I would not have bought this model.  I have owned Samsung TVs and this one was disappointing in picture quality."
I would not recommend this television. Most Tv setups could not be easier.  Not the case here.  Samsung tries to make you download their apps  to use the Tv.  Apps which dont work by the way.  They send codes by email then tell you email isnt valid??? Turn the tv off and it turns itself back on.  I have to unplug my Roku to get Tv to stay off.  Last Samsung purchase for us.
"Everything was okay on day 1, and on day 2 the tv have a darker screen on the right side. There's is reason why I was leary on getting a samsung tv in the first place. They're garbage."
"The sound quality is very poor and the color seems to have a mind of its own (going blue or pink all by itself). Perhaps the poor sound quality seeks to encourage one to purchase a sound bar (interesting marketing strategy, since Samsung also sells those)."
I like the picture as usual with Samsung.  However the remote is a joke and the setup was horrible.  What are they thinking!!
The Home Screen hub is such a mess I am considering putting the tv in its box and returning it. There is no way to remove all the junk. You can only move your downloaded apps left to right. Samsung suggested content takes up 95% of the screen.
Bought the best 32” 4k tv I could find. This is not a good substitute for an actual monitor. I will stick with Dell monitors from now on.
Television came defective PC Richards is an absolute nightmare to deal with as I BOUGHT this through amazon . You can not call pc Richards it all has to be done through the amazon portal. It is back and forth and back and forth with pc ricahrdss and nothing gets resolved . Now they are telling me the box for an 85 inch television should have been saved and they wont take it back. The box for an 85 inch television is huge were the heck would I save that size of a box . I paid there delivery guy $50.00 to take the box Thankfully I bought it on my credit card and will stop the credit card charge
"Very disappointed in the quality of the Samsung picture. I returned it and ordered a Sony Bravia 3 instead. The TVs were essentially the same price, but the picture on the Sony is outstanding!"
"I bought it and sent it back. There are many reviews by pro TV enthusiast who will tell you this tv pumps up the image and some pictures are clear and overly bright. But it's not at all natural looking. Bright exaggerated neon colors with deep blacks that are way too dark, a horrible combination. All text has a greenish tint. One picture setting is worse than the other. It's either too dark or too bright. You have to change the settings for each different thing you watch or its even worse. The blacks have no contrast at all, it looks like everyone has bad dyed black hair. Don't make the mistake and purchase this crappy tv. A cheap OLED screen is something that should not exist. My 10-year-old Samsung was better than this new model. I find it very hard to believe this model gets so many five star reviews. I guess many viewers have no clue what a good image should look like"
"The product was damaged.  Beyond the return time when we finally unboxed the tv.  The warranty program didn’t cover the damage. Manufacturer did t cover the damage because once Amazon sells it, it’s not Samsungs problem.  $900 mistake I won’t make again"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            When I bought this TV, it was listed as “used but in good condition.” However, when I received it, it was in very poor condition. I didn’t expect it to be like new, but the corner of the TV is bent, which is unacceptable. Very disappointing."
One of the worst TVs to set up gives you 25 minutes to put in a password that Samsung sends you but they take 30 to 45 minutes to send you the password
Every time I turn my tv on I have to reset my WiFi network in the setting to access internet selection. Also the clutter on the Home Screen takes up so much room limiting easy apps that I want to use
"Although the TV doesn't show any apparent damage, the box was missing the power cord, remote control and instructions. Havent been able to use it."
"This product does not allow you to sign into your respective streaming service accounts. It requires you to create a Samsung account in order to access sites like Youtube, Prime and others. I don't want another account, I just want to log into whatever service I aready have w/o having to sign up for another. The product itself is light weight, easy to move and easy setup but that requirement to have a Samsung account did it for me. This product is an early prettier version of the early smart TVs - all the glamour while drinking a colt 45!"
I bought less then a week ago and noticed a spot on the screen. Not happy
Defective TV.  Wouldn't connect to apps or register antenna and missing screws for legs. Had to order screws from 3rd party and pay for them.  Nothing Samsung directed worked so they said to send it back.  Challenging to repackage.  Samsung can do so much better.
"I am disappointed with TV, the program is worst ever. Hard to add app, and all app can not play smoothly. The only way that we can use is mirocast, but it is not steable, we do not even know when the TV allow us to watch or not. And it is just use in 3 months"
was very excited to get my new TV but very upset when i plugged it in and turn it on the the screen damaged could
"After 3 months, we moved the tv into another room.  The construction of the TV is extremely flimsy and very heave, which makes it almost impossible to move.  We went from one room to another and now the screen has lines in it.  Terrible construction and so disappointed in the Samsung Product.  We did not get the extra plan, so I guess we are out $1000 after just 3 months."
"Go with another brand. This isn’t the first Samsung we’ve bought, but it will be the last. Poorest layout of any smart tv I’ve ever seen. Very poor quality remote. Customer support is difficult to access and poor. Features are good, but many are difficult to access."
The Samsung TV arrived broken. The defect was immediately found. The The TV was repackaged and returned immediately. Amazon charged us $50 for return shipping. This was not our fault! They should have paid return shipping. We paid $50 for a TV that arrived broken and we were left without working TV. TV.
Horizontal line appeared on screen within a month of unpacking. All troubleshooting failed. Returned. Huge hassle.
"Was sold tv as new but received a used cracked screen it looks like someone used it and beat it then returned it, not cool at all"
"It was supposed to be a 32"" tv. I measured it and it is only 28"". I paid almost $500 for a 28"" tv. I feel very disappointed, and mislead"
This TV showed up in a ripped box. No power cord. No remote  and no instruction manual.
What else can I say?
Faulty picture
"now the old soundbar with digital output doesnt work. using the tv remote for volume it just beeps rapidly, annoyingly.u have to use the sound bar remote or buy the newest soundbar.tolya- st00pid'er an st00pid'er"
Got my tv and it was broken in half was not very happy with my experience
"I agree with others the picture is awful. It sometimes doesn’t even look like HD.I’ve tried the expert fix, no luck.  We had a 12 yr old Samsung with beautiful picture. Wish I could fix it."
Blue screen of death after 6 mos
"I've purchased Samsung products for years including TVs. I PURCHASED THIS 50 INCH QLED ALMOST EXACTLY 2 YEARS AGO.I'VE BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS WITH TV TURNING OFF ITERMITENLY.I thought maybe the remote control was needing to be replaced ,and that could possibly be the problem.Remote control is solar powered.Ordered new remote which didn't fix the problem.Called Amazon and situation wasn't solve.Technical told me to contact Samsung for warranty.Samsung wouldn't stand behind there product for customers satisfaction.I paid $650.00 for almost 2 years of use. I ended up having to purchase another TV to replace it for my mother with a 3 year factory warranty.Another one of life's fairly expensive lessons.But surely not the most expensive one."
"If you wanted to use multi view with your iPhone, it will not work. Instead of being able to multi view your PS5 with your iPhone, your iPhone will just mirror onto the full screen and not show you your PS5. Same thing happens if you try to do it with Samsung TV Plus and your iPhone. The reality is, you’ll contact customer support for over 2 hours only to be lied to and told you can’t use your iPhone and a PS5 or Samsung TV Plus, despite Samsung’s site stating it is possible AND literally having a multi view layout setting on the TV with your phone + a HDMI, Samsung TV plus, etc.. There are literally videos of Samsung themselves showcasing you can multi view your iPhone and TV. It’s sadly false advertising if you have an iPhone. If you have a Samsung Galaxy, it works but any other company’s phone, it’s wishful thinking. I tested it with a friend’s Samsung and it worked so for the Samsung customer support that said it didn’t, they are wrong. Disappointing is an understatement, especially since it’s the first Samsung Smart TV I’ve bought. Also, unfortunately the sound isn’t great. Attached are photos from the site stating how Multi view works and the TV itself showing that PS5 and mobile CAN be paired together."
"the screen started to peel of the protective tinted screen.  It was not physically damaged, and  the technician confirmed this with me.  It is unacceptable  that it will not be covered under warranty."
"In November 2021, we bought a brand new TV.  Around February 2022, the screen failed the 3 picture tests (vertical lines all across the screen).  It was under warranty so they sent us a new one (again we had to pay to have it mounted on the wall). We are on Samsung number 2, it is July of 2024, and this screen is black.  It’s going to cost us $250 plus parts, and if the problem is NOT the screen, our cost is $210 plus parts, labor and taxes…if they can’t fix it (1 1/2 year old TV), $120 of the charge is NON-REFUNDABLE!  DO NOT BUY A SAMSUNG TV!!!!"
"Summary: image quality is great, but the clunky interface, unavoidable hardware lag, and Amazon bloatware make owning this TV an absolutely abysmal experience. If this is the highest tier of TV Amazon has to offer, look elsewhere even if it costs you a few hundred dollars more.Details on why you SHOULD NOT buy this TV:1. THERE ARE INESCAPABLE ADS THAT YOU MUST CLICK THROUGH TO ACCESS CONTENT. This is absolutely unacceptable on a TV that is  paid for in full. There are similar features on other Fire devices, like tablets, but that is disclosed to you up front at the time of purchase, and you have the option of paying slightly more to disable them. No such option exists on these TVs, and no disclosure is made at the time of purchase. It’s a joke and an insult to customers. (NOTE: other competitors, like Roku, have ads as well, but the ads don’t need to be clicked through to access content)2. The user interface is unnecessarily complex, and it can’t get out of its own way. As one small example, you have to select a Fire profile on TV startup, and only then can you access apps, like Netflix, which themselves have profiles you must select. Forcing users to select a profile up front  when they will have to again select further app  profiles regardless is ridiculous. Let us just get into our apps from the beginning and skip this unnecessary step.. This is just one example of user-unfriendly interface design; it’s endemic and everywhere you go  in the Fire TV UI:  super tiny apps, apps that take multiple clicks to access even if ads were removed, inability to access picture and sound settings from the main menu, profile and other settings that are completely inaccessible on the TV and must be edited on websites or apps for seemingly-arbitrary reasons, and a slew of others. You simply can’t make this TV do what you want it to do without having to click a million things, and even then, the end result is sometimes hidden away on another device or simply can’t be accessed.3. Glitchy, rampant hardware lag is EVERYWHERE. The TV takes seconds to respond to single clicks of the remote. Shows start without proper buffering and play in resolution worse than a Super Nintendo while also moving in stop-motion for 10 seconds before actually working.  Ad-supported apps bounce between commercials and content incredibly slowly, which would be fine if it were buffering, but it’s not and the first bit of commercial or content is a pixelated, glitchy mess regardless. Trying to fast forward or rewind a show requires a prayer to ancient Incan gods, and only half the time does the TV actually respond to your button press, and only half of the time after that does it actually stop fast forwarding/rewinding when you let go of the button instead of 5 seconds later. Menus boot up super slowly, and once available still don’t respond to your clicks. It’s like this TV has 40 pounds of crap shoved into 5 pounds of hardware, and it just can’t keep up. The worst part is that when the TV confuses itself enough from all the overload, it crashes and restarts…multiple times per day. (NOTE: TV is completely up to date, and it’s connected to Amazon’s own 6th-gen eero mesh network, which is excellent; all hardware acceleration is also turned off since it makes content look terrible anyway)4. Bloatware. Bloatware everywhere. The TV comes with about as much unwanted software on it as a 2003 Dell PC. Unlike the 20-year-old Dell, however, this bloatware can’t be removed. You can hide it from certain menus, but it will always be there, always try to send you notifications, and always try to force its way into your periphery. Even Apple figured this out a decade ago with its native apps: let us delete unwanted junk that we don’t need. Maybe the TV would actually work if we could get rid of all this garbage?5. WHY DOES ALEXA HOME THEATER MAKE A LOUD, OBNOXIOUS “BOOP” NOISE EVERY TIME YOU CHANGE THE VOLUME!? And how in the world do we disable that freaking noise so we don’t wake up napping children when we want to turn the volume down from 5/100 to 3/100? It’s not in the options of the TV, I can tell you that, which further reinforces how clunky and unintuitive this entire UI experience is if this option is hidden in some other app completely unrelated to Fire TV.6. Every possible hardware modification of the TV’s content is turned on from the start, meaning everything you watch looks like a super saturated daytime soap opera. It’s 2022, guys. Stop shipping TVs with Motion Smoothing and 17 other things turned on by default. No one likes them.If for some masochistic reason you still want this TV after the above points, here is the singular reason you SHOULD buy this TV:1. Once all the hardware acceleration bloat is turned off, and after you’ve edited the picture settings (which again, cannot be accessed through the main menu) so that the image quality doesn’t look like the Teletubbies, the image quality is excellent. Colors are uniform, pictures are crisp (when they aren’t pixelated from all the lag), details are clear, dark areas are dark without looking grey, etc. It’s likely that the display is manufactured by Samsung (like most QLED displays), which is great, and it shows.Overall, there is no way I can recommend this TV to anyone who wants to retain their sanity. It’s very clear that Amazon chose to compromise TV functionality and the user experience so that it could push Alexa, a metric short-ton of Amazon services, and ads, and it does all of this by bait and switching you with an excellent display at an excellent price-point. It’s a borderline scam since the ads, bloatware, overloaded hardware, and unusable interfaces aren’t made apparent to you up front. The price looks great compared to its competitors, but there’s a reason for that, and the reason isn’t made clear at the time of purchase. It’s an unforgivable business strategy, and I’ll be returning this TV in 5 days once Thanksgiving has passed.Thanks for coming to my TED Talk."
"We installed the 65"" version on our bedroom wall (replacing a 43"" FireTV 4 series, which we also had problems with). The only two things we have attached to it are a PS5 and an Xfinity media box.Overall, I'm torn between giving this tv a 3 or 4 star review, but I'm going with a three for one particular problem: there are times when the very edges of the screen (the top-right, and right side) appear as though the QLED panel is not properly aligned, and you can see long strips (4-8 inches) of the bright white panel showing around the edge of whatever you're watching. It's really only noticeable on dark scenes, and scenes with a lot of light will kind of ""blend"" the edges back to normal. I'll try to remember to get a photo of this happening, and include it later. It is incredibly distracting when it happens, and for that, I'm dropping a 4 star review down to 3. I'd look into sending it back for a replacement, but I think it may have occurred in transit, so I'm not confident the next one won't also get beat up. When I got home and saw the box on the porch, it was banged up so good that this was actually the first time I've photographed a box in case the packaged product was smashed up. There was no noticeable damage on the tv's exterior, and this problem took a few weeks to present, so I'm thinking there was some internal damage that is getting worse over time. That said, whenever this problem gets bad enough, I'll be replacing this tv with a Samsung, as we've never had an issue with a Samsung tv.Another big complaint is that there's no way to adjust/calibrate the picture settings when you're on the home screen (meaning the FireTV screen). It only allows you to adjust the backlight, which I currently have at 50% (and even at 50%, I've noticed white characters will have ""hot spots"" on their faces where the screen is simply too bright, and the actors/actresses look like an off-frame light is reflecting off their faces). I'm so confused as to why you can't calibrate the settings on this screen, but I've scoured the setting screens and there's just nothing I can do about it.Aside from those two complaints, I actually quite like the TV. We have a Samsung Frame in our living room, and given that this is clearly meant to be a cheaper version of that, I will admit that for the price it's a worthwhile alternative. We put it on the wall on a low-profile Amazon mount, and it really does sit nice and flush, but does still look very much like a tv (unlike our Frame, which has been mistaken for a painting on four separate occasions). The audio is good enough that I don't feel compelled to add a soundbar or Echo device to it; however, I did test an Echo Studio with it, and that was a GREAT upgrade...if this was in my living room, I'd keep the Studio paired to it, without question.On other inputs (PS5 is on the eARC, and the Xfinity box is on HDMI3) I can adjust the screen settings and calibrate it as necessary, and the picture quality is NOTICEABLY better than the FireTV interface. God of War: Ragnarok on PS5 looks fantastic, and I'm also a computer gamer, so I'm humbly giving credit where it's due on this one. As for the Xfinity box, the increase in picture quality on that input is so noticeable that I've just given up on using the tv's native FireTV interface.The artwork it displays is really nice, and having it integrated with Alexa and being able to ask about the artwork is a really cool feature that Samsung really missed out on. We only had that feature on for a day or two because, unless I missed it, there's no way to set it to a schedule so it doesn't turn on while you're sleeping...which seems strange since it's an Alexa device, you'd think a scheduling option would be a native feature/option. As it stands, the motion sensors would turn it on if we rolled too much, or got up to pee, or if the dogs or kids came into the room, so we just turned off any and all standby modes.Overall, I'd say this is a great tv for a secondary watching location. If this was in my living room, I'd be sending it back for a refund, not a replacement. But because this isn't any kind of focal point, we're just living with its flaws and moving on, and accepting that the experience we're getting is not worth what we paid (and we actually got it on the Black Friday sale price)."
"UPDATE: Dropping this review to two stars.  I have been using a pair of Echo speakers for Alexa Home Theater for about 6 months with very few issues.  Not sure if an update broke something, but the unit would stop playing audio through one of the speakers.  Some times unplugging the unit would fix the issue, but often I would have to unpair the speakers and re-pair to get it to work, and even then, it often didn't.  I have had to unplug/plug-in the unit every couple of days in the last month.  I even tried a different pair of Echo speakers and had the same issue.  I have likely wasted three hours of my time over the last few weeks.  I have replaced this set up with a new Roku Streambar, which so far is working.  Very disappointed because Alexa Home Theater is advertised on the main page for this TV but it is a huge pain to deal with.  Still happy with the picture quality, but this unit is on thin ice with me.  Any new issues and I will request a refund.  I really wish I had gone to Costco and bought a LG, which we have had good luck with as a brand.  I would have spent less and probably had a better experience.  Buyer beware!TL/DR: I would probably give this TV a 3 1/2 star rating rather than the 3 shown.  I really like the picture quality and love being able to use my Echo speakers for better sound.  But, and this is a big but, the TV is let down by a lack of processing power that makes watching live TV events painful.  I added an Apple TV 4K and now I am very happy.Pros:- Easy to set up- Alexa integration is nice, although not a game change for me.- Connecting Echo smart speakers for the TV sound is a really nice feature. Very easy to set up and eliminates the need to buy a soundbar.- Four HDMI inputs- Videophiles may have quibbles with the picture quality, but I have zero complaints for a bedroom TV. I find it to be plenty bright enough.- The Ambient Experience is nice, but not game changing. I like having a slideshow of impressionist paintings on the screen when not being used.Cons:- This TV is severely let down by its lack of processing power.  I really wonder what Amazon's QC team was thinking when they let this product come to market.  Many Fire TV apps, mainly those that do not have live video, work fine but are slower to load than my Fire TV 4K Max.  The letdown is using apps where I watch live TV, especially sports.  YouTube TV is painful to use.  Using the internal guide is very slow and i notice a lot of stuttering during live sporting events.  I use the Bally Sports app to watch my local NBA team and it's awful.  The picture freezes up every couple of seconds.  This is not a problem at all on my 4K Max.  If you watch a lot of sports, I strongly recommend getting a secondary streaming device.  I added a $20 Android TV box from Walmart that works a million times better for these two apps.  This is supposed to be Amazon's flagship TV and this does not show off its operating system's true potential.- I had an issue with a Yamaha soundbar that I connected via eARC.  The volume levels would suddenly go down to zero.  I have not had this issue with the internal speakers or the Echoes.  I returned the soundbar to Costco.- I think the stock Fire TV remotes are not great.  I can feel the battery door squeeze in every time I use it and the buttons are small and shaped the same.  Easy to press the wrong button, especially in the dark.  I paid for the Pro remote and it is vastly superior.  Much better build quality and the backlighting helps prevent pressing the wrong button.  I wish Amazon would include this with what is supposed to be their most premium TV in the Fire lineup.- There were some weird bugs that seemed to have been worked out with system updates.  Ambient Experience stopped working for a few days.- I placed multiple calls to customer support to deal with with the picture stuttering and Ambient Experience. Their solutions are 1) Unplugging the TV and pugging it back in again, 2) Factory Reset, and 3) have the unit returned for a refund.  They aren't equipped to handle anything else.  I suspect some of the issues with stuttering could be fixed with software updates, but I doubt much technical information is making it from their front line reps to their software/engineering teams.Bottom Line: I decided to keep the set because it works great with my Apple TV 4K connected and I am happy with the picture and the ability to connect my existing Echoes as speakers. The hassle of returning the TV was not worth it the less I used the installed Fire OS. If you treat this is as dumb TV that happens to have Alexa integration, then I think you'll be happy.  But if you are a Fire TV purist, I would get another TV and add a 4K Max stick and I believe you will be much happier.  You can still use your Echo speakers for sound for the entire TV when connected to the eARC input.  I hope someone from Amazon's engineering department reads this, because there are some serious flaws for what is supposed to be their best TV."
"Initial setup was no problem to get the basics working. But then I wanted to configure it for our environment, which included a Nakamechi soundbar, TiVo and Samsung Blue-Ray player.Firstly, the option to set up attached equpment was displaying a message saying that it was not enabled on my device. I spent sometime with the support team but they could not work out the problem. Since the error message I got related to the remote control, I suggested that we try connecting my older Fire TV Cube remote. That fixed the problem, as the menu of option was then displayed - when I used the older remote. However, it was a waste of time. The devices that can be controlled are very limited, so my Samsung Blue-Ray player can only be used manually (I cannot switch it on/off or open/close the tray and play DVDs using Alexa). Also, my TiVo has to be connected directly to a TV HDMI port instead of my soundbar, since there is no Alexa control of the soundbar or TiVo (other than Power on/off via eARC). I wanted to keep everything going through the soundbar, but that is not an option.The avaible documentation suggests that it is possible to use Skype with this TV - No, it is no longer supported - Zoom is the only option, which does not help when our friends are still using Skype.The documentation says that it is possible to use Apple Air-Play, like my older TCL TV (with Fire TV). That option is not displayed in the menu where the documentation says it should be. I do not want to spend more time on a support call with Amazon, so I guess Air-Play will remain unsupported on my TV.The display quality is quite good, as our family room is relatively dark, so no complaints with the picture quality. We use a soundbar, but I did need to use the TV speakers briefly while troubleshooting an issue and the sound was not bad.The best thing about the TV is that it lets us eliminate one box and associated cables (the Fire TV Cube). However, if you want to have control of all your attached equipment using Alexa, I would recommend using the FireTV Cube as it will support a much greater rage of devices."
"Picture and sound are nice enough. Not stunningly good, but good. Display mirroring (screencasting) is buggy.Screencast from Windows 11 laptop works *once*. After that, further connection attempts cannot find the Fire TV. I tried restarting PC and TV. Same result.I went to another Windows 11 laptop and had exactly the same result. It too connected and screencasted successfully *once* and fails on subsequent attempts.It is a *TV* problem, not a Windows problem! I reset my TV to factory defaults and I was again able to connect my PC *once* and after that the PC cannot see the TV. Another user reported the same symptom on amazonforum, right down to the works-once-after-reset.Screencast from Android to Fire TV works flawlessly. I can connect, disconnect, connect again, etc.Display Mirroring is an essential function for my family. I'm going to have to spend $60 more dollars to buy a Chromecast dongle because Fire TV can't reliably screencast."
"I purchased this television nearly a year ago.  Pros:  I love the big screen and the good picture quality.Cons:  Compared to my former TV, a popular brand, it takes way too much time when changing from one channel to another.Compared to my former TV, when I am watching a program, say a cold case file, a movie, or anything, this Amazon TV does not keep it where I left off.  My old television, I could go outside and mow my lawn and come back in and my program was still there to watch.  Now, with the Amazon TV, I have to go back and research the program every time I take even a short break.  And, if I don't remember the title of the show, I can not find it again.  Very aggravating!I am from the old school, an 83-year-old lady, and I simply have to laugh at ""smart"" televisions.  I bought it at Amazon to save the trouble of bringing a TV home from the store.  For the same reason, as an independent, it would have been impossible for me to consider returning it.  I wish now I had purchased it at a store for a lower price and sought someone to help with the process.  Frustration continues!"
"Ok I don't always leave reviews but I've had this for awhile and I have to say I'm kinda disappointed. I got this cause I wanted 4k for my PS5, and even with the correct cables I get 4k @60Hz and you can tell. Playing games at 4k you quickly notice.  Also I don't have the TV connected to the Internet and instead on an Apple TV 4k and the TV will leave itself on. Like multiple presses of power button don't work you have to press and hold the power button. Also built in mic on the TV that has a physical toggle on the bottom. Idk I got this for my PS5 and it doesn't live up to what I wanted. I am outside the return and it's not horrible, just should have tried for a 120hz, the mic built into the TV feels to much, and why does it have to have Internet to function easily as a TV? If you want a Online Netflix/Apps TV this might be for you, reach higher for your consoles/eyes sake."
"Edit 7/27/2023 This will be my final edit. I gave up on the TV completely. Less than 1 year of ownership. The software never got fixed. It would get stuck inside of apps. Pressing the home button would only return you to the app you were trying to leave. And when powering the TV on it would also go into the app you last used. Makes it very difficult to switch between apps. I was unplugging the TV daily to get it to reset.The dead pixel cluster did grow too. At first I could only see it standing next to the TV, by the time I gave up, it was noticeable from the couch.Plex was still broken as well. Still would crash at exactly 5 minutes into a song. Plex logs show it was the TV that sent the kill command.It is now sitting in the dumpster. I bought a new TV that doesn't use Amazon software.Edit: 2/25/23 I've given up on using Plex with the Fire software. I plugged in a separate streaming device and OMG that device is miles better. Content actually loads. Music actually plays.The Fire OS on this TV is straight broken.Stay far away from this TV.Edit: 02/01/23 Another month down, at least 2 updates I think and absolutely no progress made in making this software better. Still has problems with Plex. Music still only plays exactly 5 minutes and crashes. Which then causes an issue of not loading metadata.Still has the problem of trying to get to the home screen. Press the button once, it flashes the home screen then loads back into whatever app you were in. Press the home button again and it is 50/50 as to whether it'll stay on the home screen.And the software just freezes some times. You can press a button on the remote and nothing happens...press again, still nothing, press a 3rd time and it finally accepts the command and does all 3 commands rapidly.Do not buy this TV. There are many better choices at this price range. I'm hoping for a decent sale to pop up before the big game so I can replace this piece of garbage.Edit: 12/24/22:  Another month down and this TV still does not play nice with Plex music. Plays exactly 5 minutes then crashes. After the crash metadata fails to load in Plex.And the issue with getting to the home screen has come back. Pressing the home button tries to load the home screen, but then reloads whatever app you were in. Most of the time a 2nd time pressing the home is 50/50 that it'll go to the home screen and stay there. Overall navigation in the app is just super slow.The dead cells in the center of the screen have gotten slightly more noticeable.I'm passed the return window, so I'm stuck with this garbage for a while.Edit: 11/29/22: I've spoken with customer support and they did refund me the $250 price difference, so that was nice. Too bad the software still does not play nice with Plex. I can not listen to a song for more than 5 minutes before it crashes the app and shuts the TV off. Plex's logs show the TV is what is crashing.I am fully up to date on software and still having this problem.Then, I noticed I now have a small group of dead pixels right in the middle of the screen.Such a disappointing device.It is amazing how this TV's Fire software is soooo buggy compared to older Amazon TV's running the same software.Right now this TV crashes apps and turns off the TV. It also has a problem where you can't get back to the home screen. It just gets stuck inside whatever app you are using. Pressing the home button or asking Alexa doesn't work...it tries, but then right back to the app you were in.Letting it sit turned off for a long time kinda fixes it...as does unplugging it. There is no hard reset option other than unplugging.Plex in particular crashes a lot when playing music. It also has created a problem where metadata art fails to load.It works fine on an older Fire TV running software that has the same home screen as the new TV.Also super disappointed in Amazon when they price dropped this TV $250 from what the pre-order people paid. That is that extra kick in the teeth."
"I love the picture on this TV. It has excellent resolution for gaming and video. Its hardware handles streaming apps very well and, despite its large size and great quality, it came at a bargain.My major complaint, and it’s big one, is that the Alexa voice assistant has steadily become more and more unreliable. That’s so disappointing because I set up the TV up as the central hub for my smart home less than a year ago. It worked wonderfully at first. I used voice commands to control all my smart lighting, played music throughout my house on all my speakers, and entertained friends with trivia. That all changed. Frequently now, the TV no longer responds to voice commands without using the voice remote or I have to do hard reset of the TV. When it is working, it often gets my requests to play music all wrong and plays music on only the TV when I clearly tell it over and over again to play the music on all my speakers. I tried setting up my speakers in the Alexa app again, and it’ll now only play music either on the TV or only on my other Alexa devices, or only on my non-Alexa Bluetooth speakers. This is infuriating! I’ve been round for round with customer service about and nothing has been done to fix the software. I am seriously starting to regret having invested so much in Amazon products. Oh, and to play my music across all my devices, I have to pay more when I didn’t have to do that a few years ago."
"Lots of minor things we don’t like. I’ll list a few.Tv will sleep when a movie is paused. Massive delay when trying to wake it back up. Sometimes have to re open the app and restart movie.Slow and clunky app performance for anything other than Amazon stuff.Glare is pretty bad, worse than our last TV for sure.Good picture quality. Decent sound. Good remote.Advertisements are annoying.Adding apps is confusing and it almost seems like they purposely make it difficult to use anything other than Amazon stuff."
"I decided to rewrite this in a less angry set of mind. I wasn't fair. My actual dislikes of this tv, besides the dead pixel. could happen to anybody i suppose, is the input lag, every port is too laggy to play games with, drives me nuts, it stutters bad, any setting I've tried so far. My second grip, which I did half expect before ordering was the crappy menu layout and settings menu and how it works...it'll take you yrs to find what your looking for in there. I have the previous model as well, the non qled version. I just found the settings for the sound in the menu, I've had it for over 2 yrs! Why 3 stars as a fair rating?? I think the pixel was a fluke and is likely a small occurance overall percentage why..and things slip past inspections now and then. I can actually live with the dead pixel, fact it annoy's me alot less than it did at first. The positives, yes, believe it or not it does have it's upsides. Once you tinker with the picture and figure it out..I got to say it does a pretty good job at delivering a good picture, if you don't have a white stuck pixel I mean."
"The problem with relying on built in apps on smart TVs is the performance of those apps become slower and slower because though the apps are always being updated, which includes even the TVs OS, that can call for more processing power, the processor on the TV has remained  the same since manufacturing.  That will lead over time to a slow response TV, especially if a ‘just adequate’ processor was chosen at the time of manufacturing.  To keeping the performance experience high, I avoid using the built in apps and just use a Fire TV Stick Max on one of the HDMI ports. Cheaper to upgrade the stick than the TV."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I had a 65” Vizio 4K that was 7 years old and died. I used this as an opportunity to try out the Amazon Fire Omni 4K QLED (did I say that right?). Fit and finish of the device itself is nice. Visually appealing device in the living room. The image quality is stunning. I mean, absolutely incredible. Only thing I’d want more is 120 Hz and OLED, but this display certainly holds it down and I can be picky. The other great thing is that if you have Amazon devices such as the Echo Studio, you can create a stereo pair and elevate the experience further. We previously used an AppleTV 4K which is connected to the TV via HDMI and use two HomePod’s as a stereo pair and it’s incredible.Here’s the problem - we bought this TV as a means to potentially ditch the AppleTV and HomePod devices so that there were no cords connected to the TV. Thought was to use all Amazon devices and create a stereo pair along with whole-home Echo setup for our new home we’re building. Unfortunately, the usability of the TV is embarrassingly poor. Most days I hear one of the kids calling me to fix the TV because it froze, or they tell me that the remote is clicking on its own (it’s really just catching up on clicks because it’s delayed). Alexa also only works when it wants to. What I mean is that sometimes it hears me and other times I look like an idiot talking to the TV trying to get Alexa to wake up. I typically am left needing to restart the TV once a day, sometimes twice. While this isn’t a $2,000 TV, I don’t feel these issues should exist on an Amazon product.My final thoughts: look, the price of the TV was great. I bought it during Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days in October 2023. With the image quality and use of our existing AppleTV 4K, we get what we need today. I’d like to see Amazon address the tech issues within the device, that others have addressed as well. I would be willing to pay a premium for a TV that had an updated processor (or whatever tech needs updating) if that meant I could get a high-quality user experience - think iPhone Pro Series. My hope is that we see something like this come to market from Amazon soon.All said, would I buy this TV again? Yes. The value is there and the image quality is serious business. If you’re looking for a good TV with a light price tag and don’t mind the tech issues, this TV has your name on it."
"We decided to see what Amazon had to offer for televisions.  It was over $550.00, not the most expensive, but not the cheapest either.  First aggravation: The ""artistic"" junk they think we want to play on our tv, instead of just shutting off when you hit the power button.  Had to go to settings to get that off.  Second: When you turn the tv on, it takes 15-20 seconds for it to respond. In fact, all buttons are very slow to respond!  Third: Why do televisions always have so much bloatware to use up memory? I only use my computer to shop on Amazon, all the shopping, and other Amazon apps should be optional, not mandatory!  Fourth: The sound has to be turned up to over 40 to hear some of the programs.  Shouldn't have to buy a separate sound bar for normal sound!  Fifth: The recommended programs you think I want to watch? I can decide that for myself thank you!  And when I am in the middle of a show, and want to resume it, about 50% of the time, I have to do another alphabet search!  On the positive, the picture quality is good. It was nice to shop for something large, and have it delivered to my door. I like shopping with Amazon, but will probably never buy another tv from them."
"In my 20+ years of using Amazon, I've only ever written reviews for two products.  In both cases, the products were outstanding and deserved the recognition (note: I recently removed one, because it was for a piece of software that I bought in 2002 and has not been relevant in the decades since).  In this particular case, I feel an obligation to warn future buyers about what they're considering.  First, some background.  I wanted an easily wall-mountable 4K/UHD television in the 40-50"" range for my second bedroom, which is also my office.  It wasn't meant for constant use - mostly for guests when they stay over, or if I happen to sleep in that room, or to stream the news or YouTube background music for ambience while I work.  The idea of having a FireTV built into the same device was very appealing, because it meant fewer cords, cables, remotes, things to plug in, things to unplug or turn off & on again for troubleshooting, etc.  I've generally had good experiences with Amazon-branded products, so a relatively inexpensive television that checked all of those boxes seemed like an opportunity for another good experience.Here's the good: It checks the boxes.  It's easy to mount. With the built-in FireTV, things are pretty simple.  For a non-theater-quality television experience, the picture and sound are great.  Right now I'm streaming a video called ""Medieval Irish Tavern While Celtic Travelling Band Plays Ambience 🔥🎶 Crackling Fireplace & Chatter"" while working (well, err, while writing this review), and it sounds fantastic, the colors are bright, and the viewing angles are actually really good.  It's all very pleasant.Here's the bad: I'm not using the built-in FireTV.  Nay, I ended up mounting an old Apple TV to the back and use that.  That's right - for my Amazon FireTV, I use it to watch my Apple TV.  ""Whaaaaat!  Blasphemy!"" you might be thinking.  But, lo, for while my hopes for the FireTV were grand, as I use a ""4k Max"" Fire TV Stick from 2021 on my main television, alas, whatever Amazon did with this television is, to quote Jean-Ralphio, ""the woooooooooorst.""  Once you get something playing, sure, it's fine.  Queue up that Netflix movie, start that episode on Hulu, get that YouTube ambience rolling - it's all good, my friend.  However.  The experience of getting to the point of something running is terrible.  The built-in FireTV is so slow as to be nearly unusable at times.  I'm talking, like, pressing a button on the remote to navigate a menu and it taking a full second or more to see a response.  That might not seem so terrible but in real life it's unbearable.  It's slow to respond, it can be jittery at times, and it's just such an awful user experience.  I was so disappointed, but by the time I was ready to give up I was past my return window, so I invested another $40 in a plastic mount and flat extension cord to attach the Apple TV as discretely as possible to the back.Would I recommend this for someone looking for even a basic television for streaming?  Sadly, no.  It ain't worth your time.  Find another television that meets your physical dimension and quality needs, then spring for another $45 or whatever it costs for a new Fire TV Stick these days, and move on with your life.  I wish I had done the same."
"Worked fine until it didn’t. Less than a year in it started having issues with the voice control which eventually totally stopped working and the remote stopped pairing so I could not even get it to power on.I had to jump through many hoops to get it working.  When it does work, has good picture and decent sound."
"Love this TV the picture and everything is is good love that but the interface is too slow. I was considering buying another one but I'm going to move the existing one to my bedroom that is less used because the interface is so slow. I do appreciate the value and the price point which is huge and understand that in order to reach that price point they have to compromise on certain components like the processing power which results in a laggy interface. I do like the integration with all of the other Amazon components like my Ring cameras and Alexa which is amazing, but at the end of the day I'm intending to purchase another TV that is more responsive. If your patient this is definitely the TV for you."
"I picked up one of these on sale at Best Buy.  It seemed like a good deal.  It has some nice features and if you have an echo studio, it can have incredible, wireless sound.The major issue with this TV is it's by far the most buggy one I've every owned.  On a regular basis, the sound to my Echo Studios will cut out.  The TV doesn't know anything is wrong and the speakers don't know anything is wrong.  All you can do it fully reboot the TV.  When you do that, it takes minutes for the speakers to reconnect.The sound without connecting Studio speakers is pretty bad.  It's just not good even by built in standards.The software runs like hot garbage.  The performance is horrifyingly bad.  For instance, if I open Pandora, it starts playing music pretty quick, but then if you want to navigate the screen, you have to wait seconds between each button press for anything to happen.  I thought maybe it was just Pandora, but over time, I've noticed the same thing in the Hulu, and Disney Plus apps.The interface is a okay, but there are times when I miss the Android TV interface.  Neither are perfect, but at least the Fire TV has gotten better with time, where Android TV seemed like it just got more cluttered with ads.The remote is nice and streamlined, but sometimes it seems to disconnect without the TV knowing it's disconnected.  This could also be the awful software performance on the TV just crashing in the background, but it's hard to tell.The nicest thing about this TV might be the ambient mode, which will act like a digital picture frame, with apps.  Only problem with the apps is that there are very few and sometimes they just die.  When then die, they don't just drop off, they sit there with an error message.  You then have to go in manually remove the app.The picture is good, but it's not on the level with OLEDs.  It's serviceable and most of the time you won't notice it's shortcomings.If they fixed the performance and software, this would be a four out of five star TV.  Right now lower price is the only thing really making it appealing."
"I've had this TV about 10 months and it has a great picture for the money. Sound is decent from the panel without using a sound bar.The problem is the Fire TV UI. It is PAINFULLY slow. The system lags any remote input by about 2-3 seconds for the first 2-3 minutes after being turned on. It's to the point that we all know to turn the TV on and wait about a minute before you try to do anything else.  Every week or so we have to do a hard reboot to clear it. The fire UI is cluttered and confusing at times since it shows you options in multiple streaming service but doesn't tell you if you already have access to them (i.e. if you are going to have to pay more to watch it).Again, great picture terrible software performance. Wish they would release an update that would fix the lagging OS."
"I have reset this TV back to factory multiple times.  Alexa hangs all the time and doesn't respond half of the time.  Trying to navigate this OS is painfully slow even with is being the only device connected to the 5ghz wi-fi with a gigabyte pipeline.  The picture is okay and is no difference from the Omni series event with the newly ""added picture features"".  The audio constantly pops and glitches and will continues to render after leaving an app and continues to render after turning ""off"" the TV.If you care about speed this tv is not for you.  If you care about audio not rendering after you leave an app or turn ""off"" the TV this tv is not for you.  If you like Alexa to be responsive this TV is not for you.If you like a TV that hangs and doesn't shut off when told, than this TV is for you!If you like audio to continue to render after turning it off, than this TV is for you!If you like a lack luster picture that is not different from the previous series, than this tv id for you!If you like applications that hang and fail to respond, than this TV is for you!If you like audio that pops, glitches and consistently drops out, than this TV is for you!If you like a TV that has all these defects and okay with it because of the great price point,  Than this tv is for you.Summary, I have had a Fire TV since the first generation and it only get worst in performance with this being the worst.  It is obvious their QA team is non-existent or just doesn't care and lack any quality checks."
"Edit #2: absolutely terrible tv. Came home from work to see the tv changing colors from White, red, green, blue, black and continuously repeating the cycle. Unable to get the screen to change. Can’t find anything about this issue online or on Amazon. $800 regretted purchase especially since they keep selling them for $500+ for the 65”. I’m past the return date and seem to be stuck with a broken piece of junk. Do NOT buy, go with a reputable tv company instead.Edit: customer service reached out and helped me fix the issue. Therefor I’ve bumped it up to 3 stars from 1 because for the time being it’s now working like when I first bought it. If it becomes a common problem where I have to factory reset my tv to get it to work properly then I will adjust my rating as needed. But for the issues I’ve dealt with I leave it with a 3 for now.My expectations for this tv were on the low end since it is a Amazon made device. I’ve always had issues with their fire line products and this tv is sadly no different. The good parts though are that the picture quality is pretty great for the price you pay. I’m happy with that, tv shows, movies and games have all looked nice and crisp on the screen. Plenty of apps to download of course. The remote that comes with it is also a plus, has a dedicated Alexa button on it which is nicer than yelling across my living room at the tv to get Alexa’s attention. With that said, Alexa doesn’t always understand what I ask which is frustrating with how long Alexa has been available. Why aren’t these kinks sorted and gone by now? Asking Alexa 1 time to play a show I’ve been watching should be a simple task but sometimes it takes 2 or 3 tries. Usually it’s just easier to find the show and click to start it since when using Alexa to start a show, it tends to just bring me to the shows page instead and not actually play the episode, which again seems frustrating with how long Alexa has been out and including the fact I paid full price for this tv when it came out. Along with Alexa not being able to listen to a clear request, it’s slow. So horrifyingly slow, the UI is also slow and seems to just struggle and chug with every press of the button trying to search for a app or a show. I’ve had this tv since November and been plagued by issues with WiFi connectivity which led me to get a Ethernet cable so it was just hardwired and as of this writing that’s now not working? Any time I stream a show it skips, dialogue doesn’t match the screen, the picture shutters, I have to basically stream a show from my phone to the tv now to just watch something. Ive had no bad experiences when playing a game on the tv though. I use my switch and ps4 a lot and noticed the quality is as high as the gaming machines allow and have had no issues there. Also, I can no longer use the power button on the remote to turn the tv OFF but I can use the very same power button to turn it ON….? So I have to use Alexa and to speak loud, clear and slowly just to turn the tv off now. Overall it’s a $800 oversized paperweight that I highly regret buying. For the price and it being a fire tv I knew I would have a couple issues but not this bad or consistent. Saving up a bit more money and buying a LG C2 would’ve been a better choice. Personally I’ll never bother trusting a fire tv or any fire product again. My 2yr old 32” Toshiba fire tv for my bedroom which was $80 at the time works better and faster than this piece of junk."
"I've never really written this poor of a review but with all of the TV choices out there, I’m really sorry that I bought this Amazon Fire 50” Omni QLED TV, and unfortunately the return window has closed. I wish it hadn't because I would be sending this TV back. We had a Samsung that was working fine but the screen was a little smaller. I thought the Fire TV and Alexa would be a cool thing to have. It’s not. The picture is great but not only is this TV clunky and “laggy”, it does not play well with Xfinity TV/DVR (not Xfinity stream), and surprisingly it does not play well with the Bose sound bar we just purchased. The FireTV was working OK with some limitations using it with Xfinity, but not everything worked the way we wished it would. Amazon support confirmed that we could not use the Fire TV remote with Xfinity but we don't mind the Xfinity remote so we dealt with it.We recently added the Bose sound bar, and things got even more frustrating. The connection between the two works for a very short time, and then the picture turns off, we get “input not detected” messages and the sound constantly keeps switching between the sound bar and the TV. We’re usually pretty good at figuring technology out. Maybe it's Xfinity, maybe it's the sound bar, maybe it's the TV, or maybe it’s a combination, but this TV has more negatives than positives for us.  We've searched for solutions, tried everything we could, went through all of the settings, switched to a new ARC cable and nothing has changed. It’s all just a source of frustration. We have no choice but to take the sound bar back before the return window closes on that as well. It is disappointing, but I will probably throw this TV in the guest bedroom at some point soon, and use the old Samsung or purchase a better TV down the road. It won’t be a Fire TV that’s for sure. I guess it's true - you get what you pay for.  Lesson learned."
"Picture seems pretty good, was expecting it to be so bc of oled/qled quality.  Only concern is that surround sound speaker option, that I use on my LG 60 inch is not available and have to use the tv speakers, which are decent, or sound bar that I don't want to have to buy.  We will see.  So far it seems like a great value for the price."
"I am in no way a huge TV fan boy or techie in any way, especially since tech started monitoring everything we do.  Also, I will not go in depth about all the crap no one really cares about because I am finding out that writing reviews tends to be more subjective than objective with tech these days, so take that for what it is. I settled on this TV because of the price and because it is next to impossible to find a TV that isn't ""smart"" and doesn't monitor you.  Ultimately, I just want a basic TV and if I want to make it ""smart"" then I'd buy a separate stand-alone device that I can hook up to get connected, but that's difficult.  My $20 second hand Samsung has a much better picture in my opinion and I wish I had it back.  The picture is ok but I think we've become so obsessed with ""picture quality"" in our TV's that the picture comes nowhere near realistic and only benefits users for heavy CGI.  I've noticed pixelation in dark scenes, messed with the settings and fixed it a little but still there slightly.  I now get motion sickness with this TV if there is lots of camera movements, never experienced that before.  Tried messing with the settings but doesn't help much.  I notice some lag while navigating around and it doesn't seem to ever get better although it isn't terrible.  The worst part is that with all these added features, now Alexa monitors me.  I don't care for those features honestly and I can't rate this more than 3 stars. If you enjoy modern tech, I am sure you will enjoy this TV, especially at such an affordable price and/or the convenience of having Alexa and Amazon's UI.  I am not quite impressed."
"The picture and sound qualities are fine. I’m not very finicky about these. However, this TV does not pair with my FIOS TV remote. The Amazon remote handles the power on/off and volume. My FIOS TV remote does not have the Amazon Fire TV as a pairing choice. We have several other smart TVs: Toshiba, Sony, Insignia, all of which are paired with FIOS TV for volume and power functions. My family is very frustrated with the limitations of the Amazon TV pairing. Ugh!"
"The picture is just as we expected at 4k. The problem is - it is sooooooooooo slow. It consistently freezes, we have to restart it often and when linking to our surround sound it goes in and out.Super disappointed"
"The good: it's got a marginally better picture than the Sony I replaced. It is a little crisper and a little more vivid. It also can connect without using a fire stick.The bad: see above. For $450 I ended up with the same screen size and marginally better picture. Hype!The ugly: when my cable got knocked out by a storm and I was a week without internet, I discovered that I can barely watch over the air programming from my antenna, and it would record scheduled programs, but I could not watch the recordings on the DVR without having an internet connection! Go figure! The antenna is sending programming to the TV, and to the DVR, but the DVR won't talk to the TV without internet. This is insanity! Apparently, the problem is that the DVR talks to the TV through the Wi-Fi, which of course is not working I have a brilliant idea: connect the DVR to the TV with a cable! That would also save all the shenanigans you have to go through getting the DVR to talk to the Wi-Fi on the same channel as the TV. Just a suggestion from a non-engineer.If you have a very old TV that barely gets HD and color, this would be a good set, but don't replace anything less than 10 years old."
"I own three of these TVs. All in different sizes. A 55, 65 and then a 75. They all have the exact same flaws. I’ve already had to exchange two of them within a few months of purchasing. They are extremely slow and lag a ridiculous amount. The ambient setting either doesn’t come on or if you’re lucky that it does it freezes half of the time.  Don’t even get me started on the return process. It’s not as easy as just packaging and having Amazon come pick it up. They send third party pick ups company’s . You have to fill out paperwork and then figure out when they can pick it up. The whole return process is a hassle for it being an Amazon product.  I really wanted to like these as they have good features.  But what are the features worth if they only work 20% of the time?  I thought it was a fluke when I bought the first TV. But now having the other two TVs doing the exact same thing, it is obvious they are poorly made. Save your money."
While once you can finally get your video playing the quality is top notch it will take forever as the processing seems to be extremely underpowered causing constant input lag of sometimes seconds.
"Good value for the money but wifi is weak. I have not lost streaming yet, but if your wifi is weak or your demands are stronger it may show loss.  I only discovered it in settings recently after three months so check it right away if you buy it. Screen is nice and bright, MUCH better than the TLC tv I previously sent back which was barely viewable in a normal brightness  room setting. This one is good though.Otherwise it is performing quite nicely for my tv stream viewing. I don't game on my tvs. i dont' get it, my fire stick, phone are banging! I use the Eero mesh and got three, phone and other firesticks are banging on 5 bars...this tv? Only 2 bars ! :("
"The picture and display qualities are great and worth the money. However the Fire TV os is very sluggish and cumbersome to use, coming from Roku devices. I connected an existing Roku Ultra to the TV and will continue to use the TV and just ignore all the smart features.I also find the Alexa integration to be lacking, I can control the TV fairly well using the integrated Alexa, but trying to get external Alex's to control the TV completely fails."
It’s a good tv but has a so called dirty screen effect (DSE). It’s especially noticeable when you play games on it.
"Alexa keeps talking to me when I never called it. Very slow, not easy to use. It keeps flickering and glitching."
"We use Fire TV to access the majority of what we watch on our TV. We get annoyed by the operating system of the TV, so we thought buying a Fire TV would simplify our TV experience by eliminating an unnecessary operating system. The problem with this tactic is that the performance of this TV is not in the same ballpark as our Fire TV Cube 3rd Generation devices. This Fire TV lags in opening applications. This Fire TV chokes on opening apps. It freezes, streaming can lag significantly compared to our Fire TV Cube 3rd Gen devices. I have tried WiFi vs Ethernet, it makes little difference. We have mutligig internet, 6E WiFi, and the TV is right by the router; the connection is not the problem.The Fire TV Ambient Experience: We went with this series of the Fire TV line for the ambient experience, that was an error. The ambient experience is at best an afterthought. The ambient experience fails to deliver an integrated, interactive Alexa experience. There are fewer widgets than available on the Echo Show line. Interacting with the widgets on this device is not intuitive.The AI Art Generating thing is interesting, a fun ""toy"" to play with to see what Alexa comes up with. Many of the images generated look like a search engine image search that found other peoples less than stunning pictures. I don't think it's ""there"" yet, but something to kill time. You can save the images you generate and they are saved to your Amazon Photos account, you can view and share them from there. Though if you download them you might struggle to open the file type.I would return this thing is there was an easy way to do so and I wasn't in the middle of handling someone else's crisis."
"This tv looks nice and have a decent screen quality, but we have had nothing but problems for the last year since we purchased it. What set off the chain of unfortunate events was my dog jumping up on the arm of my husband’s chair and knocking the fire tv remote into his margarita. Bye bye WiFi connectivity. We attempted to use voice controls and even purchased an Amazon brand Fire Tv replacement remote, but it never connected to the tv after 1,384,490 attempts and 385 calls and chats with Amazon customer service. One rep told us to buy a new TV! Seriously?!? Eventually I had to connect it with my Ethernet cable to my modem/router so we could actually connect to the FireTV remote app. This works temporarily until the fire tv app stops working on our phones. We’ve rebooted Nd factory resettled everything multiple times with the same glitches continuing. I’ll NEVER buy this TV again and am incredibly frustrated that after having my previous trusty LG non-smart TV for nearly 20 years, I got screwed."
"Updated 12-12-22After using the TV for several weeks I decided to update this review and increase my rating to two stars.Good points:- It's a very large TV at 65 inches- I bought it on sale at around $550 which was a great price- Sharp, clear, bright pictures- Supports all of the major streaming apps, including Apple TV and Verizon Fios- Contains basic Alexa commands- Slideshow feature is nice when the TV is in standby mode- Calendar feature is usableBad points:- It's slow, very slow.  This is cabled to a gigabit port on the router.  My Echo Show 15 is WiFi and fast.- The slow speed causes video streaming to sputter or jump every now and then while watching TV- Switching between apps, connections via Alexa commands recognized by the TV is slow- No apparent change in the ""watch list"" concept mentioned in my earlier comments- If you're considering this as a streaming TV with voice commands, read all of the reviews and then decide.Previous comments:We purchased the 65 inch model to replace an existing TV and its connected devices..  Our existing setup included Version Fios TV box, Apple TV box, DVD player and Sonos bar/speakers (all WiFi).  We are using Fios giga speed Internet, wired.  The bad starts with speed; apps take several seconds to load, while watching via an app there are noticeable delays.  The TV is wired directly to the router on the gigabit port.  While Amazon Prime Video has the concept of a ""watchlist"", there doesn't seem to be one for the TV that includes ALL apps such as Netflix, Hulu, etc.  This means you don't have one place to go to see all of you series, what's next, etc.  In order to get around this we are still using the Apple TV device via an HDMI port and not the app on the TV.  Voice commands don't really work within the apps as expected.  Nor do the voice command titles match the titles of the app you see on the screen.  For example, the screen icon says ""Verizon Fios Home TV"" and the voice command expects ""Fios Home TV"".  The TV has default labels for inputs, no customization.  The ""voice"" doesn't remain in its chosen ""gender"" or selection.  We chose a male voice.  Some times it responds in a female voice.  Ambiance doesn't work the same way as it does on the Echo Show 15 screen.  On the TV you get a band of either small or medium size rectangles in a row that you can navigate to and expand fully or expand via voice commands.  We're still working on the issue of Sonos and figuring out how to use that directly instead of through the Verizon Fios TV box.  FYI - The help guides on the web site are useless; plan on just trying a lot of different things.  At this point we're keeping the TV in the hopes that Amazon will continue working on the software.  It needs a lot of improvements: speed, voice commands, additional options and most of all a master watch list at the TV home screen level that pulls from all of your apps in use."
"This TV is fine if you only want Amazon Fire TV with voice control.  If you want more, as I do, then may run into its limitations very quickly.Badness:1.  The remote is primitive.  I am old fashioned and want to have numeric keys on the remote to change channels.  Voice is insufficient, in my view.  There are only a small handful of buttons, mostly to navigate the app interfaces.2. I use a sound bar (optical).  I want to turn the TV speakers off so there is no echo.  When I turn the speakers off, I lose volume control to the sound bar.  I have used other TVs with this same soundbar and had no issues.  I cannot find a setting configuration that works.3. Instructions are not very helpful.  Most things I have had to figure out on my own through experimentation.  I use multiple streaming services and it took me quite some time to figure out how to install and use them.4.  I have Uverse.  This TV has no code that I can find to allow the Uverse remote to change channels, adjust volume, and power the TV on/off.  Very frustrating.  There is supposed to be a Uverse app that I can install, but it is operated by the Fire TV remote (without the numeric pad, and presumably,  a much more primitive guide capability).5.  There is only one HDMI that has sound output.  That might solve my soundbar problems - if I had the right soundbar.  But I prefer the optical.Goodness:1. The QLED picture quality is quite good.  This was the main reason I bought this TV and I am pleased with it.2. Software, once installed is very fast and responsive to the remote.  Back to my opening statement - if you are looking specially for Amazon Fire TV with voice control, I think you will be quite happy with this TV.3. Sound quality of built-in speakers is decent.  If you only want built-in sound, this TV is fine.Summary:This TV is clearly targeted specifically for Amazon Fire fans.  In that role, it is a good choice.  However, if you want a nice TV that happens to use Amazon Fire, then I think it is a very poor choice and I do not recommend this TV.  I believe most people fall into the latter category.*************************************************After using this TV for a bit, I am bumping down to 2 stars. The lack interactivity with  soundbars and other remotes along with very poor technical support on the web is a huge problem.  I am truly appalled at the terrible lack of forethought put into the design of this TV.  I recommend getting a real TV and then buying a Fire Stick or Cube if you really like Amazon Fire.  This TV is not worth the price."
"1/31. DO NOT WORK WITH AMAZON DEVICE RECOVERY! They will tell you they will replace your defective TV in a few days. Now I have learned the replacement TV will not arrive until July.  1/26/2023 OMG! This is SOOO horrible. AMAZON approached me about a return, promising a replacement in a few days. The first person I spoke with (Steven) seemed genuinely interested in rectifying this abysmal purchase. The people they sent to pick up the TV were horribly confused and they arrived at my house with a small SUV that had a baby carrier, no tools to disassemble the TV from its feet/stand and they wanted to transport the TV without the box putting it sideways into the SUV. Luckily it did not fit. Oh, and the employee said while he was picking up the TV, he was doing so without getting paid by his employer. WHAT??? Then the pickup company sent a dude in a pickup truck. That guy forgot his blanket and had to come back and then texted me a few days later because he didn't complete a chain of receipts. So then I get a brisk email from Amazon after almost a week saying they won't be delivering a replacement TV and I would have to buy from the site with A FULL MONTH WAIT LIST. Amazon ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Is this what you do when you offer to replace a customer's TV - Abandon them? Okay, fellow consumers - know what you are up against if you buy this TV. Chances are it won't work and you will be virtually dumped by Amazon once they have your broken TV. You will have absolutely no ability to contact anyone in a nameless department. You will be totally powerless without money you spent and without a working TV.So, so disappointed with this TV! It came defective. The screen has spots and circles on it, like watermarks below the glass. The bottom edge of the screen is brown, so the picture color is off. See the photos. Other issues: The picture resolution is just okay. I have seen better with other brands for a similar price. But I waited for Amazon's 2022 release because I wanted onboard Alexa, thinking Amazon would have the best integration. But the integration fails. Alexa gets confused. I am frequently repeating my instructions. The TV tuner frequently buffers, even with a good digital antenna. The APP frequently pushes content on channels I do not want or have and frequently I'm sorting through all that to find the content on channels I actually subscribe to. It does have pretty good sound and pretty good customizations. It took a while to figure out the captions. No flexibility with captions. Sometimes, they are on the bottom, sometimes they are on the top or middle. I tried to make the font smaller, and use a different style, but it would only allow one choice. That choice frequently covers the good part of the screen. I called Amazon to get a replacement, just in case this one happened to be a lemon, and was told that a replacement wasn't an option. Amazon offered a discount on the defective TV or I could return it. Since there is NO WAY I can lift this 65"" thing back into the box, I took the discount. I am regretting the purchase every day. I have many Alexa products and Amazon subscriptions. This one was a total bummer!"
The TV is ok and works well but the remote is less than adequate.  It is not working at less than 6 months.
"I’m very upset that the TV cost at least $300 more than its LG competitors and doesn’t have AirPlay.I bought it, overlooking and assuming it would have that feature (especially after costing me almost $1,000 after taxes) and it’s one of the most annoying things that I have to look something up on YouTube on my phone, then open the TV’s YouTube app, then go into my history to see the video I want to see on the Fire TV.Whereas on my LG TV that has AirPlay, I can easily touch the AirPlay button on my iPhone and cast it to my LG TV within seconds.If you are looking for a TV to only serve as a smart TV, it is also very slow.My LG TV wakes up much faster and is more responsive even with an advanced remote that lets point at what you want to click, whereas the Fire TV is pretty slow in waking and navigating from app to app.Very disappointed I can’t return this after missing my return date by a 2 weeks. (Only having had it for 1 month and half)With Black Friday prices this year, you can buy a higher quality picture, more responsive and more able LG TV from Costco for literally less than $600 after taxes.Plus all of the selling points were hands free Alexa, which are now offered by most competitor TVs.Huge regret for the price, couldn’t probably sell this TV, but am actually going to try.This is a direct ask/complaint to Amazon’s Product Team and Quality Assurance:Add Apple AirPlay to Amazon Fire TVs please"
"Amazon omni fire TV QLED 55in. The unit is easy to assemble and set up. I am ""upgrading"" from a TCL $300 that I bought 4 years ago. I say ""upgrading"" because it feels like I stepped down. I am not very happy with this TV. Better picture than my old tv but the software and processesing is below PAR. Besides all the issues with purchasing and delivery. It LAGS alot and has issues with launching APPs. I have to constantly restart the TV so that apps can launch. It struggles to play 4k content, even from Amazon video and the apps just crash. The TV doesn't process the volume fast enough and the lag has it going up and down catching up to the inputs for 5 to 7 seconds after pressing volume button. I've checked updates,internet speeds, cleared cache and data, connections, factory resets...no issues found on my end. Maybe I got a lemon or I expected a better quality product."
"Updated - it has only restarted once since a slew of almost daily updates has been installed. I think Dolby Vision certified displays should have some higher standards. Being QLED alone I expected a much better picture. I'm not going to bother to return it. Had I seen it in person first, I would not have purchased it.I will go ahead and write a review since I can't get support for this item for whatever reason. We tried another 65in Onmi TV a few months ago; it was an absolute lemon. We wanted to exchange it, but BestBuy would not allow it, only a return. We decided to wait and eventually got this one.The worst issue with our previous attempt was network stability. It could not keep a connection wired or on wifi, and it was not on our end. So this was the first thing I attempted to check on this unit. When I try to do a speed test, it says I need to update and there is no update.The picture is ok sometimes, but on the UI, it looks like it is scaled up from standard HD and looks horrible.The audio briefly cuts out here and there. I am feeding to a receiver using optical. I used optical on my previous TV and never had this issue. Audio also actually switches to Mute when I try to ask anything through the remote.It has restarted about 5 times in 24 hours while watching a program or trying to open an app. There is no indication these are updates or prompted otherwise.No sleep disable? I see nowhere in the settings to adjust the timeout. If we go make a plate or run the trash out 3-5 minutes maybe, it has turned off and we have to re-open our app and find the show again.The networking does not appear to be an issue as I was able to stream a 4k HDR from a local device without issue.Overall, this unit does not provide any reasonable experience and we will likely be returning it unless software fixes are promptly released."
"Honestly the TV does have a great picture on it but you absolutely have to tune it to what you like to achieve THAT image. It is fairly easy to set up using the remote control but the user interface is very slow and borderline glitchy at times. I ended up getting frustrated navigating the TV and eventually just went back to my old TV because the interface was so slow. I have since learned that after the TV has run for a like 5 minutes it becomes more responsive to inputs made with the remote. TV is rather light for the size and easy to move around. Will be great for some, just not for me, I love a quality TV experience and this did not deliver that."
"The idea of built in FireTV sounds great, but the execution is only fair.  Picture quality is decent but clearly not exceptional.  Integrated FireTV control is definitely sluggish compared to current generation Fire Stick devices and operation of basic TV functions can be kludgy. Be mindful of your application before selecting one of these sets"
"So here’s the thing. At the price point it does what it is asked to do but I hate this TV. Let me explain. The dark colors in the picture (think deep greys and blacks) look “washed out”. Honestly it’s super disappointing because this QLED was supposed to have “wonderful and brilliant colors”. Well if it’s something that is super bright then I agree. Anything dark(ish) does not even remotely resemble the correct color. Secondly, it takes forever to boot up, then it takes you to the Amazon hub….. why would it not just go to the device I turned on that’s connected to the device!!! (Think cable TV or Xbox here). For anyone that’s says, “there is a setting for that”, well, you’re wrong because it doesn’t work correctly when you have multiple devices hooked up. Also when you finally do convince the TV to switch to the hdmi you want, it often goes back to the hub again!! Infuriating. I wish I never bought this TV."
"Image quality is good. Connections/ports are abundant and diverse (3.5mm audio out is used in my setup) apps opening and closing can be sluggish. Moving quickly through the UI can be frustrating when it goes past where you intend because of the lag. Ambient experience is lame, if I hit the power button on the remote then I want the TV off and not to go into picture frame mode. Advertisement and suggested content being higher up than your recent apps is BS. Maybe a different UI would make it worthwhile."
"The picture and UI look great but there's just way too many issues for the price point. I'm returning this after 3 months because the extremely laggy UI, it randomly turns on, the sound bar sporadically disconnects , Alexa only works half the time (not to mention when TV dialogue says ""Alex"" it turns on"".It could be a nice TV but its too annoying to deal with and for $600 you can get something way more reliable and future proof."
"Like the picture. Sometimes when you press a button on the remote, the TV takes up 23 seconds (yes I timed it) to respond. Even the volume up or down button press will be 8 to 11 seconds to actually responf to a remote press. Look at the 1 and 2 star reviews, there seem to be many people with this problem. I was going to get the 75 inch version, but after my experience and reading many others, I will not be getting a fire TV again. The TV worked great for the first 6-8 months and now it is a waiting game opening apps, changing channnels, and controling the volume. And a dozen or so factory resets (and unplugging the TV is not a solution."
Very nice tv picture. One of the worst streaming devices I’ve ever used. Very slow and laggy user interface. Not really sure why but Amazon devices have the worst application for viewing Amazon content. Every time I use it it makes me want to go back to an Apple TV because the Amazon experience is so much better there than on Fire devices.
"What I'm supposed to do with a barcode sticker on tv and a note message telling me to be careful when moving screen protector to avoid damaging screen,,but what about barcode sticker on screen"
"The picture on this is absolutely great but I had to give it 3 stars because the software/technology in this tv is awful. It lags, doesn’t work, and honestly we bought a Roku stick to use in place of the software. We upgraded our WiFi and log off WiFi on all devices just so the tv doesn’t suck so bad when we watch it. I wish I would’ve just bought a Roku tv to begin with. If we didn’t get it a year and a half ago I’d get a different tv."
"Clear, bright picture, however ui can be a bit sluggish. I’m really starting to hate integrated ecosystems within the tv. It seems like they never put enough ram/memory or processing power."
"I purchased this TV because it’s loaded with great features. However, it never occurred to me that such a feature-rich TV would not have a Gigabit Ethernet port. In this day and age, when most programming is streamed, in my opinion, it’s a major oversight to have only a 10/100 Ethernet port. Although this TV is wired directly to my router, and my Internet connection is in the 300-350MB range, it’s constantly buffering. My other TV’s that are not directly wired to my router, and must therefore rely on wi-fi, actually have less buffering. In fact, I now notice that all Amazon TV’s apparently only list the port as being “Ethernet”, without specifically stating the rate of the Ethernet ports. I consider this to be misleading and makes me not want to purchase another Amazon TV."
"Why you should buy this TV:- Good deal for the price.- Good picture quality.- Better than expected sound quality for a TV. (You won't confuse it for a decent sound bar though).- Concept of full Fire TV and Alexa integration sounds awesome.Why you (really) shouldn't buy this TV:- Fire TV OS is painfully slow on this TV. Moving between navigation menus (even the Fire TV settings app) is frustrating. Application load slowly, and Alexa sometimes waits until the 5th time you call its name before responding. It's so slow that while watching videos, the TV sometimes drop frames just to catch up.Conclusion: The TV is solid in so many areas, but the sluggish processing capabilities is just a deal-breaker. I'm going to return this unit and buy a TV and a Fire Cube 3 (which is VERY fast itself). It's a much better long-term investment.UPDATE (1-week later): A Fire TV OS upgrade was available, so I decided to update the TV while I still had it. It's certainly not as fast as the Fire TV Cube, but the performance is more reasonable now and we'll likely be keeping it.UPDATE (3-weeks later): Although the update did help, the TV often slows down as it remains on (could be buggy software) and it becomes unbearable. I plugged-in a Fire Cube 3 to the TV and compared the performance back-to-back, and it's almost a joke how slow the TV runs compared to the Cube.Please do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. I would have recommended pairing this with a Fire Cube 3, but so far they do not seem to play well together. Had the performance been at least decent, it would have been a keeper."
"I purchased this as an upgrade to an older Sanyo TV, however I soon discovered it is a stand alone system which automatically boots to the FireTV interface no matter if you want to go to a menu where you can choose AppleTV, Netflix, AcornTV, and similar streaming options.  It seems to get very confused if say you want to boot to your BluRay player from the menu on your Control4 screen the TV gets very confused as to which hdmi output you want to go to since it always defaults to FireTV menu when first turns on.  I spent a lot of money on local AV support labor trying to make my old devices integrate seamlessly with this TV.  I then opted to download Netflix, Acorn, Prime Apps to the FireTV menu but found out they were much slower to come up and they buffered constantly due to the slow network interface to my router even using an ethernet cable.  I finally gave up and bought a Samsung TV and now everything works as expected with no issues.  My recomendation is if you like FireTV then get the FireTV 4k Stick and use it in a spare hdmi port on your existing tv rather than this TV. Twice my wife was watching Jeopardy and the built in Alexa came on and started to answer the questions, I am not kidding!"
"This is my 3rd Amazon integrated Fire TV and have loved all of them. I had been using Fire TV sticks prior to buying the TVs so it made sense for me to have my usual TV watching interface integrated directly into the entire TV and being able to switch inputs and do everything all from the main TV OS and Fire TV remote.Prior to this one, I had a Toshiba/Fire TV that is still working great but because it was a few years old, the software began to feel slow. I figured I could upgrade TV sizes and the hardware would be updated and be much faster, however the experience is equally as slow as my several year old Toshiba version of this TV -- not only that but with the direct Alexa integration it feels even slower than my old Toshiba version. I want to love this TV but it really is just too slow. The software and interface is exactly what I want in my TV, but launching and switching apps take forever.Additionally, not a fan of the Alexa integration. I have Alexa enabled devices in pretty much every room of the house, and when the TV overhears me it takes up nearly 50% of the on screen real estate with the response -- not what I really want. I had to change the wake word so I could talk to my TV separately than the echo show in the room for when I want to use the voice instructions specifically for the TV.Overall, almost great. Disappointed in the processing power for the software."
"Have had this tv for just over a year. Nice picture and sound.Problem came when we switched from cable to HULU for network viewing.The HULU app frequently glitches (freezes; can't return to menu), so tv must be unplugged and restarted.I'm not tech-savvy so it may be HULU (have tried deleting and reinstalling).Aside from that, it's an ok tv at a decent price."
"This television is a nice size.  The price was nice.  Iam even happy with the picture.  Major fail: It will take forever to respond to requests.  I will hit a button on the remote and sit there waiting for near 10 seconds before it reacts.  I even hard wired the TV to my router, and picture will periodically freeze.  I don't have these problems over any of my other equipment, or phones.  It will return to the home menu (requested) and still be playing the sound to the show I just exited.  Was going to use the TV as the living room Alexa.  It does not behave as well as our Alexa speaker.  I re-hooked up the Alexa speaker in the living room for functionality.  If it wasn't for the sluggishness, pausing, performance of this TV.  It would easily be a five star TV.  It's seems like they decided to make a good set then when it came time to add the ""smart"", they played it dumb"
"I bought this tv, ""55""  inch, last July during prime days. I have a few streaming services I use but I primarily watch TV with my antenna. I also have an older Samsung in my great grand kids playroom that I bought in 2011. I started noticing problems when I was watching DWS on Hulu. The picture was going blurry and then recovered. i watched it on the Samsung and it did not happen on that tv. Then about a month ago I noticed I could not keep the closed caption on the tv. Every time I changed the channel, went to a streaming app or turned the tv off the closed caption disappeared. I have also been trying to adjust the cc since I got the TV. I wanted it smaller, without a background and at the bottom of the TV. I was never able to adjust it no matter how much I messed with it/ it always just did what it wanted to, which was be gigantic and block everyone's face on the TV. It also started randomly shutting off. It also would continue talking on the previous channel when I changed channels. Alexa quit taking commands when I was watching with my antenna. I would ask her to rewind, something I have been doing since I got the TV, and  nothing happened.I bought the warranty so I was not worried. I no longer wanted the TV and did not want a replacement for a TV that obviously had problems working properly with antenna TV. I contacted Amazon and after 3 hours of being transferred all around, I was given 2 choices, I could return the TV and get the same one or I could return the TV to Amazon and be charged a $95.00 restocking fee. I had already paid $70 extra for a warranty. I have been an Amazon customer since 2004, so 20 years. Most of that time I have been a Prime customer also. I did not even ask for my money back. i asked for a credit so I could choose a different TV. I am disappointed both in the TV and the fact that a multi billion dollar company wants a $95 restocking fee from a 20 year old customer that bought a warranty."
"I hate that we went with this brand. It's slow to load anything when you initially turn it on. And, if you're watching a show and pause it for more than 5 minutes the TV Exits out of the app and you have to go through the whole process to get back to the show. I've searched the settings and have not found a way to fix this. Any input would be appreciated.Edited to add we have now had this TV for almost a year and it is by far the worst Amazon purchase we have made. I highly regret buying it and wish I could get my money back."
"*** edit update***This continues to be the worst experience ever! I had the tv replaced. Not after it being a dramatic experience all on its own. Customer service basically wanted me to do a factory reset more times than I care to count. And did not want to resolve (my return window was nearing) they promised to keep the ticket open if the factory reset didn’t work. It didn’t, all it caused me to do was have to go through and reset my streaming login info. So, guess what?! They closed the ticket and tried to refuse a replacement. Since apparently I am the only one who has ever had this issue (guess they do not read their own reviews, I probably wouldn’t either it might hurt my feelings). Any way, after they reviewed my review below they reached out to me. But, I had to return their attempt within 24 hrs. When I finally got the replacement and sent off the first one (I kid you not) they charged me AGAIN for the tv. So, I had to deal with that issue. In fact this experience has been so ridiculous I almost don’t believe it myself. Seriously, save yourself from any frustration and go to your local big box store, I promise you can get just as good of a deal and you’ll be able to enjoy your purchase instead of regret it. And if you’re thinking that I should have just returned it and went elsewhere, you’re 100% right.***edit update***The performance is absolutely horrible! Customer service is even worse than the tv performance. Just to put things into perspective. We have only loaded a couple of apps outside of what has been preloaded. And I say a couple because I believe Netflix was preloaded. So basically with the addition of Disney+ we have not bogged down this device with much else. The AI constantly says “this feature is not available in a child profile” when we are not in a child profile. And the glitching and buffering is horrendous, it is to a point that it completely ruins viewer experience. I really wanted this to work… I should have heeded the other “poor performance ratings”. I have gone through numerous attempts resetting the device. Including factory resets (this was the only option that is given by customer support to solve problems). The only event that I can connect it to is if you allow it to go into the “Ambient Experience”, seems to make the glitching worse. I’ve endured the biggest pain EVER having it replaced. So, now you know. I am a person who has had TWO of these TVs and the experience has been the same. Save yourself the headache do a little more research get something in a local store, it will not be that difficult to find a better performance at a similar price point… you’ll thank me, or maybe not. But, I’m all seriousness save yourself the trouble."
"It always starts with an ad menu.  It frequently looses your choices or if does, it does not remember where you left off.  When you’re watching and you pause you have very little time to get back before going back to main menu.  Not even enough time to go to the bathroom.  The sound is not good.  If you like to add back lighting to your unit you will have to turn the color on every time or the colors will flash.  I was very dissatisfied with this purchase.  Rethink this choice.  No updates have helped."
"Picture is pretty darn good for the price. I bought because it was such a good deal. I have a 43” fire tv that i have been overall happy with, despite learning with that TV that amazon’s UI is relatively slow and klunky. But this 55” omni qled processing and interface speed is absolutely appalling. Its completely unacceptable for amazon to have this product for sale. Switching between PROFILES sometimes takes 10 seconds, sometimes takes 60 seconds. Opening up apps, same thing.  I have hdmiarc hooked up to a soundbar and increasing volume from instant of button press to actual volume change is 5 seconds. It frequently, not every time but often, has 1-2 second buffering every 10 minutes while streaming through any of the apps, netflix, prime video, appletv plus, etc. I would not recommend until amazon fixes the processing speed issue. Very disappointed."
"We've had the tv a little over a year. We only use a few apps on it, but over time it gets slower and slower. Sometimes restarting the TV helps (you have to tell it to restart, because by default turning it off puts it to sleep).I'm used to devices like fire tv, roku, chromecast getting slow over time, but the whole tv is controlled by this UI: switching inputs, changing the volume, etc. It's really frustrating when i want to turn the volume down, and its a good 15-20 seconds after I start pushing the volume down button that it registers and changes the volume, and at that point I've pressed it so many times that when it catches up the volume is at zero and i have to wait for it to catch up before I can turn it back up."
"Update.  I really tried to be as positive as I could be about this and pointed out the Alexa features that work well in my original 3 star review, but after a few more weeks of battling (yes I'm battling a TV for enjoyment) this thing, it isn't worth the money...regular price or on sale.  I am dropping this to 1 star from 3 as this shouldn't be marketed as a smart TV. Gomer Pyle is smarter than this TV. I got tired of all of the updates. This thing still isn't a month old and I can't count the updates that have been needed almost every other day. I've now unplugged this and it is sitting next to a tv that is about 9 years old that is a bazillion times better in picture quality, network connectivity and anything that comes remotely close to being expected from a smart TV. The Alexa features are great as I put in my original review, but it has caused enough frustration and such a poor viewing experience that it is now officially not even plugged in and here I am editing a review...The Alexa features are great, as they should be. Added to whole home audio and the arc port has no delay to my surround sound, and I can pop one of the cameras around my house on the screen with ease.  The sound on the TV is fine, but I don't have a TV in the house that I depend on internal speakers.Buutttt...Here is why people have a TV.  To watch it.  Picture isn't top notch...which for 800 bucks it isn't fair to compare to a LG, Sony, Samsung etc...that is more expensive, but I have 1st gen Sharp Roku 4k TV on my porch connected via WiFi that looks better. The panel type has a lot to do with that, but mine is set up in my bedroom and there will be no watching it from an indirect angle, so it is bearable. I still went into this thinking a 4k QLED.. sweet...now I'm more lke...hrmm. I have a fire TV stick connected to a Samsung QLED in the mancave and the picture is amazing, so I know it's not the fire TV guts. Out of 6 tvs in my home, including the aforementioned Roku and an old Panasonic 1080p plasma tv I keep around for 3D...this has the poorest picture...and it's not close.  It's like backtracking to a DVD after living with Blu-ray.I'm keeping it as I do use the Alexa features, and that is what I primarily bought this for, and I don't wanna go through the hassle if returning it. All of the extras are nice and satisfy what I wanted it for, but I do feel this should be marketed as a 65 inch Echo Show with Fire TV included...which in that case I probably wouldn't have spent 800 bucks on it.If you want a smart display with Alexa features get this thing.If you want a centerpiece for a theater setup...I can't suggest it."
"Update august 2024. After much effort i can attest this tv/streaming device rolled in one cannot pass dolby true hd sigals. The fire tv software and hardware must be less advanced than what is coming in the newest generation fire cubes, which do pass dolby true hd.  I would recommend buying another brand tv and a fire cube or fire stick max that way your tv won't become obsolete as new formats come out that your streaming device must be able to support.There are many reviews of the Fire TV OLED. Most reviews conclude that the picture quality is not as good as TVs costing 100 to 200 less and lead you in the direction to buy the less expensive TV and add a fire cube. I have 2 Fire Cube 2nd generations at home and it's true they almost can do everything that the Fire TV with built-in Alexa can do and the Fire Cube has a lot more storage but there are 2 advantages the Fire TV with built-in Alexa has. The Fire TV has ambient experience I Like this feature check it out it's pretty cool. Second, a Fire TV can scan your local channels off an antenna connected to the Fire TV antenna input and automatically incorporate these antenna channels seamlessly into the fire tv live TV guide. Other fire devices cannot scan local channels off and the antenna connected to a TV. To bring antenna channels into the fire tv guide of a non-fire tv using a fire tv device you need another device such as a airtv, and you must connect that device to sling and then syc sling into your live TV guide. Extra hardware to buy and more set up time and a sling account. Amazon used to have the fire recast devices which i own which are great for integrating antenna channels but Amazon discontinued their fire recast device leaving you to find other devices and workarounds if you are a cable cutter looking for live local TV. So in summary to truly turn a TV into something similar to a Fire TV you would need a Fire cube, Air TV, and sling account."
"I've had this TV for 11 months. The picture quality is really nice, but the TV is so slow and annoying to use that I'm considering putting my 10 year old tv back up in place of this one.The voice command features don't work very often. The browsing function with the remote is clunky and slow, so we were better off using a plug in Chromecast on our older TV. The link between the ios app and the TV gets disconnected at least once per week, so I have to set it up over and over. Lastly, the TV turns itself on constantly (even right after turning it off) so it's using electricity all day long -- I've reconfigured the settings several times to stop the TV from doing this, but it does it anyway. At this point, I'm unplugging the whole thing before bed and before I start work so it's not idling on the home screen 24/7.Overall, I'm definitely disappointed and doubt I'll buy an Amazon TV again in the future."
"Amazon cheaps out on the processors and as a result you have an interface that is laggy and frustrating at times.  The corner cutting doesn’t end there: I specifically hardwired the television using cat6 cable And could not understand why my television was still buffering well being hardwired to a gigabit fiber, Internet connection. My ISP came out and tested the ethernet port on the TV and found that only two of the six wires are active on the televisions network, interface card. When unplugging and switching to Wi-Fi, the speed quadrupled why even bother putting in an ethernet port on the TV at that point? Their included “home theater control “ lacks aforethought for more advanced systems.  The picture is just OK. Their decision to only offer a locatable remote as an upgrade is offensive As this is supposedly one of their flagship models.If you’re looking for a budget TV with bang for your buck expectations aren’t very high, this is a decent choice. If you’re looking for a flagship television Anchoring your main home, theater set up, invest in something else"
"I've had this TV for about two months and I have been trying different ways to maximize its performance, but I am struggling.  The main reason I bought it was because it was supposed to integrate with other echo devices for surround sound, but this feature is VERY buggy.  I purchased two Echo's with the TV and paired them as a home theater setup.  The sound is good when it works, but for the first month this feature would fail every time the TV was turned off.  Now Imagine how I felt every time my wife called or texted from home during the day stating that there was no sound on the TV.  And then she would complain about the money I spent on a crappy TV and speakers whose sound doesn't work... This isn't my idea of a good time.  All of a sudden though, this setup is working better and I can't explain how.  It no longer disconnects when the TV is turned off.We recently subscribed to YouTubeTV again to watch NFL games but it is almost unwatchable.  There is lag and the menu is unbearably slow.  I never had this issue on my old TV with a Firestick, so I don't blame YTTV.  I'm honestly considering buying a FireTV stick to plug into this FireTV to see if it will work faster. I am wondering if the wireless card in this thing is subpar compared to the ones in FireSticks.Picture quality is great from straight on, but degrades at an angle so take this into serious account if you're purchasing this for a space where you want to watch it from a wide angle.  Sorry, but there's no way of getting around this without spending a lot more money on a TV.* I am using a Pro remote that I purchased separately.  I hope this isn't a factor in any of the problems that I have had, but I have not yet troubleshooted the remote.UPDATE: Over a year later we switched from YouTubeTV to Hulu but still get lags with live TV from time to time.  Luckily I’ve been able to download an app to help turn off background programs.  This seems to help when the TV slows down.  It honestly just feels like they settled for half as much RAM as think needed to operate normally."
Nice to have Alexa onboard but needs an update to work with nearby Echo units.  Since we use a seperate amplifier and echos in pair they do not work nicely .  The TV constantly is trying to control the commands and when off responds with the onboard speaker which is off.  The only fix is to switch off the microphone on the TV and that defeats having it...lol...not really.Aside from all that the TV is nice.  QLED is clear and has superb color with strong contrast.
"I really wanted to like this TV. We were using a Firestick Max with a Vizio UHD which was at its end of life.But, I mistakenly ordered a 55"" whereas the Vizio was a 50"". We may have kept the Fire TV but it stood much too high for the setting - so back it goes. My error.That said, while it has a lot to offer, jiggling with the picture settings was, well, too frequent. Often, images were muddy and not crisp (the Vizio + Firestick never had that problem). I should note that the Vizio had a 120 Hz refresh rate vs 60. I am not a gamer at all but I suspect the higher refresh rate contributed to the better picture quality for some programs.Additionally, for some mysterious reason, Prime, Netflix, and other streaming trailers would not play - audio but black screen. I checked all the settings but couldn't get it resolved. Had we kept the unit, I'm sure Amazon service would have responded.Back it goes, replaced by an LG 50"" QNED plus a 2nd Gen Firestick Max."
"Let's start with the pros: Good picture, lightweight, affordable. TV guide and built in rewind feature for live TV is nice.The cons are real and problematic: Operating system is very slow and clunky; there is no single button or easy way to change inputs (requires navigating multiple steps with remote or using Alexa); Alexa has a tendency to not work, thus forcing you to use the remote (which is easy to lose because of its compact size). CEC functionality is buggy and frequently results in random audio muting when switching inputs.Need a cheap TV? Sure, it works. Would I buy it again? Probably should have stuck with my old trusty 1080p non-4k TV."
"I replaced my TV, fire cube and Bluetooth speakers with anticipation of a simplified solution. I got the Fire TV and Alexa Studio speaker pair. The tv has chronic connection issues for wifi and the speakers. I ended up having to get a wired connection to the TV for internet.  The Studio speakers drop out from time to time requiring a power cycle to be performed on the TV."
"The good news: the picture rocks! ¶ WHEN (as in sometimes) the controller turns our Samsung soundbar off, it usually toggles the soundbar on/off repeatedly until I pull the batteries in the controller. ¶ Apps are slow to load (see next paragraph). ¶ After a year-and-four months of rebooting this TV to open Paramount+ a second time, we bought a competing streaming HDMI device (begins with ""R"") last week and plugged it into HDMI1 on the Omni. With the new HDMI device, we've learned apps CAN load quickly (Hulu, Paramount, Netflix, YouTube). Paramount+ can be loaded multiple times a day without rebooting. ¶ Paramount+ blames Fire TV and Amazon blames Paramount, so there's no solution. ¶ My recommendation is: ""Omni"" is short for ""Ominous."" buy something else."
"Nice TV except the native app doesn’t function properly when watching 4k live sports. Note this is the second TV with same issue, ordered this one as a replacement.Spent hours with each TV “troubleshooting” with tech support via chat. It is the TV - Samsung upstairs works fine with 4k.. Also plugging in fire stick into this one and voila I can watch live sports in 4k  - however why should I have 2 remotes, switching inputs, and not to mention have to figure out the soundbar.Very frustrating.  Especially as I discarded the foam protection from the box before realizing issue with first TV, not going to risk a voided return because not packaged in original packing. Ugh."
"I am a Roku user but since I wanted a 50"" QLED, Amazon Fire TV was my choice since there weren't any Roku TVs.  The transition from Roku to Fire was ok, but Roku is far simpler and less bells and whistles.  The picture quality is good and the setup was smooth. The user interface I can live with, but the Fire TV disappoints in that the sound jumped a bit when navigating different streaming apps but I unplugged and reset and every now and then sound still jumps.  Also, sometimes the picture blacks out when switching to different apps.  All in all, not as smooth as the prior LG TV I had with Roku.  I'll give this a chance, but not a great first impression."
"While the picture quality and features of this TV are great for the price point, the user interface is painfully slow.  Certain apps do not function properly because of how slow it is.  We ended up getting a separate Fire Stick to plug into an HDMI port rather than using the built-in FireTV interface because of how slow it is."
"So far it's a pretty good TV. It probably needs some tweaking to get the colors right.  The antenna setup got me more OTA channels than my previous TV, using the same antenna.When paired with your Alexa, it acknowledges every command to your device with an annoying BLOOP sound, even things unrelated to the TV. Customer support informed me there is currently no way to turn this sound off other than by unpairing the device.  I've requested they give feedback to the developers in hopes of offering this option. I don't make very much use of the Alexa functionality in the TV, so I might unpair them, since I can still use the remote voice control for the Alexa functionality.I also bought a new Lenovo laptop from Amazon that I hoped to pair wirelessly with the TV. So far the laptop recognizes the TV but can't complete the pairing. I've not yet determined if this is a Lenovo issue or a problem on the part of the TV. For now, I bought a long HDMI cable, but I'm hoping to resolve this issue.I'll update this review after some time getting through all the functions.  It may go up to four stars. Half a star was deducted for the Alexa issue."
Listen. I’m definitely all in with the Amazon ecosystem. It’s just that. Things that work. Work. Things that don’t. Really don’t. And it’s noticeable.For example - the latency due to all the bloatware is incredible.  Setting up my soundbar with HDMI ARC - worked great the first day and now every time we change the volume we have to mute and unmute the sound to actually hear anything.  At this point we primarily use it as a display for the Xbox. Oh. But you can’t change the input without signing in - half the time.The primary reason I wanted to get an Amazon specific appliance is because it integrated with an Alexa kids account so we could have tighter and easier integration with the settings with the other fire devices.I honestly think I’ll just get a more brand name TV next time and deal with the parental controls a different way.
"To start, the tv and picture are beautiful. I paired the tv with two echo studios for surround sound, when it works it’s great but that’s very hit or miss. The tv is very laggy and I swear has a new update almost every day. You can tell when it has an update because it will barely function until you download and install the update. It cannot keep a stable connection to the echo studios requiring me to switch to the tv speakers. This is very frustrating when friends are over to watch a movie. Overall, I would not recommend this tv at all. 2 stars for the picture quality and when it does work, it’s great."
"**UPDATE**This TV has only gotten worse since my original review.  It’s processor is so terribly slow there are apps that won’t work because the TV simply can’t keep up.  I’ve tried everything - restart, delete apps I’m not using, ensured updates are current, force close apps I’m not using  My advice - DO NOT BUY, spend a bit more and get a TV that does the job.  This set is horrible, how Amazon puts the firetv label on it is beyond me.  If I could give it 0 stars I would.I wanted to love this tv, for a lot of reasons.Pros:- the picture is very good, great detail and color, it’s nice to watch- I use a soundbar, but the built in sound system is good, not great.  It does the jobCons:- this tv’s processor and interface is PAINFULLY slow!!  It makes apps seem almost unusable, the lag time and load times are flat out unacceptable.  There are streaming apps I love to use, but I don’t use them from the tv itself.  To make live streaming tv watchable, I have to use my PS5 as the streaming source, because the tv is so horribly slow it can’t keep up with the apps.  Everything takes an unacceptable amount of time to load/open the app, and it only gets worse from there.- Again, I wanted to love this tv, but given the opportunity to buy it again, or spend twice as much for a tv that works as it should, I’d forego this tv and spend the money needed to have a set that works as it should.BLUF: You get what you pay for, and this tv is no exception. It’s cheap for a reason"
"This was the third time I've tried to buy a TV on Amazon. The first one was a different one that was damaged at the bottom and had a dead pixel. So I decided that I'll get the fire tv because surely amazon would care more about their products. When I got the TV it looked perfect, however, after all the updates and setting up my accounts I noticed the screen (first picture) has a big shadow on it. So after putting everything thing back and deleting all of my info from the tv I asked for an exchange. Now this was the last attempt I was gonna do before giving up entirely. So you could imagine my surprise when I got my replacement and saw that everything was in perfect condition (second picture). It's a little slow like some reviews have said which I didn't mind cause Im probably gonna use it more for console gaming then watching TV. They have a crazy amount of apps you can download which is great cause I didn't think I would be able to find Dropout on there. Anyway, I'm happy with my tv so far. I'll come back if there is any updates."
Very slow user interface.  Controlling the volume is also very whacky. Just not smooth. Annoying delay on everything. Picture quality is fine. I ended up not using the built-in interface and hooked up a roku
"So, couple glaring issues with this TV that caused me to return it right away. I'm a huge AV guy that typically goes for high end stuff but wanted to try this Amazon TV because of the alexa integration and artwork options. Unfortunately, this TV went back within a day the problems were so severe. The TV looks nice enough but it is way, way to fat (thick) towards the bottom so it sticks out further from the wall than the 6 year old TV it replaced.  Secondly, they use a VA panel, not IPS which means unless you are dead center, the picture quality severely drops off. Walk a few steps left or right and it becomes unbearable. Definitely not good for big rooms or watching from different seating areas.  This isn't an amazon specific problem, all tvs that use that type of panel have that issue. The other deal breaker for me was the incredibly poor performance when watching football. It's obviously a 60hz panel and it has some of the worst motion handling I've ever seen. My 3 year olds cheap off brand does better. It's really quite awful. Now, if you're sitting dead center and don't watch a lot of sports this might work for you. It doesn't get near bright enough to really take advantage of HDR but it's not the worst I've seen. Audio output is flawless to a soundbar. Set up was easy enough but it's challenging figuring out how to adjust the picture. You have to do it individually for inputs and apps... All and all I would not recommend this TV. Every article I found says it's basically the same as another brands ""5 series"" TV (search and you'll know) which isn't awful but you can get that TV for a few hundred bucks less. Really wanted to like this but it's definitely a lower to mid grade TV.  You don't have to be a TV guy to spot these problems, they are that obvious.*update-as mentioned in other reviews, the customer service and return process is the worst I've ever seen. You literally have to deal with 10 different people and a third party shipping company to get it picked up."
"This is one of those instances where 'you get what you pay for'.  It's a nice-looking TV and the size is just right for a small living room - perfect for the price. However, the communication between the remote and the unit's response time is outrageous and frustrating.  It is so slow!  I use Hulu for my live stream, and for some reason, on this TV, it constantly either freezes or crashes altogether.  The other streaming platforms are not as bad but will also freeze from time to time.  For simple things like turning the TV down, you'll press the remote controls and wait to see the response on the TV.  That's crazy! This is my main complaint with this TV.  I do not have this issue when using the Firestick.  I'm quite disappointed.  I chose to buy this TV based on my experience with the Firestick, which was amazing!"
"I was very excited when I first got this TV set up, and then all the issues started.The Bad1. Out of the box the TV had spots along the bottom that were ""splotchy"" This was mostly noticeable on any video that showed solid grey or during OS navigation.2. The FireTV OS is very laggy and slow. Again, maybe this is personal preference but it seems the hardware in this TV to run the software is very underpowered. I have a $300 4K Roku TV in another room that is buttery smooth compared to this TV's operation.3. A few weeks into owning it, it developed a rogue pixel, and I say rogue instead of dead because instead of it just being a dead, black pixel, it's stuck on displaying red, which surprisingly is very noticeable.4. The local array dimming feature glitches sometimes. Sometimes, you can see this weird backlight issue where on a mixture of light/dark parts of the video, the backlights in that spot of the video are constantly enabling and disabling resulting in this weird moving lighting effect on that part of the display. It's hard to explain. Maybe a software update will fix this.5. If you have Dolby Vision enabled, the TV constantly goes black for a second or two while switching the picture mode to Dolby Vision while switching between content that is/isn't Dolby Vision compatible.6. The FireTV OS is clearly not optimized for a 4K resolution. When you're using the FireTV interface, it looks like a 1080P interface just scaled up terribly to 4K. The OS isn't visually crisp and just makes the display look low quality. This could also be fixed with a software update.The good:1. Screen issues aside, blacks are black, colors or vibrant and contrast levels are great. The adaptive brightness in Dolby IQ works great for brightly lit rooms.2. If you're in the Alexa Ecosystem, it works very well.3. This TV is actually on the lighter end of most 65"" TVs sitting at the lower end of 40LB where as most other 4K TV's I've owned are closed to 50LB."
"I purchased this tv in December 2022.  Since then, I have had to replace the batteries in the remote twice.  Only new batteries were used so it should not have happened even once.  Also since my purchase I have had to do a factory reset. The reason for this was because although all functions seemed to work, the tv would not play any video or movie on any app.  It would only show a bright green screen and play the sound. The following are other problems I have with this TV.  1.)  When I exit from a video or a movie it will continue to play the sound from what I was watching, even with the tv turned off.   2.) Sometimes when I am in an app and I press the power button, the tv will not turn off. Even with a long hold.  I will have to press the home button and wait a couple of minutes, then turn off the tv.    3.)The voice function only works half the time. Sometimes when I use it to search something, it will do nothing.  Then 10 minutes later, after I have manually typed in what I wanted and started it, it will kick me out and take me back to the search page because it had just caught up with my voice demand.    4.) IT IS SO SLOW TO DO ANYTHING. This includes running some apps and getting videos to play.   5.) This one is the most annoying of all!!  If I pause a movie to do something, the tv automatically shuts off after 5 minutes. Thats right ONLY FIVE MINUTES!!!!  Then I have to turn the tv back on and get back in the app I was in and find what I was watching.  I do have the setting that says it will open back up to where I left off but it does not.  It also does not have a way to stop it from shutting off after 5 minutes.  It does have a sleep timer setting but who needs that when it will shut off anyway.   These problems are not due to my internet connection.  I do not have any issues with any other tv I own.  This is the worst purchase I have ever made.  I often choose to just go to my room and watch tv because I cant stand the thought of dealing with this tv.  And yes, I could have returned it but tell me, who keeps that big ass box to send it back in?  I have a tiny place and could not keep a box bigger than my living room laying around."
I bought this TV specifically for the Ambient Experience and there is no accompanying sound. I could have stuck with a screensaver!
The picture quality is good. End of positives. The OS is garbage. Moving through the menus is so slow trying to react to remote button inputs. But by far the worst thing is it's eARC functions for surround systems. Just trying to change the volume makes the screen go black for a few seconds and make the media either stop and buffer or continue playing in silence and with a black screen. One of my apps it just skips to the end or beginning of whatever media I'm watching. These things happen 99% of the time I try to adjust the volume. So unbelievably frustrating.
"I bought this TV back in June of 2023.  It's not December 2023.  I have to say I'm pretty disappointed with the product.  The screen is pretty and bright, the interface is a little odd (especially with the ads) and takes some getting used to.  However, my biggest problem is how slow/responsive the remote to TV is.For instance, I'm watching a show on Netflix.  I get it connected, we are in the middle of the show and I get a call on my phone.  I pick up the remote and I press pause.  It takes almost 15 seconds before the show charges.  Often, I push it a few times because I'm not sure if the remote was awake and saw my button press, so then they all catch up and it pauses, unpauses, pauses, unpauses, etc.  It drives me crazy.I'm going to use an external Roku just to avoid these problems, but of course that means my integration will suffer.  I won't have Alexa as easily but overall it'll be a better experience (I hope)."
Do not buy this TV it is a waste of money and an aggravating piece of technology this is the worst TV I have ever had do you want a TV that's going to shut your music off every 15 minutes because their ambient experience decides that it's going to shut the TV off on top of that this is the most watered-down Alexa software I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with anytime I look anything up it's showing me TV shows instead of what I'm actually searching for so I will search how many ounces in a gallon and it will decide that it's going to look for a TV show called ounces in a gallon I will not buy another one of these TVs I am looking forward to it failing so I could buy a new TV that's pretty sad I got to wait for my TV to die to buy a new one because your technology is garbage I'm having nothing but problems all I want to do is listen to music without every 15 minutes of it shutting my TV off I want to be able to search things up with no problem I want my Alexa device back this is in my living room so now the Alexa device I would use for normal stuff is taken over by this piece of garbage so instead of getting the information you wish you get the information that this stupid TV decides and also when you request things it's nowhere near what you actually ask for it's incredibly slow a piece of garbage and at its price doesn't even have the graphical capability to keep up with nowadays consoles only running 4K at 30 frames a second this is garbage this is like scraping the muck at the bottom of the dumpster garbage do not buy it I'm warning you now this is not a fun experience I just want to break it every day
"So my complaints about this TV are purely related to Alexa. She listens to what you’re watching and sometimes without her name being said well we react to what the character saying on whatever show you’re watching. She also randomly will shut your TV off. Oh also, there’s a I don’t know if it’s a setting or what but when it goes into screen saver mode, you can’t directly go back to your show. If you hit the back button, it takes you back to the home button half the time, so then you have to re-find whatever you were watching and go back to it. It’s very frustrating and the last thing if you hit the power button to turn it off, it doesn’t usually turn it off. It says it to screen saver mode you have to turn it off twice for it to actually turn off .This TV made me never once another Alexa TV. As for the TV itself the quality is nice it’s beautifully bright and big sound is decent. Everything else though makes me wish I hadn’t bought this TV."
"Update: The latest ridiculous trait of this horrible TV: We were watching a Hulu show and set a timer on the Alexa (convenient, right?). The timer went off, a message appeared on the screen, and I clicked ""Dismiss"" with the remote. Surely, the TV will return to the Hulu show...Nope. Went all the way back to the home screen and I had to navigate all the way back to the show. Just plain dumb.I spent the extra $25 for the remote that supposedly controls both the TV and my cable box - and it did...for about a month. It just stops controlling the cable box, and I have to keep disconnecting/reconnecting the remote to the TV to get it to work. That wasn't particularly fun, so now that remote just collects dust. Sigh.----This is not only the worst TV I've ever owned, it's also the worst functioning device I've gotten from Amazon. The absolute worst features are: - the TV randomly shuts off if I'm not in the room for a few minutes. I've tried to find a setting for this, but no luck. - The remote - or one button on the remote - will simply stop working for a day, then it will suddenly work again. I've never even heard of that happening before. - There are settings (like the speaker mode) that I have to keep re-setting because they randomly revert back to the tv default. - the transitions from streaming to cable or from one streaming app to another are unbearably slow; - the TV goes into ""Ambient"" mode if you pause a show for a couple minutes. This would be fine if I could hit Play and restart my show. Nope. Instead, you have to go back to the Home screen and navigate back to the app, back to the show, and start it back up again. Ugh - seriously??Not sure why Amazon is pushing these TVs when they clearly do not have the tech figured out."
Picture quality is fine but it’s hard to complement anything about this TV with the way it lags. One of the things that I loved about this tv is I could talk to it without having the remote but that doesn’t even work anymore. Its slow interface makes for an overall horrible experience. Definitely wouldn’t recommend and would advise customers to spend elsewhere.
"If Amazon or fire is in the product description get ready to enjoy and ad-filled life!. You have the pleasure of paying Amazon to bombard you with every possible ad to get you to purchase drugs, develop a gambling habit or even support your favorite political nightmare candidate.  If you love ads this is the best possible product for you!"
"Once muted with sound remote that came with the fire tv it un-mutes itself after 5 or so seconds.  Muted again and the mute holds. It got worse. Now I have to mute it three times before it stays muted.  This happened after an update to the fire tv and it needs to be fixed, AMAZON !!!When I told Amazon that I want a refund due to this TV's malfunctioning mute button, it's now worse, Amazon told me to send  them a copy of my driver's license to prove I was the owner and said if I did not supply them with my DL to some 3rd party Amazon says I should trust and the name of which it refuses to disclose, they would not honor this claim or any other on what was a two month old Amazon fire tv.  I told them they damn well know I bought the tv because they have me verifiy that I am the account holder ever single time I sign in and when they verify my ownership on telephone conversations.  I didn't have to furnish ID to buy the thing or for any of the items I have purchased from Amazon, a total of ~$1,100 in since AugustThat Amazon would threaten to void all warranty claims in the future if I don't surrender my DL to them is outrageous . After disputing the issue my bank refunded my money I paid for the tv but Amazon, after a complaint by me to the BBB and on Monday I will file another complaint with the AZ attorney general's office will not issue a return order so I can return it. Now what, Amazon?"
"We purchased this TV in August 2023 and, unfortunately, it stopped working in December 2024. The television simply won't turn on.  The one-year warranty has expired, and there's nothing we can do, it's disappointing that a relatively new TV would fail so soon.Amazon offered a 25% discount on a new TV when I called them, citing potential software issues. However, given that the TV wouldn't even turn on, it's unclear how software updates could have prevented the issue.  Beyond that, we get emails when the remote control power is low, we don't get an email about software updates for the tv?So if you're thinking about purchasing this tv, be aware of its potential short lifespan.You might buy this tv and like it for a year. Then, when the warranty expires the tv suddenly won't turn on.  You will rue the day you didn't heed this warning from a fellow Amazon customer.What really is disappointing is that we have been a loyal Amazon customer for years spending thousands of dollars each year with Amazon.  I never would have imagined that Amazon would sell such a lemon, never in my experience has Amazon failed us in such a way."
"I Would not recommend this TV. It is slow, it does not power off completely via the remote, the picture compared to my Sony Bravia is so inferior. I would say the most frustrating issue is how slow it is to respond. Just buy a non fire tv & use your firestick. This thing is terrible."
"I have had this TV since July of 2023 and I purchased two Echo Studios and the Echo sub for the home theater sound setup. Getting through the setup is challenging, but the support will get you through it. The TV itself has a great picture, but that is the only thing that I can say positive about it. Processing speed for the TV is awful, the lag response for the navigating through the menu is unacceptable to the point that you have to stop using the remote, wait for the tv to catch up with what you were doing, and slowly click once, wait for the tv response, click again, wait for a response and so on. Once you do get your program running the processing can’t support the audio of the home theater and the echos regularly disconnect and I have to reboot the television. For backgound, I have exceptional internet service (1200mb Xfinity) and the WiFi strength is excellent. There is no reason the system should perform in the way it dose. I would recommend a different system and should have returned it. Was really hopeful that I would be happy with this setup, but regret not buying a Roku system."
"I got this TV 2 days ago. Everything works as advertised but the software is cheap and buggy right out of the gate, classic Amazon OS. You get what you pay for. What really pisses me off is trying to ask customer service for help bc it seems like a software ota update that can fix this issue. My software is current I tried all of the troubleshooting techniques myself including 3 factory resets in the first 2 days but for whatever reason I get this same error message over and over. I spent 2 hours on customer service chat with 5 different people from India who just pass me along and basically give me very very very basic trouble shooting of things I already did on my own and then think my problem is some how resolved when the chat is timed out. I then call customer service and get 3 people again in India and have to explain my situation all over again for the 6th, 7th, and 8th time and then they just offer me a replacement which I obviously already have. Just a super pain in the ass bc it is a 65 inch tv that you hang by yourself and now I can send it back for maybe a new one adding widgets to the ambient experience. Lets be honest I can probably live without that feature but this is how we start out of the gate....Amazon's customer service is awful awful....didn't realize it has gotten that bad. After 15 years of be a prime member and all the money we spend with them and I can't get any help....zero help. Is this a global issue or is my tv defective? I feel like it is a software update but good luck asking anyone in customer service at Amazon, zero chain of command or help."
"I purchased this tv for my bedroom as we also have a 65"" & a 55"" Vizio tv's in the house.  As soon as I plugged it in I had a bright white blank screen that changed back & forth with a gray screen with a box in the middle.  I called Vizio & after trying everything they offered to send a repairman to my house BUT they couldn't find my address on Google so asked for a different address????  I've lived here for 35 years & I don't have a different address.  Then I got an e mail from them telling me they would send me a new tv & to put the broken one in the new box & send it back BUT they wanted a credit card # so they could charge me AGAIN for the broken tv if they found the problem wasn't their fault~~Amazon already had the original payment & I sure wasn't going to take the chance Vizio might make me pay again.  I also didn't want to take the chance of allowing Vizio to drag it out past my 30 day return window with Amazon.  I decided to just return it to Amazon where I bought it.  Amazon supplied me with the return label & I dropped it at the UPS pick up point.  Amazon refunded me immediately the same day I dropped it off.  I immediately purchased a 43"" Raku tv from Amazon.  I'm going to be setting that up today & I sure hope my luck is better than with the Vizio.  Amazon gets 5***** for their return & refund policy.  It's a whole lot better than dealing directly with Vizio.Update~~The Raku tv is great.  It took some time for me to set it up as needed codes were being sent to my junk mail folder & it took me time to figure out how to retrieve them~~my fault.  Once I figured that out it was really easy to finish the set up & add my youtube account to the tv.  The screen on the Raku tv appears to be larger than the screen on the Vizio~~I had to move my dresser out from the wall for the tv to fit where I didn't have to do that with the Vizio.  I'm super happy with the Raku tv & if we need to replace either of our other Vizio tv's we may go with the Raku brand instead."
I read the reviews prior to buying the TV and decided to chance it. I bought a Roku due to the reviews. For the money the TV is ok. At first it would load right away but 2 months later I find that it takes longer to load up. Max and Hulu are not working properly on the TV so now I use my Roku a lot. If the tv turns off whether by my hand or it shuts itself down it automatically goes back to the main TV and I have to use the remote for the tv to change it to the right HDMI. Even though the Roku remote works to turn tv on I  cannot use it to get back to the HDMI with the Roku. So I always have to know where the tv remote is and have to deal with not losing one or the both of them. I thought it was cool that we could change the brightness with a button at the bottom of the remote. I like to darken it at night but it doesn’t work on the HDMI channels.
"Overall summary: In order to use internet apps you need to accept to data collection terms. Then after that you get sent to the Vizio home screen which can be very slow at times. Sometimes it can take a while to load (this is on a good-excellent Wifi connection). You can set the TV to turn on to your last used input, but you cannot set it specifically. It has 2 HDMI inputs, a Digital out, antenna, and a usb input. The USB does not read your video files on a flash drive if you were hoping to do that. The viewing angle isn't great from below, so it's best to be at the same height or above.  Speakers are not great and not terrible. Below I'll list the pros and cons that I've seen so far.Cons -UI:- The home screen will often start with a full screen advertisement.- If you leave the TV on at the home screen, it will automatically play something at full screen. This can be bad if you're worried about a data cap.- You start the navigation on the home screen with the usual advertisements at the top. You have the other menus on the left but you have to move down from the top advertisements before you can navigate there.- Sometimes slow navigating or loading the home menu. I assume this is reliant on your internet connection so this can vary.Audio:- The speakers sound a bit cheap. I feel it's too loud on volume 1. I didn't test past volume 8 and it can go well past that.Antenna:- Say you're watching broadcast TV. For example you press channel 9, it brings up a keypad on screen, and it takes around 7 seconds to change to that channel. Pressing enter after hitting '9' just inputs the number highlighted on the keypad. You have to navigate down to press OK to goto that channel.- If you are getting a bad signal, an overlay on the screen says you're getting a bad signal and you can press up or down to change the channel. This can happen even when you can see and hear the show you're watching just fine.Video:- Viewing from 10-20 degrees below the tv can look too dark. However there are lots of video settings to compensate.Pros -Audio: - Has bluetooth audio that works well. Sometimes when you pair your headphones the tv will lag to compensate for delay.- Has settings to delay audio.- Adaptive audio control.- Settings to increase voices. However I haven't thoroughly tested this.Video:- Has a surprising amount of video settings. HDR color settings, being able to set individual RGB values, backlight, black control, game mode, pixel tuning, sharpness tuning. Seems feature complete in that regard.Other-- Has a restart tv function- Shows your wifi signal strength and appropriate info- No Steam Link or Twitch app- Has Plex. But no Jellyfin.- No ethernet port- Cheap remote- Has a favorite channels menu- Vizio offers alot of internet channels without having to make an account- Switching inputs to a PS4 for example will turn it on. Can disable this. Also your remote can navigate through the ps4"
"The picture is fine, connected to things fine. Internet, Netflix, Amazon prime. Home screen sucks. My old tv connected to the security cameras as soon as it turned on, then I could go to the home screen if I wanted. Which I never wanted to on the old tv, and wish I would never see on this one even more. Connected to my new headphones fine, but disconnect while moving through the apps. So far, it has only happened once.My biggest problem is I can't put the Spectrum TV app on this. So, it is a boat anchor as far as I'm concerned, though it would probably float, to me it is unbelievablely light. I would send back, but it was my own fault for not checking first and buying because it was cheap. I will be buying another tv to take its place, after some research, and this will be only for the security cameras and left on until it burns out considering it only has 2 HDMI connections anyways. If it would go to the thing connected to it first, I might have replaced the monitor for my laptop with it.Update: I was able to find a setting that makes it go to the last imput when turning on, as long as I check the cameras before I shut it off, it seems to work fine. The headphones disconnecting is happening more often, like when I go to an app I have to reconnect, but not positive yet if that is what is causing it. Once on Netflix it stays connected, though I have to go into the settings to connect manually. The speakers sound bad, low volume, but I haven't changed any of the settings since I bought it exclusively to be heard through headphones. Someone mentioned the app removal doesn't work, mine does, yet it's on that messy home screen I try to avoid. I only use three apos, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Spectrum TV."
"I purchased this tv with high hopes, my daughter had previously bought one and I had helped her set it up when she bought hers and so from what I saw I was initially impressed. The colors were bright, the remote was simple, the apps seemed like they were all up to date and all fairly easy to sign in- okay so that’s not what’s most important. What’s most important is that it doesn’t lose wifi connection in the middle of trying to watch your show every few times per day. I would say you get what you pay for but I have purchased 2 Rokus and a few Samsungs and this HAS NEVER HAPPENED. I wouldn’t recommend this tv. I didn’t return it cause I threw the box out. I would also like to add that when I brought this up to my daughter, she said she was experiencing the same thing, but less often. Like I said it shouldn’t happen at all."
"Purchased this TV, its a low end and that was what I was expecting.  The remote doesn't even have a button for pause or play.  Easy to work around.  What I don't like is that it makes you sign up for an account.  Then I read that Vizio makes the overwhelming majority of its profit on data.  Who's data might that be?  I could guess and so could you.  Otherwise its just an average, low cost TV, used in my home office as a large monitor (mounted to the wall) and sometimes to steam something.  Works ok, sound about average or below.  Picture about average or below.  The old saying ""it is what it is""."
"I got this all set up .The shows and commercials pause ,buffer. My internet is fine for our big tv no issues. But what is this? Never watched a TV that stops and jumps into shows random. Not sure how to fix a problem like this."
I bought this a few weeks ago and will be returning this tv. It is beyond SLOW loading when turning on the tv and the sound is awful.  This is a bottom of the line tv and you get what you pay for.  I have bought a better brand and couldn’t be happier!
"Do not buy this tv if you’re looking for a simple seamless smart tv experience. I basically never leave reviews but felt compelled hereQuick pros: for a cheap tv, the picture actually looks good and the sound is fine. Maybe this would work great as a monitor or something. It’s good enough to throw in my bedroom to fall asleep to. That’s why this isn’t one starNow the issues: The OS and smart tv functionality are laughably horrible. I get the sense whoever is working at Vizio has never used a tv before. Would you like a pop-up every time you return to the home screen? How about one that just advertises the home screen? The built in chromecast, which was a reason I chose this cheap tv among the cheap tv’s, is completely nonfunctional. How about an interface that is so slow and clunky it’s impossible to navigate any apps? Would you like your shows in stop-motion because the apps are constantly buffering and jittery (no, it’s not my internet)? Completely eliminates the purpose of buying a smart tv. I’m going to keep it and just get a Roku or google cast stick or something."
Picture is nor clear and words are blurry and hard to read. I would not have purchased if I had read the reviews. Vizio is poorly rated for th reasons I experienced.
This tv freezes up A LOT for no reason at the menu. I’ve had to unplug it to reset it a couple times. Annoying
"I bought a tv not a casting device.  First I had to install an app on my phone to proceed in the set up.  Then I cannot get anywhere on my tv using my remote?  How difficult can it be to watch tv on a tv?  As I did not purchase a casting device.  Hopefully I can still return it.  With Help from Vizio it was found I had to create/log into the website and add the tv there if I want to use the remote control.  The app is a separate piece, that wasn't very clear"
"This Tv is ok, the picture is great. I am very disappointed the remote does not have a microphone, I like searching with the voice feature., which this Tv does not have. Also my old Tv, had pause, rewind and fast forward with a zip drive plugged into the back. The remote takes time to learn. The box said it works with Alexa, my daughter linked them together, but she doesn’ t know how to do any commands. I’m just very frustrated right now. Switching from attenna to the apps is weird too, nothing like my old Tv. I’m still learning, I should be familiar by now. Disappointed"
"The TV was delivered on time, great audio"
quick review.  I got this tv about a week ago and it's been mostly okay.  Pretty good picture.  I do however have a few issues with it. One is the loading seems to struggle sometimes. The remote seems a little clunky as well. And I just got off the phone with Amazon to do a exchange because the TV recently just started spinning and won't load. I even tried resetting it. Hoping it's just a faulty unit and the new one solves the issue.
The Vizio app in this particular tv is sluggish/slow. The remote seems wimpy and fragile plastic junk buttons and everytime I click to move in the app ..it moves twice (2 places) So I reconnected the Roku device into the hdmi and thats working super-fast in comparison to the Vizio app. Still a good deal for a decent picture. I would not buy again.
"I didn't like that the speakers were not loud enough because the overall sound quality of the speakers are not very good. I purchased a external Vizio speaker for it only to realize that it did not have enough HDMI ports to support  it, so I had to unplug my DVD player to accommodate the speaker. I have other TVs that have 4-5 ports."
Are the wrong size made and screws provides did not fit . We went ahead and bought a table top tv stand to make the tv work in our bedroom space .
I absolutely love the video quality and the tv itself but the legs are so loose I had to prop my tv up until I get new legs and screws ordered for it.
"Was easy to set up, but doesn't work with my Amazon firestick nor my Bluetooth ear buds. Will never buy a Vizio tv again. Very disappointed it doesn't work as well as my old Sharp tv that finally died."
For the price it’s a nice TV - learned to adjust picture and sound to my liking .Not crazy about tone yet - may need sound bar. Since it’s a bedroom tv not to concerned .
This tv decides to turn off by itself while I watching it. Has to be unplugged. Then it will be replugged and it will come back on in minutes or hours. Very frustrating!
"Bought it for my office/workout room. Just wanted something I could listen to while working but also use to watch tv on the treadmill. Picture is fine, little slow response when pressing buttons, and the sound is… lacking. Hard to understand what people are saying when there is background music on. Will probably have to get a speaker because I hate subtitles… but it was cheap so 🤷🏼‍♀️"
"The TV is fine.  Unfortunately, it comes with an astounding amount of bloatware installed.  Some of it can be deleted, some not - so get in there and wipe out everything you can.  Beyond that, it's functional.  I did not sign up for Visio+; I did not download the app.  Don't need that nonsense."
"I hate this TV. I am a van lifer and got this because of price and 1080P. It's os is slower than my Samsung, and that's slow! It never wants me to watch over the air broadcasting, and the spinning thing spins forever. The channel up down buttons never respond, and I have to manually enter channels whenever I change channels. It constantly prompts me to watch ""It's"" Vizio programming instead. It never turns back on to the last used app even though I specifically told it to do so. It would only be good to be hooked up to a blue ray player. Don't waste your money!"
The color wasnt as sharp as my 65 inch vizio
"Its a ok tv for a spare room. Get a sound bar for it cause the tv speakers are not that great. And its smaller then thought. For the extra couple dollars get the 43"" I had to call Vizio for some help in installing but they were great."
Do not buy this TV without buying a sound bar to go with it the factory sound is CRAP!!!
"Picture quality is great. Outside of there being no sound on the previews and you have to turn it up alot for decent sound, the audio is clear."
"It doesn't have Bluetooth capability, also it doesn't support Google, not so smart TV! Disappointed with Vizio! -1 more star.TV doesn't have a eithernet port! Seriously, a smart TV without eithernet hookup?! Major manufacture oversight, I may not have bought it if I had noticed that.Also a little disappointed it didn't come with screws that attach the back of the TV to a wall mount bracket, as luck would have it, neither did the wall mount bracket I got."
"Ordered this item, got stolen within 5 minutes of it being delivered.Bought the exact same model of tv at Walmart within 3 hours.Got it home, and the legs/feet they supply didn't fit.No idea the screen quality, picture sharpness etc because it's kinda useless if it wobbles around."
It's so cheap because they require you to opt in to data collection to use any of the smart TV features.If you don't opt in it's a dumb TV. Hey that's not so bad. Has two Hdmi inputs. I'll just plug one of my Rokus into it and call it a day.
"Hard to set up.  Takes almost a minute for programing to appear after turning on, when viewing using a HDMI port."
THE TV IS NOT 40 INCHES; IT'S ONLY 35 INCHES!
This TV is definitely not as user-friendly as the fire TVs. The response time from the remote to the TV responding is very slow in the picture quality is mediocre
"Yes, it’s affordable but you get what you pay for!  Awful audio…has to be at 50+ to even hear dialogue. Remote quit working after one month. Change of battery of no use. Came with a small pin point issue on the screen. Go with a Roku tv…ease of use is far superior. I opted to save money but paid for it in the end."
"Tv it self is Good but once I unboxed the tv it was very clear it was a returned tv. Packaging was damaged, tv stand did not stay in place. The tv is very unstable and leans forward.  Definitely not happy about that since I was going to stand tv up and not mount it. Totally misleading."
"I bought this tv a little over a month ago and at first it was great no issues. But now, a few times my screen has froze or the remote was not registering with the tv. I've had to unplug the tv a couple of times. Also, now I notice when I hit the volume there is a background that temporary comes on."
"I bought this mostly for game console.  The screen freezes, the left speaker doesn't work, it turns the game console off while I'm playing, will sometimes change the channel by itself.  I can see a TV tower, I can't get the channel, channels come and go.  The tracking software turns itself back on,  the screen brightens itself. Customer service? "" Unplug it, wait, plug it back in. You should buy a soundbar .""  I had a 32"" Vizio that lasted 8 years with no problems.  It broke while I moved. This... thing isn't even good for gaming.You've been warned ⚠️"
"This is by far the worst TV I've ever bought,it takes forever to change channels,the channels disappear & you cannot tell what channel its on, doesn't show the name of the programs which is very infuriating and this tv shuts off by itself. I'll never purchase another Vizio ever. If I had transportation I'd return it ASAP!."
I have no problems with the TV--however it would be nice if a manual  or some sort of instructions were included . Basically I'm guessing what some buttons are for . If you have such a manual would you please send it ??
This tv only connects to the internet 50% of the time. Constantly having to turn it off and back on. Went to return it and I am just outside the return window. 😞
"I'm disappointed with this LCD TV. The picture quality is underwhelming, with dull colors and poor contrast. The viewing angles are terrible, and the sound is flat and tinny. For the price, I expected much better performance. Wouldn't recommend."
Too much for me!!  Way too complicated!!!
No Ethernet cable! Must connect with wifi and that causes bad quality resolution and lag between sound and audio. No audio out port - only HDMI and USB port.
Does not have a wake up setting.The shortest sleep setting you can choose is 30 mins.The fonts are so small I have to stand right in front of the tv to read anything on the screen. Oh and the fonts on the user manual (that I had to download because it didn't come with a user manual in the packaging nor installed on the tv) are super small.Have found no way to adjust text size.Can't cast from my android phone to the tv.Sound quality sucks.Extremely difficult and annoying to get to the antenna channels whether you are connected to the internet or not.Does not start playing where you last left off when you turn on the tv.Very slow start up.I've never been so dissatisfied with a tv before..
"The delay when hitting a button will drive you mad. Almost takes a few seconds everytime, terrible"
"There's nothing more to say other than this TV is actual garbage. Nothing more than a paperweight. Half the time, the TV decides it doesn't want to turn on, so it'll be a black screen with the power light flashing on and off. The only way I've found to fix this is to unplug it for a while. If you use apps, you better hope the apps you like are at the beginning of the list because even though it gives the option to move and remove the order of your apps, it doesn't work. You can highlight the apps and it says to move the arrows to change the order but it doesn't move, and trying to remove the apps is the same way. The option is there and all the buttons on the remote work, but pressing remove does nothing. Overall this TV isn't worth it. I wouldn't buy one of these brand new off of Jeremy the crackhead for $20. Hands down will be the last piece of Visio garbage I ever buy. Than you for coming to my TED talk."
The screen keeps freezing
"How to get Bluetooth Headphones working? Had it working before I did the WIFI connection. But after I did the WIFI connection, the Bluetooth headphones would not work."
Had my tv for about 2 months and I’ve had to reset it several times. Very glitchy. Spend a few more dollars for something better
"TL;DR it’s a good ornament, terrible buy.I was so excited to get this tv but since install, it’s been nothing but a headache. The first week I did maybe 3 updates after the initial update with setup. I continue to have issues with this tv holding a connection. It regularly loses connection needing to be rebooted and after restarting, it is fine. With that said, I’ve also had issues with getting the tv to actually power down; when turning off it will blink repeatedly and not actually shut down fully, I can sometimes get it to power back on fully and then power down all of the way but something I need to actually unplug the tv. Literally every time I use the tv, it gives me at least one connection issue about 20 minutes into use."
Confusing set up.  It took me forever to figure it out and I still have problems with it.
"The Lag is bad. The picture quality is good, but it chooses whenever it likes to power off completely. No other device in my home has issues with my WiFi."
"This was purchased as “new”, but it was clearly re-packaged. Plus the feet are missing from the box."
"I bought this so I didn't have to use my computer to watch shows that were on Max, or other streaming services. I didn't know that I had to have an unmetered internet connection to watch, which my cable company does not offer, (was not in discription of the product. Other than that the T.V. works great,"
"Somewhat disappointed. it has a pixel missing, near the center so when the screen turns dark, its noticeable.Had the hardest time to mount the legs. the screws it came with did not fit. Def wrong size. I work in tech and work heavy with hardware, so I know. Had to buy a stand instead."
"The tv came quickly but with no remote, tv stand or user manual.  I had to double check to make sure I didn't order a used tv because I don't understand why so many things would be missing.  I ordered a replacement.  Never had a chance to turn tv on, hopefully no problem"
"Pretty stupid that it has no HDMI in, and pretty stupid that I MISSED that! Going to see if they will exchange it. No HDMI, really?"
Packaging displays contents. Smart features of TV too cumbersome to use.
"When I looked at the TV and read the reviews everything looked ok, I bought the TV mounted it on my wall, set everything up, was good for a few days and then I can't access my dish satellite. I found out that you can't get the dish app or connect dish satellite to this TV. No where in the information or description does it tell you that. Now I have to go out of my way to return it wait for a refund to purchase another TV."
I expected more than received. TV is wobbly and legs don’t fit correctly. Great size and picture. Scared it’s going to fall over and break or I need to purchase a wall mount for security sake.
I bought this for my niece who just moved into her new home. She had no money for a television and i got it for a house warming gift. The only thing that works on this TV is the YouTube app! I’m very disappointed bc she has no money to buy a replacement and when I went to ask for a refund it was 1 day past the 30 day policy on returns. I will no longer support this brand. She has stayed on the phone with support for hours and I have sent her videos to try and fix it. No luck what so  ever.
"The picture is great and the price is great. However, the tv automatically clears its memory and I have to restart everything to include resetting up WiFi and every single app. I have had to do this 5 times and I have not had the tv for a full week. In addition to the major inconvenience, whenever I turn the volume down, the volume completely disappears, I mean no sound whatsoever. I have spent more time setting this tv up then I have been able to enjoy it. I have reached out to the seller, so, I hope there is a work around if not I will send this tv back never to ever purchase this brand again."
"This was a gift for the family, so it was purchased at the end August and gifted two days ago. Got it all set up, installed all the apps and got it working beautifully, all were happy. Tonight we all gathered around the new TV for a fun binge night, and in the middle of a show, the screen went full diagonal static and a super loud - honestly frightening! - screeching noise came out of the speakers, and the screen went black. Totally dead and will not come back on. WTF??!! I do not care if it is “too late” to return the TV to Amazon- I want full restitution from the manufacturer. This is outrageous."
"The company package the wrong screws. Needed 4- 6mm to be sent.  Had 2- 27 minutes phone calls. First  call was told would get email with tracking for the screws. Second call was told needed a picture of the feet, the TV is my 85 year old mother’s that is 20 miles away so I can’t get a picture any time soon. In the meantime she has a TV that she can’t use because VIZIO refuses to ship the screws that should have been included unless a picture is taken and sent to them.Also I have had small issues with my other VIZIO TVs. I would NOT recommend VIZIO"
the TV is fine but the legs do not fit tight and the TV wiggles.  I called and told the company and they said they would send out new legss with screws but nothing for the last 3 weeks!!
Do not buy this TV . You may spend an hour waiting for it to connect every time you turn it on. Even though you are using the same internet as the last time it connected.Once it finally does connect the Home Screen is so full of unwanted shows you have to scroll and scroll to get what you want.I hate this TV.
Within the same week of buying this it broke. The screen only flickers and fades when I turn it on unless I have it laying on its back. As soon as I set it back up the same thing happens. I didn’t buy the protection plan and now I’m just out that money. Where did standard of quality go?
First Vizio TV purchase.  TV did not work on arrival. Helpful customer support tried helping but eventually we determined box was faulty and had to be returned.
Bought a small tv for our bedroom post moving. Just unpacked it from the box and mounted it last week (delivery). Haven’t been able to watch a singular thing on it because it keeps freezing. It’s not our wifi because none of our other TVs have this problem. Outside of return window and a huge waste of money.
Miss some of the part
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It is the slowest TV I've ever seen. The remote does not respond 90% of the time. It's constantly loading. The voice does not match up with the sound you have to turn it off and turn it back on. I've read reviews all over the Internet that say the same things about these TVs how horrible they are. That's why it's so cheap you get what you pay for
"So aggravated that vizio doesn’t work being that I am located Outside of the United States, which was not disclosed before purchasing. I called VIZIO and was on the phone with them an hour to 30 minutes and nothing was solved. If you’re going to get this TV, make sure that you can use VIZIO in your region first or get it slowly for HDMI purposes I don’t know if that works But the customer service representative said that it should work great with gaming systems But if you’re trying to watch TV, using VIZIO and you’re outside of the United States, do not buy this TV."
Had 3 months just stopped working. All you see is Vizio on screen ! Had help nothing worked. We were told it the tv it self ! We would like a new tv preferably a 50 inch . This was the only way to contact you didn’t mean to put you on blast.
"Nice picture, but to use the smart tv features you need to set up an account with Vizio. This allows them to… blah blah blah, track what you watch and harvest data. My greater frustration is that I’m in an area that doesn’t allow a Vizio account, and there is no bypass to use the smart options. We have rental houses and I planned on buying more, but not now."
"There is no way to complete the TV setup process without creating a Vizio Account. Vizio is extorting personal information to gain access to a piece of hardware that's already paid for. Evil corporation dystopian future trash garbage.Don't buy this TV. But if you do, use Temp Mail to create a login without giving them any real information.Vizio should be ashamed of themselves for this practice."
"I wear hearing aids.,but the audio on the tv is not compatible with them. Some channels ate oj, but most I can't understand the dialogue. Don't have this problem with any other devices. My return window has expired, but could I exchange and pay difference for Amazon Fire?"
"It looks like a great TV but check your WiFi password before you purchase it.  This TV only accepts passwords of 24 characters or less!  Our password, set by T-Mobile, is 30 characters long, so I can't connect.  Changing our WiFi password would be a major hassle since I'd have to get T-Mobile to do it and then change the passwords on all of our devices (none of which had a problem with the 30-character password).  I've had helpful confirmation of this situation from Visio support.  It looks like I will need to return the product."
This TV is horrible. Don’t waste your money on this one. Go for TCL or Amazon Fire instead. I’ve bought all three for similar price range and this one is the worst! The TV turns off on its own while playing. Many apps found easily on other TVs are not available on this one. This was a total waste of money for me and I’ll never buy this brand again.
"It worked less than 5 times, then died. I bought it for my office and only had it 2 weeks and maybe turned it on 5 times. Right in the middle of a program the screen went black. Even after doing a reset it still wouldn’t turn on."
"I bought Vizo's before never had issues, we have extenders all through our home, I have to turn on the tv. turn it off, the turn it on the light turns on then off real quick, Then the 3rd time you turn it on it connects."
I’ve had this TV since September and it suddenly ( 3 months later ) won’t turn on. It turned off in the middle of a movie! I’ve tried Visio’s recommendations and they don’t work. Would recommend taking your purchase elsewhere.
"I have never had a Smart TV that was so hard to set up (hours and its still not done).  The online user manual is worthless and you MUST set up a Vizio account to access any of the smart features of the TV.  There are some apps that you cannot download so you're stuck with the ones that are on the set!  And it won't let you delete or rearrange the ones that are there. AND, it is very intrusive, Stay away from this TV, and maybe Vizio altogether."
"It regularly malfunctions, apps like Hulu and HBO don't work (known issue according to the Internet and they do nothing), sound goes out, etc. It's a waste of money to buy this. I will never buy this brand again."
"I bought this crap thinking I could grab a decent cheap tv, however, to my surprise this whole tv does not work for customers outsiders the US. To setup the damm Vizio account I had to install a VPN in my phone and after that the whole tv just doesn't work because it's outside the US, basically useless as a a smart TV and have to pay for shipping if I want to return it. Why the heck would this vendor ship this crap outside of the US."
"Literally turns off every 15 minutes maybe more often, has some many issues but main one is it won’t connect to the internet and if it does it doesn’t stay, very slow response time to remote and over all feels very cheaply made."
"I never did get this to work, even with going in to set up an account, then another account and a password, still wouldn't work, won't even let you play antenna tv with out a vizeo account and agreement to all there adds,  tv didn't work you just sign your life away to vizeo and google, terrible for a customer"
"The picture looks nice, but the home screen takes a minimum of 30 seconds to load.Any button push on the remote is also extremely behind and frustrating.Go buy a Roku tv instead."
"The TV has a malfunction in it. We notified Vizio the day that we received it that there was a problem. They are able to duplicate that problem on the same TV At their factory, but they have no solutions for us. We have asked for a replacement and have not received one. We have asked Vizio for a step down model that functions properly. They did not provide that either. So now we have a TV that does not function as it should and they have offered us. No relief. I have eight Vizio TVs in my house. I am livid that they will not just replace my TV."
The product doesn't function without buying separate tv stand. If you put too much pressure putting screws in the tv then you can crack the tv screen. The company need to update the tv stand.
The two brackets that support it are too far apart to sit where I need to put it. And I don’t see any where on the back that a wall mount could be attached.Also I bought another Vizio and it’s a real problem getting it set up . Very frustrating
"DAY 1: worked as expected.DAY 2: took 40 minutes of trying to get past it spinning/loading. Unplugged modem/router even tho tv settings stated connected and connection strong. Unplugged tv, nothing. Connected to AI service , stated to unplug tv . Unplugged tv, plugged it back to normal menu. Picked a channel, no volume, freezing then starting back. Never had a smart tv fail so miserably within less than 48 hrs. DO NOT BUY. Retuning this asap"
"I know not everyone cares, but it offends me that I have no choice but to sign up for a Vizio account (which monitors my TV use and subjects me to ""tons of free offers"".  I would not have purchased this TV if I had known.  Unfortunately, I am past the review period."
"I use my TV for cable and DVD/Blu-Ray.  I also have a high-end sound system that I use with my TV/video system.  This unit only has a single coaxial cable port, unlike the Visio that I am replacing, which had ports for multiple external units.  This was omitted in the product description.  Had I known that this was the case and that all this unit can do is Internet and cable, I would have saved the hassle and not purchased it.  This shortcoming should be made clear in the product description.  I am returning the unit and continuing my search for a TV that meets my needs."
"If I try to watch something over Airplay, the TV will randomly shut off. Auto shutdown is already disabled. Looked online and this is a known issue going back to at least 2018 that has to do with a firmware bug affecting multiple models of Vizio smart TVs, and it's been ""fixed"" previously only to recur in other updates. Have fun watching for 15 minutes then have to grab the remote, wait the 15 seconds this thing takes to boot up, and reconnect your phone/tablet again."
"Judging by the packing on the new one I bought after I returned this, same make and model. The television I was sold was refurbished and repacked. This is just my opinion."
"Updated:It turns out that this TV has old, inadequate WiFi support that does not work well with modern WiFi systems that present the same SSID on both the 2.4ghz and 5ghz bands at the same time (thus letting the client chose which band to lock on to.)To get reliable WiFi with this TV I had to change our WiFi settings to create a new ""IoT"" SSID on either the 2.4 or 5ghz bands (but *not* both) and then update the TV settings to use that new SSID.  (I put mine on the 5ghz band.)Fortunately my Netgear Orbi system was able to create that new, additional SSID and lock it to exactly one of the frequency bands (2.4 or 5ghz).  Before getting this TV one should check that their WiFi hardware is able to do this.When doing this you probably will need to restart the TV multiple times.Neither Amazon nor TCL support was much help figuring this out.Original:We will probably return this - WiFi is unreliable (only way to use is via a Roku plugged in to HDMI)We just got this new TV, TCL 65-Inch Q65 QLED 4K UHD Smart TV with Google TV (65Q651G, 2024 Model) and set it up yesterday.Some points:First:This unit does not reliably connect to WiFi.  It can see our networks, it can connect (sometimes) after a power reset, but often not.  It looses the connection until the unit is power cycled and a fresh attempt made.Our prior TV had no problem.  The Roku that we have to use in order to use this TV connects to WiFi with total reliability.We have excellent WiFi here (NetGear Orbi system) and no other device of any kind has any difficulty with our WiFi.We are networking technologists, we are unlikely to have made any errors in the setup of the SSID or the access pass phrase - it is just that sometimes the WiFi works on this TV (for a while) and often it does not work.  All other WiFi devices, including the Roku sitting right next to it, work fine while this TV struggles and fails.This turns this unit, from our point of view into nothing but a dumb screen that we can use only via a Roku (that has no trouble with WiFi) plugged into one of the HDMI ports.We did a software upgrade so we are running the latest release.Basically this is unacceptable and if we can not resolve this we will simply have to return this TV for a refundSecond: The off-angle viewing range is rather limited.  Off center viewing that was OK with our prior (Samsung) is blury with this unit.Third: Google TV seems to be a repacking of YouTube with apps.  It can be rather difficult to find content that is not part of the Google ecosystem.  We actually prefer to use this unit via our tried and true Roku (which has no WiFi problems) via an HDMI connection.  Google TV seems designed by and for children.Fourth:  Some of the controls are hard to find - like turning off Soap Opera mode can take a bit of digging.  (In its default mode, old B&W movies looked awful.)"
Product is good though the screen reflects the light.  I have only had it for 24 hours.  The setup process is rather lengthy 1 hr +.  ONLY MOUNT WITH FULL MOTION TV mount.  When you use the tilt or fixed version you have to attach all the cables before you load the TV onto the mount. To attach any new cable you have to remove the TV which is a big pain in such a large TV. Also if you don't use a full motion mount to screw in the bolts on top you need a 16 to 18 in screwdriver extension. The product should have said only mount with full motion mount
"It’s 4k and bright, but not the best for gaming. It does have 120FPS, but at 1080p. To be honest I think it was 720p, it was really bad. You’re able to play at 120fps in 1440 P, but that looks slightly better than the 720 P.  I wasn’t satisfied so I submitted a return.You’re able to put the TV in game mode which I’m assuming is an auto HDR because it dims the screen and changes the colors to a warm setting.  I preferred a cool setting color which forced me to leave game mode and caused the games to have terrible ghosting and run between 40 and 50 FPS."
"Once you start watching something on Netflix or Prime Video, the picture seems pretty satisfying most of the time. However, the Google TV is well beyond the worst among all the TV OSs I used before (which are practically all of them, with Roku standing out as the best). Google TV on this tv is extremely glitchy, slow, skipping, randomly blacking out, doesn't recognize location so you can't use Pluto, Xumo, Tubi etc. which says ""it's not available in your country"" even though my Google account is registered in the US. Watching YouTube is a huge pain, it always stops and reruns from a minute before several times during each ad, making it the worst YouTube watching experience and you just give up after a while. I used this with and without Google account set up, also reset to factory settings and set it up again, but nothing has changed. I've decided not to return (because of the discount I got) and use it with Apple TV, but will definitely never ever buy a Google TV or Android TV again!"
"This TV has a nice picture and I love the remote.  The praise stops there as it just has too many other issues.  I have owned TCL TV's in the past and have been happy with them, not this one.Using the onboard Google TV based apps causes some type of system overload and the picture develops bad stuttering which gets worse the longer a stream is running.  So, the solution is to use an external streaming device.  However, the HDMI ports seem to be extremely sensitive and have trouble settling on a resolution often much lower than the 4k capabilities.  For what it's worth, this is only through the in wall HDMI extension cable I have to above the mantle, but other 4k TV's do not have this issue, so the ports just seem very sensitive. The 3.5mm sound jack has static that won't go away even after blowing out the port and testing new cables and speakers.TCL support is extremely slow.  Each email response from them takes about 2-3 business days. My latest exchange, I've been waiting for three days for a response and checked in only to be told no updates.  I've provided all the info and tried the testing they requested, but my case is dragging on without any resolution in sight.I had high hopes for this TV after seeing other reviews.  However, the troubles and slow support just are not worth it.  I should have returned this TV during the return window.  I will update if there is a positive outcome, but for now, I'm done with the TCL brand."
"All the presets are either extremely saturated or extremely brown. It took hours to get it to a tolerable stateWhen connected to a PC, there is a 0.1 second audio delay when game mode is enabled. When game mode is disabled, the audio syncs but the lag is very noticable. I've connected the PC audio directly to the sound bar as a workaround, but I wish I didn't have to. One of the HDMI video presets is literally called ""PC"", so you'd think it would work. I didn't have this issue on the last TCL I owned."
"I've loaded the TCL app onto my Samsung 20S phone three times yet it will not open an account for me (I never received the verification code TCL is supposed to send to me). I have decided to delete their phone app. I also never received registration notification that the photo I texted to 71403 of their ""camera icon"" from their start up user manual was received or that my TV product was registered. I ended up going to their web site and sending them registration data to get verification of product registration.TV viewability is okay, but nothing spectactular.Between the 5 days of my Amazon order date (price was $298) for 43"" model and receiving the TV (price had dropped to $248). I feel ripped off."
"Once you get something playing it works well, but even within the first few days of buying this tv it was immediately glitchy to navigate between apps and select something to watch. The screen will often go black or jump to a different app without reason, and it generally lags and is extremely slow each and every time I'm trying to choose something to watch. It's on the cheaper end but I didn't expect it to be this slow. Again, once you actually play something it works great, but this can get annoying."
"Reviews claim Google TV is the same or better than Roku - nay nay. The one channel I want to watch, MSNBC, is not available. I'm sure it is a nice TV otherwise."
Since this is a 2024 model year thought it would have usb 3.0. Besides that the picture quality is good.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This was an odd one, and quite disappointing: while unpacking, I noticed an odd warping in the frame. Turns out something happened to the top bezel that caused it to be deformed, though there doesn't appear to be any impact marks or pressure points, and the panel itself seemed to function fine. The bezel warp produced un-ignorable light bleed at the top of the screen. Further, build quality of the power button housing was God-awful: pretty sure Glorious Hall Effect switches fit better in their plate than this thing did in the TV. I know it's not something you'll use in favor of the remote, but that's not the point. Build it right or not at all.Amazon rightfully didn't offer an exchange and just offered to return and refund. Interestingly, Amazon ALSO tried to pay me off with a 59.20 or so partial refund to keep the TV anyway.TV cheap, and maybe there's a reason why. Guess you gamble with the build quality and packaging. I was too frustrated to even want to see if the rest of the display worked, so I can't speak to image or backlight quality, or functionality of Google TV."
"Overall its a good deal for the price I got. But then you start noticing small things which will bother you (atleast to me). It takes time to turn on, once on you wont be able to use your remote for like 10sec ( more like a screen freeze), but it goes away later. Sound, picture quality is good for the price. In built dolby sound is better than most of the TV I’ve seen, most of the time I dont even connect my BT speakers. Content with 4k (dolby vision) with dolby sound sometime doesn’t work well - more like too much to take together for this TV."
"This tv has amazing sounds for the price,  no need for sound bar. This is why I give it a 2 star rating. The picture is amazing if it is still or very slow moving. If you have epilepsy or issues with flashing or sudden imaging, I would be cautious. The image is very ""sharp"" where you can't adjust the sharpness. Because of this the image makes almost a flashing motions when it goes from a moving image to still. The image blurs a bit and then comes to a super sharp stop when still which makes almisy a flash image happen. It triggered my epilepsy.  I returned the tv because of this. If you don't have any issues with this then the tv is amazing for it's price."
"It's Google, not Roku. If you're used to using a Roku platform it takes a bit. Moreover, if you are the only one using this TV, it's fine, the account logins are a pain in the butt. The interface needs some serious rethinking. This is why Roku has the largest market share. It WORKS! Don't get me wrong I use Chrome all the time. But this isn't Chrome. It's Google trying to play catch-up."
"We had done a lot of research on 85"" TV's and were excited when we finally landed on this one.  We originally bought this TV on July 16th; we were immediately surprised to learn the shipping would be quite a bit slower (than typically Prime packages) and it wasn't delivered until August 5th.  We were willing to wait since it seemed to be a great product.  TV finally arrives and within a few days we have it professionally mounted.  By November 20th we began having issues...starting with pixels being out, but quickly escalated to a black and white fuzzy screen and then within 1 day a total black screen with no picture at all!  We quickly reach out to Amazon customer service (on November 23rd) that tells us we are outside their return policy and to reach out to the manufacturer.  From there we reached out to TCL directly; doing EXHAUSTIVE trouble shooting to no avail.  Finally we are told they'll send a repair person and the repair person will call within 1 week to schedule.  That date comes & goes with no contact so reach out again to learn the repair was cancelled with not notification.  At this point TCL determines it can not be repaired and they will replace the TV.  As of now we are at 3 weeks of waiting and are still waiting for resolution!Worst purchase ever made on AMAZON!  Avoid TCL & go to Costco to buy one you can replace and walk away with immediately."
"The TV hardware is great. The picture and sound are excellent. Good as anything else I've seen. However the wifi system is old tech but works adequately. But the Google TV operating system is a mess. It is patched together from a dozen apps, many that were never intended to work together and don't. It is slow, memory hungry, buggy, freezes, and literally backs you into navigation deadends that you can't reverse out of. You get stuck in a screen and can't get out. Also the remote will randomly launch something other than what you selected."
"If you like having to use two remotes to turn on your TV, then this one is for you. Does have a nice picture."
"I have another QLED TV from a different brand and this one isn't even close in the picture quality department, they are both similar price tier. The side viewing angles are terrible. The bloom on black is terrible. If this was the only TV you had it would look great, but compared to others it's mediocre for QLED."
"Pictures is OK, not great and keeps disconnecting and reconnecting to the Internet, saying that Wi-Fi is lost"
"First, the remote is really meh. The two buttons below the select buttons should have one back button and one button dedicated to pausing. The right button, however, brings up the antenna option. WHO NEEDS THAT? Really dumb. My biggest complaint has to do with their browser. I've been spoiled by Samsung. Too many things separate the two but using this browser is tiring. Going back a page requires more than one click (sometimes way more) and the pop-ups telling you there's a video waiting to open is extremely aggravating. This happens on every site that you visit. There's more, but I'm sure you get the point. I will say, though, that the sound is very good and the colors are great, but as soon as I can, I'll be giving this away to get something better."
Color not vivid.
nice tv sharp clear vibrant ciolorsand dynamic black very good speakers. buuuut its not 120 mhz. as a gamer i was drawn to that feature. its available on 55 and 65 inch models im told by google but im not sure. pretty let down
The TV looks and so far the picture has been great. I have never owned a TV with so many sound issues though. Apps and connected devices are having audio synch issues. They even have a audio delay option you can adjust but I see no improvement. I have 3 other RVs not TCL and have no issues with the same devices and apps.
Frequently disconnects Wi-Fi. Sometimes have to reboot it.
See above.
Don't be tempted by the good price. Won't go apps the first click. Always goes back to the home screen at least once. Don't even think about watching a sporting event. Ten minutes in the juddering will start. You will have to switch channels then go back. Don't be disappointed like me. I regret buying it.
"75"" Picture is just OK. Sound is the sad part. Sound changes intensity, from too soft to too loud, regardless of the sound settings."
"I purchased this TV on Prime Day (July 16) for my son’s birthday on August 31st.  When I turned it on for set up, there was a live bug in it.  I hoped it would find its way out, but as you can see from the picture it died and is a permanent black spot on the screen.  Then two weeks ago horizontal lines appeared on the screen, and after a few minutes the picture fades to black.Amazon says it’s outside the return window (30 days), and TCL is directing me to work through the retailer and not taking responsibility for the issues.Buyer beware.  I will never buy a costly electronic device gifts through Amazon anymore…especially on Black Friday or Prime Day, as they will be out of the return window when opened."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The cord it’s broke
"Unless you are a wifi wizard, you will not get this thing to reliably airplay or cast. Its tech is too old to make it work with mesh systems. I guess you get what you pay for with a $400 TV."
Color is not what i was led to believe was supposed to be better than Hisense and have the updated chip in it!
Google TV literally the worst TV OS ever. Keeps crashing
"Having more problems than a little bit with this TV. Constant disconnect from Wifi, TV not close enough to connect ethernet directly. Google Play store, you have to go through setting to get it to run. Many apps that just makes since is not marked as compatible, you have to side load and even then they may not work. The tv also has a camera. Would be nice to cover it up when not in use. Tried to sideload Whatsapp, but it couldn't get access to the camera."
The tv looks great and I was really excited to use it.I bought a used tv for a great price but the repackaging of the tv couldn’t handle the shipping I suppose… I was delivered a damaged product and I really hope I get my money back
"The headline says it all.  I tried multiple cables and multiple ports on on the router.  All I got was the 100MB connection. Why is this ""2024"" model V using 20+ year old technology?"
"As soon as I plugged in for the first time, tv was just a black screen with the backlight on. Did not work.Also when it was delivered, I specifically asked to have it delivered to the back of the house to avoid it getting stolen off the front porch. They delivered it out to the front in the open and didn’t even knock or ring the doorbell."
"I was excited to actually getting a 4k TV. My old TV is like 10 year old or more. Of course, it would come completely busted and nothing more than a 98 inch paper weight. To top it off, I have to wait weeks to have it picked up and it will probably be weeks after that before I get a refund."
I have bought another one of these tvs from target and i loved it. I decided to buy another one on amazon. The bottom part came broken and now there is a piece dangling. Disappointed with this vendor.
"TV 3 days past return date!  Was just now able to have someone install it for me but when taken out of box, screen cracked!  It’s worthless now!!!  Please let me know if there’s anyway to get refund.  Would be most appreciative! Thanks."
Didn’t even take the plastic off of it yet. Glad I checked it. Really upset there is no option to exchange it. I purchased it on prime day.  Now I’mjust getting a refund and have to pay full price to reorder. Extremely unhappy
This thing gives me a headache.
"After the first power up, the TV did a system update and the TV was useless after that. It would only flash the TCL logo over and over. Could not factory reset and try again. Contacted TCL support and they quickly passed me to warranty support to replace it, instead of troubleshooting it fully and trying to fix it. After a 2nd call where I requested a link to download the firmware to update the TV via USB, they assured me that link would be emailed. 2 days later, still didn't receive it, so I will return the TV to Amazon and avoid TCL product from now on."
just bought it 20 days ago and installed it 10 days ago and within 10 days the screen started peeling off from the top from the frame and I have to contact the TCL about the issue. Let's see how they do so I would recommend it. Do not buy it.Anyways Manufacturers ready to replace it but have to go through hassale
The volume on this tv is awful up and down on its own ear-piercing at times not a good quality. I wouldn't advise buying this always bought Samsung in the past this is junky piece of plastic. Now we start the warranty circle of pain.
"Make sure you open your package so you don't have a worthless $2,000 TV.  The screen had a massive shatterpoint."
I PAID 1082.49 FOR THIS TV . I RETURNED  IT BECUASE IT WAS DEFECTED AND I ONLY  RECEIVED 865.99CREDIT.. I WILL BE COMPLAINING  I DONT UNDERSTAND!!!
There was no damage to the box by shipping but when we opened it there was no packing material besides the thin sheet covering it. Plugging it in was when it showed the lines across the screen from damage.
Exactly what you’d expect with a google product. Interface is buggy and REALLY starts acting up after just a couple weeks to one month of owning the tv. It did this under minimal use.
Waiting for days and putting in a lot of effort to put the TV on. And found out the screen is totally cracked. Wasted my time and energy.
Kindly reminder: don’t remove the plastic wrap with the tv. It will help keeping screen on.
For some reason my screen has faded out within 3 months of having it.
"Worked fine for the first month then the screen suddenly went to black and only the sound was working. Very disappointed. I have a feeling they sell TVs that were previously refunded and then they ""repair them"" and sell them as new again."
One month and suddenly no image. Waste of money.
"TV didn't even turn on out of the box. Contacted TCL ""trouble shooting"" and they said to video the TV not working and they would assess how to proceed after reviewing my case. ???.  I returned it to Amazon,  ordered a Samsung and am happy with it."
"What i disliked is tv remote and legs were missing, and also tv would not turn on"
"2 tvs so far, 1st one damaged during shipping, 2nd one black screen, back light problem.  working on getting the 3rd television.  Insane!!!!!!!"
I haven't received a call or email about picking up this damaged tv.
Spend the money for a samsung you won't be disappointed
Good product. Buy it somewhere else other than Amazon. Poor customer service.
"A tv for general tv viewing.The tv screen is cracked, the box was open when delivered."
"The exterior of the box did not appear damaged aside from a small tear. Once we opened the boxes and plugged in the TV, we discovered the screen was damaged. Glad we tested the screen before we removed all of the protective plastic covering. I wish there was an option to order the replacememt set immediately but the return policy requires the unit be returned and refunded."
"waited days for this and it came in with broken glass and crack screen ,also the box was open when it arrived ."
this product is cheap for a reason immediate flickering screen/ heat damageEdit: turns out common TCL + QLED issue simple fix but i still wouldn't recommend
Ive had a echo on my television since I've bought it and I've even hired a technician to look at it. Still cannot get it to go away
It's ok does not do what it says on the box
Terrible doesn’t work no help on phone returning immediately
The TV does not connect to 5G WiFi networks which is quite insane for a 2024 model.
Wouldn’t power up!
"I have an LG smart tv. Already used to the concepts a smart tv can do.Bought the tv to replace our Sylvania ""dumb"" tv.At first, it would not find our wifi. Had to connect my PC cat 5 to the tv to get it to see wireless network and download the drivers to see my network. Once captured, it now sees my network and loads my current paid apps.Wanted to search for Xfinity Stream to avoid a 2nd tv cable box, and after a long try, turns out TCL did away with the app; on account the app is not compatible with TCL.Had no idea! It would have been nice upon opening the box, Xfinity Stream is NOT an option to watch live tv from. Better yet, it would have been nice to know that information prior to selecting the tv for delivery!That meant having to use our Apple TV box that has Xfinity Stream installed just to watch live tv from it.Nice tryTCL! Not only is TCL the preferred platform to view NFL games, it won't install Xfinity Stream app to watch them games live from."
The TV is about slow
a small line of dead pixels appeared after the first month of use.  It was great until then.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Picture quality is  good, sound is ok, nothing special. My biggest issue is with the darker colors. The picture has a white fog in the corners during dark scenes. I thought I would get used to it, it is a budget tv after all. That day never came unfortunately. It got more and more annoying.For the price I guess it’s fine. I had the same issue on the previous TCL Smart TV that I bought and ended up returning for this very reason, I bought the Q6 thinking it would not this issue being that it’s a newer model than my previous TV, should’ve done research prior to buying.This TV is a better option for watching sports and playing video games as the colors quite well. As far as watching movies, it falls short of expectations."
"65 QLED screen went out after 2 months, started with flickering lines and lagging, thought it might be the streaming, tried with dvd and gaming console, both had same issues. Got progressively worse and became unwatchable. Research showed it was the main board. Contacted TCL Cust service to use the warranty and that’s where the nightmare really started. To spare you the details, 8 weeks later, 10 phone calls, 20+ emails, multiple videos and pics sent, still no replacement tv. They’ve been saying it’s on the way for weeks but no tracking info or updates. Oh and I’m responsible for recycling the bad tv.Net/net it’s a cheap crap product and customer service is even worse. Avoid TCL all together!"
"Why was this delivered with highly visible box damage, especially with a flat screen inside?"
"Do you like ads everywhere as soon as you turn on the TV? Do you like launching the Youtube app and instantly get met with ads before doing anything? Then this tv is for you!I bought this TV because my last 55” TCL with roku was reliable and easy to use. This TV’s hardware can’t keep up with any input. It freezes, lags, and becomes unresponsive. Then on top of that Google TV is the worse OS I’ve ever had the displeasure to deal with. Advertisements are RAMPANT! The Youtube app forces you to watch ads constantly. If you forget to close the app before turning it off, you will be met with ad the moment you turn the tv back on.The picture quality is not great, spotted lighting.And to top it off, no matter what trick I tried this tv will not connect to my google home system. So the google app, remote, or home app won’t work on it.My brother bought the same TV for the same reasons as I and his has the exact same issues.Waste of money, do NOT BUY if you value your sanity."
I almost bought this but stopped short when I learned that TCL tvs do not support the Spectrum Tv app. That is my primary streaming source. Google is blocking this. I will not buy TCL.
"I have personally owned 2 tcl tv’s a 65in & 55in the 65in only lasted 2.5 years the 55in lasted 14 months both had issues with internet connections and other problems , both died  suddenly with no warning sighn of this happening , they are a waste of money, the life on this tv is short plus they have issues straight out of the box…….so if you have money to waste then buy a tcl television ."
"I asked here and was told that it woulf work with echo and echo sub, it does not. The Alexa app will recognize that it is a TV but will not give the option of linking to the home theater group. I was told here that it could connect through Bluetooth but it does not. I ended up moving the echo home theater group to another room with a fire tv, and purchasing a plain sound bar and Bluetooth woofer for this one."
"Tv stopped working after 2 months, wouldn't turn on. Amazon stated my 30 days was up, Called the manufacturer, TCL and I'm getting the run around, 4 weeks later, 4 - 1 hour phone calls, had to submit a video proving my outlet was working and the tv doesnt turn on and they are still reviewing. Now they want me to ship the TV to them, absolutely horrendous customer support!! Very disappointed customer."
"As a customer who has spent over $20,000 on Samsung products in the past month, including dryers, washers, refrigerators, stoves, TVs, and cell phones, I feel compelled to share my profoundly disappointing experience with this brand. Samsung, once known for innovation and quality, has become an obsolete brand, operating in a way that feels more like a scam than a trusted company. Here's why:Customer Service Lacks Any Interest in Helping the ConsumerWhen you call Samsung's customer service, it quickly becomes apparent that they are disorganized and unprepared to assist. Even though you're registered in their system, they often claim they don't have your information. Agents lack knowledge, and their support process is frustratingly inefficient.Unwillingness to Replace Defective ProductsDespite reporting issues with a new TV that arrived with clouding, Samsung refused to replace it, insisting instead on repairs. After long calls and numerous tests, they sent a technician who replaced the screen, but the clouding persisted. The technician then said there was nothing more he could do and left. When I followed up with Samsung for a replacement, they refused, stating that multiple repairs are required before considering a replacement—even though the product is less than 30 days old.Unprofessional and Ineffective TechniciansThe technician who visited did not take the issue seriously and dismissed the obvious defects visible on the screen. Their lack of accountability only added to the frustration.Declining Brand ReliabilitySamsung's products and service no longer reflect the quality and trust the brand was once known for. This experience has left me feeling scammed and betrayed as a loyal customer.I strongly advise against purchasing any Samsung products. There are better, more reliable brands in the market that prioritize customer satisfaction. Save yourself the frustration and disappointment. As someone who has invested heavily in Samsung, I can confidently say I will never buy another Samsung product again. Consider this review a warning to any prospective buyer.Think twice before choosing Samsung—it's no longer worth the risk."
"This TV definitely has Glare & Reflections.The Picture is OK with a totally dark room with no windows.Also the Display mode for Film maker seems to be the best.The other options make TV programs too sharp & looks really phony,My old 2005 Phillips TV had a great picture but quit working.. as a really expensive replacement I was really hoping for way better."
"I purchased the Samsung because of it capability to sync with my Sonos surround sound as well as to its unique ability to easily sync with the Spectrum app.  In these regards, is worthwhile purchasing this TV. However, Samsung does not easily allow you to modify the picture to your liking and its constant notifications and attempts to sell its services and programming are outright annoying."
"Wonderful TV, but completely loses audio at least once per day and has to be unplugged when using only TV audio - no external speakers.  As do our other two Samsung TV's.  Bug?"
"We purchased a Samsung Neo Qled in 2021.  It is a wonderful TV and the user menu is great.  We came back for this new Samsung in a larger size.  The new one has a good picture.  However, the user menu has changed for the worse.  All kinds of ads which are much bigger than the apps you are using.  In addition, we love the ""Picture Off"" option to enjoy the audio only.  This works with all the apps except Youtube TV.  (This works flawlessly on our older TV set with Youtube TV.)  Also, some apps will not load at all like SiriusXM.  I was on the phone with Samsung Support for hours and hours.  Reset to Factory, soft resets, hard resets, uninstalling apps, etc. and nothing fixed it.  Please Samsung, roll back the updates to match the 2021 TV sets.  We are now debating whether to send this back or deciding it's just not worth the trouble to do so and be stuck with it.Update:  After talking to YouTube TV Support and a couple of other apps, we find these apps are not compatible with the options on the new Samsung TV.  We have decided to keep the TV and hope Samsung will listen to our request to fix these problems."
"I should have read other reviews, the sound of this tv has major issues. Sporadically raising and lowering the volume to deafening levels on the high end to almost muted on low end. Went through all the settings, no help. Seems like many have had this issue. Save yourself and go with a $700-$800 model and not spend the extra $700. Picture settings also need to be changed often for different shows, channels, apps, etc"
"This has been a horrible experience, wish I could rate the product but after botched delivery attempts without messaging, not delivered when promised and when finally arrives I had to chase the FedEx guy for a block because even though I answered the vestibule-phone he left before I got down to the lobby of my apartment building. So instead of getting on 4/26 as originally promised, I finally got it on 4/30 and took the time to set it up but any app I choose gets ""Smart Hub is being updated."" message. So have been on the phone, in text message and in online Samsung support chat for 3 hours this morning while they all have me go through the exact same troubleshooting steps repeatedly that do nothing to resolve it. I get a Samsung rep on the phone who remotes-in and does all the checking and troubleshooting steps himself on my screen, reboots, etc. but problem is still not resolved, I still can't use any apps. So his solution is to have a service rep come out but the earliest is 5/6 which means I have no functional tv for the next 5 days after spending $2k+, waiting 4 days, spending hours setting up and several more hours on the phone with Samsung reps who could not get the apps to work. I actually do use my tv for cardio workouts which is necessary for my health but now have to wait 5 days just to use this brand new tv. this whole situation STINKS."
"ROKU battles with it.  Pic is great but I am sick of Samsung software, won’t let me alone without giving me all my info."
