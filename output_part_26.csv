"The only expertise I'll claim to is simply, being cheap I have had a medley of ring, blink, wyze and various Chinese random branded home cameras. Here are my opinions on blinkpro:of a named brand, cheapest camera, with no loss of qualityearly notify on eventsoffers save of clips locally with accessories purchased*+* notifies if power or internet go downcons:the biggest complaint I have with both blink and ring is the fact that everything that has any value is tied behind the requirement of paying them a monthly subscription. They call it a camera but unless you're paying Amazon it's a glorified motion detector. I don't know why it is so hard to Simply let me put a SD card in the camera and record 24-hour footage which is all I've wanted.The technology is there, Wyze can do it, why I've been slowly transitioning everything over to their infrastructure because they provide the feature I want and I am happy to pay them to bridge remote access to my cameras and host events for quick view. way all of these products should work. I don’t  know why you would pay for a camera that you can only get access to clips or live streaming for 2 minutes.No sub? Alert that there was motion, by time fumble app open. Ho good luck finding out who or when because you get notified without video or photo. AKA expensive motion detector disguised as a camera. but if that is all you need, great, $10 more gets you a Wyze cam that is just as good quality and you can record 24/7. Don’t work for them and I’m not a huge fanboy but just compared to the other big players in the bargain bin its apples and oranges they deserve comparison to nest or arlo but got that ring and blink price tag. (Feel free to send me a check lol)Blink at least let you buy some sync module tomfoolery that allows you to save Clips to a local drive but again not anything like a 24-hour recordable footage to a SD card that just overwrites as it fills. Sync module only a big deal because it offers illusion of owning your data when compared to the bloat king of worthlessness that is their big brother ring.  Complete trash, it is the definition of pay to use and should be avoided at all costs.dont get me started on ring because that’s not even scratching surface…blink service will notify where a camera is detected as being offline, super handy of course I never tested without a sub, because blink is likely even less useful then ring without a sub or sync module so would not be surprised if this basic feature isn’t only available with sub. But free Ring nor paid Wyze offer at all so +1I don’t understand why Ring and baby brother Blink have this moratorium on AI facial recognition and privacy. Why is it a company only gets serious about privacy after a second data leak or breach? And now Ring gets to stand on some pedestal about respecting privacy too much to use facial recognition? Nobody is buying it except the interns that fetch your coffee and run blink.Why don’t you stop hobbling your products and let me worry about what needs to be private on my property. I I look at my ring doorbell and it disgusts me, what a hobbled, crippled, worthless waste of carbon. People dig material out of grand, manufactured it, glued and screwed together this worthless thing for suckers like me to drop $150 on and 96 a years of I want a begrudged b a r e l y featured “security” camera Why are they holding basic functionality behind a paywall. Oh yeah profit before people, profit before product. Profit by purchasing every competing  small market small electronics  company and then stealing the best parts for their garbage line and then letting the carcass of whatever is left limp along in a slow death (“blink” and you will miss)So in closing this camera It'll let you know when it gets disconnected from the electricity or the internet other than that it is an overpriced motion detector unless you're willing to pay a subscription and even then only events.2/5 and both are given as charity with Thanksgiving in heart"
"For a security camera that, with an additional purchase of a sync module, can be used without a subscription, these aren't too bad. However they do have trouble telling where to focus at night, as well as have no control over the exposure points, so if you want to have them pointing at your yard from inside, they have to be right up against the glass or they will set their own exposure to see whatever dimmer area of your house is in frame. They lose connection to Wifi randomly, and will not reconnect because they will completely stop seeing your Wifi router, but every other one in the neighborhood will show up, until you reboot your Wifi router. So with all that, I can say that these are good, but not great."
We’ve had this camera for over a year now and I absolutely love it EXCEPT for two things that have become a deal breaker for me.We use this camera in our babies room.1. To use night vision the camera makes a “shutter” noise. HOW DUMB! It literally scares my baby and will actually wake him up! If you don’t want the shutter noise you have to turn night vision off which means it’s pitch black and I can’t see anything.2. The LED light. Same scenario as the shutter sound. I don’t want a green light to flash when i try to check in on my baby!I’m currently looking in to replacing this camera with something else because these two things make the camera not useable for our family unfortunately.
"We got two of these and use is as a puppy cam. The two talk is a great feature, and night vision camera lets a us check in.It does remajn plugged jn so linits where to position it. Video quality is good. Theres ks a little lag in the audio. Overall fairly good"
This camera quality was okay but could be betterThis camera can’t be adjusted at all so where you place it is where it will beMini as the description describesLightweightI never received any notifications as I watched people walk pass the cameraDoesn’t have great motion detectionWide angle nearPlugs into wall at all timesTwo way audio
"They advertise that this camera can be mounted onto the ceiling however I have a hard time, even mounting it to the corner of the window molding. Not because of the horrible instructions that come with it, but because the cord is very short, I don’t know if that’s something they didn’t notice or if that’s some sort of marketing plan to get people to go back and purchase a longer power cord. Other than that, it seems to be working just fine. I had a glare on it, but I’m assuming that’s from the lightbulb because I can’t go too high and I can’t go too low so it’s affecting the image. Definitely worth the $20 though."
"I just swapped this out from my other cams because of all the great reviews but these cameras suck.The picture is small, the image quality is poor, and the night vision is even worse.I dont understand all the good reviews. I bought 8 and sending them back"
"I have been using the blink cameras, both indoor and out, for about a year now. Originally, the cameras and app were easy to use and on point.After the most recent app update earlier this year, the app performance definitely changed. The app has gotten so complicated amd frustrating to use: recordings get stored out of order; some entire days are missing; switching from video to video used to be easy as there was an arrow to direct- now you have to go back to the home screen in between each one; when you want to download a video, you have to select the download button multiple times to hopefully download one copy as the app doesn't give you any indication the video was downloaded like it used to. This is especially irritating as you need to leave the blink recordings to look in the download/video gallery to see if it was downloaded then when you return to the app, you have to search through all the recordings again for to find the day/video you were looking at as the app refreshes the list of recordings to the most recent recording every time you leave. Also noted that the times of the videos being downloaded into the gallery are showing the time 7 hrs later than when the video is actually recorded.I have been in touch with Blink's customer service on these matters since Feb. I have only been told to wait for the next update and most recently- ...thank you for your contributions and well pass them on to our team...The one thing with the cameras performance is that my plug-in cameras often just stop recording for no distinct reason. Usually, simply disarming and arming the system again take care of this for the day.The cameras have been great overall. The app not so much. The customer service- I would appreciate it if the customer could seen their software folks are seriously looking into and trying to fix the issues."
"Update:After reading other reviews, I decided that my review of 2 was low balling this camera. Many other reviews are definitely user error, not reading the fine print or product description, expecting to get free service, or misunderstandings.I knew from the very beginning that I would need a subscription for this because I read the description before I purchased. I have 4 cameras now and pay $10/mo for unlimited cameras. It's a good price.  Expect to pay a subscription with security cameras unless you set up an expensive closed system with DVR.It's a breeze to set up.  Just use a device that's on your wifi that has the app on it (I used my tablet) enter the serial #, and connect to wifi. It takes 5 minutes.Cons: I can't control the microphone volume for recordings. Either you want it to pick up everything you say in your house,  no matter where you are,  or turn it off and pick up no audio..Notifications and recordings stop working sometimes; seems like it stops between 4am and 8am consistently which is really bad, and intermittently throughout the day.Grey zones that you select to not cause a motion detection (like a street with cars going by every few minutes) doesn't seem to work all of the time. I still get motion recordings of random cars driving by in zones I select to ignore.The LED lights can be turned off if you want the camera to not be so obvious. Turn off night vision if there is already light outside. Turn it on if it's pitch black dark.I go through all of the settings first before saying something doesn't work."
I love this camera now it works so well I am noticing so much more now with both of these cameras the blink pan tilt camera and the blink compact cameraI love this camera I needed this sooner I am so happy thank you blink
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                I have had mini blinks and a doorbell for years. I noticed at end of relationship that video clips were altered terribly and no sound. Reached out and was told unless I involved law enforcement,  there was nothing they could do. Ok, I was leaving anyway. I have roommates and put one up and only armed when not at home. So almost no clips. Fast forward to September I am doing data takeout from icloud and expired subscriptions for tracker from ADT Sofar and security key pass. Ok new I see somethings not right and.  He's good and in my phone somehow still and new phones with new appleID, went to android n nothing came to this phone. I moved camera and check to see nothing. I am doing final data pulls as I delete everything and on thumbnail into new laptop.  I start seeing videos of me in my room? What? I've never saved blink to icloud. He's been in blink creepily watching. I call n I get im sorry that happened! What? Where is rest of data? How did he log in with new phone, app, email, password and no trace. Send me directions to check devices? Really? If not armed and middle of night how is it recording for 6 minutes n on screen says next video is minute later? Altered? Then 2.5 minutes. For over a year! How did he get away with this and has to be imprint on blinks end! Then just freezes and I can not get hooked up bc says my wifi is wrong and just on wifi hours earlier. That site is terrible. I reached out again and sent me request for data form. If blink provides me with ip address or something going 100 miles south, I can reach out to law enforcement.  This gut messed w state computer files and I didn't notice- lost job for hippa breach! I am saddened by lack of concern or hard to believe no access to deleted clips!Come on Blink! I need you to step up with proper response of predator watching me for year multiple times a day! Unacceptable.Got 3 because cameras are very clear during the day and night could improve but still better than competition. Hopefully this is properly resolved. If so I will change to 5 stars with update! Truly creeper out!!"
"I have a doorbell with the protection box that slides on and secures to my front door. I also have the sync module with holder and usb. Finally, I have 3 indoor cameras.The cameras themselves were decent enough besides disconnecting when they wanted to and notifying about motion after the fact. The doorbell at night doesn't have a clear picture.Blink allows Amazon to sell other pieces of equipment like USB for storage, with their products. Then when theres an issue with said equipment there's nothing they can do besides giving me a smaller USB bc that's actually blink equipment. 😒 So in total I've had to receive a new doorbell camera, sync module USB and indoor camera. However I opted out of the camera bc by this time I was done with Blink systems.I cancelled my subscription because why would I pay for something that doesn't work properly.  They said my system would still work and store on the USB as long as I had the sync module. It's not saving on the local but on the cloud as if I had the subscription and it won't let me see the videos. I'm over it!I've been back and forth with Blink about their products over the past 2 years trying to find solutions but it would always end up not being long before I had to call again, even asking for a refund on their equipment that didn't work properly most of the time. Of course they told me there's nothing they can do about that and to take it up with Amazon since that's where I bought it but Amazon hasn't given me a refund."
FINAL UPDATE: We live in a world of greed. People wanting to get rich. Not just make a living. Certain aspects of technology allows certain people to throttle performance. It worked great at first but a combination of internet providers and this manufacturer taking away features unless you pay them is a cop out against advancement. Why offer a better product capable of more at the same price when you can charge more for nothing... I really liked this system and hoped they would improve. Instead they chose to cheat the consumer. 😔 I have 8 of these mini cameras and 1 failed. Wouldn't connect back up. Worked for a year then went out. I invested so much money purchasing the minis and outdoor cameras for its ease of use and battery for easy connection and small footprint only to have them swindle people by taking options away and charging for it when previously it was an incentive to buy these. 👎 Looking back I should have purchased a more reliable security system. This is now just an expensive baby monitor that is not reliable. The minis are plugged in yet it only records in 30 sec slips with a minimum 10sec delay. If it is plugged in with constant power it should be able to record all day long or as long as your thumbdrive will let you. Its cloud service so they don't want you to cloud up their cloud. Bottom line this entire system is not recommended anymore. With some tweaks it would be THE system to get but with the quirks unreliability and paying extra for options that use to be included ... this is not a system worth spending money on for a real security system.UPDATE 4/28/21: I put up with all the flaws and problems and cloud storage was not a problem as you can save to a thumbdrive. But now they took away the ability to save live clips. You have to sign up for a monthly plan. I no longer recommend this system. You might as well pay for ADT or something.picture quality is good just as good as the all new Blink. Maybe a hair less maybe but overall clear image quality. The contrast colors dynamic range sharpness all pretty good and i don't even have it on the highest quality setting. 😮 Night vision is also just as good and you have some adjustments with the app. Audio is good doesn't have the humming and hissing as much as the battery powered ones. Speaker is ok you can clearly hear and speak but at close range like within 6ft. Volume could be louder. Motion detection works good. You can't be 50ft away and expect it to pick up motion consistently. You can adjust the sensitivity but you risk it picking up the slightest bit of movement. Its pretty good turning on slightly before entering frame especially with the beta option on the app at a normal reasonable range.I have 2 of them one in the garage and one in the back porch. I know these are indoor cameras but will see how they hold up. They are not going to get wet and we'll see how they handle hotter and colder temperatures than being indoors.The weather is nice right now so I hooked up an external battery and hid one in a flower pot. Makes for a nice spy cam sorta the white color sticks out. If you have the Blink system I don't see how you can pass these up. I got a 2 pack at $65 and they were also on sale for $25 each. At that price get some whether you plug it in to a wall socket or use an external battery this makes for a great addition to the Blink system. 😎👍I like the size of this camera. Too bad its not waterproof or battery powered. I hope they plan on a zoom feature in the future. 😉UPDATE: I'm about 5 months in and about a month ago there is a steady increase in the amount of failed views and failed thumbnails. It will also all of a sudden drop from the 30sec recording setting I have to a sec or two or even just a screen shot with blur. I can't get it to record back to normal. Frustrating and unreliable. I'm dropping the stars.UPDATE: After some troubleshooting I found that resetting the router and modem got everything back working again. So I'm raising the stars. Lets hope it doesn't need a reset frequently. 😉👍 Next version should be HD with zoom.UPDATE: It seems I'm having to reset the router and modem again and again more frequently now. The clips are shorter than what is set sometimes freezes skips or fails altogether. It's not working the way it should and happened after an update. 😐
I like this product but it is very obvious you are logged in when you are trying to spy on your kids they know instantly because a light turns on.
"The ten second pause between recordings is really frustrating. Bought this to monitor the litter box activity of each of my five cats for health reasons..needed to know how often one of them is urinating and the amount (for kidney function), how often and what volume/consistency of another cat’s BM’S (for megacolon), and who might be sick as evidenced by diarrhea. Although we have one litter box per cat, it was impossible to know who was using which one, etc.  This camera helps immensely in this area, but the pause in between recordings means that sometimes (and often) a cat may finish and cover it’s waste during that 10 seconds and I don’t get to see what and how much they deposited. By the time we get home and multiple cats have used all the litter boxes randomly, we can’t tell whose covered poop or pee is whose.Other than that, I love these cameras!!!  We have the plug-in models and it’s simple and easy to plug one in, have the app see them instantly and ask you to label them, etc. and then it starts doing its thing. You can adjust each camera’s settings individually as to length of clip, whether to continue recording the full designated length even if movement stops, sensitivity to motion, which areas “in frame” you don’t want the camera to monitor (I.e. you have a fan going and its causing a curtain or plant or some such to flutter repeatedly which causes the camera to record clips endlessly, which then makes scrolling through thousands of clips to find what you need a time-consuming and tedious process. To this end, a helpful feature enables you to choose  which camera’s clips you want to see, reducing the time it takes to find what you need to review. Other helpful features as well. Quality of videos and the night vision is decent.I think the price is a great value for what you get. You do have to have a subscription in most cases…I can’t remember why…I think it has to do with the storage of thousands of clips for extended periods of time, but I could be wrong. I just remember that to get the full benefit of a camera monitoring system, you have to subscribe and pay monthly or yearly. I don’t mind this since for now we can afford it. BUT I DO NOT LIKE THAT THEY AUTOMATICALLY RENEW THE SUBSCRIPTION EVERY YEAR AND CHARGE YOU WITHOUT NOTIFYING YOU AHEAD OF TIME AND ASKING IF YOU WANT TO RENEW. Therefore, it’s  one of those subscriptions for which you’d better set a reminder on your calendar at least 60 days prior to the renewal date, so that you can decide if you want to renew and have time to give the required advance notice of cancellation if that’s what you choose.So basically, there are significant pros and cons in using this camera and subscription service."
"Had I known what I know today I would have never wasted my time ordering these cameras. Going to try and make this as short as possible So, my stepdad was released from the hospital March 3rd. We were told by his doctor he should be going to Hospice, but respecting my step dads wishes to pass at home I needed to get an indoor monitoring system set up throughout the whole house so all of us could help my mom keep an eye on him 24/7. Well I placed my order march 5th with same day delivery 5pm to 10pm. Needless to say I did not receive it on the 5th, as a matter of fact, I received a notification that there was an error with my address at around 8:27. Even though I have been getting items delivered to my store address for a few years now and they had literally made two other separate deliveries to this same address earlier that day. And I had been sitting there at my store on my day off waiting for these cameras. If there was ANY order I needed to have come through for piece of mind that day it was the cameras. So I could set them up at home and monitor my stepdad while I was at work with some piece of mind. So maybe about 30 mins after I get that notification I call customer support. Explain to them the address is right and even CS can see the 2 packages that were delivered earlier. CS tells me wait until end of day, if  it not delivered by then, they will try tomorrow. If I do not receive the package tomorrow they will cancel the order and send the money back to my card. March 6th. I wait all day at my store, mind you again, on my day off waiting for these cameras to come in. Midnight rolls around, no new updates or notifications on the cameras. So I assume they are going to cancel the order. I go home. March 7th. I wake up at 8AM on this day. Sometime between 1am and 5AM i get two emails and one notification. 1st email says package is being delivered. 2nd email says package has been delivered. The notification on the amazon app says ""It was handed directly to a receptionist or someone at a front desk. Signed by: Jackdnd."" I got up out of bed immediately with a WTF!!? and who TF is Jackdnd?. Our store is closed between 2AM & 11AM. The cleaning crew does not get there until 7AM. So I am speeding through traffic to find out what is going on. I ask the cleaning crew if they signed for a package they said no but one was laying out front when they got there. No reason for my crew to lie about it... But the fact, the app said it was brought to reception and signed for.....On top of that it is well known our contract with the towing company has them keeping our P. Lot clear during our closed hours. And I know their drivers names as well...so there's that now onto the cameras themselves. 2 of the cameras worked properly out of the box, one was absolute double vision blurry. And after the fiasco with trying to get them delivered I was not going to try and contact CS again to try and get a replacement. Luckily I know enough about electronics myself that I was able to pull apart the camera and repair the camera back to perfect clarity.I will say at the price cost for picture they are better than my outside ring cams. But the ring app has a few more customizations to it. So if you want great picture = Blink, If you want good picture but more functionality = Ring"
"I really really like the ease of installation and picture quality of this mini camera. I'm rating this a 3-star, however, because one of the cameras in the two-pack I purchased was defective. I communicated with Blink's service, but unfortunately could not get the camera to connect to the network despite numerous trouble-shooting attempts. Therefore, I had to return the product. I would love to have 2 or more working Blink mini cameras, but I'm not sure whether I am going to re-order in the future and take my chances."
"I really wanted to like the cameras, as I was hoping to move away from Nest cams to something else.  The Blink cameras were extremely simple to set up, and the video quality is excellent.  However there are way too many flaws to make them my primary home security system cameras.1.  Motion detection doesn't really work well.  When I was out of town, I had family check in on my house 3 different times.  Of those 3 times, with someone walking directly across the camera field of view about 8 feet away from the camera, only once did it trigger a motion alert.  The nest cam I had in the next room over picked up the motion even though the person was 20-30 feet from that camera and only walking across a small portion of that camera's field of view.2.  There is no home/away assist to turn them on and off.  I want all my entry/exit/outdoor cameras to be on and alerting 24/7.  However for my indoor cameras, I typically want them to turn off when I come home, and then turn back on when I leave the house.  Several other camera vendors offer that capability, but I haven't found a way to do that natively in the Blink app.3.  No multi zone-based detection alerting.  The app does have a ""zones"" feature, but unfortunately, it only allows you to define two zones, on and off.  It doesn't allow setting up multiple zones, each with their own specific recording and alerting policies.  I have one camera facing my front yard, which covers the street where I park my car, as well as the walkway to my front door.  Ideally I want to have my front walkway always detecting, recording, and alerting me when there is any motion.  For where my car is usually parked, I want it always recording when there is motion, but not to alert me, since cars driving by would typically set that motion detection off.  For the rest of the street as well as the sky, I do not want any detection or recording.  Other competing produces allow doing this, but Blink does not.4. Live view often fails (probably close to 50% of the time that I want to access them), especially if motion detection has just triggered.  When I open the app and try to open the live view, I often get a ""Live View Failed"", ""System is busy, please wait"", or ""There was a problem, please try again in a few minutes"" popup.  This especially almost always seems to happen if I get a lot of motion alerts in a row.  Force closing the app and reopening doesn't fix it, it stays broken for at least 10-30 minutes.  This makes the system unusable as a security system, as I cannot check what events are occurring and whether or not someone was trying to break in and I need to call the police.5.  Theres no multi-camera view.  I have multiple cameras set up, and in the Blink app, while the home page shows all your cameras, they're just pre-recorded thumbnails that you manually refresh.  You can't view all the camera feeds at once to see the overall state of your home.  Again, this makes it less useful as a home security system.Overall, I like the cameras themselves, however the software on them especially the Android app leaves a lot to be desired, and is lacking the feature sets that several competitors have.  I don't think I'd use these as a primary security system camera, but they are good as informational cameras."
"Not the best, but it’s works. Struggles WiFi connection and app is very slow, but it works I guess."
"I continue to be amazed at how bad this product really is. My friend bought one on sale. I warned her she should return it but it's just $20 so small loss. Amazing bad ui. Get a motion alert (many moths, etc) tap it a few hours later and it brings you to locked live view. Useless. Have to close the app, find it and Launch it to see the non events. Wyze on the other hand let's you get alerts only for people, if that's what you choose. Wyze will be pretty bad without service so plan on 15 to 20/yr per camera, but way less than blink for up to 5 cameras and their AI is actually good. Week 4. After spending hours corresponding with tech support and trying all kinds of stupid steps because their device simply doesn't work, I ordered a Wyze V3 to test it out. Set it up so it sees the same area. Turned off night mode so it uses its high gain color sensor and wow. What a difference. I'm not sure everything works correctly, but even if it doesn't, what does is better than this junk.Based on all camera reviews, I purchased $3 2 year warranty just in case.Camera quality - wyze, sound and speaker - blink, notification actual - wyze, notification sound - blink (probably setting for wyze), night camera - definitely wyze. Cost / yr for service - wyze @15 per vs blink at 36 per or 120 for bunch. Onboard recording - wyze.No service option. Neither. It seems like with both while the camera works without annual service, with blink you need sync module which probably also has technical problems since they seem incompetent, and with wyze, they clearly disclose many limitations on alerts, recording options, review options, etc. For the effort 1.50 to $2 / mo will be worth having full feature set.Region marking for detection wyze. Mounting and pointing - blink. I'll have to buy better mount for wyze to put it in a good location. Probably would have with blink to.Return - BLINK IS HORRIBLE. Wyze, I don't know and hope not to. With blink, because the product didn't work so I was returning it as defective, my choices were print a label. My printer stopped working. Or stay home from work to hand the $20 junk to ups. Amazon rep had difficulty with the detail, but when I typed in all caps that no one would be home for ups, is this OK? He went away for 5 min and just gave me my money back. OK, but I really would rather return it. Of course what's the point. It doesn't work, but it probably works as well as any other new part of this item because the problems are firmware/software.Night Vision horrible compared to Wyze V3, motion detection good when it works but non existent on transition from night to day. Picture quality OK but nowhere near wyze V3 quality.Week one.. We'll this is a bust. Tech support says. Check the early notification box. Nitwit. Is not that I don't get an early notification, it's that I get no notification, recording, etc.Basically, the camera ceases to function until I access it with the app. Seems to only happen overnight. I'll bet it has something to do with night to day transition or update check, but it's basically worthless without a Reliable detection function.Also getting late night recordings where the first 5 seconds have audio but no video. I suspect it's a prerecord feature where the light is not on until motion is detected. I like that it prerecords.Day3: tested yesterday evening and night before bed, picked up motion no problem. Walked out front door this am and nothing again. Gave it a minute. Checked app, test again nothing. Live view, lock phone, test and it picks up.Seems like you have to live view to reset which is DEFINITELY not acceptable.Day2;I have it set up so it catches my front door. Worked great first day, second morning I walked past 3 times and it occurred to me I didn't get notified. Checked, everything correct. Searched problem, apparently app is still crap. Returning defective. Not worth the $20 sale price if it doesn't detect. Was about to invest in a bunch of outdoor, but I'll go with a different brand for sure. I'll give it a week, but definitely not ordering all the other products today as I had planned."
"I bought the mini because the door camera wouldn’t connect to my wired chime in the house and the mini can be used as a doorbell chime, sadly, even with the volume all the way up on the mini and the door camera, it’s very low and if the tv is on, you can’t hear the chime. The Camera itself is great but disappointed with the loudness of the chime"
"I bought this at the end or April. I didn't get around to installing it until August. After spending over 90 minutes trying to create the new account, link, FUSS AROUND... it would NOT link to my RING app. It connects to Alexa but that's useless. I want it to open the backyard cam with my other two cams.NOPE! It took me 15 minutes of internet searching and I actually found it on the BLINK website that it's not compatible.BEWARE WHEN BUYING OTHER PRODUCTS SOLD/DISTRIBUTED BY AMAZON. My return window is closed and, of course, there is virtually NO WAY to contact Amazon about this.I'm keeping it but now I have to open yet another app to see my backyard.The camera works fine. I gave it a three star response. Amazon should get a -1 star response for this misrepresented listing."
"I purchased multiple Blink items overall review-A real security system gives you at least 4 zones that can be adjusted and armed separately. It has an audible alarm, it may also have a cell phone connection. I have owned several such systems and had good service from them.Blink has none of these qualities.You can have ""zones"" but each will cost you $35 to $40 for a sync module so, 4 zones min $140 and you have nothing else. The cameras are not real motion detectors, as illumination does not set off motion detector like the blink cameras and doorbell do; hence multiple false alarms. If you use lights on timers  in the room with blink cameras they false alert each time a light turns on or off. Light control is a big part of security. Blink IR is very poor by today's standards.The Blink door bell has a sensitivity adjustment, but set to lowest setting it still alerts when a car goes down the street. It is 80' from my Blink doorbell to the edge of the road and it false alerts every time a vehicle goes in either direction.r I have mine on battery; you can hard wire it in place of your existing doorbell). Amazingly it alerts to cars but not to Amazon delivery people right in front of it. Yes it recorded 9 cars today (I live in a Cul-de-sac or I would have smashed the doorbell by now) but not the ghost that placed my Amazon package on the porch right in front of it.The Mini Cameras alert every time a light is turned on or off, but sometimes doesn't when I walk by.To use local storage instead of cloud you have to have at least one Sync module and an SD card. So if you have four zones as above example you add $10 to $20 per SD for each module which adds another $40 to $80 to your cost. Now all of your ""security recordings"" are on 4 different devices and totally separate. Does this sound like a security problem?The outdoor cameras are all three still in the box so I cannot tell what problems they will add. Too disappointed with Blink so far to waste time adding to my disappointment.The Echo Dot and Echo Show which Amazon recommended to go with the blink system are also still in the box so no info on problems they might have.I purchased all of this prior to Christmas in order to update and improve my 8 to 10 year old small security system. I do not use the Cloud for any security purpose so local storage was a must. Due to life in general, I did not have time to open and set everything up. When I finally got around to it, I became aware that the Mini's would work, but I had to purchase a Sync module to have local storage. Later found out that local only transfers videos to SD once a day and will NOT record Live View (yeah this is a security system LOL). You may notice that Blink does not tell you a lot of this in their description. For way less money I could have purchased a legitimate, real security system with 4, 6 or 8 zones and cameras with wifi and had something that I would trust and not hate. A friend suggested that I sell Blink on Craigslist. I told him the Blink system is bad: I would feel like a criminal asking money for it. It would make a good baby monitor using the Mini cameras, I guess.Amazon refuses to stand behind the Blink system since it is past their return date. I spoke with customer service and she transferred me to someone else for assistance with the Blink and they just hung up on me when I told them it was totally unsatisfactory.Buyer Beware. Just because Blink is owned by Amazon does not mean you will be pleased or they will stand behind it.I bought it, I didn't use it before return date so my fault for not doing my research. Now cut my loss and go to Costco and purchase a real functional security system."
Overall I love these newer blink mini cameras. There is a known bug though where sometimes they don't trigger after the lighting in the area has changed and caused the IR mode to engage/disengage. The camera stops seeing motion and you have to reset them to get it to work again. Blink seems to know about the issue but hasn't done anything to solve it as far as I know.
"After using this unit  for a few weeks, I have noticed it seems to drop the ability to detect motion about every other day or so.  I usually power cycle it every day. Or change some settings and change it back.  So not very reliable but otherwise I really like it and will continue to use it.On the positive side:As someone who has been writing software since 1982 I was impressed with the software interface.  It is first class and it is refreshing to see software moving forward not backward (which it sometimes does.)I used the camera as a window mount.  Blink does not sell at is such so take my review with that in mind.  Amazon sent me a reminder that I might want to buy a third party window mount.  I did so.As a window mount you have to fiddle with some settings to get it to work at night.  You need to set the Infra-Red settings to LOW, which is to basically turn if off.  I think there is another setting I may have adjusted to get it to work at night as a window mount.You have to pay for a subscription to its cloud storage.  You have 30 days to decide.  The subscription rates are low so if you like the camera I would buy it.WYZE has a camera that has better motion detection but lower software quality. It also has local storage (not subscription based cloud)  I tried the WYZE solution but started to get ""Operational Failures"" within six months. Probably trying to write to the SD card.  I also upgraded the WYZE firmware and the unit stopped working.  It ""bricked"" as we used to call it.  Total failure.  I would not buy WYZE."
"I bought 4 Blink Mini cameras, including one pan and tilt unit, plus two Blink Wired Floodlight Cameras, a Video Doorbell, and a Sync Module 2 with flash drive.I originally cursed Blink cameras with a flaming one-star review because all of my Minis would stop recording at least once a day at random times every day. Live view still worked, but they stopped detecting motion and therefore stopped recording until they were power cycled. This rendered them essentially useless as security equipment. Blink support reached out to me, requesting that I grant them access to my cameras' log files, and they also sent me a single new Mini to replace any one of the cameras, to determine if it was a hardware issue.I was very skeptical of this being an isolated hardware issue, unless there was an entire bad run of cameras, since all were effected. Note that Blink did not specify that any particular unit be replaced. After just replacing the Mini in my garage, the entire system performed vastly better. I only knew for sure of one missed motion event, and since the replacement I have not had to power cycle any of the cameras.The odd thing about this incident is that even Blink support could not explain what made the system start working when one Mini was replaced at random. I had assumed that they had tweaked something at their end, but apparently that was not the case.Night vision has a couple of issues. Even at the lowest setting of the IR LEDs, at close range peoples faces tend to look blank because of the strong glare. A brighter setting allows you to see further away in the dark, but makes glare at close range much worse. Also, switching from night vision to color mode when a light is turned on or an outside door is opened to daylight, it takes at least 5 seconds to adjust, during which the image is washed out white.When using local storage instead of a cloud storage subscription, access to the recorded videos is very slow. It can take 20 to 30 seconds for a clip to start playing when clicked. With a subscription, playback is almost instant.For now, I am quite pleased with the system I have. It does have a few shortcomings compared to other camera systems, but for the price and the ability to record video locally without a paid subscription, it's a pretty good deal."
"We got two Blink cameras in 2020, and to be honest, they have worked great. We mainly use them to check on our dog (love the voice feature for this reason) and also for peace of mind when we're at work. Then we moved and forgot to put them back up for a while, so we set them up with the free subscription. Aftet that expired came the problems. The issue isn't the cameras--it's the system glitch that won't let us connect Blink to an Amazon account. The system says the Amazon email is already linked to a Blink account, which it isn't, neither on the Blink app nor on Amazon subscriptios. And to get the subscription, you have to link the two, but when trying to link the two, it says the Amazon email is linked, so you can see the problem. The customer service is trash. They couldn't figure it out and told us to sign up for a different Amazon account, which seems ridiculous to set it up just for Blink. I responded as much and said I would contact Amazon to see if they could sort it or else cancel my Blink plan, and the customer service rep just said, ""thanks, have a nice day; we're closing this ticket."" So essentially a snarky customer service version of the middle finger. I'm not actually sure they even read my complaint given that the different colored text in the email suggests they copy-pasted the salutation and automated response from two different sources. I'm posting here because come to find out, other people have had this same issue. There are entire online forums of people complaining, but Blink apparently doesn't care. I guess they make their money on the hardware not the subscription. Suffice it to say they lost my patronage. And to Blink, thanks! Have a nice day. We're closing our account."
Dog bought this item to go with my camera and so I can have a ring chime to go with my doorbell which the doorbell rings outside the house not inside the house which I had already found that to be totally insane but now you have to buy some separate so it can ring inside the house bought the camera it has not wrong not one time I have had this for months and I'm still waiting to hear the ring I have called customer service numerous times to help me set this up so I can ring and so I can know someone's at the door I have to be alerted by my phone with my ringtone not worth the money
"I bought this to monitor my indoor plants growing, not only can you not see any of the vegetables the leaves are difficult to see. On the plus side the audio quality is surprisingly good. Also it takes 2 minutes sometimes to pull up the feed on my phone."
The cameras go offline way too often and it’s not my Wi-Fi it’s the camera and having to pay for a service that isn’t reliable is a bit frustrating. No way for me to access and get back online away from home isn’t a good thing either.
I have two of these cameras and one is crystal clear but the second one I ordered arrived and was blurry right away and I haven’t been able to fix it. Debating ordering a new one but would prefer to trouble shoot this one first if possible.
I'm sure the camera is great but my bank card was hacked while trying to set up the account for the cameras. Not sure if this was a freak accident or what but I haven't even tried setting them up again because of being hacked the first time.
"So this camera works fine, and is easy to setup. No issues there.The app however doesn't let you view for more than 30 seconds without either constantly hitting `Continue` or you lose the feed. Maybe that's fine if all you do is quickly check. But if you want something you can leave on and just glance at, then its a dealbreaker. You can either live with that, or pay extra to have it continuous. Given the options out there, I see no reason to do either. The camera also produces an audible click every time you access the feed, so I would constantly distract my dog if she was nearby every time I check in.In this price range, I think the best option is the 𝗧𝗮𝗽𝗼 by TP-Link 2K. It has a nice app, doesn't cut off your feed, and the camera does't click. It also acts as a standard IP camera that offers the feed over RTSP streams, so if you wanted you could access via third party software and you're not locked into their app. I have two of these blink cams, and wish I had discovered the Tapo earlier."
So these mini work well for picture but the audio is horrible because the mic pics up every bit of background noise. Even if people are talking louder than the thing causing background noise. I have a wall AC unit that while next to it you can barely hear it run. But the camera makes the noise it makes so loud you would think your in a construction site during demolition. If you are only looking to have picture these work wonderful. But if you want audio with it like being used to monitor your baby or small child I would not recommend these.
"For the money, it's hard to resist these little cameras. The promise that you can use them without a subscription with the addition of the Sync Module is even more enticing. But in practice, Blink just disappoints. To be clear, the cameras work great the Sync Module stores clips locally without purchasing a subscription, but the niggling limitations Blink puts on the functionality as punishment for not subscribing are infuriating. Here is a list of features you don't get unless you subscribe:Motion detection video recordingLive view recording60-day unlimited video historyRapid video access (instantly watch your videos as soon as they’re recorded)Video sharingPhoto capture (images captured periodically for more coverage)I'd almost be happier if the product were garbage instead of feeling like I only purchased a gateway product to entice me to get hooked on the subscription features. I'm not opposed to a subscription model, but only if it's for features that can only be offered remotely or ones that offer constant upgrades. This trend of selling vessels for subscriptions is soul-crushing and ethically reprehensible.So without a subscription, the Sync Module will only record motion-detected clips. Not live-view. That, of course, means you have to have motion detection enabled all the time, and it will record every single time you walk in or out of a room, which overflows the module with useless clips. I use my cameras to monitor my pets, and I'd like to just be able to peek in on a room, see if my pet doing something worth recording, and record it. I should be able to do that without storing my clips in the cloud.Second, when you have a subscription, you can access clips almost instantly. Accessing the clips on the Sync Module is painstakingly slow, and for some reason, you're unable to access videos if you have a live view active. Unless you have a subscription, there is no option to delete multiple clips or even all the clips. To quickly delete multiple clips, you have to eject the USB storage, put it in a computer and manage the files there.Next, live views are limited to 30 seconds without a subscription. Then you have to manually click on ""continue"" to keep watching. I don't even understand why that would be. If I want to watch a camera all flippin' day, I should be able to (barring any overheating). They, of course, offer extended live view with a subscription.The cameras themselves are pretty good. They provide decent images covering a fairly wide FOV. Night vision is sub-par but passable. It's only in black and white and is significantly grainer than a well-lit area. That is to be expected, but I've seen better. Setting up the cameras is a snap, though each time, the process crashes the first time. On the second attempt, after restarting the app, it connects smoothly. The app is fairly easy to use, though I'd like to be able to arrange the camera views in a matrix rather than jut on top of each other. One really annoying thing is when you do a live view on an iPad, even in portrait mode, it shows the video really small, and you always have to hit the full screen icon. Motion detection is too finicky; either it detects nothing or everything regardless of the level. Selecting activity zones is not very intuitive because it can't tell the difference between a moving object and change in lighting or a shadow.All in all, I would say that I am more frustrated by the features Blink withholds from the customer than I am pleased with the actual product. However, I could not find an alternative at a comparable price."
"I bought 2 of the minis for inside, in addition to the 2 blink outdoor cameras, sync module, and the doorbell. All of those seem to operate as expected with the exception of completely going offline one time and all other wifi was fine. Had to manually reset sync module. That would not have been good if i was out of town.The minis don’t seem alike. The coverage is not far at all, especially with one of them and doesn’t seem to always collect movement. Not impressed with them.I should note Ive had these for 3 weeks."
"Mini camera is easy to install and setup but if you use for window view, there’s a reflection of the camera in the video. It make the view blurry"
"Made this purchase to keep an eye on my pets and apartment while out of town and they were on sale.I’ll start by saying they would not be worth the purchase at full price. Probably my biggest grievance is that these cameras serve as only that unless you want to pay a monthly subscription. Granted, it was my own fault for not reading further in the description to realize these require a monthly subscription to serve as genuine security cameras and even then they are a questionable option for that.The subscription is conveniently set up so if you have 2 or more cameras you’ll pay $11/month while one camera is only $1. The whole thing feels slimy.To clarify: a subscription is the only way for the camera to record any movement or activity when the system is armed, otherwise Blink will send you a notification that movement was detected but when you go to view the clip it will remind you that you need a subscription to do so. Slimy.That being said, the movement detection is extremely unreliable and not always effective. When movement is actually recorded, I would prefer to receive one 2 minute clip as opposed to 15 ten second clips. The video quality is relatively decent with a decently wide view. Night mode is okay.These cameras are barely worth the base $50, let alone a monthly subscription for them to function as anything more than a camera."
Just wanted to tell you I got it to work now.  So you can charge me for it again.
I have to return the one camera because there is no power in it.  It doesn’t work at all.
"I use these in the windows in front of my doors. Most of the time they work, but for some reason the motion detection isn't triggered. I don't know if it's because it's behind windows but I didn't want to install anything outside. I also have one installed indoors and seems to have the same problem. It's like it goes to sleep after no activity and it has to wake up before it starts recording."
Nice little camera..con is there is like a 5 second delay and for being in a kids playroom it's y it received 3 stars..
"Great image quality, semi-okay set up.  would be 5 stars if the app auto switched your phone to your 2.4mhz band wifi router.  Its a fracking PITA to connect when 98% of all phones now only connect to 5mhz wifi with chance in hell of forcing a 2.4 mhz connection to complet the setup.  Great thing i have a 5 year old 802.11n tablet i keep around for S&G's."
It’s a cute little camera. Very easy to set up. I got a set of 3 to put in my windows bc I’m renting my residence. I was disappointed to find out that they do not work at Night in my windows. Which is the main reason I ordered them. I wanted to feel safer at night with my Child. Turns out these won’t work guess I’ll have to send them back.☹️
"Product is pretty good. I've had them for about 6-8 months, doorbell eats battery life and have to change a lot.Complaint- one of my camera that has motion sensors on and is facing outside towards my door. When I first got the cameras id always get 2 notifications,, one from the door and one form the camera inside facing the door. Now that camera continuously goes off for motion and nothing will be there, or it may be the shadows but it will notify me probably every minute for almost an hour for motion outside. But then when it needs to work it doesn't detect motion of people walking up to my house.... I go to the settings and check the camera on live and it seems fine but for someone reason the motion detection is wack... Other 2 cameras work fine tho 🫡"
Love the camera- clear video! Did not know that there is a monthly fee of $11.99! Disappointed
"This was a great product at first, but in the last few weeks it goes offline more often than the camera is on.  Which makes it difficult to get movement notifications in real time. This model is a plug in that connects with my phone app (not my internet) so there’s no reason it should keep going offline. I’m about to go with something different that’s more reliable."
"I've used Blink cameras outside for some time and they work fine, these fell short of my expectations. Perhaps my location choices contributed to the many motion triggering for shadows but they also bounce in and out of black/white and color within a clip as well as many clips ending abruptly, etc. Never have this issue with my older cameras connected to the same sync module."
"I purchased these cameras to use in my toddlers’ bedroom to monitor them playing as I’m doing daily chores and I like the ease of set up and picture quality  along with night vision but I don’t think I would buy this product again because the motion detection video only records up to 30secs.there is a delay in the notification for new clips. It does not detect small movements it only detects active movement such as walking, raising a hand and other similar movements. Some details get left out of the 30 secs video so I am concerned that if the kids were to hurt themselves the camera will not capture the full incident. They will due for the time being but I prefer Ring camera over these unless there is major improvement overall"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Things I like about blink: 1 I love the affordability of the indoor blink mini cameras 2 I like the little Mount that allows full tilt and rotation without requiring any tools to adjust angles 3 The camera quality meets my expectations 4 the entire system sync and 3 cameras were super easy to set up and took little to no time without any written instructions 5 using sync without subscriptions all your clips are remotely saved on a usb vs an sd card like other cameras or a company wide cloud-Features  that I wish blink would incorporate: 1 continuous recording option  2 date/time stamps on video (if you need to download footage there’s 0 date/time stamp) 3 independent notifications (wish I could turn notif off for one camera and leave on for another, as well as adjust to notify for motion, sound, or human detection but camera would still record while notifications were off) - blink allows me to disarm cameras separately to turn off notifications but then no clips are recorded for said camera 4 live camera preview when opening the app or in notification previews 5 once only on sync no way to filter footage by camera/date/etc. 6 add photo/video preview to sync only footage similar to cloud clips-There’s a few things I think blink could improve on as well: 1 motion detection recording entire duration, not just a max of 30 seconds with a minimum of 10 seconds between retriggering camera 2 motion sensitivity -I find certain obvious things are not being recorded 3 turning off notifications in app still leaves notification bubble over app itself 4 I have early notification turned on and I still am only being notified after motion has ended. I’ve tested with a camera in my kitchen real time & don’t get notified until seconds after motion ends 5 once your 30 day trial ends you can rely only on sync however loading times are dramatic on live camera view as well as playback"
"Good cameras, good quality, sucks that you have to have a subscription!!"
"Did it record videos? Yes. Could I tell what anything was half the time in the video? No. I had these set up to keep an eye on my living room and adjoining patio.  You have to use an app to view the videos. It alerts you when a video of something has been taken. I had both cameras armed all day. It would rarely record anything during the day and at night, it would go off when it registered car lights down my street through my patio window. But did it record people in my house? No. I’d have 50 video motivations every morning and maybe 2 during the day. I really wanted to like these cameras. I was so close to ordering the doorbell system since I bought these cameras already, but that wont work unless you have a Sync Module device or doorbell wiring. I don’t have either so I’d be spending more money to have a video doorbell and two cameras that don’t work during the day effectively. So I tried to return these just now and I was a day late for the return window. So I paid for subpar cameras, and pay $10 a month for the storage /video feature since I want alerts saved just in case. I can’t sit around watching the app all day. That defeats the purpose. And if I want a video doorbell, I’ll have to pay for the sync module device since I don’t have doorbell wiring. $40 bucks on these cameras, and $98 for a bundle with the doorbell and sync module device, plus $10 a month subscription. It might not be much money for some but as a single legal guardian/“parent” who works full time as a teacher, it’s a lot for me to afford in the summer. I took a chance on this company because I needed a way to keep tabs on my latchkey kid everyday and it doesn’t even detect when they walk by in the day. Also, I’d like to mention the mounting was annoying. Be careful ordering this- make sure you have an outlet for the power cord close to a surface you want to put it on. Not a fan of having to use the super glue sticker to hold the camera in place either. It’s a pain in the butt to position and it would really stink if you ever wanted to move it somewhere else more than twice. I just wanted to return it and get my money back. Pay attention to your return dates! It was one month for me. I’d wish I had returned it sooner and tried the doorbell instead. I honestly forgot I every had these cameras because they stopped recording much of anything and I stopped getting notifications. Once the free trial subscription ended I got a notification to start paying for it.  30 days had passed and so did the return time. If you buy this and it works, don’t forget to keep checking it up until the return window so you aren’t late like I was. I should have read more reviews and wish someone else would have warned about this. Good luck."
Great camera that I was happy with until I realized it requires a subscription if you want in to temporarily save the motion sensor videos. I have been using it to monitor my sick cat but I can’t sit and watch the live to make sure he’s doing ok all day. Really irritated that everything requires a subscription now-a-days.
"I seriously think these Blink mini cams are way over hyped. Don’t get me wrong they aren’t totally worthless, but they have a few bad issues that make them not very desirable. First off, they are marketed as being 1080p, but I think once you have one for yourself, you will see that they are lucky to be 720p. And the night vision looks like it could have been from 20 year old tech. Not to mention that they have a bad habit of going offline quite often, like they just lose internet signals at random. Normally fixed by unplugging the power cord on the camera for a few seconds and plugging it back in so they will reboot back up. And if you ever have to call customer support, make sure you are clear about it being a (Blink) camera, because the calls also go to the (Ring) brand cameras customer support people and they will run you in the wrong direction. They definitely aren’t worth the price of the subscription to keep all the backup memory stored. The camera stands are also an issue for me as they are made to only have the camera set at the same positioning. Meaning, if you wanted to mount them to the side of something, or the underside of something, the image would be upside down or sideways. They should have make the casing more diverse for right angle attachments and ways to maybe mount them to the underside of the windowsill top so they can be up out of the way while pointing out the window. Which leads me to also adding that if you do run them looking out of a window, the night vision will create a terrible glare on the glass making the recorded footage almost unusable. And when I said they aren’t totally worthless, I mean they work great as a fake security camera. Haha.  They are more of a deterrent and less of a security measure.  As long as people think you are recording, they may think twice before doing something stupid. That is unless they read this review letting them know just how bad these Blink cams really are.  So,  would I suggest these to other people looking for a camera to post up? I gotta say No. plus, after a week of owning them, the novelty wears off. You just get to the point where you just don’t feel like even checking out the recorded footage or checking out the live feed. So they just begin to collect dust. Nine times out of ten, it’s just the cat setting off the camera. So you do get some nice close up videos of your cats face looking into the camera lens because they can hear the recording function start up.  Listen, I bought 2 of these about 9 or 10 months ago, and can say they just aren’t worth all the hype they get. If it’s cameras for security reasons that you need, I would suggest getting actual “security” cameras, And not these gimmicky units only the cats will like."
nice camera and easy set up… the volume is great and day time camera is good (just a little delayed). but the night time vision is awful. it looks like there’s fog covering the camera with the night vision. i have cleaned the lens and double checked all the settings… the night vision is just bad compared to my previous camera from a different company
It’s a great little camera. I bought three I set one up has a great picture but then it says you have to pay $50 a month to forward to go to the cloud so that you can see the video the only time you can see the video is if your live . I’ll be sending it back
"The app sends me an alert when there is motion, but it only records for 10 seconds. You can adjust it up to 30 seconds, according to FAQ. I tried to adjust it up to 30 but it didn’t work. I’ll try that again. But I’m not satisfied with a 10-30 second recording when there is motion. That’s only enough time to see a person walk up, and then you can’t see what they do since nice it stops recording. The live view also has a limit of one minute and then it stops. I didn’t realize any of that before I bought it. The app is pretty limited. You get a 30 day free subscription for extended features. So Im worried about what the limits are going to be after the free 30 days ends. If all I get is 10 seconds NOW, what’s going to happen after the free 30 days? For right now, the alert is working."
"Very easy to get it going, quality is good. App doesn’t connect live all the time."
"My blink mini was an add on to an echo show on prime day.  I added my mini to a sync2 module which was included in my blink indoor camera kit.  The addition of the mini went smooth, it updated the firmware and added it to my system.  The firmware was updated.Plus -  Plug in camera with no batteries.  A different system of motion detection which works through windows at night.  Alexa integration lets you see live view on your echo show or your TV via Firestick with alexa  Scheduled arming seems to work, it can follow an entered schedule.Minus -  If you currently have a schedule in the system and turn off scheduled arm slider from the system settings page on the fire app and try to arm from the main page, the mini doesn't arm.  It is like the sync2 module never sent the command to the mini, in fact the date didn't even change at the end of the camera parameter page.  The date and time changed on my indoor and outdoor, just not the mini.  I found the only way to fix this was to delete the entire schedule, then hit arm from the main page and the mini started capturing motion again.  So the pause function for the schedule didn't work.  If you turn off the microphone on the mini, the echo show could no longer show you a live view of the mini via alexa,  turn it back on and everything works.  The motion detection through a window doesn't work in the daytime, but seems to work at night with night vision turned off, based on car headlights coming up the drive,  but during the daytime it isn't even triggered  by a mail truck coming up the driveway or a person carrying a package up the driveway.Overall – it has decent resolution.  While using through a window, I was disappointed it could not detect motion in the daytime but happy it can detect headlights at night with the night vision off.  You should note I am using the mini via the sync2 hub, and I think most people will use this directly without the sync2.  I used the sync2 in hopes of local storage which seems to just consist of a daily backup from the cloud to the USB drive.  Also note the app was running on a Fire tablet.  I plan to retest on a phone to see if the glitch is due to the application or the camera.  Anyways since it couldn't see a delivery truck driving up my driveway, I replaced it with a camera that could.  So if you are trying to catch deliveries during the pandemic, forget this one.  My other camera by someone else, in the same position through a window, triggers an alert if the poodle across the street comes out of their house, and of course a giant mail delivery truck."
"extremely disappointed in this purchase.Initially this product worked great, however.... over time it picks up less and less movement. It misses WHOLE days of activity when I know there activity. This is to help monitor a co-shared office space with the intentions of tracking usage to keep renters honest, security purposes as well as alert of people in the waiting area.. The camera stays in one place and it will go hours without picking up any activity... People coming and going walking right infront of the camera.It used to also connect to my amazon echo show... one of the whole points of buything these two products was to be used together being both by amazon. Well that stopped and will not work with it anymore and the only customer service support is ""turn off the internet and reconnect"". It can NOT be the internets fault why this camera is so bad. I use devices on the internet all day long without issues and this camera just picks and chooses if it will function.I can not keep turning my internet on and off and am unable to when not in office. Joke of a product. Shame on amazon for not improving this product with all these known issues."
"If you’re looking for a cheap quick solution for monitoring something then Blink is your company. Their wireless cameras are cheap and work great will under a subscription plan and are usable but noticeably different out of plan. They work, bottom line is you’ll get some activity on them just apply the rule of “you get what you pay for”.The longer version: I’ve had blink cameras for over 3 years now, 3 mini’s, 5 blink 3rd gen, 2 blink 4th gen and a doorbell. Like you I was searching for options to monitor my house, dogs and wildlife and based on reviews it was really a no brainer. Without getting into it all, I noticed significant differences in motion detection while in subscription/trial and out of it. The delayed alert was expected, however the actual motion capture became apparent as soon as the 30 days ended. I’ve been in trials a few time, first buying 3 outdoor cameras and a mini, then 2 more camera and a mini - then strategically buying my latest 2-4th gen cameras and another mini where I stretched out adding them to increase the longevity of the subscription. That within itself was a great idea however I did this specifically to collect data at the network level as well as stage examples of motion capture. I’ve been back and fourth with blink support for over 4 months now ever since my last subscription trial ended - they have been less than useless. Over 22 years in technology as a developer, network administrator and now cyber security and I can clearly see functional differences between how the cameras operated in/out of trial. For example, one of my dogs will run past a camera and it would have been captured fully while in subscription - however now the dog can run to the door, sit by the door twitching to go out - and the camera doesn’t even set off. In other cases out doors an alert will trigger and I’ll see a tail in the first frame then 14 seconds of nothing. They are deceptive, fully in how these work with local storage. While the battery life is great arming my system only over night and select day times, it’s the motion I wanted. The devices are perfect size, very durable in the rain and can be mounted pretty much anywhere. I’ve been happy with everything with the exception of local only support. This is undisclosed and aforementioned pretty useless to use it local only. They need to make these exclusive cloud only cameras and I still likely would have bought them. The fact that major corporations continue to get away with intention deception annoys me to no end. Hundreds of complaints about blink litter the internet on forums everywhere, seems nobody has challenged them about it, I intend to. Truth be told I will likely spend the $100/y for the sub, but not till I get closure of the functionality differences first. Otherwise I love everything about this while in subscription, just keep all this in mind when you solution your home monitor needs."
"Hey Blink Camera, I was given a Blink camera about six months ago and I used it for a month and once my free subscription was up I decided to go ahead and purchase three cameras, the ring doorbell and the sync module. The picture quality is good, the voice quality on them is good but when I have the motion activated sensors on, my cameras are intermitting. I stood in front of the camera with the motion sensor on and wave and jump up and down and it never activated. That’s not just one camera that’s all four of the cameras I have. Two cameras point outside were  my vehicle is at and I’ll come home to a vehicle in front of my apartment and when I look on the cameras it never caught anything. I just came home today and the vehicle was parked in my spot and when I looked on the camera there was nothing there. When it did show the vehicle in front of my apartment, it was picking up a vehicle on the road. It never picked up when the vehicle pulled in and parked. I heard some talking outside and looked out my window and saw the guy getting in his car and again my cameras never picked it up. I even tried to look at the live view but the live you would never come up. Then all of a sudden it says my camera is off-line, just that one none of the other cameras. That is another issue I have. If it was my Internet then all the cameras should be off-line but all the cameras are intermitting. What’s the point in having these cameras if there not gonna work like they’re supposed to. I’ve cancel my yearly subscription and I’m looking at different cameras. The whole reason I got the cameras and they’re not doing their job. I’m very disappointed. My son bought a small camera for his room just to have, and his camera doesn’t require a subscription or anything, you can use an SD card or if you want to store stuff on their server you would have to pay for that. I’m looking at going with the cameras he has."
"Update 12/1/23After posting my initial review, an Amazon Executive Representative specialized in Blink devices reached out to me. He was very kind and happy to help troubleshoot. While he did not solve my initial issue he did provide a solution that seemed reasonable. I have yet to fully test the solution but will update again when that is complete. My experience with this specific representative, Cooper, has been great and while I hope I don't need further assistance, I would be happy to work with him again. However, during this time, I was also in communication via the original customer support thread that I had initiated and while they extended my Blink subscription trial for another month they continued to be unhelpful in solving my issue and have just restated the same thing over again - clearly not understanding their ""solution"" is not working. To sum up my experience, it is probably not worth the hassle and poor general customer support but specifically, Amazon Executive Representative Cooper was a pleasure to work with.Original Review 11/13/23I have been in contact with Blink/Amazon support and they have not been able to resolve my issue. I have been trying to purchase a Blink subscription since my trial period ended. I keep getting an error that I do not have a default address and payment method linked to my account which is not true. I have not had issues with any other Amazon orders or subscriptions. Customer support has been no help and my return window has now closed. Without the subscription, the camera has very little value and I would likely steer clear of Blink products in the future because of this."
I mean it works but only about half the time. I’ve read and tried every setting they suggest but it doesn’t matter. Sometimes a leaf will set it off sometimes a creepy guy with a big metal stick can loiter right outside my patio and my alerts never went off and never recorded.
"I purchased a Blink Mini 2-Pack around the middle of 2023.  One of the Blink Mini Camera's stopped working.  I initiated contact with Blink Support about getting an RMA on Nov 21.  On Dec 2nd, they finally took a look at the Blink logs (that I had given them access too on Nov 22).  After looking at the logs they finally decided that it was a hardware issue.  On Dec 5th, an RMA was issued.Today is Dec 17th, 2023 - I still have not received the replacement.Even after more than a few contacts with Blink Support over weeks - Blink has not replaced a Mini that Support says has a hardware issue and was purchased directly from Amazon.com - and the Blink Mini is still covered by the 1 year warranty - buyer beware - warranties are only as good as their Leadership team allows.edit: Dec 18, 2023 Called Blink - was hung up on by support staff when I asked for more help.  Called again, I was on the phone for an about 45min, while they tried to figure out where the RMA was.  As it turns out, Blink Support staff who answer the phone don't have access to the RMA replacement tracking number - so support staff who answer the phone or reply to emails can't really help - I had to give them the tracking number.  But, they still could not figure out what happened.  They said they would call me  back after looking into it more.  I will be calling again.Called again, finally got a reasonable customer service response.  They are resending the RMA.  Replacement arrived Dec 22, 2023, a little over one month from when I first contacted Blink about a malfunctioning Mini.  This process cost me about 15 hours of my time.Buyer beware - Blink support delays warranty replacements.  It took me 15 hours of my time to get a replacement.  Warranty support is only as good as the company that backs the warranty - in this case, it actually cost me 15 hours of my time to get a warranty replacement for an item that I could buy new for about $20.00 (Common price after discount from MSRP).  15 Hours for a replacement indicates an environment that management has designed to run up 3rd party support costs and discourage customers from seeking help from support.edit 11/1/2024I had issues with the 2nd blink mini camera.  I added the camera back into my system on 10/29/24, at which time it updated the firmware to 9.97.  Later that day, I wanted to move the camera, so I deleted it from the system, moved it to a different location and tried to add it back.  However, the blink app kept saying there was an error.  I spent at least 5 hours of my own time troubleshooting.  I did a reset(5 times), factory-reset(5 times).  I called blink and spent 141 minutes with support.  Based on previous experience, I gave the 1st tier support a chance, followed their instructions about resetting, doing a factory-reset, etc, after roughly 50minutes, I asked for a supervisor.  It turns out firmware version 9.97 was released on 10/24/24, and it has issues.  At this time there is no fix.  It's clear that the released firmware without testing it, that is really bad and just asking for customer to call and complain."
I was able to keep an eye on my place when out of town. No issues connecting to WiFi. Good picture and sound. I was able to direct my neighbor to the item I needed him to send me from home.(He could hear me talking to him through the camera) Easy to play back recordings on my iPhone.
"I returned.But the quality of the video was very impressive , one camera had sound. There was lots of echo and noise but I think it cab be reduced. Very easy to setup so I returned it but Ordered a new one. Hope that one works well and no problem after return period ends"
the clips it records are too short so if action continues you get 3 or 4 notifications rather than just 1 for the incident. also there is no way to watch the camera live on your computer. wont buy from Blink again. ill continue to use Arenti and Wyze
"Grabbed a 3-pack of these on a Cyber Monday sale.  I already have 5 of the Blink Outdoor cameras at my house and another 4 Blink Outdoor cameras at my in-laws house and figured these could be good additions to our systems.  Unfortunately, it seems they have much weaker antenna in them compared to the Outdoor battery versions.  I had difficulty getting them to pair to the sync module at my in-laws place and it was even located significantly closer than two of the Outdoor cameras.  If I brought it within 20’ of the sync module then it worked - bring it further away and it would disconnect.  It was surprising to see happen as I assumed the constant AC power might even boost the signal grabbing power - nope.  In the end we couldn’t fine a way to make them work for him so I just set one up at my house and now have 2 extras.  If I were to do it all over I would not get this Mini and instead would’ve just opted for a few of the new Outdoor 4 instead and deal with battery replacement from time to time.  At least we wouldn’t have had the reception issues."
They work for short videos
"****** UPDATE PLEASE READ:  After having the Echo Show 5 and Blink Mini camera working perfectly as a puppy monitor, it basically quit working. Let me explain. I used the Show/Blink setup to notify me when my puppy would wake up at night so we could let her out to do her business.  It worked well (almost too well) by sending Alexa notifications to both my iPhone and the Echo Show.  I eventually turned the notifications off on my phone because I didn't need two things waking me up at 3am.  Again it worked for a while, then just out of the blue, it stopped notifying me through Echo Show.  I tried everything to  get it working again, but I was forced to start using my iPhone notifications instead.  Echo Show would still let me view the camera ""Echo show me Bella"", but no notifications when she would move.  Echo Show became almost useless since I can also  view the camera from my phone (and also speak to my pup which Show never could do).  Mind you, it has been taking 30 second video clips and storing them on my phone.  I got a couple that were YT worthy for their entertainment value (search Bella the Corgi).I put up with the notification issue until BLINK PULLED A FAST ONE ON ME!!!  A little over a month ago, I got a notification on my phone that my ""30 Day Premium Blink Trial"" had begun.  I did not sign up for the trial, so I thought nothing of it.  The other day my trial expired.  I went into my phone to look at the stored videos and now they all are LOCKED!!!  When I click on them Blink app tells me I need to subscribe to their service!!!! WHAT??!!!!??Now the Echo Show and Blink Mini are all but USELESS to me except to notify me on my phone when my puppy moves at night.  Echo Show's notifications are gone, and NOW Blink will not record.  The whole point of the security camera is to record!!  If I were to point my camera at my mail box to catch mail thieves, it would be absolutely WORTHLESS now since I'd have to be at the ready to view it live.  Anything not live is locked up and held for ransom by Blink.Amazon (who also owns Blink) is getting greedier by the day.  Shame on you for taking away the basic functionalities that I bought it for in the first place!******************Using the blink app on iOS you can use the ""Talk"" button to talk through the camera, however, this is NOT possible when using Echo show (5"" latest version) that is bundled together with this camera."
Of all of the cameras I have inside and outside my house this has got to be one of the worst. It's ridiculous what it chooses to record and what it chooses to just ignore. After checking the recordings from about a week ago I found it's insane how much it ignores actual motion but then picks up the trees blowing in the wind.I have it aiming out my front window since my doorbell camera is on the fritz. We were out on the deck for about 35 miniutes waiting for my friends vehicle to be dropped off so they could get to work. 2 people moving back and forth in front of it constantly. This was about 5:35-5:45 am  until around 6:20-6:30 am. I look back at the recordings so we could see what time exactly it was finally dropped off and there's nothing picked up from 5am until after 10am. This is one of the busiest times on the street I live on. It should have been constantly being set off and recording.  Since other times it picks up most of he cars that pass on the street.Bad enough it typically records then shuts off missing the things it should pick up. Or starts too late to pick up the important parts it should be recording. Part of the reason I can't use it for indoors when I'm selling items. It didn't pick up anything useful and only got useless parts of any interaction. It wasn't useful for watching for shoplifting when my back is turned or anything else. Now this.Then there's the lousy 20 to 30 second recording times. Will never understand how this is useful for any security cameras. What good is 30 seconds. So why bother.These don't have any type of decent live record or live watch on them unless you keep hitting continue. Half the time it takes about 2 miniutes to get the live view to even open. So that's no good for security at all.The only redeeming quality is the picture isn't horrible as long as the light is just right.I'm just hoping the wifi recieved on it is really good cuz only places left for it are upstairs where no one is much these days or the garage to keep an eye out for squirrels getting in there. After that it can go in the trash if it doesn't work there cuz I'll have no use for it at all.Unimpressed and rather unhappy with the blink cameras and won't buy another ever again. Would not recommend to anyone for anything.
But it’s good
"While this camera is okay for motion detection or an occasional live view, there isn’t a 24/7 recording option. I should have read the reviews and details better. But other than that they are okay to have if you do not want a 24/7 recording option."
"Despite having the camera on alarmed the entire time, it wouldn’t sense movements after a while. I would have to manually disalarm it first then place it back on alarm so that it would sense movements and video. Placed it on my front porch and most footage are cars driving by. Blink app also doesn’t work the whole time. I have to exit out of the app first then open it again to view footage. For reliability I would give it a 2/5. Video Quality is ok, more blurry at night. Picture above shows quality of it during the early morning.easy to install"
I love this but for some reason fresh ou the box i could not get the two way talk communication to work it. Video capture and everything else is good but can't get that to work.
"So far, I am not at all impressed.The camera's motion detection is going off very frequently just from blowing tree limbs & shadows, but is missing cars going in and out of the driveway, the front door opening, people moving around, etc. (The camera is aimed right at the front door and driveway, and picks up motion in these places SOME of the time--maybe 30%.)I cannot find a ""user guide"" for the app and the online ""support"" is configured as a series of ""how to"" blurbs using jargon you'd only know once you've been using the system, so it's very difficult to find info as a new user. (I graduated magna cum laude with a BS degree in computer science & have been a professional software engineer--writing software and supporting documentation for everything from hardware controllers to radar systems to 3-D modeling--for decades, so I'm not a technology idiot--this is a poorly designed, executed, and supported system.) There should be an easy to find & use Getting Started Guide that provides app and system overviews. Just a 1-page Quick Start Guide in the box would make a big difference. Right now, I simply want to know what all the icons and buttons on the app mean, and cannot find an explanation of them.Based on what I read on the user forums, the app gets changed with no explanation to users, so even if you do figure it all out, it can change and suddenly there are new or changed icons & you have no idea what they do. Although I've figured out enough to get the whole thing set up, it's not intuitive, and I've used other similar security cameras and apps. I still have not figured out some of this app. Plus, the online/app info tries to cover all the Blink camera models, even though they don't all work the same, so that could be confusing to some users.If there's a way to access your camera's live feed or the recordings from a desktop/laptop PC/Mac (vs. app on phone/tablet), I haven't found it yet.The camera quality is OK and the 2-way talk seems to work in testing, but I don't know what it'll be like in a real world scenario. You cannot record more than a 30 second clip. It's difficult to tell when you are in ""live"" viewing mode. The app interface is just not well designed. I haven't had time to experiment with everything--have wasted too much time just trying (and mostly failing) to find basic information.No idea what the ""local"" (non-Cloud) storage Blink talks about will be like--I can't find much info about that, either. It seems like it'll be in a device that's on your WiFi network so the camera can communicate with it, and would therefore be exposed to the world. A closed system would be more secure. The storage will obviously NOT be in the camera itself--there's no place for even a microSD card. An SD (or micro) card in the camera would be a good idea (at least as an option).And one more thing--Blink is ""an amazon company."" So why is the app not available for Kindle devices?UPDATE: I've been using this camera for a couple of months now and it is such a mixed bag. I like the ""activity zones"" that (theoretically) allow you to define the areas to detect motion. And the image is pretty good. The audio is so-so. But the motion detection is terrible--and I've tried all the setting options. I have mine mounted in an outdoor mounting kit, under a protective roof. The thing goes off constantly--every 30 seconds, for rain, wind, shadows, bugs (bugs seem to be drawn to the camera's blue light at night), a slight change in lighting due to a distant car headlight, any little thing--it will sometimes get literally hundreds of constant triggers over a few hours over nothing, but EVERY SINGLE DAY (including overnight), it just sometimes just stops detecting anything, even cars and people being very active all over the entire viewing area. If I ""go live"" for a moment, it seems to start detecting motion again! For a while, anyway. This is maddening. It completely defeats the purpose of the camera. The frequent ""false alarms"" made me turn off notifications because it was dinging constantly, and the inability to detect REAL motion makes no sense. Having to ""reset"" the camera daily, sometimes multiple times in 24 hours, is crazy."
"***Update***After leaving this review, I received an email from a different customer service rep and he immediately offered to send me a new replacement camera. He even emailed me to ensure I received the new camera and that it works. I’ve had it going for 24 hours and so far so good!—————————————————————I received this camera and set it up immediately by following the directions I received with the camera. It worked really well for exactly one day. Very clear display and it picked up sound really well. Within 24 hours the camera quit working. I followed all of the directions on the website (sent to me in an email) and it still didn’t work. I have now been communicating with the support team for one week trying to get this resolved and it still isn’t working. I asked if I could return my camera and have them send me a new one but was told it could be fixed remotely. It has not been fixed.If the customer service was quicker and more helpful, I would 100% recommend this camera. It worked really well when it was working. Dealing with the customer service has been very slow and unhelpful."
"Terribly disappointed so far. Unbelievably disappointed.Cameras were easy to set upI bought an extra sync module so that I could 2 networks, 1 for my house, 1 for a vacant family homeMy wi-fi systems are 300mbps, or better6 month old routersSync module positioned about 10’ from my routers at most.system 1 cameras are both within 30’ of the sync moduleSystem 2 cameras are max 10’ from the sync moduleSystem 1 installed at my house and operates normally for 3 days. There are 3 wireless outdoor cameras and 1 mini camera on this system. All seems okay, except 1 camera will not reliably display live video and will not update thumbnail images, but detects motion and records.Then I go on vacation OVERSEAS, and a second camera at the front door goes offline. Fantastic.Instructions say I just need to cycle power. But I cannot remove and reinstall the batteries here in the USA when I’m in Germany.So this system has 4 cameras: 1 doesn’t open live video feed or update thumbnails, and a second drops offline 1 day after starting a vacation.I install the second system at in-laws house a few days in advance of leaving. This system has only 2 cameras, wireless outdoor gen 4 cameras, and as a precaution I buy and install new batteries.The system is performing normally for a couple days, but  when I return home to the USA, camera 2 drops offline. A half-day later it returns online. On day 4, both cameras drop offline. They do not reappear online.During all failures, the sync modules appeared to be connected with a full strength signal. And when the cameras all showed that their batteries were full, and all showed a full strength connection to the sync modules.When I returned home, I was able to remove and replace the batteries in the offline camera, and it has been working normally, so far. The camera with the live video issue was also power cycled, and still not functioning properly.It will be 2 months before I can power cycle the cameras on Germany.At this time, I have no faith in this system.They have dropped connectivity at random, and there is no easy option to troubleshoot remotely.A lot of folks seem to have good systems, and I was impressed at first, setup was easy, settings were pretty good, day and night video was good, motion detection was good.But if they don’t stay connected reliably then they are not good. And mine have not been good.-------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 23 Dec 2023 - Improving my review from 1 Star to 2 StarsTrying to organize this so it's easy to follow.Home Cameras  - Camera 1 - This camera (Outdoor 4) still not reliably responding to Live Video or Thumbnail Update requests, but detecting motion okay, and sending alerts okay, when the system is armed  - Camera 2 - This camera (Outdoor 4) fell offline after its 1st 3 days of service, and stayed offline while on vacation. I cycled power when I returned, and it has stayed online for 9 days now.  It is sometimes slow to show Live Video or Thumbnails, but has generally responded.  - Camera 3 - This camera (Outdoor 4) has worked 100% good, without issue.  - Camera 4 - This camera (Mini) has worked 100% good, without issue.In-Law's Cameras (Overseas)Camera 1 went offline and came back online a day later. Then Camera 2 went offline, then both cameras went offline. I tried to ""jiggle the handle"" on this system, by removing the cameras and reinstalling them remotely (I know the camera serial numbers)  - Camera 1 - This camera got disassociated from the Sync Module, and it's gone until I can return Overseas and cycle the power again.  - Camera 2 - I removed and reinstalled remotely, and this camera has remained online without issue.Don't know why.Some cameras have been good all the time, some have been unreliable.On a good note, Blink Customer Service reached out to me based on my initial review, and has so far been very responsive.Based on the Customer Service guy's help, I am improving this review to 2 stars.The cameras still need to be better than this, but Blink seems to be trying, and I appreciate that.-------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 17 Mar 2024 - Reducing my review to 1 Star againDO NOT TRUST THE OUTDOOR WIRELESS CAMERAS TO STAY CONNECTED RELIABLY.5 DAYS INTO A MONTH LONG TRIP AND ONE OF MY CAMERAS GOES OFFLINE.IT HAS DROPPED OFFLINE 2 TIMES IN JANUARY,  BUT HAS BEEN OKAY, UNTIL I NEED IT.A SECOND OUTDOOR CAMERA ON MY NETWORK DROPPED OFFLINE AT LEAST 3 TIMES IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY, BUT IS CURRENTLY FUNCTIONING.I NOW HAVE 2 BLINK MINI CAMERAS AND THEY HAVE BEEN 100% GOODTHESE OUTDOOR CAMERAS ARE GREAT WHEN THEY WORK, WHICH IS 95% OF THE TIME, AND THEY WORK AGAIN AS SOON AS I REMOVE AND REINSTALL THE BATTERIES, BUT YA CAN’T JUST RETURN HOME FROM VACATION, RIGHT?!?BECAUSE OF THIS,THE OUTDOOR CAMERAS ARE FRUSTRATING AND MISERABLE.IT’S TIME FOR BLINK TO REPLACE THESE."
"I purchased the Blink 4 cameras to replace an older Arlo Pro 2 system at a remote cabin. I use the Blink 4's outside the cabin. I also got two Blink Mini cameras (hardwired so no batteries) for inside the cabin. The old Arlo cameras are now running at my house in the city.A side note about the cabin. It's in rural area on several acres. There's no cell phone service - none whatsoever. On a good day you have to walk a few miles to get one bar. The driveway has a steep section that traps a lot of people. Naturally, they reach for their phones and soon realize they're screwed. No tow truck service will be coming to rescue them. So, I use the cameras to monitor things and call a tow service, or the Sheriff, depending on what the stranded people start getting in to. Sometimes it turns into dinner and a show.Strangely enough, the cabin has blazing fast fiber optic Internet service. I'm sure the government paid for the infrastructure - no private business in it's right mind would ever invest the millions required to serve the 30, but probably less, customers tapped into it.Back to the review...The Arlo cameras had two issues. First, the night vision was terrible, especially where there is little ambient light. At night at the cabin you can barely see your hand in front of your face. Second, Arlo announced the end of free cloud hosting (now extended) which I want. I don't want to buy a device and then be tethered to that company forever, relying on them not going out of business, just to use it.I want to preface my comments with acknowledging that I'm comparing two technologies that are 3 or more years apart. The current Arlo cameras may now have better night vision and clearer video, but Arlo doesn't provide anything but subscription based cloud hosting. There is no local/free cloud hosting option.So, comparing the Arlo Pro 2 to the Blink 4, the Blink 4 night vision seems to be slightly better, but still not great. I can tell if the ""intruder"" is a deer or racoon, but only when they're close enough to be sniffing at the camera. You can't read a license plate.The quality of the Blink video (day or night) seems clearer and sharper. Blink does give you the option to increase the IR intensity to improve night vision, but I haven't used it.Blink offers a free 30-day trial of their cloud hosting. I cancelled it, but noticed three things that I wish local hosting did that cloud hosting offers. First, there are no video thumbnails in the app when you use local hosting. Second, you can't delete multiple clips at once when using local hosting - you can only delete your clips one at a time. Third, when you play a clip, it's takes a few seconds to load the clip in the app. These are things I'm willing to live with.A few things I think Blink does better than Arlo are the scheduling of times when each system (sync module) is on and off. You can have multiple schedules running unique to each day of the week.Something that the Arlo app lets you do that Blink does not, is to turn off individual cameras. It seems like a pretty basic feature, but for the life of me, I can't find that setting in the Blink app.A few other items. Setting up the Blink system is incredibly easy. The app has a few features that are handy, like pausing an entire system for 2, 4 or 6 hours, or simply overwriting a schedule and turning it off. You can also set the clips to automatically delete after 7, 14 or 30 days. (If you use cloud hosting there are more options). This way your thumb drive for local hosting won't fill up.I never tried to adjust activity zones or use facial recognition. One or both of these may only be available with paid cloud hosting.Initially, my biggest concern with the Blink 4 cameras was battery life. Only time will tell, but I doubt if I'll get 2 years out of them. A few camera locations get lots of  animals passing by (also insects, birds and blowing leaves) which triggers the cameras every day. Some hardly see any activity. After three years, the Arlo batteries are starting to need replaced and they're expensive.Finally, the Blink 4 cameras are considerably cheaper than Arlos. I had an issue with woodpeckers attacking the Arlos - they don't care for the infrared motion sensors - so replacing them won't  be as expensive. It was funny the first time. but not as funny the third time around. Now I protect them all with coated chicken wire set about 3 inches in front of each camera.3 Month Update:I have ten cameras running around the cabin on two sync modules. One camera (the closest outside camera to its sync module) died after about a week. I suspected a bad battery, and that's exactly what it was....so much for a two-year lifespan. So, be aware that your batteries may not be at 100% charge when you get your camera out of the box and set it up.A few of the cameras show very poor network strength, but perfect (4 bar) connection to the sync module. Not sure exactly how that works, but I suspect it's also a partially discharged battery when I first opened the package.If it's not a battery issue, then there's really no explanation. The furthest camera away (at least 100' away from the its module) shows perfect wifi strength and sync module connectivity. Another camera on the same sync module but only 20' away directly in front of the far camera, shows poor connectivity.It also seems like the cameras with poor wifi strength and sync module connectivity detect motion, and send my phone an alert, but don't record a video. Again, this could be a battery issue.Note that despite my suspicion that the camera performance falls off if batteries are not fully charged, all of my cameras say their batteries are ""ok"" in the app....except the one that died. It simply went dead and offline with no warning.Another issue I've frequently noticed with the Blink cameras is that if you access the system via the app,  and then try a live view on a camera, you get a  message that the system is busy. This never happened with the Arlo cameras. This is especially frustrating when you get a motion alert, but no video was recorded, so you try to see a live view...only to be informed that you can't do that either.I'm hoping that replacing a few batteries might alleviate all of these issues.6 month updateA few more months and a few more issues...I get a LOT of what I would term ""false alarms"", where I get an alert of motion, but no video is recorded.One suggested solution is to reduce the video quality. That didn't help.I also started getting false alarms on the two hard-wired Blink Mini cameras inside the cabin, so it's not a battery issue. I didn't change anything about the cameras prior to getting bombarded with alerts. I started getting about one alert per minute or more. The only solution I could initially find was to DISARM the system/module for the indoor cameras. So, basically the indoor system was completely worthless.Solution number two was to decrease the motion sensitivity. That seems to stop the false alerts temporarily, but 24 hours later they started again. I decreased the motion sensitivity again, but it had no impact. If it wasn't for the remote location of the cabin, I'd wonder if I was missing something that was going on.Possibly a camera reset is in order. At this point, what could it hurt?One issue I've seen others report is that if you have a 2.4 GHz network (required for the Blink 4's) and a 5 GHz network, they should have unique SSID's (network names). I set my network up this way so this wasn't an issue for me.The Arlo cameras used to capture video of a lot more animals. So, I suspect that the Blink motion detection isn't as long-range as the Arlo cameras. Blink does capture a lot of close-up video of bugs, and video of family members when I know they're visiting, so they seem to be working.Getting the perfect placement for the cameras is important. You want traffic crossing in front of the cameras, not coming straight at them. So, I'm still tinkering with placement.ConclusionsWhen the Blink cameras work, they're great. When they go into crazy mode and start bombarding you with false alarms, it's aggravating and makes you regret the purchase.I trust the Arlo cameras more than I currently trust the Blink cameras. It'll take a while for me to get there with Blink, if at all.Hopefully, I'll eventually get the Blink kinks all worked out. Other things on my list to try are (1) reduce the number of cameras per sync module and/or add another sync module, (2) play with camera placement, and (3) move the sync modules around to improve connectivity.I guess I would sum up my review this way: There's a reason why the Blink cameras cost less."
"Well, it’s official. I’m a tech idiot. It’s actually more difficult than I thought it’d be to admit that but here I go. I purchased this awesome camera set and an echo dot because I thought that combo would help make my life easier. (You know the thought: I come home after a long day doing this and that and I’d be able to call out: “Alexa, turn off exterior cameras” or something similar!)Unfortunately I had a piece of bad luck because the echo dot wouldn’t stop saying “hello “ to me in amazingly multiple languages! After a few days of this I did what anyone would do and called Amazon for help and found out that there’s a whole ECHO DOT help division! That made me feel better about myself because it told me that lots of folks were having issues. Anyway, after a bit of directions they figured out the thing had a problem and I had to send it back for a replacement. (I know, I’m getting to the part about the cameras! No worries 😉)So! In the meantime I figured I can still use my cameras and I set it all up and place them around the place and I feel like “yeah, safer already!” This is where the problems begin, firstly, the cameras are front heavy and just I don’t think they were meant to be just “placed around the place”. After about an hour or so I started getting “movement notifications and the pictures all showing the counter top or shelf top. They kept falling forward and the cameras seemed to take their movements as “motion detection” and took a picture and sent a notification to me. That’s actually an excellent thing because it means that the system was doing something so that was good. The bad part was that no matter what I tried over a 3 week period, the cameras wouldn’t stay upright. So being a dedicated Amazon Prime believer I called in and imagine my shock that there’s no tech support for this device! I got a phone number and website for BLINK and I had another step along my journey to getting safer… I tried calling Blink, no joy. I got to the site and filled out the form and created an account (which it seems you have to do to send a “help me” request so, yeah, I did that thing too.)Next thing is I get an email from BLINK saying they got my request and someone would contact me “soon”. Argh! I waited a day and finally put a call in to Amazon again because the 30 days return policy is coming up fast and I needed help. I finally got some customer service person and was told that my option is returning the set. I was seriously disappointed 😢 and frustrated and finally decided to give up on my dream of a technology driven home and agreed with the cs. During all this process I’m told I have to PAY TO RETURN THIS BLINK 4 OUTDOOR CAMERA setup but , hey, the really awesome part is that I can CHOOSE any mail out service I want so there’s a bonus…Now, I just got confused as well as frustrated and my immediate, insightful response was “huh?” And worse yet: “ um, what’s going on?” I’m told that the computer the cs is using is showing only 1 return and I have to pay to get it back to them and I have 2 days to do it (remember that 30 day return thing is still ticking away.)Bad luck me because next day is pouring down rain and windy like crazy. Now, I’m in wheels so in order to get to the post office I have to wrap my wheels in a gigantic plastic garbage bag to protect all the electronics and then I have to wrap myself in all my rain gear and got busy making my way to the post office dodging huge puddles and cars hitting those same puddles and swamping me like I’m invisible even though I’ve got lights on and an ugly bright yellow rain poncho going on! LOL 😂 I’m laughing crazy and just soldier on and I got the thing done and got a real good receipt too because I was told I’d get a refund for that. I finally get home, make the call to the call center and am sent an email while we’re talking and I send off a picture of the receipt showing everything about the order and delivery date and everything is the way I was told to do it. The guy on the other end says “ ok, I got the receipt and it’s clear and I’ll call you back in a few days about your reimbursement “!And once again my amazing insightful response system kicks into high gear and I go: “huh?!” Meanwhile, the cs person was asking a bunch of questions about whether I have received other orders and I finally say: “ can’t you see my account?” And he says, no and something about computer issue or some such and I’m still dripping wet and I still have to unwrap my wheelchair and myself and my insightful response system rears it’s head and I say: “whatever dude”. And I hang up feeling pretty good because I have the email.For this product: it easily connected to my existing Blink doorbell setup and I was not too difficult to get it connected to my blink network. Be really careful with what you’re trying to do with this camera set. It’s not made for my kind of setup where you can move the camera around to where you mostly think you need it until you decide on a permanent installation. It’s probably for a setup where you have already decided where to permanently install. It’s front heavy so even though the frame looks boxy and squared it isn’t and if it isn’t permanently installed from the start the cameras will fall forward and it will start notifying your app constantly that there’s motion in your camera view when it’s really just falling forward and it takes a picture of what it sees as it’s falling. The image quality is decent but blurry when the camera is falling forward so that you can’t really make out what you’re seeing unless you manually do a walkabout of the location that you placed the camera. I’m unsure of how to rate the motion detection since it was the thing in motion and it isn’t clear. The inability of the camera to stay up even though it looks as if it should be stable is possibly because the camera probably makes some kind of internal movement during activation of picture taking but again and most importantly I’m NOT a tech genius so I couldn’t figure out why it keeps falling over. It comes with a plastic key for battery installation or changing and some other plastic thing but I couldn’t figure out what the other plastic thing was so that means that I probably needed help and I couldn’t get the help I needed. It didn’t pick up sounds very well. The app I used is the blink app and I’ve used it for years with my doorbell so that app is easy to use and understand but you need to “play with it” to figure out most of the advanced settings. During my attempt to figure out this camera setup and the problems with instability of its outer shell I was offered (during initial setup) to connect to something called “sidewalk” that appears to use the nearby cameras of neighboring other users in your area but I interpreted that as a breach point for camera access so I refused that offer but others might think that is a good thing so you’ll have to decide for yourself when the time comes. Despite the shape of the camera shell it is highly unstable during use if it isn’t used as a permanent installation. Be really aware of this problem otherwise you may believe that it’s useful for moving it from place to place until you determine the best locations and view overlap to get the best protection for your location and application. The cameras have major drawbacks and some plastic parts have no apparent use as they don’t show up in the pictures in the ads or on an existing installation in the ads. The customer service response for my situation was an email saying they got my help request and would contact me soon without any timeline for the response and to date I haven’t heard from Blink as I am writing this. Beware of the return policy that requires you to pay for the return shipping as the size and weight of my return cost $28.00 and change. For my situation there wasn’t any option to return via a Amazon drop point at Whole Foods even though the box is pretty compact and well suited to shipping. Good luck and I hope that this comprehensive review will help someone avoid the pitfalls I’ve experienced with this Blink 4 outdoor camera set and barely responsive customer after care."
"Neutral? Better than nothing - yes.Good for the cost - mehNot sure if I should have gone with another option or not. All seemed to have a downfall somewhereI looked at 4 or 5 other brands. We already have a ring doorbell, which we went from loving to tolerating. (There’s always an add-on. Always a price increase).We did want more cameras that did not require a subscription. Only a few choices for this that are also wireless (too cheap and too unskilled to use wired).To point out the obvious, wired is likely to be much better for any brand. Wired has more power, memory, strength and options. Wired is more money however and less available placement options.I was very close to go with eufy I think it was… I don’t remember but their bundle came with only 2 cameras and the hub had to be connected via Ethernet vs this set’s hub uses wifi. Every brand seemed to have reviews about connectivity issues overtime. There was another close contender, but that one you could have 2-3 cameras max with the hub and could not get more. I like the ability to add options later, but I certainly don’t like the you must add this or get a premium increase later nonsense every company is throwing out these days. I also think a major factor I went with blink is the battery life of 2 years vs 6 months.Pros:-can put them almost anywhere-Decent images/video-not bad night vision (see image from very dark corner outside)-Lots of add on options-lots of settings options (length of video, sensitivity per camera)-Optional subscription-supposed battery life 2 years nice-sound is better than expected-we have had no connectivity issues (keep in mind it has only been 5 days and we have both 5G and 2whatwver connection). I believe now cameras want the 2mega connection range. (However it did warn me once one camera didn’t arm, but then it did so)Cons:-doesn’t come with long arm mounts (bought from 3rd party for 15.99 for 3 and hub mount vs 8.99 each from blink. Most other options I saw came with everything you’d need for at least one camera).-doesn’t come with the usb memory card-slowness (some is to be expected, but I should not have just gotten a notification this morning from an event at 7pm last night from one camera).-inconsistency (got 3 cameras, all work so far but only one regularly does the trial periods photo capture when all 3 are supposed to).-subscription required for person detection (personally think that is bogus. Most coders will tell you that is a simple edit from motion to figure detection, ie they just want money)-no clue why it isn’t using the hub for videos right now and is using the cloud from the free trial-I have the sensitivity on all at 9max and 60sec videos. It warns you this will decrease battery life. I disagree that this should be a thing. Say they only last a year instead if you actually have events that trigger this…-batterylife monitoring not accurate? All came new supposedly but as soon as you get all setup, they only say “okay” battery life? I expected 100% or full or something. Not for it to say okay. That doesn’t make me very confident they will last.-Armed/disarmed. Take this with a grain of salt bc I don’t understand the point. There is no sound alarm that I am aware of. These are not 24/7 cameras. These record if a motion is triggered and alert your phone. Why would I not want these armed 24/7? They’re supposed to record if they need to, otherwise you just have pretend cameras to scare off people maybe? I don’t get it, I’ve left them armed. We have tweens sneaking through part of our property at times, rabbits digging holes and I did learn we also have a raccoon snooping about.-2 cameras rarely are triggered by my dog’s motion when maxed out. They are triggered if I am with the dog and also by a raccoon. Rabbits have yet to be caught by the camera (but I know they’re there as my dog has eaten 5 so far )-I do NOT like that it doesn’t have a date and time marker. That should be a MUST in all camera systems. To me, it makes their photo captures they brag about pointless. It clips a bunch of them together so it looks like a stream of video/images from morning to night but you have no clue what time other than “oh it looks dark out now…” stupid-I can’t figure out how to actually use this with Alexa. It is linked and shows the cameras connected but won’t let you view anything. Have to use the blink app, that’s annoying. Weird too bc ring works with Alexa just very very slowly-by the time you get notified, motion is often over and not recorded. I consider these minor things that don’t matter. If you want every detail, this is not for you.-other cameras (ring and some off brand that I just remembered we have in a light socket, and our dog camera…) all these have wider lens ranges than the new blink cameras). They don’t expand or go as far as I think they could. Probably to get you to buy more but it may make their quantify better to be fair.I’ve only had these 3 cameras 5 days (25 days left in trial with person detection and cloud). I have zero intention of getting a subscription. I will try to remember to update review if I no longer think this is worth it. So far, it seems pretty okay. Decent like I said. It is far from perfect. Not 100% reliable but it does give us more confidence and peace of mind. Hopefully a deterrent for trouble if anything. It has occurred to me that if anything terrible were to happen, say with a break in, that thieves could find the hub (annoyingly bright light always on) and delete all the camera captures if you don’t use a cloud -fyi! Hopefully you watch the app like I do and can prevent such an issue. If you’re going to ignore nose notifications, you might want a different brand or get the subscription. Ring raises our fee every year so looks like blink is the less expensive route but not trying to go there. If anything, we might add some cameras from another brand to get more coverage and reliability. Not looking for another bill every month."
"These work for my purpose, but don’t have too high expectations.  For me so far I have not gotten 2 year battery life on three of the 6 cameras I own.  On two it’s been less then month an half battery life and I put pretty good name brand batteries in.  The video quality is fine, but you only get 30 to 60 seconds then it stops recording regardless of what it is recording.The motion detection exclusion zones don’t work very well.  I have a camera with a street along the top, totally excluded and it's constantly picking up and recording the traffic.  The night time recording is pretty fuzzy,  but ok for my purposes.I bought these to detect what kinds of critters roam around my house.  For that they work fine, though there been a few times the video stopped when I would like to have had it continue to record.  The people detection is pretty good, but you need the subscription for that feature I believe (which I have).  The app is ok, it has all the features I need.Connectivity is OK at best, if you get notification of motion and want to check it can be an annoying amount of time to get connected to the live view.  I have a couple of cameras where the wait can be quite long wait maybe a minute and sometime not at all.  I would say on average 10 to 20 seconds to get connected for live view.  Then you have to keep hitting “continue” every 30 seconds to continue to watch.  So the camera position relative to the receiver is important, two of my cameras have quite a bit of building material to go through to get to the receiver even though they are on 30 to 40 feet away.  I would also locate them where they are easy to get two sine you may have to change batteries more then you planned.The primary advantage is easy installation, no wire etc, just batteries.  I got better camera mounts for these cameras, you can see in the attached photo.  These are pretty cheap, but work, just be sure you tighten the mount well.  Over all if you plan to buy, be sure you know what you are getting else you will be disappointed."
"Si no es para resolver, les recomiendo NO comprar estas camaras. Imagen y grabaciones pues no es la gran cosa, del 1 al 10 le doy un 3.

"On the surface, these cameras look like a great option.  If you just want something to be able to check in on a live view around your home, they’re perfect for that.  But if you actually want them as a security feature for your home, they’re lacking some basic necessities.  Here are my pros and cons:Pros:- Affordable (definitely a better buy to get a 4+ pack)- Bright clear daytime picture w/wide field of view- OK night vision- Live view has sound and you can speak through the camera- you can choose the areas where you want the camera to watch for movement- can be hooked up to Alexa- Very easy set up.  Thanks to being wireless, they can be mounted pretty much anywhere.Cons- No date/time stamp on videos or photos. Yes, you can see the date/time when you view them in the app, but if you download the clip, there is not date/time stamp on the video or photo file.  This is a basic need for any security camera and is sorely missed with Blink.- Live view/sound has multi-second delay- Additional hardware besides the cameras is required in order to see your live view- Subscription cloud service is required for viewing any “saved” clip.  Only live view is available without subscription.- Only clips are saved in the cloud/history.  There is no timeline.  In other words, if the camera doesn’t register the movement, it doesn’t start recording and you have no way to go back and see if the moment was captured. Other systems we have tried have timeline recording so you can go back to any moment and see what you might have missed.- not great distance on the night vision lighting.  Depending upon where you’re using these, you may need to add additional infrared lighting to improve the visibility of yard/home features at night.- Definitely use Lithium batteries instead of Alkaline.  These are battery hogs.  In one month, the Blink doorbell is on its 3rd set of batteries, and two of the Blink 4 cameras are on their 2nd set of lithium batteries. If you are putting these cameras in a high traffic area, definitely upgrade to the battery pack back.Having come from wired cameras with time stamps and timeline access, I was very much looking forward to the ease of use of these Blink 4 cameras, but have been disappointed in their reality."
"I have (had) 5 Blink outdoor devices (doorbell and 4 cameras) and have used them successfully for years. I purchased an outdoor 4 in September to replace the XR model I had in my backyard and 2 months later it went offline. I tried battery replacement, resetting, even resetting the sync module and plugging it directly into USBC and this sucker is dead (no lights, etc). When I opened it it had a small amount of water in it even though it was closed securely and had a silicone cover installed so of course I dried it out for a couple of days before trying any of these options.I contacted support via the app as instructed and they emailed me a couple of days later and of course asked if I'd done all the things I already explained to them I had (typical) and then asked for the serial number and for me to grant them access to my system which I did. I sent out a reply and waited a couple more days.I finally got a reply today asking me to plug it directly into a USBC cord and send them a video showing it is indeed plugged into the cord and the cord into the wall. Now I might consider doing that but they also insisted I buy Energizer lithium batteries and try those because I use different brand batteries. I've been buying these batteries from Amazon for a couple of years and they have always performed perfectly! I am not going to go buy expensive batteries that I don't need for a product that is obviously not functional. No more hoop jumping.I have been an Amazon customer for many, many years and spend hundreds of dollars every month on this site. I don't believe I've ever returned anything, but if so it couldn't have been more than once or twice. I find the support response for this guaranteed for 1 year item reprehensible, and have decided not to replace any blink product ever again. I'll live without a camera in my backyard for now and when I lose function on my required cameras I'll research and replace them with a non Amazon brand.Be aware."
"Easy to setup. Pretty good video. Delay to start recording causes important action to be missed. No software for PC - only phone. Installed 3 of the new version outside battery operated cameras in February 2024. Two of the three were off line by September 2024 when we were on vacation. Of course, rebooting was not possible. Returned in November and tested the 4 batteries. Two had '0' voltage and two had .3 V. They lasted 7 months not two years. Called the service department at Blink and at first she said the batteries may have been opened before and sat around and drained???? Told her they were Blink supplied batteries that were in the box and packaged. Then she said it depends upon how much activity there is and I told her they were in a place with not much traffic. Asked about why I could not use rechargeable batteries - No answer. Gave up after another ridiculous answer.Since it is not easy to reboot these or replace batteries this is a major flaw with these cameras. This is especially true when you have to get up on a ladder and take them down. They do not come out of the holder not go back in easily. If you go away on vacation I would recommend putting in new batteries before you leave or get the cameras that are connected to a power supply or are solar powered. I have Ring cameras on another property that are solar powered and after almost 5 years I have not had them go off line and have not replaced either the camera or the solar panel."
"I've had the XT2 system installed almost 5 years, they still work great but I felt it was time to upgrade. I also replaced the original sync module which I'm grandfathered into. When I installed this new system I don't think it recognized I'm grandfathered in, but it doesn't really matter since I also installed a SanDisk 64GB flash drive into the sync module 2, which I couldn't do with the original sync module. So no subscription for me!As far as differences and the reason I prefer the old XT2 (and I also have a couple Outdoor 3's out back). The new Outdoor 4 cameras miss about half the cars that go down the road. I've tried moving them a little since these are wide angle compared to the XT2's, but nothing I do makes a difference.  The video quality doesn't seem any better either.The Outdoor 3 cameras (I have 2 of these facing my lake) also have the better night vision where the camera lights up, just as the Outdoor 4 cameras have. XT2 do not.Since I have until January 15 to decide on sending these back, I may return these and look for a couple Outdoor 3 open-box cameras on Marketplace or eBay. I think the Outdoor 3 cameras detect motion better."
"Initially the Blink system was easy to set up, both an indoor set and an outdoor cameras. The first month or so went smoothly. The subsequent months were a rollercoaster of being offline or other issues coming to a culmination a few days ago when one of the outdoor Blink 4 cameras went offline and nothing could be done remotely to restart it. So we followed directions, pulled the batteries, waited, put them back, waited, but nothing.  This means the 2-year lithium batteries lasted 6 months. Camera now dead as a doornail until we purchase new lithium batteries (and hope it works afterwards).We've also had continual but intermittent issues with the Sync Module. It seems to fail every 2 weeks so nowadays we unplug it and plug it in again every week hoping it resets because we, as many others in the comments, experienced a Sync Module shutdown the first day of a week-long vacation. Very frustrating and concerning.Gave 3 stars for the 3/5 amount of the time where there are no problems. If things don't get better we'll have to look into a more serious solution like ADT. Unfortunately that also means spending more $$$."
"The power went out yesterday at home. I purchased the outdoor 4 cameras with the module 2 about a month ago and have only had them installed for about two weeks. The cameras are sufficient for my requirements. However, after the power came back on (I was at work when this happened) the module never reconnected to WiFi. When I got home I had to rediscover the module 2 with my WiFi. It took two times before it would stay connected. My module 2 is mounted within 6 inches of my AT&T router so there is a strong signal between the two. The module 2 doesn’t seem to be able to try to reconnect multiple times once power and WiFi are re-established. I was still in the area this time so although it was troubling for this to happen, I’m worried now about when I go out of town and I lose connection again, I will not have any monitoring capability while I’m away. I have not had a chance to contact customer service yet but since they emailed a request for review this morning I took the opportunity to let others know my experience with this product so far."
"The number 1 reason for the average rating is their self imposed limitation of not being able to  turn off motion alerts in areas that have higher traffic. I get constant alerts on my phone of movement. I don't need those alerts. I just need movement recorded so I have evidence if someone defaces my property or has an accident. I don't need to be notified of movement for every camera. You can pause notifications for 4 hrs, unless you pay for their subscription and then it's up to 24hrs. Not nice on Blink's part. So every 4 hrs I have to go back in the app and pause again.Other issues: -The door camera is so delayed that the cause of movement is off screen by the time it starts recording. So useless for most security problems, like package stealing or accident occurring at your door.-You can only view with the Blink phone app. No PC viewing or local network viewing.Good:The cameras are affordable.Video quality is good enough.Batteries so far last, as long as the camera is close to the synch module.The synch module lets you record directly to USB, so that's great and the main reason I bought the cameras, and why I give 3 stars and not 2."
"I’ve had my camera for about 6 months (has honestly felt like over a year with all the problems I’ve had) I don’t recommend this product from Blink. If you are still in need of a camera I do recommend this brand but I would advise to get the one you plug in or non wireless (rarely have issues with that one) this camera lacks battery life (as other reviews have stated), anytime I have to adjust or fix the camera (such as changing batteries) I always have to delete the camera and re-add which they advise against but that’s the only way I can get it back online. Once I get it back online it will never detect any type of motion. I’ve probably had to contact customer support 10 times. Of course they give you basic trouble shooting tactics at first but I will say I am impressed with the service they provide especially after they sent me a new camera and batteries (that didn’t work but hey it’s the thought that counts?). Overall I’ve had more issues than connectivity with this camera. I support blink but not this product in particular."
"This is coming from someone who also uses a Google Nest Cam at another property, which is by far the superior system because of its interface on your smart phone.  I have four Blink cams that I set up around my home to replace an inferior Chinese set of cams. Big improvement from the get go, but there's lots to not like as well. Let's talka bout the GOOD things about Blink: Blink is very affordable. Far less than Nest, which prompted me to try it. The picture is superb. As good as any I have seen. The set-up is fairly simple using batteries (said to last up to two years) or direct connection, wired to an outlet (which is what I did with all four cameras). You can use Blink cloud storage ($$) or set up your own local storage (Free) which I did. Cloud storage (free for the first month) is very good, as is local storage, to which I migrated. It is good that Blink gives you this choice. There are even areas of the field of view you can neutralize so as not to trigger an event (like blowing tree branches. Clip reviews are easy, just select the date and time of the clip to review. WHATS NOT SO GOOD: The app is not very user friendly IMHO. The clips don't give you a thumbnail, so you're not sure what you are going to watch. When you are in local storage mode, you are told to wait a few seconds because local storage takes longer - which is a bit passive aggressive for my tastes. You don't really wait that long. Arming each device is a pain. i am never sure exactly what I set to record which requires me to go back to each camera and fine tune it. You can set the sensitivity for each cam, which is a good idea, but it is really difficult to find the sweet spot. You only have so much time in the day. It does not record events where I know something was in the field of view, yet it records others where no one is in the field of view. One of the cameras (in direct sun) sends a notice that it is overheating - and then every night I get a notice it's normal again...why make a product that can't take the heat (we live in the Pacific Northwest so it's not THAT hot - 80 degrees most summer days). Sometimes I get notices that one is offline. i haven't investigated what causes that, because in a few hours it is back online again. This system is for someone who is probably more adept at critical thinking when it comes to set-up and performance - seems when you make one change to the setting it affects others you don't think of. It gets three stars because it works, and provides a good picture, and I can live with the idiosyncrasies."
"I ordered this camera system a couple months ago, and not too long ago received it and I’m already facing issues. I currently have four cameras and somehow in only two weeks of use the batteries have died in three of them. Now I understand that the lifespan of the batteries is approximately two years however, why is it within two weeks that I have to replace not one but three camera batteries it doesn’t make sense to me? I went into the app to disarm the system the other day and saw that one of the cameras had a low battery so I assumed maybe I got faulty batteries for one of them however two days later I faced this issue again with another and today 14 October, I have yet another battery dying. Why is that? To be clear I got them on October 1 and I’ve only been using them since that even though I ordered them months ago because I was unable to get them from the freight forwarding company. In two weeks time, not one not two but three cameras now have dead batteries After being advertised that the battery life span is approximately two years. That really seems outrageous to me. Now don’t get me wrong  there are some flaws but i do like the cameras what I really wanted to do was to reach out to Blink via a customer service chat but I was unable to which is why I am here making this review. Hopefully this someone sees it and reaches out, hopefully it helps someone I’m not sure but my advice to you if you’re gonna get this camera system would be to make sure you get backup batteries, the battery pack or get a chord for wired connection."
"Blink Outdoor 4 Review: A Disappointing Investment with Hidden Costs and Inconsistent PerformanceI recently purchased a promotional 6-pack of the Blink Outdoor 4 cameras for $169.99 from Amazon, drawn in by the promise of an affordable and reliable outdoor security solution. While the cameras excel in certain areas, my overall experience has been riddled with frustration due to inconsistent performance and poorly executed features.Easy Installation and SetupOne of the few highlights of the Blink Outdoor 4 is its ease of installation. Setting up the cameras and connecting them to the sync module is incredibly straightforward, even for those with minimal technical knowledge. Within minutes, my cameras were up and running—a great first impression.Inconsistent Image QualityUnfortunately, that positive impression didn’t last long. While the Blink Outdoor 4 advertises HD video quality, the footage is highly inconsistent. At times, the images are sharp and clear, but more often than not, they’re grainy, blurry, and downright dreadful. Adjusting the video settings does little to resolve the issue, which severely undermines the reliability of this system for security purposes.Battery Life: Surprisingly ExcellentOne area where the Blink Outdoor 4 delivers is battery life. Even in high-traffic areas with frequent activity, the batteries hold up remarkably well. This is a refreshing surprise and one of the few redeeming aspects of these cameras.Blink Moments: A Beta DisasterBlink Moments, a Plus Plan-exclusive feature, is supposed to stitch together clips from multiple cameras into a seamless video. Unfortunately, it’s still in beta and works terribly. Clips are pulled in random, nonsensical orders that make the resulting videos confusing and unusable. This feature is practically worthless in its current state.Extended Live View: Completely UnreliableThe Extended Live View feature, which promises continuous streaming for up to 90 minutes, rarely works as intended. The stream frequently lags, freezes, or disconnects entirely, making it impossible to rely on. For a system that markets live monitoring as a key feature, this is unacceptable.Person Detection: Consistently InconsistentThe person detection feature is another letdown. It frequently mistakes objects, shadows, or moving branches for people while completely missing actual human activity. This inconsistency makes it difficult to trust the system for accurate alerts, further diminishing its value.Local Storage: A Frustrating GimmickThe inclusion of a sync module for local storage seems like a great alternative to paying for cloud storage, but it’s poorly implemented. You can’t review locally stored footage through the Blink app. Instead, you must physically remove the storage device and view the files on a PC. This design feels deliberately inconvenient and like an attempt to push users toward the subscription service.Subscription Paywall: Overpriced and EssentialWithout a subscription, the Blink Outdoor 4 cameras lose almost all meaningful functionality. Basic features like cloud storage, person detection, and playback options are locked behind the Plus Plan, which is severely overpriced. This forces users into paying extra to unlock features that should come standard, making the system feel like a bait-and-switch.Final ThoughtsThe Blink Outdoor 4 cameras are a mixed bag. While the setup process is seamless and the battery life is excellent, these positives are outweighed by inconsistent image quality, unreliable features, and an exploitative subscription model. The system’s inability to deliver reliable footage and basic functionality without a paywall is a dealbreaker.If you’re considering the Blink Outdoor 4, think carefully. The ease of setup and strong battery life might appeal to you, but the many flaws and hidden costs make this system far from a good investment. Spend your money on a security solution that offers consistent performance and greater value—this isn’t it."
"I am not the most tech savvy, hence after a 2~3 hours of reading instructions and tinkering with my android mobile phone and taking careful steps I was successful in linking the camera to the sync module 2 and my smartphone. This may not be as difficult for a techy person. I am utilizing my camera as a wireless camera. I primarily purshased the camera to have the ability for a live view at my discretion. Because I also have hard wired cameras and doorbells at my home I can distinguish the difference of the visual & voice quality. The blink camera clarity is shows visually well in the daylight. The night vision is not good, unless there is some pairing of outdoor night lighting. Your sync module 2 needs to be close in proximity of the camera. Before I placed the camera outdoors for use I viewed items indoors. The camera is a very good nanny cam.  The arming and disarming of the blink camera works fairly well. The ability to speak and get clarity of speech from the camera is surprisingly decent. I also have hard wired video door bells, so I can note blink wireless camera on a scale of 1-5 and 5 being the best, blink is a 3.2."
"I apparently have a ""legacy"" system according to Blink support.  This camera does not save pictures from live view without a subscription.  It will save them to local storage with ""motion detection"" only.  I was expecting them to save to cloud with a preview like the rest of my cameras so am disappointed.  What used to be a 5 star system has really gone down hill.  The camera(s), and sync modules(s), as I bought two of,  work fine, and the added range is very, very good.  The fact that they are not added to legacy storage is a big drawback.  I understand they want to make revenue from the subscription plans, but now has me thinking about other options, which I would not have considered before.  Functionality is good.Easy of use and app is good.  Battery life is pretty good for my needs.  I would give it 5 stars if they would fix this problem of not allowing legacy storage.  Support seems to be good.  That is a plus."
"I've been dealing with these cameras for the past year as an alternate to my ADT cameras and so I can have inside cameras on a system also with outside cameras.  I had nine cameras on my system, 5 of which were wireless, 3 were the regular mini, and 1 pan/tilt.  The regular Blink mini cameras and pan/tilt are wired and have their own connection to the Blink App, likely because they are constantly having power into them, and those cameras have worked without issue for me.  These Outdoor4 cameras are wireless and run on a battery (self-preservation mode with using power) and any requests to display come from a Sync Module.  The Sync module is the part that connects to the Blink App as a always-plugged-in device, since you only want to turn the wireless cameras on when motion is detected to save battery life.  However that means when the sync module goes down, all cameras connected to it go down too, regardless if they are working properly.I owned these for 11 months, and almost without fail every two weeks the sync module goes offline and gets disconnected from the network. It's still plugged in showing lights, but the app doesn't recognize the sync module and thus doesn't recognize any of the cameras.  Quite frustrating when you are on vacation and can't reset it.  The solution is the hard reboot your wifi, wait until its done, reboot the sync manager, wait until its ready, delete the old app sync module by scanning the barcode on the back of the sync module, and adding a new sync module by re-scanning the barcode on the back of the sync module.  That means hands-on reboots only, no remote reboot on vacation.  That is also assuming that the addition of the module it accepts your wifi password (mine occasionally would not recognize it despite being typed correctly), because if it doesn't, a new removal and re-addition of a sync module in the app is required after your reboot the sync module manually (you get to skip the reboot-the-wifi step only).Additionally Blink support will have you ensure your sync module is at the goldilocks location to your wifi router, because too far away and that justifies the error, and way too close and that also justifies the error. Blink support will also need you to grant it a separate 2.4ghz channel on your wifi router and not run your computers or other devices on that channel (presuming you want them on a 5G channel anyway).  You will need to remove any wifi boosters in the house because that might be a problem too. Even when I did all of that, the sync module would still not work. I started documenting all issues and I was on my third replacement sync module when I told the Blink Support I had enough.  They told me they couldn't do anything other than send a replacement sync module and since I was at three replacements already, they suggested I wait for a new firmware release and hope that solves it.  Thankfully Amazon made an exception for me and I was allowed to return them for part of what I paid in 2023.The cameras themselves are great and have a great view of the outside day and night. The design flaw is requiring a sync module.  Outdoor use cameras should default to a solar changing unit and battery to side step this flaw.  Had the outdoor cameras fail individually, I would only have to replace a single flawed camera with the remaining still working. But not with this system.The new blink mini2 are indoor/outdoor and are wired.  Skip these if they are your primary cameras because they won't work without a functioning sync module.  These are only worth it if you cannot put power where the cameras are. Given my experience, I would rather run a 200ft extension cord to them if I needed to."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It lacks higher resolution. Other cameras are 2k or 4k this is still at 1080p. The fov is much better. It's wider. The saturation is a little heavy. Audio is slightly better without as much noise as the previous version. The lens fogs up every time it rains or if its humid 🥴It seems to be behind the competition except in one area. Battery life. I've managed to get just beyond a year on my Blinks with low usage. Other cameras can't come close.I know they make a battery pack that can double the battery life but it's extra and makes it a bit heavy for the swivel mount. This is still the best option for battery cameras that you can place anywhere but needs work in resolution sensitivity and recording length. Retrigger time needs to be shorter. Zooming in is heavily pixelated and you can't make out faces or plates. The sensitivity is not any better. People tracker needs work.It's better than the previous version but not worth the price unless you get it on sale. They need to step it up. Other systems are better with more options and no subscription fees.
"I bought these cameras when they were on sale in hopes to get a better improvement with detection in the day time and night time. I live in an area which has trees around my house and a big open front.Things which constantly go off for no reason- shadows- trees moving- outdoor furniture coversI know that there are motion zones which you can setup but that would be the whole picture due to the shadows, trees and bushes we have around the house.With the Gen4 cameras I can say the detection is better but not what you hoped for. Now since the detection is better, we are now receiving notifications for dust/pollen/bugs(during the night mostly) on top of everything else.Where each of these cameras sit we are looking at a 10-30 ft distance which is pushing the detection perimeter for these devices, but even if you put it to 9 , if a person is walking it still will NOT detect that person. It will pick them up once they hit 10-20ft.Of course though if you subscribe to their monthly subscription it will allow for you to test the person detection beta which is what I may need, but I also need to be able to detect for animals around the house as well,  Raccoons, coyotes, etc.The only improvement with the gen 4 I feel is the IR detection at night , compared to the Gen3 it is a lot better.If you are looking to upgrade I would say it’s worth it but only buy these when they are on sale, I got 3 for $134 during the deals in July-August . I wouldn’t spend anything over that though . It’s not worth it.If you would like to see a video on the detection distance I know there are some great YouTube videos that review it.i am still looking at other cameras just right now cost wise, upgrading these to gen4 was the best budget option i had. Maybe next year I will go with a different brand"
"I set up a 10-camera blink system around the perimeter of our yard. It was easy to connect all the cameras and easy to adjust settings and sensitivity levels for each. The main problem we are having with them is that they fog up or frost over every night/morning. It's seriously annoying to get a notification that something has walked in front of a camera and when you pull up the footage you see nothing but a distorted smear. The cameras worked well all summer, but since fall arrived they are fogged over most of the time. We live in a wet climate but we have cameras of many different makes and models all over our two acre property and the Blink cameras are the only ones that almost always have a fogging issue. When they aren't foggy they work well and the image quality is decent, but the fogging issue Is bad enough that they are unusable over half the time. The attached photos show screenshots of live views from three of my cameras this morning. Useless."
"UPDATE 2:  I wasn't expecting to write another update, but this camera is so bad that I felt I had to. I don't think the weather is the problem. The problem is - this is just a POS system. Temps have been fairly good for this time of year - around 50°F. This camera barely records anything. When I let the dogs out or bring them in, as happens a few times each day, I may get one recording for the 6 times they go in and out. I can walk outside, walk up to the camera and wave at it, and it doesn't record. The blue light goes on, but nothing. This was just a total waste of money - even on sale. My internet is fine. Both the camera and the Sync2 module show maximum bars. I am done with this piece of garbage. I wish I could give 0 stars - or better yet - negative stars.UPDATE:  So, before my original review went live here's what has happened. I had the camera in the house while uninstalling/reinstalling, etc. It was on the kitchen counter. Imagine my surprise when the next morning the app showed several videos on the usb (not the new one). Most of the videos showed no movement - not even ghostly movement - but still kind of creepy. A couple showed the cats roaming around. I thought, ""Good, something with my messing around with it got it working again."" Put it back up outside. I attach it with a clamp to the garage overhang, so it's easy to take down and put up. Worked fine that day. The next morning, it was back to nothing again. No detection, no videos, nothing. As the day went on things improved some - got some videos. However those videos were either 2 seconds long, nothing but a bright green screen with a small sliver of actual backyard across the top, or 10-15 seconds less than the 30 seconds I programmed it for. I started thinking ""What is different from inside to outside?"" Well, the weather. The temps dropped into the low 30°s F overnight. During the day it went up to the 50°ish range. It does NOT work in the cold. The specs say the operable temperature range is -4° to 113° F (-20° to 45° C). Well, that's wrong. This proved out over the next couple of days. Nighttime temperature in the 30°s - no good. Daytime temperature around the 50°s - works ok. It did work fine in the cold while on the free trial, so I think it's something to do with uploading to the cloud service as opposed to going straight to the usb. Anyway, now that nighttime temps are starting to rise I'm hoping I won't have an issue. However, come next winter I know it's not going to work. So between now and then, I'm going to try to find a non-subscription camera that doesn't mind cold midwestern winters. Still leaving the one star rating, as the product does not do what it's advertised to do.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  It was nice while it lasted. I bought this camera for my backyard. I didn't want another camera I had to pay a subscription fee for. This one was advertised as not needing a subscription if you put a usb drive into the Sync2 (included in the pack up). Well, set up was fine. It worked fine. It's now 2 days after the free 30 day trial of the Blink Subscription Plan, and it's basically a tiny brick. It recorded to the usb drive for 1 day, though some of the videos were only 1 second long. Today - nothing. The app says everything is connected and working, but there are no recordings on the usb. Apparently, this is not an isolated issue. LOTS of people seem to be having the same problem, and their interactions with Blink's customer service do not seem to help. Based on what I've been reading on different forums, Blink seems to just tell people that their internet is the problem, not the product. Tried several online suggestions I found, but nothing has worked. My internet is fine (download 800, upload 20). The app is showing connection to the internet and the sync module is excellent. I tried re-formatting the usb. I uninstalled/reinstalled the whole thing - Sync2 and camera. Live view works. The camera's blue light goes on when it detects motion indicating it should be recording, but nothing shows up on the usb. I'm going to waste a little more money and try a new usb, in case something happened to the original one when the account switched from the free trial to no subscription. If that doesn't fix things, I'm done with it. Of course, it's too late to return it to Amazon. If this is Blink's way of trying to force people to pay for the subscription, it's not going to happen. This is basically false advertising. If the new usb actually works, or doesn't work, I will be back to update."
"Once upon a chill morning, nestled in a quaint suburban neighborhood, resided a man named J. Jameson. His humble abode was his sanctum, a place where he sought peace, comfort, and above all, security. To safeguard his haven, J relied upon a series of vigilant eyes, his trusted Blink Outdoor 3 cameras. They were his silent guardians, ceaselessly watching over him and his cherished abode.One fine day, the winds of change brought news of a new sentinel, the Blink Outdoor 4 cameras. They promised sharper eyes and a keener perception, capable of discerning friend from foe. J was enticed; he saw an opportunity to bolster the guardianship of his home. He ordered them post-haste, his heart brimming with anticipation.Day turned into night, and night into day as J awaited his new guardians. Finally, the awaited day dawned with a soft knock on the door, as the courier handed over a small package wrapped in hopes and dreams. J hastily brought down his old sentinels, his loyal Outdoor 3 cameras, thanking them for their service.With a heart full of joy, he unwrapped his new guardians, the Outdoor 4 cameras. Their sleek design gleamed under the soft morning sun, promising a new era of security. J wasted no time and proceeded to install them. However, as he attempted to integrate them with his trusted floodlights, the first crack in his perfect plan appeared.The connectors! They were... different. A cold shiver ran down J’s spine as he attempted again and again to marry the new eyes with the old lights, but to no avail. The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows on J’s desperate silhouette against the cold walls of his home.He rushed to the digital marketplace from whence his new guardians came, scurrying through pages of descriptions and reviews. His breaths grew shallow as the grim reality unveiled itself. The new eyes bore no allegiance to the old lights. His home lay in darkness, watched over by blind sentinels.In desperate hope, J ordered the new floodlights, his pockets lighter, his heart heavier. Days of anxious waiting ensued, every passing moment an echo of the harsh reality, that security came at a hefty price.When the new lights finally arrived, J hastily set up his fortifications, his home now under the vigilant watch of the new guardians. Yet, as he looked through the live feed on his screen, he noticed a figure lurking in the shadows, unnoticed by the new sharper eyes. It was a reflection, a reflection of his own desperate face glaring back at him.In his quest for perfect security, he overlooked the one foe that was always there, his own reflection of fear. The new eyes saw more, yet revealed less, as J realized, the clearest lens was the one looking inward.The cold night whispered the harsh truth, in seeking to see more, J saw less; in seeking to secure, he felt more insecure. The silence of the night was only broken by the soft hum of the new guardians, the Blink Outdoor 4, watching over an empty, silent house, inhabited by a solitary J. Jameson."
"review redone... first one was a flame...The good:  cost effective solution allows remote monitoring and video/audio capture.  Was finally (after gobs of frustration) to get my minimum needs met WITHOUT the subscription.The bad:  Very poor (non-existent) product documentation.  If you have time to waste diving into the rabbit-hole of FAQs and marketing videos, maybe you'll feel differently...  but most of these steer you into a subscription service.  I found too many inconsistencies and wrong information to be trust-worthy.  I also find the trial subscription period masks the product faults until AFTER the return window expires.  ONLY then do you find out what you bought - you might find out you wasted your money.  It takes persistence to reach a support person.since this review is only weeks after purchase, there's no info re: longevity, reliability, etc.  time will teill."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Update: Amazon was no help. Amazon would only refund my purchase & said I could buy a new one. If I had done that, I would have paid a lot more because the price has increased. This was a no go for me so I decided to call Blink. **** Important - If you have a problem with  your blink camera, call Blink, they will help you. You do have to go through a lot of testing but well worth it. If they can't fix it, they will replace it so you don't have to buy another one if yours is defective ****After speaking with Blink representatives twice (different days because the 1st time we thought it was fixed) about the green video clip when filming on my new gen 4,  we figured out it was defective. They replaced it with a new one at no cost to me. I was really pleased with their customer service. The set up was easier with new replacement.  The wifi is stronger than my Gen 3 now. I still had to get a wifi extender because we have so many wifi items now. The Gen 4 does still eat batteries quicker than Gen 3. I did buy the battery extender so we shall see how long the batteries last. The night vision on the Gen 4 is still not as good as the Gen 3. I am wondering if it is because they change the design on the front. The camera used to be in the middle & something above it, it is a glass square, maybe to let more light in during the night? The new Gen 4 has the camera on the right side corner.  No more square glass. Gen 3 is the 1st pic, Gen 4 2nd pic.  Unfortunately the night vision is still not as good my Gen 3. I had to switch the Gen 4 from the cat house to the picnic table since the night vision was not good near the cat houses. The night vision is darker on the Gen 4. Overall, it serves it purpose for me. I have a Blink Gen 3 outdoor camera which has been working pretty good. The camera is under our picnic table where everyone eats. I have to change the batteries every 2 months because I have everything on high to capture my feral cats eating and who shows up. This is very important to me. So the changing of the batteries wasn't a deal breaker. So I decided to get a Blink Gen 4 to watch my cat houses to see if anyone was using them. I received the new camera on December 28th. I had difficulty with the wifi not being strong enough so I moved the sync module from inside our house to our shed (right next door to cat house). I had a strong  signal for the Gen 4, but not for the Gen 3. I had to lower the settings because I kept getting a green video clip.  This is a disappointment because it changed the timing of the videos, IR setting & motion. The night vision is darker than my Gen 3. I switched them around trying to see if it was normal for the night vision or it was an issue with the Gen 4 camera. Besides the settings issue, the MAJOR downfall is the batteries life. The next day after I installed the camera on the 28th, it said the batteries was low (red icon) so I changed the batteries thinking maybe they had been sitting in the warehouse too long. Well, I put a new set of batteries in and again the following day, it is saying batteries low. My Gen 3 batteries lasted at least 2 months & it has the settings more sensitive. This shouldn't be. I did order the battery extender but I don't think that is going to fix this problem. If it doesn't, then both will be returned & I'll have to figure out something else. Gen 4 is supposed to be an upgrade but for me it was a downgrade. ☹️"
"The Blink Outdoor 4 - add-on camera was easy to install and works well. I purchased this camera to add to my Legacy XT2 camera system which included free cloud storage forever. When I installed the new Blink Outdoor 4, a got a notice that showed I was receiving a 30-day trial Blink Plus Plan that I don't intend to purchase beyond the trial. I'm on a fixed income and truly cannot afford it. I just need the basic features of the XT-2 system. It's my understanding that Blink Outdoor 4 will not save clips to the cloud without the Blink Plus Plan and my XT-2 sync module does not have the option of local storage so I will have uninstall and return the camera so I can continue with my original Legacy XT-2 system and cloud storage."
"My title pretty much sums it up. This is a decent system if you want a cheap security camera. I've had an Arlo Pro ll  camera system for about 7 years. It still works like new. I have a three camera system that covers my doors. I wanted 5 additional cameras to completely cover my entire perimeter. The Blink system fit my budget, so I went with it. It's adequate. The cameras aren't as good of quality as the Arlo, but I didn't really expect them to be, considering the price difference. The image quality is inferior. The infra-red is far inferior, and the distance is less. But again, it's acceptable and a good value for the price. My biggest issue is the battery life. Blink claims a 2 year battery life. That's borderline false advertising. I've had my system for two months and have to change the batteries in 4 of my 5 cameras already. That's very disappointing. They tell you during setup that battery life may be affected if you select certain things, such as distance, infra-red, etc., but who needs a camera system that will only work for 5 or 10 feet and not in the dark? You buy a security camera system to provide security. I much rather they provide real world results, rather than making exaggerated claims. So, in conclusion, I repeat that this is a good, cheap, system, that offers reasonable coverage at a budget price. Just go in with your eyes wide open and don't expect to actually get their exaggerated claims on battery life. I did subscribe to the monthly plan, which provides unlimited recording backup and I'm very satisfied with it. Overall I'd recommend this Blink product for what it is."
"I have two versions of the Blink Wireless Outdoor Cameras Gen 3 on both.  They work fine and at times seem to be a little too sensitive but easily adjustable.  I just set up my new camera and it is the Blink Wireless Outdoor Gen 4.  The motion sensitivity is not near as good as the Gen 3's even though the field of view is wider.  The sensitivity adjustment on a setting of 9 is no better than the Gen 3's sensitivity setting of 5.  I almost have to pass by my zone of interest before it recognizes a person in the area.  And YES, I set them all on Person, adjusted the settings up and down and even reset the entire system a couple of times.Unless you are interested in a camera that is limited range and want to set it up on a particular object and not a patio setting, I would not recommend the Blink Wireless Outdoor Camera Gen 4. Otherwise you will be disappointed.  And NO, I am not returning it, I just swapped it out with one of Gen 3's to an area less broad and not as critical."
"I really want to like these. They are super easy to put exactly where you want them and get them connected to your account. They don’t pick up movement at much of a distance. My biggest disappointment is the battery life. In reading the description they CLAIM it is a pretty decent battery life. I’ve had 4 of these cameras for less than 2 months and I’ve had to replace all the batteries. Only 2 of the cameras told me the batteries will need to be replaced, the other 2 just went off line. For dependability, these aren’t reliable. I’m just glad we didn’t pay for the double battery pack because the batteries that came with it didn’t even last 2 months!!!! Wish I would have stayed with Ring"
"The cameras work well, but they're definitely not security cameras.  On a regular basis, one or two of the photos from the day before arrive the day after taking it.  Also, it doesn't know the difference from a person and a rabbit.  Roughly once every other day it captures something unknown. Those pictures look like water splash marks but disappear so fast that it can't be water evaporating.  It doesn't look like anything the photo captured...more like Blink spazzed or if it were pixelated it would be connectivity issues.  Just for information:  a long blade of grass moving or steam from a heated water dish in below freezing weather will trigger the camera as well."
"Don't put this near it. It works exactly the same. No panoramic view and only a direct view of the person standing in front of it.  Also nighttime vision only works if you don't have any outdoor lights on. With outdoor lights on, the camera will still detect that it is night time, and any figure that walks in front of it will look like a white ghost. No details.  I tried adjusting the IR to the lowest setting and it helped a bit. But still too blurry.All that being said, it's a good camera with a clear vision in the pitch dark or daylight.  Just stick it up in a tree somewhere facing one single direction."
"I've got Blink cameras at my home and business. They're easy to set up, provide good picture quality and the system is easy to manage.Of the 10 total cameras I have, one drains the batteries in just a few days. You're supposed to get up to 2 years of battery life. This camera initially drained the batteries in 2 months. The next set of batteries lasted 2 weeks, then I could only get a few days out of it. I've moved this camera so it sits right beside one of my others so that all things should be equal as far as motion picked up and battery usage. Still no good.I contacted the warranty dept and have gotten nothing but a run around. They said put new batteries in it. I said I have. They requested I let them have access to the camera data, and I did. They said the batteries are dead, please replace them. I put new batteries in again, and they lasted a couple days. Warranty dept requested access again. I granted access and they said the batteries are dead. I said I know, that's the problem....this one camera drains the batteries. They requested access again....., guess what? They said the batteries are dead, replace them. This went on for over 2 months and over $50 worth of Lithium batteries. I finally gave up. Good system, horrible warranty support."
"I finally decided to purchase a new set of Blink cameras for my second home after using the original ones for 5 or 6 years. I thought the technology would have improved, but have been very disappointed. They fog up and little can be seen on the cameras at night and in the morning. If I'm there, I have to wipe off the lenses, but the whole point of having them is that I am not there all the time. I  replaced all but one of my cameras and the old one does not get foggy! I now have to decide if it's better to return these new ones and put up my old ones again."
"I purchased these two units on sale.  I am looking at getting a whole home security system and wanted to try out these to get my feet wet.They arrived promptly and were quick to add and setup. I feel like you really need a subscription to get the most out of these cameras (for person and vehicle filtering).  I used the free demo for evaluation and was still very frustrated with zones where you could select what part of the field of view would be monitored for activity.I blocked out the entire top half of the camera and road as well as a good portion of the front yard but I still received constant notifications from cars on the road in front of my house.  I read about shadows/lights from vehicles possibly triggering the motion but reviewing the footage carefully didn't show any of that during daylight.Picture quality was OK, but not super highbquality compared to other more expensive brands.  I decided to sell them to a coworker who is already invested in the Blink ecosystem.  Fine if you don't mind the subscription (to disable cars/select People only on a road facing camera) and are OK with the quality."
"Update:  An Amazon Blink Representive contacted me and were more than willing to replace the, what I called unreliable cameras.  So far the cameras work as expected.  Thank you First, I am/was a Blink lover. Two years ago I purchased blink outdoor cameras. They work perfectly and from great distances.  I decided to purchase 4 more Gen 4 outdoor cameras thinking they would perform the same as the older ones.  Unfortunately that's not the case.  Two of my cameras keep going offline.  I've tried moving the cameras within 10 feet of the router, replaced batteries, deleted readded and still nothing.I've contacted Support and it's been nothing more than sending emails back and forth with them. Trying this and that all of which I've done already. When asked if they would simply replace the 2 non functioning ones I'm asked to do something again that they've asked me to do before, which I did.I've purchased many blink Items for both inside and outside our home.  My husband and I are retired and travel alot so we depend highly on these cameras."
"NOT ! Hi definition beyond 10 feet or so.Meets my needs in Garage to see if my door was left open or not. Also handy to see movement in ""Garage"" when wifey come and go 😊👍🏼.Also, haven't experimented with how far it can be away from router to connect through walls and what not.Fairly easy set up/link……… Only have one so far as test... app Device settings crappy Awkward frustrating to fumble through. NOT user-friendly device settings ! !Must have GED Certificate (and patience) or better for that. Would NOT be able to see a license plate Numbers/letters from farther than 5 feet !!!! .EASY to arm and disarm within seconds of opening the app.Because ""BATTERY"" powered, I only ""Arm"" it when we both away & or I want to see wifey come and go from garage rarely cuz she RARELY turn her phone on!…ALSO… AUDIO… Sucks kind of !…… when I use it to communicate with significant other, I find myself SCREAMING in my i Device and there's a slight delay…Grrrrrr. …… Yes I feel I have to scream and person keeps saying, What ?, What ?, What ?😡 Frustrating.AGAIN , suits my simple needs…… To see if I close garage door or not when halfway to work……AND… For the little I need it, $3 a month would not be helpful. or necessary because not high definition security ! !. Alerts to my phone are fast enough… (20-30 Seconds login after ding.Haven't purchased $30+ (16 gig minimum) flash for inconvenient search of recordings. I will screen record if necessary while viewing.Not so happy with sad audio communication. I can hear quite better than the person hearing me on it.External power plug hole to AC adapter would be VERY HELPFUL !... that would've been simple/cheap to include.If I purchased a $3 Record fee, I would be sucking Batteries faster i'm sure."
"They are ok for the price. I think with the settings you can get a decent picture quality. But with that comes the use of more battery power. One camera has already had the batteries replaced and I’ve only had them for a short time. Definitely not two years like they claim. I’ve considered plugging them in but that leaves the back open to the elements.And it seems when the power goes off, they can never connect back to the sync module. I have to unplug the sync and wait again. Frustrating when you’re out of town for a week and it happens the first day you’re gone. No way to restart them."
"Pretty easy to set up but some things seem glitchy.  Got a battery security light/camera setup.  We have a detached brick garage 76' from the house, had to get the module to boost the WIFI.  Only place to mount the camera and security light unit was above the garage door, under a metal canopy.  Can't angle it down enough to see anyone directly at the doors - you can only see someone walk up to them, then they disappear.  That's a problem.  (Would be nice to have an angled mount.)  At night, can't figure out if that's a moth flying by the camera or a bat (it's a white flying blob due to the IR).  A cat or skunk walking across the driveway -- good picture with B/W details.  But you can't zoom in or slow the playback down. It is what it is.  Also, during this current heat wave, the automatic notification indicates the camera couldn't arm or disarm itself, but the camera itself indicates it did and does provide videos.  So confusing on using the module -- do I have to have it if I have the Blink subscription plan?  I've never used the cloud storage.  Or have I?  Could be easier to understand but seems to be a way to get extra money from you.  Finally detached the USB drive for saving videos and everything worked better (because it kept causing false notifications with no video, over and over).  I now get instant notification of movement at the garage thru my Alexa, which is nice.  On the security light, you do need to be much closer before it will turn on.I started out with an indoor camera (for pet observation), then invested in 7 outdoor cameras, so hate to change midstream.  But if I had to do it again, I'd start with a more professional security system, or even a trail camera.  On a good note, haven't had to replace any of the D or AA batteries yet (been up since March) despite it indicating a high battery use warning."
"i bought a 4 pack, and I have had these cameras not even 9 months, and they have been inside of my house the last 4 because the batteries died one day, I replaced them and they were dead again a day later... says that batteries are supposed to be ""great"" and last a long time.. I didn't think 5 months was a long time, especially when there's not much action going on.. I bought the cameras because I had issues with neighbors messing with my dogs. but haven't even been able to use them much.. I paid right at $200 for these... I will never buy these again.. too expensive to not work."
"When I purchased my Blink Outdoor 4 camera, I added it to my system of several older model blink cameras. I am a legacy Blink camera customer, meaning I get free cloud storage because I bought Blink cameras before  April 15, 2020.  I was automatically given a trial of the Blink Plus plan even though I really didn't need it. Everything worked fine and when motion was detected, Alexa would announce the motion. Unfortunately, when the trial ended, the Outdoor 4 camera stopped announcing motion through Alexa. It did continue to store clips in the Blink cloud since I was a legacy user. The problem is that the new Outdoor 4 camera does not announce through Alexa for legacy users unless you have a subscription plan. I called Technical Support and they extended my trial subscription plan for 30 days and Alexa began to work again.  This functionality should work for legacy users without a subscription plan at all , and technical support confirmed this and told me this is a known issue for an Outdoor 4 camera, which as of Dec 2024 has been an ongoing issue for 11 months without a solution.  All of my Blink XT cameras still notify through Alexa properly and this is just an issue for the Outdoor 4. Basically, I am forced to purchase a subscription plan to work around the legacy user Alexa integration bug, even though this functionality should work for legacy users, and was intended to work without a subscription plan at all. I am stuck with a camera that does not meet my needs in terms of Alexa integration due to a problem they admit to having and can not seem to solve in a timely manner. They don't seem to stand behind their product, particularly for legacy users who are the definition of dedicated users, and I feel like their overzealous push towards a subscription business model has them slow rolling the bug fix in order to harvest more subscription dollars at the expense of long term users. So I am not happy about this Alexa integration bug for legacy users, and the prospect of Blink never getting around to fixing this problem since it has been almost a year (at this writing) and they have not yet fixed the problem."
"Updated 12-1-2023I have had a horrible time with these 4th generation blink cameras. The battery life does not last 2 years, I had to change batteries out 4 times and today another one is low on batteries in 1 month. This system is a very unstable camera system and I regret buying it. The wind moves the cameras very easily, the rain ruins the camera pictures with drops on it, and cameras will stop working randomly. I had to reset the cameras a few times cause of lost connection. What I’ve learned is that if you simply leave it alone it will come back on once it reads the wifi again. These cameras I will have to say are very unreliable and should not be allowed on Amazon to sell until they fix all the bugs and malfunctions it’s having. Customers should be reimbursed for buying these cameras. Buy ring instead, they last longer and are super reliable, you get what you pay for with these ring cameras.Updated 11-3-2023Last night there was a terrible accident in front of my house and my blink cameras did not pick up enough seconds to determine what took place. The cameras recorded 1 seconds worth video and showed nothing. The father of the person who got into accident ask if my cameras had picked up the accident and I had to tell him, no! I called customer service and we went thru all the cameras and I had to send 5 cameras back because they were all determined to be defected. We had to reset my modem, the module, and reinstall app and to no avail. Thank god I had a second box of these and went into those and found the ones that worked to replace the other ones that were defected. After setting up my cameras once more and updating the firmware we finally got them to work and record more than 2 seconds, they now record the time I set on the app and that’s 30 seconds. I sure wish the quality of these g4 weren’t this unreliable, because the person in the accident said another car came from opposite side and made him go to right side of road. Either way, these cameras have been giving me a hard time with the rain, and with frost. It seems they’re not protected enough to withstand the frost, like my ring cameras are. I’m considering sending these back if they go back again. Another thing to watch out for is your camera malfunctioning and going off line. I had to get my ladder twice and take batteries out and put them back in to get the camera to work again. If any of this happens again, I’ll be sending this garbage system back and going with ring. I’ll pay the extra money for my sanity and making sure the cameras pick up on the important things I need recorded. Very disappointed with the quality of these cameras, how ever the customer service third world country receptionist Mitch was very helpful in sorting out the problem and determining that the cameras were indeed defected. 5 camera were sent back, this was not good.Old Review:So, the sound on live view is very bad. Not sure what's going on but it’s pretty loud. The glare from outdoor lights are coming up on camera with huge light rays and ruining the picture a bit. I do not like that there’s no preview photos as there is with ring camera, which is a down fall. This is probably why the camera batteries last so long. The setup was extremely easy and every camera linked up pretty fast accept for one which I had to start the whole process over again since it wasn’t syncing to app. After resetting app, I was able to get camera to pop up. The cameras look and feel like high quality cameras, they seems very durable, but, only time will tell. So, would I recommend these, here are my thoughts:I didn’t have cameras covering my back yard before and the fact that I now can see what’s going on around my home is beyond comforting. So, of course I have to put up with some minor details, but, it’s still worth buying because I can still see there’s a threat coming in and that’s something you can’t put a price on. I would definitely buy more and recommend to anyone who wants to be warned when someone is lurking near your home. Hopefully Blink will update their firmware and fix a few things on their end, it’s a continuously evolving product and I’m sure things will get better once better software comes out."
"The cameras work well and set up was petty easy.  However they're selling these cameras with batteries that are close to dead.  I called Blink support and they stated they don't warrant the batteries.  But you pay for new batteries that are suppose to be fully charged right?  I would have checked the charge on the batteries and just sent them back until I finally got a set that fully charged batteries if I thought Amazon would do this to customers.  In the end, I kept the cameras as they were already installed and had to buy new AA lithium batteries."
GotThese to replace my 3rd gen cameras and these are awful. The only good thing about these is the video quality but other than that these new cameras kinda suck. For some reason it refuses to record at night or it captures random motion when nothing is moving.also I have changed my solar panels multiple times because I keep having issues with the power draining. I can only have it on person detection in order to record some video throughout the day but even so the video sometimes only records for 10 seconds at a time even if I have it set at 60 seconds. If I put it in record all motion my camera will die by 8pm and will not turn on till 10 am the next day or not at all. I have my motion sensor at 6 which is not even remotely close to the max which is 9 and not much goes on for my cameras to keep draining so fast.
"I bought a few Blink cameras over time and really enjoyed using them.  Then one day they all went down.  I was out of town for a week or so and when I returned home I could not reconnect them to the sync module.  I called support and was told all the usual troubleshooting methods- if you are reading this you know what they are.  Finally I was told by two different people that my internet was just too slow to connect. That didn't make sense at all, but there was no where else to go.  I had 5 dead Blink cameras.  Next I tried emailing and got the same answers.Here's what they don't tell you:  You must be connected to you 2.4 GHz network channel.  Of equal importance is this: the wireless mode must be on 802.11 b/g/n.  Then restart the router and make sure that setting has saved.  That was the gamechanger for me.  My internet company  had removed that option from my router so I was on 802.11 g/n.  As soon as they returned that option to me, my blink Cameras re-connected and work like they should.To change this open up your router through your internet browser.  Under the Gateway option choose ""Connection"" then ""Wi-Fi"".  Now look for your 2.4 Ghz channel and click on the ""Edit"" button.  You will see a dropdown box called ""Mode"".  Hopefully you can select the b/g/n option.  If it's not there or it won't save after a reboot call your provider and tell them to add it.  For me, I could change it but it wouldn't save after a reboot.  When I called Xfinity the first two times they couldn't even see that I had that option available because they had removed it from my router.  So tell them to add it back if it has happened to you!!!Good Luck.  This took me 3 months to get resolved and it was only after hours of internet research that I found this particular answer.  Amazon, if you're reading this please add this solution to your FAQs!!!  Thank you!"
"I was so exited to get these easy to install left all the settings as the basic set up. Night time vision quality is not the best, the slightest light makes a giant spot and you can’t see anything. The sound through and back is clear and understandable, BUT the battery life quality SUCKS I’ve had 2 months and have had two cameras die already with the provided batteries on stock settings. Feel like it’s falsely cause “well I have them just buy the expansion battery pack” more money spent. Not happy with them. I’d go wired if you can. Or plan to buy the packs."
"I ordered these cameras and put them up, and it is our first home security system, but even the high-def 1080 can’t make out a license plate from what ends up being about 15 feet away. They definitely serve their purpose and for the most part work great, but if you need to see something super clear from more than 10 feet away, you might need to invest in a better system, and as far as the batteries go, it does come with lithium batteries saying that they should last about two years. but, after you set them up with the sensitivity, that is most logical,  I found that they’ve only lasted about four months on two of the cameras so far! Now, To be fair those are high traffic cameras that I might end up adjusting, but, doesn’t seem like they hold a really good battery life. I mean to get two years out of those batteries. The sensitivity would have to be set so low that it only picked up something, that got directly in front of it,  from 6 inches away.  but all in all, if you’re looking for a good starter kit, this will be just fine. Try not to get the cameras too far away from the hub , or they won’t work With Wi-Fi, the strength of each little camera isn’t that great and reaching the hub. I would say no more than 40-50 feet , if you want to connect to Wi-Fi"
"This is the 3rd camera I bought. I have had no problems with the first 2. However, this last one I bought suddenly stops working. I don't know about it unless I check and see that device is unavailable. During that time the camera wasn't doing its job. I did a reset and removed it from the system and it worked again, until it didn't. It keeps happening. I followed the directions from support. They closed out the case and said to reply back if it happens again and they'll replace it. It happened again, so I replied back and they wanted me to start over with the troubleshooting steps.03/12/2024 I replied back to the closed support case per their instructions.03/13/2024 I received this response:Thank you for contacting Blink regarding your issue.Most common offline device issues can be resolved by rebooting your Wi-Fi router, Sync Module and if available on your home network; network extenders and mesh pods for 30 seconds.Please see the links below on how to resolve most common offline issues:- General Wi-Fi Information and Troubleshooting Guide- Blink Camera Offline- Blink Mini Camera Offline- Sync Module Offline​Please reply if you need any further assistance.Thank you for being a Blink customer.03/14/2024 I reply back03/16/2024 I reply again03/19/2024 I write this reviewThis camera is of no use to me if I can't rely on it to do what it's intended to do; notify me when it detects motion. It can't do that if quits working. I like the cameras, but the support experience has left me unprotected more than once during the time between when the camera stops working, and when I discover it and contact support to reset it and get it working again.I gave Motion detection 2/5 because I will get notifications on my phone that motion was detected, yet the clip of the motion is never created. It doesn't happen all the time, but it happens."
"So I’ve been in the blink ecosystem since their inception . I already own every generation and every product that blinks has ever made . So I feel I’m in a position to give a thorough and honest review of the latest from blink . So what’s changed : 1) design ( camera lens is offset and the PIR sensor is hidden . The speaker is now on the side . This has not resulted in any huge improvement over previous generations sound volume  . There’s no way you’re hearing this on a busy street ! And that’s just about all . ( no spotlight , no siren , no time stamp). It includes the Same crappy and flimsy mount that moves with the wind that the previous design shipped with  . There’s New motion detection with “ person / face recognition”  … which does  require a cloud storage subscription in order to work . How well does it work ? In all honesty it’s so far worthless . I get alerts that a person is at my door … only to watch a visitor  squirrel or bird which is labeled as having been a person . The motion sensing sensitivity ? With the latest firmware it’s Worse than my previous gen blink . At a sensitivity setting of 9 I don’t get any alert until I’m within 20 feet of the camera . And at a sensitivity setting of 9 I get false alarms every time a cars headlights hit my house . Less than 9 ? I get nothing until there within 10 feet sometimes . Same as previous gen. By that time , whatever set it off is just about out of frame. Same as every other gen blink . So my final thought ? It’s Seriously lacking compared to Ring in both software refinement, features as well as integration to Alexa which almost never works reliably on blink as well . Despite both ring and blink  being amazon owned , blink continues to be priced much lower compared to ring but nowhere near the performance .  If these were continuously priced at their Black Friday pricing all the time , I’d say to buy them no questions asked, especially if you’re already  in the blink ecosystem. If you’re starting fresh … pretty much every other camera in this price range works better . Ring , arlo and eufy  all expose the blinks shortcomings  . Sorry Blink , that’s just  my honest review . Your new 4th gen camera is good … but like every other gen … it is Not great !"
"I try to keep my network secure.MAC address filtering (yes I know it means devices can't use dynamic MAC addresses, but I don't want them to I want to know what's on my network - I don't want to make it easy for someone to disguise their device). Even my guest network uses MAC address filtering. There are other security settings, but guess what, Blink didn't like any of them.Next, the APP. It doesn't always work if you have a privacy VPN turned on. Trying to create an account gives a 406. I always use a privacy VPN on mobile devices... It's just a secure way to live.Lastly support is poor.I got the devices set up, made sure they worked, connected them to the places I wanted, then moved the ""sync module"" to a new location.Went to check again and couldn't activate the cameras or get a picture.Called support. The person said ""can you turn off your router for 30 seconds and turn it back on""... No I can't, I run a business with this network and all my other devices are connecting. She went on to say ""Blink devices can only connect to 2.4Ghz, so it must be the router"" :facepalm:I went on to explain that initially they had all connected, so the router is obviously 2.4Ghz (it's 2.4 and 5 like most). They could only connect to the 2.4 as each network has different passwords so it can't connect to the 5.She didn't get it one bit.When you get support that thinks they know more than the customer it's a bad sign.I hung up...I thought to myself ""I bet this thing doesn't like MAC filtering"", turned it off and it worked again.So. I've created another guest network just for Blink...Finally it's working and the cameras are pretty good. It's a shame the networking technology is bottom of the barrel."
"OK so I have two ring cameras, but Ring is a little more expensive and I wanted a new doorbell camera and two outdoor cameras and Blink was a little more cost-effective and Amazon were having their sale so I bought a blink doorbell camera in a package with two outdoor cameras and then I got the little silicone cover that goes on the cameras to help protect them from birds and stuff so I get everything home and I unpack everything and ring has the doorbell you put the mount on the wall you put the doorbell on the mount you go to the app and you set it up and the picture is perfect and you set your zones and it notifies you when it goes with Alexa and it’s easy. Blink not so easy blink comes with this sink adapter. You have to have plugged in near your Wi-Fi so that in case you don’t want to use their cloud services, you have some thing that’s going to record your stuff the set up instructions in the boxes don’t give a whole lot of information I mean it’s basics  all mine instructions again basics it doesn’t tell you that the cameras only gonna record five seconds unless you go in and reset it but there’s so many settings unlike Ring the picture is OK it’s it’s not any better or worse than Ring the parts are pretty much all plastic in where my ring doorbells are some plastic and some metal which makes me feel a little better  but all in all I have to say I’m probably going to go back to buying Ring products because they seem to be more sturdy and much easier to use the app is way more user-friendly. Yes Blink was cheaper by quite a bit probably at least half if not a little more than half , their subscription is the same cost as Ring. It’s got more moving parts more everything to do on Blink than there is on Ring. I have health issues. I’m really glad we put the cameras up because my husband had a heart attack and the camera caught it, but I had only set the recordings for normal and normal on the ring is 30 seconds normal on the blink is five seconds , so it didn’t catch all of it it so we didn’t know he had a heart attack and was laying on the ground for three minutes until the camera picked up movement again again didn’t know I was only recording five second intervals it should tell you more information. It should tell you all of the different options as you’re going through set up like Ring does that’s all I’m saying , both products are decent they’re good I just think I like better they’re more sturdy and more user-friendly but Blink is quite a bit less expensive good luck with which ever you choose."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Well I want to give you a five star but I bought three of the new generation cameras. And since I've installed them they glitch all the time and this is a video of what it does. I've had the other generation for a little over 3 years now no problems at all! By three of the new generation nothing but problems with them. They sometimes don't even pick up motion. And if they do they'll go black. I'm very upset. If there was a way to plug the minis in outside and then be waterproof they would be going out there. Oh wait a minute but now my camera in my laundry room in my basement is glitching. I sure hope there's a way you can fix this because if not, I would like 100% refund on that last order of cameras I bought."
"For what it does, it is okay and work as intended. The issue: Purchase camera together with 1 year subscription plan.. But after setup and linking blink/Amazon account, Amazon charged me again for the subscription. So I got charged twice for the camera subscription service for the same year period. The representative claimed that subscription plans are none refundable, I had to make it clear of their error and the double charge. Still waiting to see the outcome, this was troubling and I am not too happy about this experience at all."
"I have been a loyal Blink customer for almost a decade, even before Amazon acquired them. I have an account that does not require a monthly fee, as Blink originally had no fees as a selling point. I have owned every generation of Blink camera and currently have two XTs, three version 3s, and three of the new version 4s.All the generations share the same mount type, so I assumed installing the 4s and removing the 3s would be straightforward. However, I encountered several issues. The 4s use USB-C instead of microUSB like the previous models. While this is not a significant issue, I had to purchase converter cables to connect my existing solar panels to the new cameras.More concerningly, the 4s have a weaker Wi-Fi range compared to the 3s. Despite being in the exact same locations, one camera could not maintain a Wi-Fi connection, and all of them had weaker signals. Strong Wi-Fi and Blink Sync module signals are crucial for Blink cameras to function effectively.Additionally, two of my cameras would disconnect and go offline every morning. After contacting support and waiting several days between emails, they suggested deleting and re-adding the cameras, which did not resolve the issue. The only temporary solution was to unplug and replug the solar panel or remove and reinsert the batteries.While I was initially drawn to the Blink ecosystem and thought transitioning from the 3s to the 4s would be simple, it turned out to be a mistake. The 4s have a wider field of view and better picture quality, but the battery life is significantly worse. Even with solar panels, the batteries would drain completely.Furthermore, Blink has introduced an AI mode that can detect humans and reduce false notifications, but this feature is hidden behind a paywall that is not accessible to grandfathered accounts like mine. The new subscription plans are also expensive, costing over $120 per year for multiple cameras.Despite being owned by Amazon, Blink and Ring do not have a unified app, which is inconvenient for users who have both Blink cameras and Ring doorbells. This requires managing two separate apps and paying two monthly bills.Shortly after I purchased the 3-camera kit, Blink released a new Blink Sync module XR (extended range) that allows for better signal strength for two cameras but limits video quality to 720p. This suggests that Blink was aware of the poor signal strength of the new cameras.I am disappointed with the direction Blink has taken. I am tired of paying excessive monthly fees, so I have decided to switch to Eufy cameras for both security and doorbell purposes. Eufy offers a more comprehensive solution without requiring monthly fees.I must also mention that Blink's motion detection is unreliable, resulting in numerous false notifications that drain the battery and make it difficult to identify genuine security threats. Additionally, the motion detection often misses actual threats or captures only the person walking away.In conclusion, I would advise caution when considering Blink cameras for security purposes. Ring cameras are a better option within the Amazon ecosystem. However, there are alternative brands like Eufy and Wyze that offer comparable features without requiring monthly fees. I genuinely believe that purchasing Blink cameras will lead to disappointment."
"This product is not ready for prime time. The connection to the system module from the camera is spotty at best. The wireless range is quoted as being 100 feet, I think 25 feet is more appropriate for this device...12/7/24: After working with the Blink customer service team I have been able to improve the consistency of the system. The published specifications have many caveats (like any other product) and should be adhered to for the best performance. Wireless range is way less than 100 feet if you don't have at least 3 bars of signal strength on the camera. So with that being said, most installations will be less than 50 feet when trying to meet the 3 bar limitation."
"Camera was easy to setup.  Picture quality is very good. I have one camera that is stating the batteries are almost dead. It has only been operating for 14 days. I only arm the cameras at night. This is a 3 camera system.  This camera is not taking any motion videos either. Not quite sure why the batteries are almost dead after 14 days. I have all the cameras setup the same and WFI strength is the same, too."
"I really wanted these Blink cameras to work, but the most important features did not work as advertised.I had 5 cameras that I was using, including a doorbell camera, and only the doorbell camera ever worked as expected (it didn't use the Blink ""sync"" module).  All other cameras which used the ""sync"" module would not work as advertised.What did work:  - Notifications (on your phone) when someone (or something) moved in front of a camera.  - Manual  (on demand) ""live view"" of what a specific camera was seeing at that moment (including audio).What did not work (on the cameras using the ""sync"" module):  - Thumbnails.  Every time I tried getting a ""thumbnail"" image of a camera, it would say there was an error and please try again later.  It never worked.  (A ""thumbnail"" was necessary for setting motion activity zones).  - Recordings (""clips"") after a motion notification/trigger: The cameras would never record any clips of activities triggered by motion in the camera.  (this is the main purpose of a security camera).I spent about 2 months with Blink customer support trying to get this fixed for the cameras that used the sync module.  At first they were trying to tell me that my then 20Mbps Internet wasn't fast enough for 5 cameras.  They said each camera needed 5Mbps, which amounted to a total of 25Mbps Internet connection (for 5 cameras), so this explained why it wasn't working.  I'm an IT guy, so I knew they were trying to make up things to keep me busy, but I played along.  Using a single camera still failed.  They wanted me to ""try this"", ""try that"", ""try the other thing"", and it all still failed.  They then wanted me to switch the cameras over to using my phone WiFi, which is already had fairly slow Internet speed because of where I lived.I changed my Internet provider, and internal home network infrastructure, and WiFi router, to now support 250Mbps+ via WiFi.  And, as I had already guessed, the Blink cameras still failed (both thumbnails and motion-triggered-clips).I gave up on Blink after two months of this, and switched to Eufy, based on a recommendation from a friend.Eufy was very easy and quick to set up, and everything worked as advertised (including setting ""activity areas, and motion-triggered-clips).  They even had some supported features that Blink did not.So ... based on my own experience with Blink and Eufy.  I am sorry that I ever purchased Blink in the first place.  I gave it 1-star because the entire purpose of a security camera was to make recordings of the activity it saw, and it failed miserably in its main purpose."
"So I decided to upgrade my blink 3 to blink 4.Pros: these cameras have a GREAT day time and night time view. There is more coverage area in the view which is nice. Super easy to install. The person recognition is pretty accurate and I think will save battery.Cons: I feel like they do not pick up as well or lose connectivity. I put them in the same spots as my 3s.The BIGGEST con is the lens is not set in like the 3, therefore you will get dew on the outer lens. So from 2am till 8am, I can’t see much of anything. I also bought the covers and it didn’t help. This is almost a deal breaker for me. They are almost useless at the times when they are most needed."
"I got my first three cameras up and running before sunset yesterday. Everything worked great until the lenses fogged over just after sunset. That rendered my cameras unusable throughout the night when I need them the most. More than six hours after sunrise they're finally starting to clear. Is this something to expect all winter? If so, the system is unusable. Otherwise, I'd rate the cameras a 5.On the positive side they're easy to set up and use."
"I bought this thinking that it will run off batteries but you have to have another box plugged into a power source. It will record if you lose internet but if you lose power, you lose the camera. You also have to have a USB memory drive for it to continue to record hooked up to the box plugged in the wall. The camera itself is wireless, but I didn’t read it well enough I suppose"
"Quite possibly the most frustrating camera system possible. Replaced a 1st gen blink camera system with these…no issue to get the sync module online, but spent close to 4 hours trying to link cameras to it, both with and without the help of blink tech support.They finally gave me a ridiculous list of benchmarks for network settings to share with my isp, all of which are current met or exceeded….and my system still doesn’t work. The sync module is faulty, it’s obvious. But blink won’t stand behind the quality of their software or hardware. This is the last time they’ll receive my money.Update from my previous one-star review: Blink saw my review above and contacted me to inquire about the experience. Despite knowing the previous Blink customer service representatives had taken copious notes about the troubleshooting steps taken over many hours on the phone, the email representative from Blink attempted to get me to attempt the same troubleshooting again over email...a process that began to take several days between replies.After I noted that I was no longer willing to waste time troubleshooting over email and explained to the representative that I believed the sync module was faulty and needed to be replaced, she finally agreed to send a new one. After a couple of weeks from start to finish in this process, I received a new, replacement sync module from Blink at no charge. As soon as I plugged that sync module in, the system worked perfectly. I explained to the representative that if they had simply listened to me in the first place and let logic dictate that five working cameras that connected to an older sync module but would not connect to the new one, pointed directly to the faulty nature of the device, we could have saved weeks of time and trouble.I'm now happy with the function of the Blink system, but the support process was overly lengthy and tedious. I'm increasing my rating to 3-stars, only because Blink was proactive in reaching out to me and eventually did resolve the issue after a lot of prodding on my behalf."
"This is the second bundle of Blink cameras I have ordered and have been pleased with the products. Work great, easy to connect, and pictures are good enough. This received 3 stars because of the return policy. I ordered the 5 outdoor 4 camera bundle with the extra mini. One of the outdoor 4 cameras will not connect to the sync module. Amazon customer support was helpful but the policy is that you have to return the entire bundle for a refund if one camera does not work. I had already mounted 5 of the 6 cameras received and I am not willing to take everything down and mess with all the hassle of all that. I'll just toss the defective camera and call it a lesson learned for the future"
This is my second system.  Like the first system it is easy to enroll the sync module and add the cameras.  It is not easy to get them to record video when armed.  I decline the trial period and have a thumb drive to store videos.  It still wouldn't store the videos.  I ended up adding them to my first system and they worked.  They wouldn't work on the new Sync 2 module even though it would find and add the cameras.  When armed and active they would send notifications but not record.  All settings were the same all cameras and both systems.  I just settled for leaving them on one sync module even though they are weak signals.
"First thing- if you have an active area the battery life on these things is poor. Even with quality batteries I am getting less than 2 weeks per battery change and that is with changing the settings to be as low sensitivity as possible. Next thing- these do not record entire events. Unless I am grossly misunderstanding the usage settings , these cameras do not record an entire event. They record the beginning of the action but do not continuously record to show the entire action sequence. So when I had a stray dog enter my yard and begin to attack my dogs the video stopped after the recording time setting ended. So we had no video proof of the bulk of the event.In review- we will probably be replacing these in the near future with a more reliable, affordable option that monitors more consistently. The price is cheap on these for a reason, you will be spending 50 to 60$ bi-monthly on batteries if you have a high action area like the suburbs. Another factor to consider- the temperature up north where we live seems to drain the batteries quickly as well. Overnight the temps drop drastically and mid afternoon the cameras alert they are at high temp. So this may have a drastic effect of usage as well.Having had these since February of ‘24 I think it’s enough time to reconsider my options. If you live in a quiet country setting and have nothing like kids or dogs triggering the cameras, have a temperate climate and think you may never actually need them to record a real event, and they are for “just in case”,  these may be a good thing for you.One plus side- 2 of the cameras came off house in a wild storm and fell on rocks. No damage so these things are hardy. (They also don’t record the storm that made them fall)"
"The biggest thing I dislike is when watching video clips, if I want to pause and look at the scene, I cannot. When I pause, the screen turns dark gray to almost black with the commands across the center. So if there was something I wanted a closer look at, its not possible. This was not too expensive so I may look at other systems in the future."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The camera do very well pictures in day or night. I use them mainly for keeping an eye on my cats as I have had coyotes come through and get my furbabies.  I have only had my cameras just 30 days and the batteries are already dead, so not even close to 2 years or even a year!! So batteries suck!! Then my one camera whenever I try to do a live check, I would say about 95% of the time it won't let me connect for a live check. Besides those 2 problems I love the cameras, best I have had used. If not for those problems, I would have given a 5 star."
"The set up is relatively easy and the app is pretty user friendly. The image quality is excellent and they pick up pretty good sound. With that said, I find that they can be inconsistent and unreliable at times.I ordered a 3 pack. For the first week, all 3 worked very well. After a week, the one closest to the sync model repeatedly went offline and I was unable to reconnect. I reached out to customer service who was able to send me a replacement. It worked perfectly until I experienced the second issue…Secondly, I experienced an issue where the motion detection would only capture 1 second or less videos. This even occurred after adjusting settings, resetting WiFi/modem, deleting cameras and sync models from app and re-adding, etc. I was finally able to solve the issue by doing some of the steps above (again) and factory resetting each camera. It would be nice if you could do this within the app. Unfortunately, you are required to take the camera apart to do so. Not the end of the world but it’s a little frustrating having to grab a ladder and adjust 3 cameras on multiple occasions. They seem to be working fine now (3 hours later).Lastly, one camera required that I change the batteries twice while only having them for 3 weeks.Overall, these are decent. If the reliability and consistency issues were resolved, I would give 5 stars. I would say i have dealt with at least one issue or more per week since having them. This is frustrating when most times a fix requires getting the ladder to manually reset a camera."
I got these then took over a month to finally put up and setup Blink. Its been about 3 weeks since then and so far so good...except one of them already needs batteries. I thought those were good for a lot longer than a few weeks!! I saw this was an issue for others too. Fingers crossed this isn't a sign of things to come.
"I have 4 of these.  They are easy to install and set up.  The batteries went dead in about 2 weeks.  I could adjust the settings to make them last longer by lowering the amount of video taken, reducing their sensitivity,  lowering the IR brightness.  I was not catching the activity I wanted with these settings.I wanted to connect a hardwired power-source, so I was not always climbing ladders to replace batteries. These only take lithium batteries.  They are a bit hard to dispose of properly.The old version 3 cameras have a USB cable with a plug that they say makes them water tight, but it is a micro USB.  This camera uses a USB 6 cable and they do not sell one with a rubber plug.  I don't know why it is an outdoor camera, kinda makes sense.  The only problem is that the version 3 camera is that it does not have the selective motion detection so you only take picture of people.As a work around, I bought standard USB cables and used silicone to seal the back.  So far I have only lost one camera to the weather.  I the batteries stay in the camera as back up.  You can tell it is wired correctly if external power source shows up in the app, under the camera details.  This is a work around that only works marginally well, but it is better than changing batteries all the time or not catching the activity that you installed the cameras to catch.The other think I do not like is that I have bought 2 single camera and they both came with the base station module.  One seems to work fine for me, but the description of the camera, does not say, in big bold letters that it come with the base module and that is why it is so expensive.  Maybe I can sell the extra ones on amazon.  The single camera without the base station module is probably someplace on Amazon, but I could not find it.If you have trouble installing or setting the camera up or wondering how to use the features, it is best to google your problem.  The blink online help is pretty pathetic."
"I installed these cameras outside, as they are ""outside"" cameras. One worked for ONE week, then stopped, and other worked for 9 days, then stopped. Now they just say ""camera is offline"". I did all the recommended steps of removing batteries, replacing batteries, resetting, etc., still doesn't work. I want to return them but am FOUR days outside of the return window, because when I received them on October 26th I was sick for about two weeks with Covid and couldn't install them immediately upon receiving them. I should have known better than to order them because I've had nothing but issues with my other blink mini indoor cameras and no one has ever been able to assist."
"I wish I would have done more research about these cameras. I’m not happy that all movement isn’t recorded. Blink cameras only record about 5 seconds at a time then shuts off for a minimum of 10 seconds before it continues picking up movement for another 5 seconds… This is a terrible idea for a security camera. Other than that, the quality of the recording and product are decent."
"So I don’t usually do reviews but thought after a lot of frustration I would let everyone in on this. cameras themselves are good batteries only last a couple of weeks not what they say and they only record  up to 30s but that’s ok. The bad part for me is I had to order new cameras because I can’t use the 5 I bought previously to my phone being damaged, you see once you link your phone to the cameras that is the one and only device that works with the cameras. So if you can’t turn your phone on due to damage or theft your cameras are trash period. I have went back and forth on emails with blink customer service for months and it’s no help. So be aware and also that means only one person in the household can view cameras which I think sucks. Also range isn’t that great maybe 30 feet from house if your lucky.  But with saying all that I did buy more of them after having them you really feel unsafe without."
It’s comes with a 30day subscription after that it won’t Record when it detects motion it’s just notifies you(you’ll have to open the live view to see what going on ) . Also the unlimited storage is taken away. Person detection is taken away and only motion detection is available with no subscriptionThis unit runs off your home wifi
"I wanted and needed to like this camera. In the process of a return. Major flaw is the night vision. I purchased, as I wanted something for evening. This did not even come close to my expectations. Fuzzy, dark and illegible.  Second issue is down time. Not sure if an internet issue but either, too much lag time for use and photo, even on Live status.  I give a 3 stars,  as I like the size, ease to install but lack in evening vision which was very important to me. .... ( the down time maybe our internet provider, which is another story ! )"
"Horrible instructions on how to set up and use. Even worse instructions in app. Nothing is in one place.Incredibly greedy and pushy efforts to $uB$cribe to their optional featuresBad latency-picture is about one second behind actual movement.All in all, Wyze is a better camera with better instructions.But the long operation on just 2 batteries is a very amazing plus!"
"I purchased 2 of the outdoor 4th generation on Black Friday as a deal with the doorbell camera. First thing I noticed is how poor the video quality is. It is not clear. The second thing is how long it takes to trigger and start recording. The most surprising disappointment is how much the live video lagged behind. Now I have an Amazon Eero router right next to the Blink sync module and the video was at least 3 seconds behind actual real life. I have a fast internet connection too.Anyway I decided to install one to see how it went and this is what I found.The camera cones with a tool that helps unscrew the back to put in the batteries and where the QR code is for setup. I did that and went about installing it. Two issues I found here. The first is the tool to unscrew the back is also part of the camera mount. It clips onto the plastic swivel mount that screws to the wall. The way it clips onto the mount and the camera clips to it in my opinion is not that secure and I can see it breaking if not carefully handled. The second thing is that the camera cannot be made to face straight out, it has to point at an angle downwards because the ball joint on the mount hits the piece between the mount and the camera. The only way to fix this would be to mount the camera with a modified piece behind the mount.So I got it installed and the image quality is distorted, pointed slightly down but worse of all at night the image quality is really poor. I mean like a really cheap camera. Wow. Very disappointed.So off it goes back to Amazon. I didn’t even try the Blink doorbell as it came part of the same deal.This is an Amazon product from what I can see (which I am surprised about as the Amazon Fire tablets, kindle paper whites and some other things with the Amazon’ stamp I  really like).So off I go to look for a better security camera system.Additional informationThe camera I had put up triggered numerous all night due to rain. Yes rain triggered it. I would look at the videos and nothing moving. Just a poor quality black and white image."
"The cameras work great, and are super easy to set up, however, one of them just alerted that it has low batteries.  They have only been in use for 11 days.  The batteries are advertised to last ""years"".  Is it because it is cold outside?  not sure- the other outdoor camera is not alerting."
"So disappointed. I have a Gen 2, and 3, and three 4s. Been using them and happy with them for years. Just Recently purchased the Gen 4s. They are ok-good. Since they are in high traffic areas, I've been going thru a set of Energizer Lith batteries about every 10-15 days. So I thought I'll try lithium rechargeables. Sadly, no luck. Two different brands. The camera will sometimes 'connect' but neither will actually capture motion or refresh a thumbnail. Very disappointed. Stick in the single use Lith...no problem. 🙄 Any idea on why the Gen 4s can't use Lith rechargeables. Single use batteries are so expensive."
"I have used Blink cameras for years. I have been happy with there performance a very well polished product. I recently bought a bird feeder made to accept a blink camera. I had an extra XT2 so I installed it. Everything was good except for the bird feeders mounting straps are a travesty and it allowed the feeder to drop no mater how tight they were. It damaged the brand new never used blink camera, an internal filter broke loose. I ordered this 4th Gen to replace it. I was excited for the new generation and the presumably better quality images. I installed it immediately. Or tried to. Sad to say the 4th Gen doesn't fit the feeder. I modified things to make it work.Now for the performance of the camera. It seems it has the ability to detect people Except it thinks most things are people. This also seems to be a paid feature with a free trail. The camera also has an offset lens and the field of view is slightly different.The deal breaker is that it doesn't focus up close on the birds at the feeder as the older unit did. I see the neighbors house crystal clear and blurry birds. This is a disappointment to say the least, couple that with an inability to replace the original camera mounts of the older cameras on my house (storm damage) and I think I am shopping for a new wireless camera system.I would buy a few of the older generations but they are no where to be found."
"I got this camera with a sync module 2 and spent several days trying to sort it all out.I got the sync module2 because I need that and a USB stick to record clips... BUT when you first set up the camera and/or sync module you get a free trial subscription to Blink cloud.  The ONLY thing the USB stick does when you have a subscription is for 24 hr clip backups - which you can't view using the Blink app - you have to remove the USB to see those backup clips on your computer.If you want clips to be saved on the USB attached to the sync module you have to CANCEL any Blink subscription you have... that is the ONLY way to get the sync module to use the USB stick in a way that most people probably think it would work in the first place.Of course none of this is spelled out clearly (IMHO).Also, the mounting bracket is useless - the instructions on the website are also useless - so I googled how to set up the bracket... not good.The camera has some features that are DISABLED if you cancel your Blink cloud subscription. Obviously these are hardware features that you just lose access to if you don't subscribe. I guess the Blink marketing folks can't really figure out how to promote their cloud service so anyone would want to pay for it - so they just limit the camera's features instead.I've finally got mine set up and working the way *I* want it to work - but they sure don't make it easy.Finally - I also have a Blink video doorbell and I have to say what a stroke of genius it is that all these devices MUST bounce a signal to Blink's servers, then back to my house - then back to Amazon's servers for Alexa...? I think that's what is going on. Doesn't seem very reliable if you're using it as a home security solution.I gave it two stars. It's a nice system but the fact they try to force-feed me a cloud subscription by disabling camera features is just a trash marketing move."
"Have 8 total blink outdoor 4 cameras.Most are unusable due to total fogging obstructing the lens overnight and in the early morning hours. See attached screenshots. Note that at the time of these screenshots, it was not actually foggy outside, it is just the lenses fogged up.  Do not buy these if you want usable video footage at night or in the early morning hours Perhaps they would perform better in other regions, but here in humid central Florida, they just don’t work.The battery level indicator in the app simply offers “OK” or “Low”. A percentage would be nice to have a better idea of the actual level. All still showing OK after 6 weeks, but as an aside,  my “2 year battery life” blink video doorbell required replacement at barely over a month (see my review for that). Same batteries in that as the outdoor 4 cameras so not very hopeful on reaching anywhere near the advertised battery life. I’ll try to remember to update this review when the batteries die.Motion detection range is poor. One camera points at the area I park my giant SUV at about 25 feet and is 50/50 on triggering when I come and go.  I have 2.5 acres and have a total of 13 blink products pointing in every direction but only feel secured in about a 20 foot circle around my home, and only during the daylight when the lenses aren’t fogged up.Cameras aside, the blink app itself leaves a lot to be desired. One thing specifically is I would like the ability to receive notifications for specific cameras and groups but not others, while still having the camera record to be able to see it at a later date if an incident occurs.  For example, I always want to receive real-time alerts for my video doorbell, cameras inside my garage and a particular low-traffic room in my home where valuables are stored, but I don’t need the dozens of notifications I receive daily of the wife sitting on the porch drinking her coffee, the kids playing in the yard, etc. I still want the system armed and recording for later review in case something happens, just don’t want the unnecessary ding dongs. But with blink, notifications are all or nothing. There’s no ability to enable notifications on a per camera or even per group basis.I have a ring system at another property that is awesome. Very much regret the nearly $500 dollars i put into this blink system. My ring system at my other home is so much better. You get what you pay for, and my attempt to save a few bucks is going to end up costing me much more when I replace the blink system in the near future. As my dad always said, “Son, you got an education, and educations aren’t free.”"
I thought with the factory setting it would last the 2 years they advertised but it doesn’t. Battery lasted less than a month. The video quality is okay. When I used my own motion settings battery lasted no more than 4 days. I wouldn’t purchase these again. Motion sensor was fine. Night vision was okay. Just not worth having to buy batteries
"The image and area viewed is much better than the blink 3. However, after more than 20 discussions with blink support, the main problem is that if a vehicle comes from the right going left, it only picks it up just before it goes out of frame on the left most of the time. No fix could be found. Next issue is if you are just using the standard batteries and placing this covering a busy street, the batteries will be drained within a couple days. I had to move this camera to a low traffic area, then decided to purchase a cable to connect up to one of my outdoor lights for power. You do have to remove the batteries if you are going to do this."
"It is great when it works. Camera seems to stop recording and do live viewing at random times then correct itself hours later. Had an older blink outdoor camera in same place and upgraded to the 4, the older one never had this issue so WiFi not an issue."
While these cameras are cheap priced the quality of the videos are nice. The problem is they tend to randomly go offline and hours before they well reconnect. We bought these to fill in gaps as our mailbox was vandalized and I was looking to get more.Within less than a week I have had 2 cameras go offline. Setting sensitivity is all or nothing. You can get it to where you need but will take days and even then it's all movement such as leaves or blades of grass or you miss everything including vehicles.The time for recording and such is limited. You can set how long to record up to a minute or 2. But that's it. Then it's a minimum of a 10 sec reset before it comes back on.You will need the pay plan for this to work right.The batteries so far do not last anywhere close to a year. It has not been a week and 1 camera that has less movement notifications is on its 3rd set and needing to be replaced again. Another camera I had to replace batteries as well. These will only last 2 years if they are never triggered maybe.I have reached out to customer service. So far I have not gotten a satisfactory answer for this issue other than your using wrong brand and type of battery. Meanwhile the battery they supplied in 2 cameras were already depleted so it is not a battery issue.There seems to be no consistency with how they operate.
"I just got the camera and already I am having issues. It keeps changing the thumbnails and eveb though I block out an area so it will not trip the motion sensor, it does anyway. Constant tripping will cause the batteries to burn out faster. This issue is not happening to my Gen 3 cameras."
"The cameras work fine and you can use a compatible USB flash drive (Not over 256Gb) to avoid the costly subscription plan but you will lose some features in the process which makes this system less appealing.  It will do what I need it to do,.... for now."
"I’ve had blink outdoor cameras since the XT2, and I’ve been mostly happy, but some of the recent decisions have made me feel like there have been downgrades and decreased value overall. Aside from requiring paid subscriptions to access all features, they have made Early Notification non-optional, and it’s causing us to miss clips. When you tap a notification, it cancels recording the clip and connects to a live feed, which is so slow that you end up never seeing what/who was there while losing the clip. The local storage option is a joke, because you either sacrifice cloud access entirely or can only make backups of your feeds every 24hrs. No option to record locally only if your internet goes down, or caching to improve performance while you’re on your network. I’ve had a cat detected as a “Person”, but the feature is still in beta (even though you need to pay $ for it). What we really care most about with a security camera system is reliability, and the performance leaves a lot to be desired. If early notification and connecting live is an always on default, it needs to be a lot quicker. Investing in performance, reliability and redundancy is far more important than slapping on some “AI” and trying to monetize it. Aside from this, the motion detection range is still very short - you need to come within 6-7 paces of it before it finally, slowly kicks on, even with a high setting. If I were a criminal, I’d feel like these are easy enough to avoid."
"A couple of things to be aware of; 1) Buy yourself a large USB thumb drive for the sync module. Otherwise, you will incur more costs with the Amazon enabled service. 2) Setup is neither intuitive or easy. Getting the Sync Module on my network required an act of Congress (and we know how fast they work). 3) Turn the motion detection system off as well as disarming it. When you want shut it down. Otherwise it will drain your batteries quickly via the motion detection feature (I have the add-on unit for longer battery life too). 4) When it's cold (mid 30's F for me) the alerts do not always come right away even when the system has detected motion and tripped a video clip capture.The positives; The night vision is really good even without lights. The camera has a selectable field of view (you can set it to avoid blowing bushes or errant motion and just a pathway or gate). You can hear and speak through the camera/microphone. Just wish this had been more straightforward to setup and use. Still better than nothing!Update: Now the thumbnail refresh no longer works. Viewing in real-time and audio no longer function. I have restarted the phone, restarted the network but nada. Very disappointed. Reducing my rating to two-stars. I noticed today too that the motion detection tripped not for the delivery person (Amazon) but for me picking the package up in front. Then, not immediate and not consistently working. Have motion detection on the highest settings and the zone setup for the walkway and gate. Again, very disappointed. Cannot recommend these going forward. Too buggy and inconsistent."
"Camera seems fine. However, I subscribed to Blink Plus where they keep your clips for 60 days.Mine are only being saved for 57-58 days.So, that is a big concern of mine that subscription used in conjunction with this, isn't as promised."
"I was excited about getting this but I soon learned of a few issues that may or may not affect your purchase.The good.1. Easy setup.2. Nice wide quality picture while streaming.3. Mounting bracket that comes with the product works even though it's tricky to figure out.  I recommend googling.4.  Made by Amazon.  I got a hold of support within a few minutes.The bad.1. Live view on the cameras lasts only a few seconds and you must repeatedly hit a ""continue?"" prompt every few secnds!  I called and confirmed this with support.  After every few seconds, you are prompted to continue (again and again).  The reason why is to save battery life but at a cost of not being able to livestream uninterrupted.  Hence the 2 year battery life.  Other cameras that have a shorter 3 to 6 month battery life can stream live longer which makes sense.  It also makes sense if you are using these blink cameras as security cameras that detect motion, it works well with the motion detection.  They are not cameras you would use to detect wildlife in your backyard and film it.  I was a little disappointed as I thought the subscription plan would allow longer live streaming.  It does not.  It allows you to save your video detection clips online to review them which seems fair for $100 year with unlimited cameras.  The mini blink with the rotating base along with the blink doorbell are also a good add on.Overall, I think I was expecting too much and I am looking at buying another solium rotating turret with a solar panel.  This offers unlimited live viewing and has worked well in the front of the house.  I think I was expecting too much for the price and I should have suspected the shorter live stream when the blink didn't offer a solar option.  I thought I also read Ring was owned by Amazon so maybe I'll also look at that to watch animals.  Another option is an actual game camera but there are connection issues to an existing wifi as these can only act as a wifi device and you Bluetooth to it.  I'm not sure if this would work if I wanted to live stream it but I'm still learning.1"
"As soon as I canceled the ""free"" subscription, they wouldn't work with local storage. These are good if you're into subscribing, but I will never subscribe just to use my own cameras. I have blink 3s that still work with local storage."
"The camera has limited range for quality pictures. It triggers late, mostly missing intruders away from the door. The sync module keeps dropping the network and is a pain to reconnect. It is easy to install and has been rain proof."
The cameras are great and great quality. The picture quality is great and the app is really good. The only problem I have is the batteries were low when I received them and one cameras batteries went completely dead on the first day.
"Very good system with great value.  Batteries last a surprisingly long time, and cameras work great.  Easy to setup, intuitive app, and it does ALMOST exactly what I need.  Only issue driving the rating is three sorely missing software based features:1) I can't silence notifications for individual cameras.  This is not a problem if you want to get EVERY notification from every camera anytime the system is armed and triggered, or else NONE of them.  But I need to have some camera cover an area which is going to have lots of motion triggers.  I DON'T want notifications for these areas, but I do want to be able to go back and review footage from these cameras if a problem comes up. To overcome this, I bought a separate system complete with second blink module.  Which mostly worked, except:2) You can't have separate blink modules and camera systems on the same account AND silence one module and it's corresponding cameras.  So I still get either ALL or NONE of the notifications.  To overcome this finally, I set up a separate blink account.  So now I can have one account and system that notifies me, and one that just records events in the background so I can go back and review footage if certain problems arise.  Except that3) You can't have separate accounts in the iOS app.  So I have to log out of the account that I want notifications from, and log in to the other one anytime I want to review footage from my ""no-notify"" system.If Blink fixes any of the above, I'd give this 5 stars for value and performance."
"I bought this system because I liked that these outdorr cameras were completely wireless although they do need a sync module to work. I also liked the fact that they say the Sync Module 2 comes with the added capability of Local storage.But that's where they are wrong. Local storage DOES NOT work as advertised. Looked through various troubleshooting steps and tried them out such as1) try a different USB memory stick2) delete and re-add sync moduel to my app3) reset the sync modeul4) move to a different wireless connectionBut none of the above helped. Local storage still did not work.In the end called up their support. The support engineer had be grant full access to the system, had me try out a few things but with no success. In the end he tells me that my internet connection is bad. FTI I have fiber internet connection (IGbps symmetrical). Ran some tests on the internet conenction and I see no fautl with it (942 Mbps up/down speeds, latency to various sites is consistent and no packet drops) yet the support person refused to help me any furtherIn my opinion if you are buying this becaus eof the local storage option - THEN DO NOT buy it. Else be prepared to spend another $100 a year for subscription to view the clipsAnd my second issue is that I have set zones on each camera where I do not want to be alerted when motion is deteted. All cameras seem to ignore and I get alerted when motion is deteted in those marked areas. Very annoyingI am out of the return time frame. Otherwise I would love to return this system and get a refund.My advice - DO NOT BUY if you do not want to pay for subsciption and can live without clips  which makes the cameras pretty useless."
"The video quality during the day is excellent, decent at night in general a bit hard to pick out details at times. One camera works perfect and the other will set off motion detection for rabbits in the yard but not a car driving thru the same area. The design is small and discreet. The sync module drops service in storms. My two complaints is the lag for recording it may take five minutes to get a notification and a clip and these are useless without a subscription."
"I bought this camera in May of 2024 and 1 of the batteries is already dead. It has a port to charge, but it's not recharging.I might return it just to get the 2 year battery as advertised."
"I bought the 3 camera system. All 3 cameras are inside, 2 in front of opposite windows facing outside, 1 in a room facing inside. The 2 facing outside will not detect motion. The motion sensors are turned on, but you can walk in front of it or wave your hand directly in front of the window it’s looking out, and the camera will not detect motion and will not record. You can see live through the camera if you click on the camera in the app and go live, but since they are not triggered by motion, it’s useless for security. The 1 facing the room works great and any motion triggers it.So I called customer service, and the person rebooted the cameras, had me reboot the sync module, then had me reboot my WiFi. Still the motion sensors on the cameras would not work, for the ones facing outside. So then he tells me it says that I don’t have enough WiFi connectivity. He said I need 2mbps per camera, so a total of 6 mbps. I ran my upload test right then and it showed that  I have 12 mbps upload speed. So then he tells me it’s because I have other devices on the WiFi. I told him I only have a Laptop and a phone on WiFi. He said that’s why I don’t have enough upload speed. So I called a friend who also has 3 Blink cameras and Ring, and he tested his speed and he only has 5 mb upload speed, and all his motion detectors work, and one of them even faces outside. Plus he has several other devices on his WiFi.So their customer service was lying. I took my laptop and phone off my WIFI, and walked in front of the cameras and those 2 still didn’t detect motion. So then I put my other devices back on WiFi, and I decided to turn the cameras facing inside. I didn’t move them, just turned them facing the room instead of outside. And they all worked and detected motion. But only when facing inside.So why are these called Outdoor cameras if they can not detect motion when facing out the window?! And one camera is facing north, the other south. So they aren’t even getting the same sun direction, but neither can pick up motion. Obviously their motion detector system is really bad if it can’t work outside! The system is even called “Outdoor 4”!! But it can’t handle detecting motion facing out a clear window with no direct sunlight. I’ll have to do some research and find a better quality security system and return these."
"I was hoping for more on this camera given the reviews.  When watching the videos I felt the video and picture quality seemed pretty sharp and feasible for the price.  I knew in advance the audio was not good, but I have external mics, so gave it a shot.When I tried out the video and picture quality, I was sadly disappointed.  I didn't even bother to try the external mic.  I ultimately ended up returning this product.  My cell phone will do a better job and not as much to carry around."
I would have given this a negative review if I could. I took this camera as a backup to another camera on a trip to Japan and South Korea in October 2024 and I am thankful I only had to use it briefly. The photos were grainy and blurry. I would return it except for the 30 day return period has run out. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CAMERA!!! I would have been devastated if this was the only camera I had on the trip.
"This camera is on the largeside for digital cameras, and it's mediocre at best. But I won't write it off because it does have it's uses. I'm gonna start by saying what it could be good for before I get into why I personally consider it mediocre at best.It could be great for kids and teens (or anyone really) starting to get into photography and/or videography. It is a nifty little camera with a decent spread of functions and adaptability. Making it good for people with no experience to get into the hobbies (and potentially career).It would be a decent chose for families for documenting memories. Any modern phone has a better camera on it, but there is something sentimental about picking up a camera and document moments you want to keep forever.Now why I consider it mediocre.... it's image quality (which is displayed in the photos attached to this review) is mediocre. Yes it zooms decently well, but it is pixilated when zoomed. The normal field of view (FOV) is decently sized but the images aren't high definition (HD) by any means. It does maintain the same level of clarity when zooming in on a photo though. I have experience with digital cameras to professional quality DSLRs, and this is easily the worst camera I've used in that range. But it's not unusable. But it's not complete garbage. Just don't expect great or professional quality and this camera is okay.All that said, I will say that I will be keeping it to teach my young nephews the art of photography and videography, but I don't have a use for it outside of that."
"Junk products, can not be used."
"Took it to a park and shot with this camera and my iPhone 12. iPhone 12 looked crisper and captured the lighting better. Picture quality is okay but video is terrible, when you have it in 4K mode it looks like it’s running at less than 24fps. Super choppy and there is screen tearing when you move it. I cannot recommend this camera except for maybe a child who has an interest in photography but whose parents don’t want them to own a smartphone quite yet."
At night this camera is horrible. No kind of focus at all at night.  Day time is just okay to me
"First off, the device out of the box is great: the camera is crisp, the motion sensing (and so based customization) is outstanding, and the lights are decently bright.Only issue i had with my unit from the beginning is that the scheduled lights on feature never worked correctly - when initially configured, the lights would come on, stay on, and go off at the programmed times, but after just a few days it would seem like the unit ""forgot"" about the program: either not turning on at all, or turning off too early. Annoying, but certainly not a deal breaker - and the motion triggered light feature always worked correctly.Where the wheels fall off: the light enclosures eventually fill with water, which causes the lights to dim and finally fail. Earlier generations were still hackable for those sufficiently DIY-minded, with the stock light fixtures able to be replaced with standard PAR38 bases. I'm sad to report that later generations (I purchased mine in May 2022) have apparently been ""upgraded"" to make these aftermarket resurrections far more difficult if not outright impossible.The corporate-speak practically writes itself: Ring no doubt would say these design upgrades are because the units are intended to be sealed weatherproof enclosures. Ok, all well and good, except in practice they're clearly not, as the nearly 1/2 cup of water that I just poured out of my unit can attest to. The 90 day warranty is laughable but I guess typical in this era of slow-bleed, corner-cut manufacturing of disposable everything.In summary: a good product marred by the all to common suspiciously-shortened lifespan that smells like the centerpiece of a business model relying on the stickiness of an ecosystem + subscriptions to bring us back to the shoddy device trough every year or 2 so we can be parted with another $100-200 😠"
"We are on our 2nd Ring Spotlight Security Camera. The unit is not water proof. Water developed in the lights and then in the camera area. The second unit was only 2 months old and water developed in the same areas. I spoke to Ring on Oct 17, 2024. The customer service rep agreed that the unit was under warranty and would send a replacement. We still have not received the replacement. I have been told that this type camera is on backorder. So I went to Amazon and guess what, the exact same camera (2021 version) is available for delivery TOMORROW. I have been very satisfied with Ring products over the years but it seems that their customer service is very lacking. I am not one to leave a negative review but this is very poor customer service. Apparently the camera is available. I believe the issue is that they don't want to have to replace mine.Amendment: I changed my review from a 1 to 3 stars becausewe finally received the replacement around 1 month after I started the process of a replacement."
Lights will not stay adjusted. No screw to tighten. Ring support says this happens sometimes but they will not send me a replacement because I purchased from (the Ring store) on Amazon.Edit: from 1 to 3 stars because Ring actually replaced the item after I left a 1 star review. Sigh.Ring Customer Support was nothing short of amazing 6 years ago. Not so much anymore from my experience.
"There is no way to mount this to an out of wall standard 4-inch round junction box.  The mounting plate is 5-inch diameter and seems to be exclusively designed for mounting to a in wall junction box that is flush with the wall.  So if you have an exposed out of wall weatherproof 4-inch junction box your options would be:1. Replace your junction box to a 5-inch but make sure it has the 4-inch diameter hole spacing inside the junction box for the metal bracket.2. Ring sells a kit that will allow you to plug in a Floodlight Cam to a wall outlet so hopefully you have one nearby or could replace the existing junction box for an outlet.3. Pick a different camera solution.  The available hardware kit for the Ring Spotlight Cam does appear to have provisions to mount directly to a 4-inch out of wall junction box.I had to return this one because I didn't want to replace the junction box and do other work for the specific install location I wanted.  Other than that, I have a few of these and they work fine.  If you are already familiar with how Ring products work, how they store video, and their pricing plans there is nothing different here. The alarm plan that also covers all your cameras is very cheap compared to other options and most of the time they are easy to install and use for a person with average DIY electrical skills. Even without the install issue, for out of wall junction boxes, this is still a 3-star product. There is nothing inherently wrong with it, but there just hasn't been any significant updates to general capability of Ring products for a while. For example, Ring still only offers up to 1080p video, other manufacturer's products include 2k and 4k options."
Discouraging as I have 6 cameras installed like this one and I expect them to pick up illegal activities and people on my property.  I can't rely on them to do this.
One of my ring cameras is not operating correctly. I hope this replacement will help.
I’ve had the camera up for two years. Worked great and no problems. 2 years later and both the lights stopped working due to filling with water. My camera is installed under the corner eve so there is some protection whereas other pictures on the website show the camera installed on a wall exposed to the elements. Guess it’s my problem now since there’s only a One year warranty and I didn’t buy the extended warranty. 3 star due to expecting it to last much longer.
Sees people and is very adaptable to different needs like the response to motion and quality
Light doesn’t work harmoniously with motion detection.
"This device routinely has low wifi connection and often just stops connecting even though there's a wireless access point about 12 feet away and other, further away, outdoor ring devices connect just fine.I got so sick of it, I added yet another WAP in my garage where this device is, and it still loses connection. Then I need to manually power it off."
The video clarity is not good.  My floodlight generation 1 camera is way better.  Thinking about returning this one and try to find the old one. Actually I think  the new design covering up the lens is the problem.
"Ring is so close to being amazing. But they have some bugs to work out really impact quality of life.1) There ""Person Detection"" functions are a joke. Even by setting the detection to the minimalist setting. Bugs, cats, squirrels, moving furniture covers, hanging lights, all set it off from time to time. You can google other people complaining and you'll see ring deflect with, ""well at that distance it could look like a person"". It's a half baked feature and nearly worthless. I just set up zones to very small areas where stuff was less likely to trigger it.2) There is no proper snooze function in the app. It only snoozes alerts on your phone. So if you so yard work, be prepared to drive your family crazy. Although you can setup schedules to not alert during certain times, it doesn't work for connected non ring devices, but the snooze function needs to snooze EVERYTHING.3) Alert schedules to turn off alerts are arill sent to non ring devices. So if you connect it to Alexa, expect here to notify you non stop when they go off. Just imagine your wife throwing the Alexa out the window because it won't shut up. Again if you Google it ring just says oh work with Amazon to schedule alerting on your device. No that's just more deflection and laziness on ring, you are the one sending the notification to Alexa when you shouldn't be."
Camera doesn’t always record. Is it refurbished? I didn’t see that in paragraph when I bought it
"I purchased 4 of these camera/flood lights.Flood Light:  good distance and motion detection.  They do flood the area nicely.  I do think the lights should me more moveable.  While not extremely limited in ability to position the lights, I would like more adjustably than they have.  I am using them at corners on my house.Camera:  So I like the app, the adjustability, etc.  However, the clarity of the video leaves a lot to be desired.  Yes, I can see a person on the video.  Yes, I can tell it's me when I forget to turn off the ""Away"" mode.  Here's the deal.  I had a truck come through my property, it drove within 20 feet of one of my cameras.  A) these things need to start recording earlier.  As soon as there movement - turn on damnit.  Don't wait a few more seconds.  But most importantly - when this truck drove through, it turned and went directly away from the camera - so at 30 feet I should have been able to read the license plate.  No go.  They did not speed away, they drove slowly down my driveway and off down the road.  I can zoom in well, but I just cannot read the license plate.I recently purchased a 4k wildlife camera for $70 on Amazon.  It works way better than the ring cameras!  Like way better!  Ring needs to do better."
"I have used this product for more than a year and it is pretty good. I didn't expect the camera to fall off. Fortunately, there is a hook inside. Their company has thought of this a long time ago. It would be even better if they could improve the material around the screw.What should I do now, do you have anything to put the product back together? Thanks"
"I live near a wooded area and got tired of leaving my backyard lights on all night. There's always something rustling outside my window from time to time. Is it an animal or a creeper? To avoid paranoia, I got this floodlight so that the lights would come on when it detected something. After watching several YouTube videos, I found it easy to install myself. My house wires weren't the same colors as the floodlight, but it wasn't difficult to figure out.The video quality of the camera is superb. I was impressed with how well it captured the details of my backyard. Unfortunately, the video recording was terrible. It would only record certain frames of me walking around. I would show up on the left side, and the clip would skip and show me appear on the right side. Not only that, the audio recording was very fuzzy and had a lot of static.When testing the two-way talking, there was a lot of static when the other person was talking to me through the microphone. The other person also couldn't understand what I was saying either, even though I was standing right in front of it.After calling customer support, which is pretty good in my opinion, they tried several things to fix the issue. I already updated the firmware before had, and it turns out I had a bad unit. Ring sent me a replacement not long after. Although the video recording worked better on the second unit, the sound recording was still terrible.When someone is talking, it records their voice, along with some static, making it difficult to understand what they are saying. I even tested it myself by standing in front of the camera talking while slowly walking further away to see how well it would record. The results were the same. I can talk as loud as I want, but whenever I talk, there's some kind of static that is recorded with it.I also tested the two-way talking again, and that didn't improve either with the second unit. There's just so much static on both ends. This ended up being the deal breaker for me. If it can't record audio that well, then the product isn't doing what it's advertised to do.This last part is probably my fault, but I could never hear anything when I was watching live view either. It was just video. Also, it does not record 24/7. Whenever there's an event or when it detects something is moving, it activates the recording and saves it as a clip for you to view. My Nest camera records all day, which I like compared to the Ring floodlights. Plus, my Nest camera can record better audio than Ring's floodlight.Who knows, maybe both units were bad, but I wasn't satisfied and returned it. Maybe I'll look into some other brands and hope something else works better."
"We saw that these lights were on sale. I purchased them to put on my mother’s house. We installed them. They worked perfect for the week that I was there and now one of the lights does not work. They will not send me another light. I need to buy another light at full price And pay an electrician to go and take down the other one. So basically I need to pay $80 more for a light and pay an electrician to replace it. And now I just found out if you go to Best Buy they come with a five-year warranty and they don’t charge you for it . Do not buy ring Items through Amazon I bought two lights and one doesn’t work and now it’s a nightmare to return it. And it’s gonna cost me more money. Like I said, I wish I had gone to Best Buy. I could’ve just walked in and returned it and gotten another one. And on top of it, they want me to wait 30 days for my money to return. So I need to shell out another $200 to get a new light and hire an electrician to replace it and then wait a month and get back my $129. What a nightmare stay away from Amazon when ordering ring !!!!  The rest of the system we purchase seems to work fine. The camera is amazing. The floodlight just comes on and stays on all night like I said, go to Best Buy or go directly to Ring. So the saga continues the UPS driver showed up at my mom house yesturday to pick up the bad light assy, I clearly told the lady at there so called help Desk i had purchased this system for my mom and installed it while i was visiting her. I am now 1200 miles away and would take me a few days to find someone to remove the light. she clearly was not listing she said i had till nov 2 to turn it in and to contact her when ready..and now i look and the light has almost doubled in price and the cost of someone to got take the old one down and the put up the new one so we will be out about $300 to get the light replaced. Like I said go to the box store or costco has them or Ring directly what a night mare for something so simple for a defective light reeplacement  UGH"
"I unfortunately installed these shortly around the time the 30 day return window closed And I did not know I was going to have these issues  Hopefully, I help somebody else consider these limitations before making the mistake I did.While the video quality is good, I have two issues That affect all the ringing camera products. 1.  You cannot use a VPN or similar security feature while using Ring. This should be a basic function as competitors offer this capability. 2. And this may be related to number one in some cases… each time you add a new Ring product, I found they reset your ad settings to allow them to share your information with advertisers. If you have opted out and then added a new Ring product, you will have to opt out again. And no, they don’t tell you about that in any literature that I found.  While they claim they don’t SELL your information, they do express clearly that they SHARE it. So who knows what the third parties do with your information your Personal information!!"
"The floodlight camera itself works the same as the others I own and I have no complaints on it.  The issue I have is that Ring has removed the ability to use the PC Ring App to connect with this new camera.  What this means is that the only way to connect to the camera is via the phone app or Ring.com.  The phone app works fine, but if you are like me and would prefer to have the cameras show on your computer screen during the day when you are on the phone you can no longer do this.  The ring.com interface does not show a live view of the camera, only historical information.  This issue applies to several of the new products so beware if you normally use the PC app, it is no longer of use."
"took 15 minutes to install and 1 hour to set up the app. There are 2 apps and the first one I downloaded I could not figure out how to set up the camera. so I tried the other app and it did have the setup procedure. however, it was the most cumbersome set up I have ever seem. I entered my username and password at least 5 times. it took me from the ring app to Amazon and had to enter passwords for that and finally got it going. .  the camera has a good clear picture and wide angle . will see how it works out."
Works fine
"The cameras are actually not too bad. But the ring app is awful. OFTEN I will miss critical segments because of the limitations in recording length. In addition - the snapshots that are taken (every 30seconds) skips over critical moments.Further - the network connection is unreliable. I have 1gb internet and a mesh network. It’s honestly massively overkill for the size of my property - I can still get WiFi signal nearly 20ft from my house! But somehow, the cameras will frequently lose signal ???What’s more - there is no alerting or anything to tell me when the cameras have gone down - one time I checked to find it had not been recording for a couple days!!!Earlier I had issues with the light randomly turning on and staying on (no motion detected) and it would refuse to turn off even after toggling from app.Force restarting is nearly impossible (physical button on the light, but my camera is sitting high up and requires a ladder… not convenient at all.Lastly - Ring recently decided they wanted to INCREASE the cost of membership… with all this terrible quality software?? The audacity.This does NOT give me peace of mind and has me very frustrated when trying to reach recordings. I had 5 ring devices from doorbells, cameras and a range extender chime. I’m getting my wallet ready to replace all of them. Garbage - don’t waste your money. I’m so upset I’ve sunk nearly 1k for a full setup and it’s rendered unless junk by the junk software."
"So update make sure you use Sigma Outdoor Junction boxes or another brands outdoor junction boxes. The cameras base plate seals best against these so you dont have to silicone around it to seal. I replaced my standard boxes with these junction boxes and have allowed me to get 2 screws into the mounting plate with one at the top so the weight of the camera doesnt pull the base away from junction box. You can get these boxes in grey, white, and a bronze which can help blend into the cameras. These are a must if you plan on mounting any floodlight cameras to a surface mount junction box.These cameras are convenient and easy to setup. My issue with them for being a hardwired camera there is no way to run conduit to it without mounting it to a junction box. Now this in itself wouldnt be an issue if the plastic backing piece actually had a good way to seal and mount to a junction box. Or have a knockout on the camera. Some of the older ones I saw on youtube appeared to have a 1/2 conduit screw between the spotlights you could remove. The ones I received did not. My next issue is the supplied hardware to mount the camera to a junction box doesnt work very well. It gives you a metal crossbar that goes between the two junction box screws with a hole in the middle to mount the camera to. This one mounting point is all that holds it to the juntion box. The camera weighing 5-8lbs when tightened to its plastic backing plate bends and leaves a 1/4""ish gap around the top and sides from weight of it pulling down and the camera being tighten to it.I understand not everyone is going to be mounting it to a junction box and running conduit to it but for the vast majority of people trying to use this with a junction box unless that box is recessed and flush with your siding there really isnt a good way to mount it."
"The product has worked great for a couple months then I noticed one of the lights remaining on all the time.  Upon further inspection I found that the bulb was halfway filled with water.  I tried to disassemble it to drain the water out, but there is no easy access point into the bulb section.  It appears that the LED bulbs are not meant to be removed, which makes me wonder what they intended the user to do when the LED's eventually burn out....buy a whole new unit?"
Takes its time focusing. It works OK. Turns on the light at night when movement is detected. Takes a few seconds to focus after detection. Sometimes the “target” is blurry.
"Ring really screwed things up with this updated firmware.  It makes everything look like its outlined and cartoony!  The dark black is just overwhelming. I had the first series floodlight and it had a gorgeous picture but a bird hit it and killed it. So I thought the new camera will be an upgrade and even clearer.  I even tried a refurb unit and sent it back thinking it was messed up, nope I ordered a brand new one and still get everything outlined in black.  The overcast Ohio weather deems this thing worthless.  Ring had a great product, then tweaked it far from where it was.  Shame on you ring!"
I don’t think motion/distance works to good have it on highest and still have to get up close for it to go off
"This camera is a complete disappointment coming from the pre-2021 version I replaced due to it getting damaged. There is a long list of items that are a downgrade from the previous version that I noticed:The detents for the light housing adjustment are so weak that I think a bird landing on the light housing would cause them to move out of adjustment. Previous version had locking knobs to tighten them down.The mounting system is plastic with 1 anchor point. Previous version was metal and could mount to a electrical box.The color palette is terrible compared to the previous. Colors are blown out and not close to actual color or object. No way to adjust the colors either.Exposure is high and wherever there are bright spots in view they are white. When the sun hits the wood fence in my yard, it shows as white and then cant discern anything that passes by that spot.Motion detection is hit and miss with many video events being recorded outside of the motion area. Motion detection at night is terrible. Many events are missed such as cars driving by or people walking around, even with sensitivity all the way up. I turn smart alerts off due to my property setup I need longer recording and prefer not have the camera decide how long to record.Night vision is clear in infrared, but colors are washed out when the lights come on.Another major issue is that the camera detects motion and starts recording, but takes up to 30 seconds before the flood lights come on! By far the biggest disappointment with this camera. The pre 2021 version lights came on as soon as motion was detected, no matter the distance. Anything beyond my driveway tends to not trigger the lights even if motion is detected and recording has started.Overall, I cannot recommend this version, and plan to try the pro to see if the features and quality is better with that camera. I hoped Ring would improve quality across the board over time, but this camera took two steps backward. I have lost trust in the Ring cameras because missed events could be the ones that I need recorded the most."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Setup and install was very easy. Replaced existing lights with these lights, one in the front and one in the back of the house.  Motion detection is very hit or miss. When we go outside at night it takes a lot of arm waving to get the light to come on. We have adjusted the detection zone to the whole screen and even tried adjusting the zone and nothing helps. The are VERY bright when they do come on, which is great. We setup schedules for the lights to come on and stay on from dawn to dusk, but both lights still only work based on motion. Even if we turn on the lights manually in the app, they off within a few minutes. Both front and back have this issue. The back light says it's lost wifi connection a few times a day, but the light does still sometimes detect motion. It seems there are a lot of bugs in the firmware. I have worked with computers and electronics my whole life, I wouldn't say I'm the smartest person in the world, but I know my way around these things. It seems these may still need some bugs worked out big time. Because of how bright they are and I know updated are likely to come, I'll possibly keep these lights. The video is fantastic and clear and the app is easy to navigate and use. Once the bugs are worked out, these will slbe fantastic and for the price, can't be beat. As of now, it's a meh rating. Fix the bugs."
I want to give this product more stars but I dislike how once you purchase multiple cameras from this brand you need to pay 10$ a month to use them and retain the recordings from them.Down the line I want to replace this product with one that doesn't require a subscription.Otherwise the video quality is good and so is the light. My husband says it was easy to install and it runs without needing to be recharged which is more then I can say about my doorbell.
"We have had Ring floodlight cameras since they came out. While space recordings can miss a lot, the picture and sound are very good.  This model has horrible sound quality.  It sounds like cars have snow tires on.  It captures sound and distorts it.  The picture is not as sharp and ends recording too soon.  I can adjust that but seems if there is continuous movement, why would it not record again?  It does with spiderwebs.  Yes, it detects motion and the floodlights come on.  The voice warning system is helpful to startle unwanted guests (coyote) but a volume setting would be nice.  Nonetheless, it’s what we have.  Just wanted to give my two cents."
"After only 9 months, one of the LEDs glows half lit & flickers 24/7, still under warranty and Ring has the worst customer service.I got on a chat with customer support, waited in the queue, and answered every one of their questions within seconds. It takes them 10 minutes to figure out what the next question is going to be. Again I answer it instantly but wait another 10 minutes for their next question... lather, rinse, repeat for an eternity only to have them say ""Yup, you're still under warranty. Call us to go through troubleshooting steps and get it replaced.Call them, wait in another queue, go through another dog and pony show to confirm your account to get ""head of the line"" privileges but you still wait forever. Finally get a hold of someone from India that is very difficult to understand.First step is to reboot the device through the app, easy but no dice; still broken.Next step is to remove power to it but if your circuit breakers aren't labeled, you need go down the stairs, pick one, turn it off, go back up the stairs and outside to see if you've got the right breaker. Damn, not the right one. Back down the stairs we go. Again, lather, rinse, repeat until you get the right breaker. Eventually finding the right circuit breaker and it came as no surprise to me but that didn't fix the issue.Next step is to dig out the ladder so you can reach the reset button on the floodlight and unfortunately for me, in the rain. Rain is painless but frustrating enough.Next step (and last for me before I hung up in frustration) is to go back outside, stand in the rain so I could set the device back up. After trying the first time, I remembered how difficult it was setting this up 9 months ago due to a weak Wi-Fi signal. This floodlight cam is on the outside of my tool shed and has difficulties connecting to my wireless network but the Wyze cam located quite literally on the other side of the 3/4"" plywood wall has all the bars lit up. As I mentioned earlier, I hung up in frustration.If something goes wrong with their devices, they want you to go through a hundred hoops to get it replaced. They want to make it so cumbersome & frustrating, you give up. I can't return it to their parent Amazon where I purchased it originally because I'm outside of the return period.Instead of doing the right thing and replacing the thing under warranty, they piss me off and get to keep their millions in profits instead of replacing a device that costs them maybe $60. Crooks."
I purchased the Ring Flood Light Camera for the sole purpose of  capturing video on the motion detection of a different vendor sensor.  I have a Yo-link motion sensor in a area not in the view of the Ring device.  I planned to use Alexa to instruct the Ring camera to start recording when the yo-link motion senor detects movement.  I installed the Ring camera and then tried to setup Alexa routine to perform the record function.  I found out that you really can't setup the ring device to start recording from an Alex routine.  Even though it is on the website stating it is possible.
"This is going to start off a little sad but after my oldest son was murdered in our home, I upgraded to the Ring security system (our old cameras were down  - they were on antiquated operating system and extremely cheap) to give my other son piece of mind. I purchased a total of 9 Ring cameras (doorbells, wired floodlight cameras, battery cameras and plug in stick-up cameras). I also purchased an Echo 5, 8 and 10 to view the cameras.I was apprehensive about switching as the one thing I loved about the old system was the ability to see all cameras at the same time on a monitor, which isn't an option with the Ring cameras. The doorbells are great - as soon as someone rings the doorbell, it automatically shows up on the Echo screen and I can easily talk to whoever is at the door. As far as video and motion detection - all the cameras are great. What I don't like is the notification delay (by the time I get the motion notification and pull it up, the thing that caused the notification is gone) and the inability to understand what is being said through the cameras is a major drawback. My boyfriend and I have tried to communicate with each other while either of us were in opposite locations (work and home) and unless you speak EXTREMELY SLOW you can't understand a word that is being said. It is the same for all of them whether wired, plug in or battery -  doesn't make a difference; neither does the distance from our Wi-Fi router.The cameras aren't all bad - I appreciated how easy it was to set up the app and the cameras. I also liked that I can share access to the cameras (specific cameras) with my son and my boyfriend, so that we can all see what's going on.Overall, it's a good system and has allowed us piece of mind after the tragedy that we have been through."
"Cons-• WiFi signal strength is “poor” when the source is less than 15ft away.• Motion Detection- it’s either hyper sensitive and will send you alerts for a leaf blowing in the wind or you can change it to only have it send a notification if a person is present (half the time it doesn’t send me a notification when UPS, USPS, etc. deliver a package)• Last two weeks the Device has gone “Offline”.- First time it happened I tried following the steps to reset it. Nothing worked until I went “changed WiFi password” method then it went into a reboot and automatically connected.-Today it was offline so I went outside shoveled snow to get closer to the device, got a ladder in place then I heard the “ding” motion detected.• Subscription you get a 30 day free trial- after the 30 days you pay monthly/yearly nothing changes- but if you don’t want the extra expenses and go the free version it’s pointless. You get no access to the history tab. So if you’re robbed or some freak accident happens you have to watch it “live” otherwise you can’t access it unless you pay for the subscription.Pro-• Flood lights work great good lighting and the motion sensor has a wide radius• You can adjust multiple settings on the camera-device scheduling, motion snooze, motion zones, etc. ( I do think some of this still needs work because of what I wrote as a Con)• If you pay for the subscription it’s nice to be able to look at the history if something happened while you weren’t home. Noticed the other day my neighbor came and took a package off my porch… turned out UPS delivered to the wrong house.• Hopefully never need this feature but the siren is loud accidentally set it off when I was setting the device up for the first time."
"Ring makes you buy a video storage solution so you can review your video when the camera captures motion. I already have a Ring account for their video doorbell system, but it seems I may need to pay for another Ring service for this device.The camera lens is extremely wide angle and video is low resolution, so you may not recognize someone the camera captures at night. My quality and satisfaction test? Would I buy it again? No!"
"Bought this camera a little bit over a year ago.The good: The set-up was easy and it is great that the Ring-app has so many options to customize your experience. Being able to adjust the sensitivity of alerts, being able to “draw” the area in front of the house where it start video, be able to make distrinctions between moving cars and people, etc etc. Really great.The meh: The subscription you need to be able to watch your videos back are a little bit pricy. I paid $40 last year for 1 device and I just paid $50 for the new year for 1 device. The competition Blink, also owned by Amazon, seems to be a bit cheaper with $30 for 1 device for 1 year.The bad: The camera worked great till last week. After a day of rain (we get a decent amount of rain in Massachusetts in Spring), water drops got inside the camera in front of the lens. Of note, we have snowstorms in the winter and occasional heavy raining the rest of the year but that never caused a problem for this camera. The last rainy day was not really that heavy in comparison to others we had so that is weird. Contacted costumer service and apparently we were exactly 1 month over the 1 year warrenty so there was nothing they could do. I explained that it is weird that there are a lot of similar Ring floodlight cameras in our neighborhood for even longer than we own one and nobody has this issue. Logic would dictate that there is something wrong with my camera I would think. Customer service was really polite but kept repeated that our satisfaction was very important to them and kept offering a 35% discount on a new item, which they kept pushing. Ring cameras are not cheap so I do not want to buy a new Ring camera after 13 months. Anyway, I guess I will ask for a refund of my $50 subscription and will be looking into a Blink floodlight instead."
I bought 4 or 5 of these to have coverage all around my house. They are decent and camera quality is good. Unfortunately you need to buy a ring subscription to get much value out of the surveillance functionality. I am happy using them to check in on the kids when they are out playing though. One nuisance however is that it requires at least a couple clicks in the app just to turn on (or off) the light. We have these on our patio and it feels like I have to fight with the app a bit just to turn on the patio light. Could be much easier.
"Our 1st gen Ring Spotlight Cam started the dreaded strobing lights issue.  So I ordered a replacement.  The good news is that the new one was $50 less than I paid for the original one.  The bad news is that the design is still really only for wall mount installations, not soffit mounting.For the original, I ordered metal conduit elbows from Home Depot and cut and re-spliced the wiring so I could add the elbow which allowed the camera to be aimed properly when installed in the soffit outlet.  A pain, but it worked well for year.  The new design prevents that.However, with the new design, I was able to remove the three screws holding the lights in the mount and rotate them so they aren't upside down when mounting in the soffit.  However, the camera hits the soffit, preventing it from seeing beyond the alleyway.  However, that's fine for my driveway.The biggest issue with this specific unit I received is that the camera position clamp screw was cross-threaded and stripped.  I couldn't tighten the ring, so the camera just drooped.  Fortunately I had a screw in my leftover screw storage bins and was able to make it work.Update:  A month later both lights are full of water.  Ring is replacing under warranty.  My previous Ring Floodlight Cam was mounted here for YEARS and never had water in the light housing.  Check out the pictures: the light is ""on."""
"Here is some feedback: (1) the setup was pretty easy - but the center screw to hold the plastic base was to small and the threads did not hold the base to the provided cross brace installed in the box - needed to go to the hardware store to get one slightly larger so it would hold the plastic base to the electrical box. (2) The people detection is not very good, we have a flag pole with a larger American flag, and every time the wind blows it will chime and alert to a person (turned the alerting off since that was quite annoying) (3) you can fence out an area to watch and be alerted on, I have a sidewalk and street in front of my house not included in this ""fenced"" area, but we are getting alerts when some traffic drives by or we have a person walking by on the sidewalk (not getting to the ""fenced"" area I set in the app for this device)."
"It was easy to install, just 3 wires to attach. A variety of different types and sizes of screws are provided to attach to your junction box. Really appreciated the fact that they have screws for older boxes. Nice feature they added was a hook to attach the fixture to while you're connecting the wires.Was simple to add device to Ring App (already a Ring Alarm and Doorbell owner). It says floodlights can connect to Alexa but that's only for video, I was hoping I could use Alexa to turn on the lights. Hopefully in the future they will add that feature. I asked Alexa to turn the lights on but was disappointed that the feature was missing otherwise I would have rated higher. Waiting for Ring/Amazon to add to Alexa skill to turn on light, otherwise, it's not much of a flood light I can use when I want to gaze outside.Additionally, I have the unit mounted across another motion activated light. When that light is activated first, the Ring floodlight does not come on when motion is detected. Major disappointment. Originally I returned the unit and got a replacement because I thought it was defective. After installing the 2nd unit, I had the same problems and happen to figure out it was because the other light was activated. There must be a light sensor that is picking up the light so it doesn't turn on. Major pain.Camera and motion recording works fine."
"I have used many China-made security systems in the past and gave up due to poor support. I have been using Ring Security for over 1 year.  The product material quality and look are good.  So far, I am good with Ring.  But recently bought an outdoor flood light camera for over $190.  The camera quality is far from a $20 camera.  I am surprised that I can not recognize the face or a car number plate at 20-foot distance with or without zooming.  25 food is the distance between my garage door to the street, I am sure most homes in the US have a similar distance between the garage door and the street.  It's such a useless resolution for a pricy security system. We have to remember that, the burglars are not going to pose to the camera at 5 food distance.  Ring should consider a software fix or hardware fix to increase camera resolution."
"Worked great for about 14 months, then both of the lights died.  I understand that the lights are not replaceable.  $250 for something that lasts a year is too much.  Plus now I need to have a new one (maybe not Ring this time) installed."
"I have 2 Ring doorbells, a bunch of stickup cams, and now this floodlight cam. In all cases, they have good night vision. But also, in all cases, the motion detection and facial recognition are HORRIBLE. Even with the sensitivity turned down to the absolute minimum, they're set off by things like a change in shadows due to clouds, a blowing leaf, a squirrel or chipmunk, etc. With the cameras, it only triggers the video, but in the case of this floodlight, it means that (assuming i have motion detection lighting turned on at all), the light turns on and off at seemingly random times all night long (and i don't get motion warnings when it does). I had to disable the motion detection for the light, which seems to defeat part of the purpose of having a flood light attached to a camera in the first place."
"While the product seems certainly fine it was very difficult to set up thanks to a very glitchy Ring app. Took well over an hour having to reinstall the app at least twice and half an hour with a customer service representative who was very patient and eventually got it done but this whole process shouldn't have been that difficult.Had the same experience with an echo speaker Amazon should put their products together on one platform this would make it much easier.That said the camera is much better quality than blink and a performance of the product should be very good. If Amazon could find some way to integrate ring into their main platform I'd give it five stars. Anyone with an Amazon account should be able to quickly set up these devices.  DESCRIPTON SAYS  1080p HD security camera with motion-activated LED floodlights,  THE FLOODLIGHTS ARE NOT MOTION ACITIVTED, THEY ARE ON ALL THE TIME UNLESS YOU TURN FROM WALL SWITCH OR APP.  THE CAMERA IS MOTION ACTIVATED."
"I'm terribly disappointed with this approach. I bought several cameras at once for better coverage, but without a subscription, they don't even record video-only live viewing is available. In other words, they're not selling any additional smart features; they're just selling the basic ability to record video."
"I was an early-to-mid adopter of the Ring spotlight cam. I've purchased four of them over the years and still use them. One of the four failed within a year and was replaced by Amazon without hassle - except for having to physically replace the failed unit 20 feet up. The Ring ecosystem was highly hit-or-miss early on but has gotten better over the years. That said, the ""live view"" functionality has actually worsened with time. It is very annoying to get a motion alert and bring up the camera live view only to find it fozen. The camera is recording and sending the video stream to a server at Amazon, just not to the app. Exiting the live view on can see what was being recorded while live view wasn't being streamed to the app, so it's a little better than nothing. However, I have these cameras installed in locations where I want to see what is happening in real time when I get an alert - I mean I guess that's why they call it an ""alert"" afterall. Maybe they should call it a ""by they way"" instead. This flakey behavior of a key function does not instill confidence in the system overall. I can't help but wonder what is not being captured that I'm not aware of. I'll continue to stick with Ring until I discover something more comes along and justifies having to buy all new hardware."
"I have used Ring products for many years and the older versions of the Ring flood hard wired had good sound.  I have had 3 of the old style at several locations and they had good sound.  Unfortunately last year my older one died and I purchased this newer model Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus and the sound quality is terrible.  When its quiet outside you can hear that the sound stops completely. Then when a noise is heard you hear garbled bang and shissing noises. My old ones were not like that.  After 2 months of trying to reset and reconnect it to my wireless, no change in sound.  The quality of the video is good.  I contacted Ring tech and after about an hour of resetting, turning off several times and hard reboot, no improvement, When someone talks to the camera its quite hard to hear any of it clearly. So Ring had me return the unit.  They did send me a new unit and it came next day, great.  However, the sound on the newer unit is no better.  If you can not use the two way voice communications then the unit is not useful.  I will have to get this one returned also.  Anyone else have this sound quality problem. Is the sound on the pro version any better?"
"I was really excited for these cameras and setting up this system. I wanted to love them, but I'm just frustrated. Half the time when I go to view my cameras, it comes up as not connected. The worst part about this, is when it does this, it won't actually record events. So who knows how often it doesn't record something because it's having issues. I have a solid internet connection with Wi-Fi well broadcasted though the house. Nothing I seem to do helps them maintain their connection. As a data electrician, that is extremely frustrating. I won't be buying any more Ring cameras, that's for sure. When they do work, the camera picture is pretty clear, but the audio isn't very good. The most responsive feature is definitely the lights. Those seem to work fairly well, but even they have issues from time to time as the camera has its bipolar mood swings on whether it's going to work or not. Overall, WAY too expensive for the inconsistent functionality. Just go get Wyze if you need budget wireless cameras, otherwise spend the extra few bucks and go POE."
"So I bought this unit in April 2022 and the flood lights no longer work! The camera still works but the motion lights no longer work. I tried to reset them as per the instructions and nothing. I contacted Ring and was advised, you CAN NOT buy replacement lights! I was told I have to buy another unit. They also mentioned that I should purchase the extended warranty if I did purchase another unit. Ridiculous! And no, the light was not triggered or used more than normal usage."
"I am not dealing with ring anymore as their or amazon is now charging money to return within 30 days and it is not fare.Do not have Prime anymore.But it said free shipping and return are free. But as I was trying to return due to lights not really being satisfactory,the headline was Partial refund, restocking fee will apply.Have one ring camera already at my other property, bought at costco. Its good.As you get off 1 month of fre service, noticed not everything is working anymore after buying the plan - and not sure why. Not everything is being recorded anymore and some glitches here and there are noticable, but I deal with it.It is still good camera.But lights. DId not like those at all! So wanted to return - I have packaget it all as it was and ALL was included. But did not got full return.So I would buy elsewhere honestly if I knew. Bad service.It said free retrun first but them partial!As far as camera - I have ring, I like them. Night vision is good, actually everything is good, but price may be - kind of pricey, but ok for quality, I am ok to pay for it.  My other camera was 50 dollars last year, does exactly same job for me. . It just records on the SD card. And does not demand the plan.I did wanted notifications, so purchased this one. But really not worth it. They have other models.This camera is good but not great, just not worth it.I have bougt way better flood lights that those, also from amazon  - bought 2 motion solar flood lights for my other camera, 20$ each and they are so so so much better that this camera has.Just made a mistake buying this thing and not even checking food light is not that good and camera itself  for 199 is not worth it as you also pay for the plan.If that would be even 300$ but no plans and memberships I would keep it.So I am giving it 5 stars for quality as camera is good. But 1 star for not being honest straigt forward with respocking fees, partial refund. I really made sure it is packaged well, ready to go to somebody else.Also 1 star for lights. Flood lights are not giving same view as my 20$ solar do! 1 star for having no option to just put in the SD card and not to use any memberships."
"Now I understand why the prices came down so much. The base used to be metal, now it’s plastic. The arms for the lights used to be metal, now they’re plastic.The arms for the lights used to have metal locking fixtures, now there’s nothing. Let’s see how long this one lasts. Picture quality is not the same. Images are dark even in daylight, and there’s no way to correct this.  Very cheaply made compared to older models.Very disappointed."
"Great light, purchased for extra security and more light, however it turns off and on when it wants. My wifi isnt 6 yards from it and it keeps losing connection. When purchased it said 2024 release, now when i go to write a review it shows its a 2021 release. Returning if seller doesn't send a new one or make right"
"They both worked perfectly at first. Then one day, one of them went offline, would not reconnect automatically or manually. Ring sent me a refurbished cam to replace it. Then my other cam went out as well. The refurbished one, when I got it, would not set up. Was on phone with Ring support for hours troubleshooting. Now they are sending two newly manufactured cameras.They would not tell me what the problem is. I suspect a firmware update broke the cameras. They would. Or reconnect to Wi-Fi. Will try these other ones but for future, I may look to a different setup. Even factory reset would not fix these cameras. My ring doorbell been going strong for years though!EDIT: I installed the two newly manufactured cameras and they connected first try. Ring was good about sending them to me to replace the ones that quit working. Luckily they were still under warranty. Ring customer support told me it was problems with my wifi, said I was using VPN. Very strange they the both went out within a two days of each other. Had to have been a faulty firmware update that bricked them. I wish Ring would be more transparent about this rather than placing blame on my ISP. Hopefully these new cameras will last a while."
My ring floodlight cam only lasted 18 months before it completely died.  The warranty is one year so this is disappointing.  It was mounted in a protected place below an eve.  I've had inexpensive motion floodlights last 15 year or more.  You'd expect more from an expensive product like this.
"I only had the ring floodlight camera for one year and the lens must be of cheap plastic because you could see how blurry it is. I thought there was dirt on the lens and I went to clean it and it’s the lens itself. They should be using glass or something of quality if you don’t get a clear picture, then what good is it to protect your home? I had a police officer knock on my front door to ask me if I had footage of the street in front of my house because a car was stolen. This is when I noticed how blurry the video was , I reached out to Rennes to see if they had a replacement or if they were going to stand behind the device and I still haven’t heard anything. I’ll upgrade my review when I see what the customer services all about."
"After about a year of working fine, it stopped connecting to my internet. I read alot of forums with people having the same problem, I tried numerous things with my Internet but nothing worked. My ring doorbell and outdoor stick up cam work fine. After about a month, it decided to start working again, then quit working for a few days, now its working again. For how long, who knows. I would not buy another one. Maybe the floodlight pro is better and won't have the same problems, I don't know. Very frusterating."
"Worked good at first, but stopped working after 1 1/2 years. Lights won't even come on. Have tried everything to get it working again, but will not work. Was a gift for my mom, and now it hasn't worked for a year, so she has no light in her driveway."
"It was perfect during the 30-day free trial, so I paid for 1-year and everything just went south after that.  The light won't turn off.  I go outside in the middle of the day, it's on. Go to the app and manually Turn Off Lights, and it's right back on again.  Just looked outside here in the evening, light's on.  Go to the Live view and rewind the footage only to see that it's been on all evening long.  Manually turn it off, then it's right back on again.  I'm just done with it now. Too frustrating.  Just another idiotic device that doesn't work the way it should.10/20/23 Update:  Still battling the intermittent issue with the lights not turning off.  Woke up at 3:30am this morning to find the lights on, so I checked the app.  No notifications for motion.  Just the lights on all night long.  Again....  They have to be shut off at the power switch, which kinda defeats the purpose of it all.The saying ""pick you battles"" becomes so much more relevant with age.  This one will be coming to an end soon."
"I like these, I bought two. But it is far too sensitive. When the wind blows or it rains /snows the lights go off. I have the sensitivity set to it's lowest settings too. Kinda defeats the purpose when I need to turn the motion sensor off bc of how often it goes off."
"I had no idea this flood light required a monthly fee to work on my phone. After 30 days, the free trial wore off and ithe motion sensors went off every 10 mins all day long. I had to shut it off."
This new cam spotlight was purchased to replace another one. Due to the advice of tech support provided to me the old one stopped working. The new cam is now going to a black screen as well. Support is not able to assist so thinking about cancelling my service. The new cam has a trial so every time I access the app I get a message my trial is about to end even though I have a plan that covers all devices connected. Support advised they can’t suspend the trial message. Very disappointed in the service I’m receiving. Will not recommend ring cameras to anyone in the future. Ring doesn’t care about customer service and their resolve is always we will replace it but that doesn’t solve all issues especially when most likely it is a software or ring app or system issue!
"I bought the Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus with motion-activated 1080p HD video for extra security at my home. I received it set it up and it seemed alright the picture was good, the motion sensor was better tan I thought it was going to be, the flood lights only reached half as far as the light it replaced but I can Live with that.Then as I used it I noticed the picture  isn't really any better than my HD cam I got for $25 .It's nice an bright and looks good if you looks at it as a whole but wen you try to pick out individual things it's hard to make out. Like someone was going to bring in my garbage can for me and I knew it was my son in law or my grandson. The motion alert went off I looked at the camera and couldn't witch one it was till they got like 20 feet from the camera keep in mind I know them both and one of them is a 70lb. 9yr boy and the other is a 250lb adult.Then watching video of me pulling my car and truck in and out of my driveway I noticed you cant read the license plates . I went out pulled my truck straight with the camera looked at my phone can't read the plate moved closer still can't read it .Right up to 10-15 feet from the camera zoom in till the license plate filled the screen and just can't read the license plate.I have a long open driveway maybe 150 feet and when the school bus comes to pick up my grandson nextdoor a big yellow school bus is one of those small things that are hard to make out. So for a security camera this is a fail , if you get robbed you have no good video of the person no license plate number you might be able to tell what they are driving but only if it's day light or they park in the little light this thing puts out."
I purchased my ring flood light in 2020 and here it is 2023 and the light has stopped working..my warranty is out and now I must purchase another one.I don't think that it is fair to consumers to spend all of the money that was spent on the product as well as  paid for the protection plan and then it just stops working after 3 years..I spoke to a ring representative on last night and they attempted to assist with the problem but was unsuccessful in doing so.I feel as though that they should have at least offered me half off of a new one.I will have to try to find something else.Very disappointed 😞
"These cameras are just ok. Video is not the clearest and audio can be a bit garbled, but they function. Biggest issue I’ve come across is the plastic housing cracks and breaks on its own. See photos. These cameras were mounted out of reach of people for about a year. I had to get on a ladder to take these pictures. No wildlife (birds) ever nest or land on them. Camera footage never catches anything touching them. But one morning I noticed the light pointing down. I looked at the previous days footage carefully and found nothing. So I got on a ladder and saw the plastic of the light had snapped. These are under an overhang, so they are protected well from most elements. Only thing I can think of is the summer heat. Even though they are not in direct sunlight all day. For something that you are charged a premium price for, these should last a lot longer. They need more durable housing, not cheap plastic. Light is useless now."
"I ordered two Ring Floodlight cameras. One works fine. The other one was defective. The color night vision didn’t work at all. I contacted Ring customer service and had to prove to them it was defective- not an unreasonable request. But the process took several days to complete! They agreed that the camera was defective and replaced it. The new camera was installed and the color night vision didn’t work on this one either. I decided to return the camera through Amazon and not Ring, as Amazon’s return process is much simpler. As I was packaging up the camera, I noticed that the replacement camera was actually a refurbished one! Seriously? I ordered and paid for a NEW camera, not a used one! I always thought the Ring brand was top of the line, so I’m very disappointed in the quality of the camera and the fact that they think it’s acceptable to replace a defective NEW camera with a defective USED one. I feel no loyalty to the Ring brand now."
"I bought this security camera because of Ring's reputation.  However, I have had nothing but problems since I got it and have contacted a few times.  One told me to turn on Smart Alerts; another one tole me to turn it off. If I turn on Smart Alerts so that I can set it to detect motion for people only, it doesn't give me an alert unless I'm directly under the camera even though the sensitivity it set up all the way.  If I turn off the Smart Alerts, I get a notification a lot sooner, but every time a car passes my house at night the headlights set off the motion detection.  No winning here...Update 12/23/22:  With incredible support from a wonderful, patient Ring employee and a call to my internet service provider, the camera issues have been resolved, and I am very pleased with it now.  Thanks, Brett!!!Update 3/13/23:  I have continued to have problems with this camera.  I recently had a bunch of false alarms in a 24-hour period.  There is no one there or headlights set it off, even though it is set to detect people only.  I did a reset but am still getting false alarms -- like when my neighbor pulls his car out of his driveway, even though his driveway cannot be seen in my camera view; and it is a pickup truck, not a person and is nowhere near my motion detection zone.  Support said if the problems continue, they will replace the camera.  That would be the second time it's been replaced.  I continue to do resets, which work for a little while, but then the false alarms start again.  I cannot recommend this camera."
This camera works ok for security but is much better for lighting. Dusk to dawn feature works flawlessly and the app allows for pin point accuracy and personal preferences. The camera has excellent color but doesn’t always activate when it should. The voice activation works perfect and the volume can be controlled to your liking. It seems pricey but then again what isn’t in 2024? Ring support is dependable but can be a pain in the axx to get ahold of when you need them. I use their cameras exclusively and my property is covered and sealed with great protection. Above average for DIY installations. Easy peasy. Highly recommend.
"I will attempt to convey in words how disappointed I am with Ring so that no one experiences what I have had to experience.I have spent approximately four thousand five hundred dollars on Ring security equipment and installation.Ring recommends On Tech for installation. An On Tech technician came to my home to figure out the best security system. I ordered five floodlights with video and motion sensors that required electricity. I had to hire a contractor to install the wires.I ordered two battery powered spotlights with solar panels because running wires to the two locations would be difficult.After the lights were installed, the battery powered lights were not very bright and the motion sensors did not work very well when they work.I had to replace the two battery powered lights with electrical powered lights after the contractor installed the electrical.Since this took longer than thirty days, I was unable to return the battery powered lights.As for the alarm system, it has serious issues. One issue is that when you are at home and alarm the system, one entry such as the front door is on a delayed time before the alarm is triggered.My alarm was triggered two times and both times the monitoring service did not inform the police. I was told after the first time that the police would be called if it happened again, and I was not contacted by the monitoring service. The second time my alarm was triggered, I received an automated voice message notifying me my alarm was triggered and of my cancellation request.I did not receive the call and I never requested to cancel the police to be called.I called Ring and requested to speak with the monitoring department a few hours later. I was told that the monitoring department could not take my call, and someone would call me back within twenty-four hours.I asked the customer support representative for his name, and he told me his first name. I requested his last name or employee ID number. He refused to give me either.I asked where he was located, and he told me the Caribbean. I asked what Island and he refused to tell me.I asked to speak with his supervisor. He told me that his supervisor would call me within twenty-four hours.I requested that his supervisor email me so that I would have his name or employee ID number.His supervisor sent an email to me with only his first name and a department email address.I requested his name and he refused. I requested the CEO’s email address and he refused.Ring has been a nightmare for me. I cannot believe I wasted so much money."
"Updated review: Shortly after writing my first review, I finally did receive my new replacement camera; was not within the 3-5 days they said I would get it, but they did send it. I’ve installed and so far it’s working properly. I have no idea if I received the replacement due to my review, or if it was a coincidence and it really was just taking a while to ship. After reading other reviews, I can’t be so sure. I’m still undecided if I will purchase more Ring products in the future since it was such a hassle to get a replacement.  Also, after reading many reviews, the floodlights not turning off on the wired floodlight camera seems to be a major problem with a lot of people. I’m wondering if it’s a software problem they need to fix…definitely not a fun issue to have.I don’t typically write a lot of reviews. But I’m so angry at the customer service I’ve been experiencing with Ring. I bought this wired floodlight camera. It was working just fine for a little over a month. Then, the floodlights suddenly would not turn OFF. I tried turning them off in the app. I tried doing every single troubleshooting technique the website said to do. No solution. So I went through customer service on Amazon first. They ran me through Troubleshooting. No success. So they tell me to contact the Ring company directly. I contacted Ring, the customer service rep ran me through the troubleshooting again. No success. The floodlights still will not turn off. The customer service rep said since it is still under warranty, she will send me a replacement which will be here in 3 to 5 business days. Then she said she will send me a label in my email to return my defective camera. I did receive a label of course. Well over a week later, I have yet to see a replacement camera. I can not get anyone at Ring to tell me where it is in the delivery or shipping process. I have a feeling I’ve been super screwed over.So I have blaring flood lights at all times of the night bothering my neighbors as well as during the day when they are useless.NOT ONLY am I having the floodlights issue…I’ve read multiple reviews of others having the same problem and customer service not helping them. I should’ve read those reviews before purchasing from Ring. I will not be purchasing anymore of their products and will also be letting as many people I know how much they suck. IF, I happen to actually get a replacement camera, I’ll edit this. I’m so angry!!!"
"Got everything hooked up and good to go, tested many times at night when light should come on, checked settings, called ring customer service too. When motion detected, the light does not always come on, have had this for almost 30 days now and already did a reboot on it and it still does not work as it should. Motion detectors, we get notification, light comes on when it wants, most of the time it does not. (This is being test at dark when the light should be coming on.)"
"The electrical installation and setup were great, as they always have been for me for Ring products.  The big major design flaw in my opinion is the 5"" mounting diameter for the base.  I searched everywhere and couldn't find a 5"" round outdoor electrical box (hey Amazon, how about listing some recommendations with the listing?).  Every outdoor box is the standard 4"" diameter and it's a truly Mickey-Mouse solution to mount to that, as mentioned in other reviews.I ended up with the really nice BestTong aluminum outdoor box, which allows for a sealed mounting.  The disadvantage is the added cost and the DIY nature of using a sealed box with no pre-drilled holes."
"Unless you know a cheap electrician, let this one go"
"I purchased this camera in 2023. After 14 months, the lens covering the camera fell off. After goggling, I realized this is a known issue by Ring. My product is 2 months out of the year long warranty. There is no option to purchase a replacement lens. I contacted Ring Support who said that I should’ve paid $100/year or $10/month for the extended warranty and that I could’ve gotten a new product for free. Free? That’s not free. They then suggested I purchase a new camera for $250+. No thanks. I have never had issues with my Blink cameras and will stick to them from now on."
"Update: about 4 weeks after writing this review the camera completely stopped working.  Nothing, won’t come at all.  We have tried everything. It happened during a period of rain.  It’s definitely because it got wet inside so this is NOT weather proof at all!  What’s the point of having an OUTDOOR spotlight camera if it can’t handle rain? Very disappointed in the quality of this product.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!!!I already had the doorbell pro cam, 3 indoor stick up cams, and an outdoor cam for my pool.  When our spotlight above our garage door went out, we were going to buy a new light but because our driveway is not visible on my doorbell cam we decided to try this.  My house was built in 1983, and I think the outdoor spot light there was original.  It was completely rusted.  I questioned whether or not this would actually work.  But it did,  it hooked right up, I didn’t have to order anything else,  the original mounting fixture worked and it is completely water proof.  Now, this light is controlled with a light switch, so, if anyone turns it off the power to the cam is cut off.  But I’m going to put a piece of tape over it.  I was able to set the parameters so that it didn’t pick up every car going down the road, just cars that pulled into my driveway.  And the light does come on automatically at night, and it is bright bright.  The voices coming through seem to be clearer than my older cameras.  Also, even though my Wi-Fi router is upstairs on the other side of the house it’s picking up signal good and haven’t had an issue there.  This literally took like 30 minutes to install and get it running on my ring app.  I was pretty surprised.  I’m glad I bit the bullet and purchased this instead of a regular light."
"I was replacing my 1st gen Flood Light. First thing I noticed is the new model weighs half of the original. Mostly plastic compared to mostly metal. New plate is easy to install, but the light base barely covers the box opening. It will take a ton of caulk to fill the gap. If it shorts from the rain, it's going back. Never had this issue with my 1st gen light. Oh, I expected a much better resolution with the newer model, but it's actually grainy. Yes, I've removed all the protective film and I am not in some night vision mode. How weird!"
"I have had this for nearly a month. It cost more for an electrician to install than for the $119 price on Amazon during Black Friday.It is poorly constructed Chinese junk. Instead of high-power LED bulbs that I expected, each of the two ""lights"" comprise several tiny LED chips, not single bulbs. They are yellowish (like incandescent bulbs) and not very bright. I had expected bright white illumination. These throw about as much light as a 75 watt bulb.Ring claims color night vision. Nope. I thought it had snowed, because my grass was white. No night color.After several calls to Ring (customer services is in the Philippines), and being told my unit was defective and would be replaced in 4-5 business days, after 2 weeks I got a supervisor in the phone. She said there had been so many returns of defective units, they were backordered for an estimated 2 weeks.Worst of all, when the little micro-LEDs burn out, you have to toss the entire fixture and buy a new one, which is now $200.If I ever get a replacement,  I will have to pay an electrician $150 again to remove the defective one and install the new one-- which may be no better than the first.I would NOT recommend this unit!"
"I bought camera in Feb of this year and paid a years worth of the basic coverage. After a few weeks ring notified me a certain function would no longer be available unless a bought a more expensive subscription once my trial ended. That was fine, however now after 7 months they TOOK away the function on my app where I can easily arm and disarm system with different modes! I called ring support , I was told I need to go in settings every time I want to arm and disarm, the “Mode” function was upgraded and discontinued for “Basic” memberships. However if I upgrade to a more expensive plan I can use the “modes” easy functions again! I already paid until March 2025 for the basic , I feel ring is unfair, I should have been able to keep my current App functions which I paid for at least until the end of my paid subscription. .! I will never upgrade now and I will never purchase another  ring product. This was my first and is now my last. I will be looking at other options to replace this camera at the end of my term."
"Camera quality is pretty good. I had some issues when it rained very hard and the color was off for a couple of days until it dried up.  I bought the service and had my phone set up to save recordings for 180 days. Of course you really never notice it's not saving for 180 days until you need the videos. Customer service pretty much said I was a liar and didn't have it set for 180 days.  Even though they walked me through how to check what I have it set for. They the walked me through deleting the app and reinstalling it back on my phone. Then had me check to see what the setting was. It was 180 days. She then told me that she couldn't guarantee that my videos would be saved for180 days. So what's the use of that setting???Lesson  learned if you want to save a video, download it to your phone or email it to yourself.  And just hope a video over 60 days isn't needed in the future.Also the app constantly stops giving notifications and you have to go in turn them off then back on in order for it to notify you."
"Camera quality is great. Unfortunately, the lights do not work as expected. I Bought this camera for motion-activated lights, however the lights stay on CONSTANTLY. In order to get them to turn off, I had to turn them completely off which has been a disappointment. When researching this camera, I found that it is a flaw that many other people have been experiencing"
"We had an unidentified suspicious vehicle pull into our driveway, ignoring the Private Property - No Trespassing signs. It stayed for several minutes, for no detectable legitimate reason. The Ring camera had a direct line of sight to the license plate, but was not sharp or detailed enough to ID the plate. I'm very disappointed in this Floodlight Cam Plus product for not being detailed enough to capture a license plate.Not good for peace of mind. When I posted this incident in the Ring Neighbors app, it was denied because it wasn't important enough. I regret being a Ring customer."
"I Purchased a ring camera floodlight for my yard at the end of 2023. It was installed and hardwired by a licensed electrician. I added a new transformer to my house. It stopped working and went totally dead after four months. I contacted Ring. They made me go through a circus act to try to get it to work. They then sent me a “refurbished” replacement as opposed to a new camera floodlight like I originally purchased. It was installed at the end of February and now again it is absolutely dead. I talked to the manager, Dante, and he said it’s out of its 90 day warranty so the best they can do is give me a 35% discount to purchase a new one. Why would I purchase a new one when they do not stand behind their product? I’ve had this refurbished one for six months and it’s completely dead and they said that’s the best they can do. I’ve purchased many of these ring products for clients and family members. I will never purchase another Ring product. Zero customer service and their product is absolute garbage."
Even tho this is a nice looking unit and I’m sure it works great I won’t be able to use it. My mount is on the soffit not on a vertical wall. I waited to long to send it back. But my kids have a big back yard and this would be perfect for their ring system. Come on Christmas.
I've had the spotlight with camera for 2 years. It was mounted under the roof eave and the sensor fills with water.I have seen reviews on other sites where people have the same issue. This is a known problem but Ring does not acknowledge it! Bad design.
"Unless you buy a plan, the system is much less usable and effective. Without the plan the motion detector alerts you to every bird that flies by and there is no image storage at all. Meaning you don't know what type of bird just set off the motion sensor."
"Unless you plan on purchasing the monthly subscription, the product is USELESS!The cost of the Ring Floodlight Camera is $249.99 which is VERY EXPESIVE compare to many of the competitors available in the market.The competitors include the most essential features FREE with the purchase of their camera, such as:1. Auto alert of movement in front of camera (via sensors)2. Auto recording of movement in front (Via cloud or saved locally in memory card)3. View in app for live feed of the camera4. Two way communication5. Night vision cameraWhat did I get with purchase of Ring Floodlight Camera is $249.99? Surely there must be more for purchasing a product that is 2x the price of their competitors?A 30 day trial period, you must purchase the The monthly subscription of $10 a month totals to $120 per year, for the basic future that was mentioned previously, with the option to share my feed to the ""community"".If you don't get the monthly subscription they remove some of the MOST ESSENTIAL FEATURE or you will end up with an EXPENSIVE JUNK.- They disable recording and saving of videos and there is not option to add your own SSD card- They offer ""auto alert"" to notify you of movement, THAT IS MINIMUM 2 MIN DELAYThere is two ultimatum:A. I SHOULDNT BE PAYING FOR A DEVICE IF I AM PAYING FOR A SUBSCRIPTION OF ""FEATURE"" THAT ARE LITTERLY FREE WITH ANY OTHER COMPETITOR!B. Provide the most basic features for the camera if customer decides NOT to get the subscriptionWHY SHOULD I PAY FOR A SUBSCRIPTION THAT HAS NO ACTUAL BENEFIT?? THERE IS LITTERLY NOTHING THAT I AM BENEFITING FROM THE SUBSCRIPTION OTHER THAN PAYING FOR A SERVICE FOR FEATURES THAT ARE LITTERLY FREE OR CUSTOMARILY BASIC FEATURE IN ANY OTHER CAMERA?"
"I don't know why the video is Very Short! That's why I paid monthly payments to have a right to be recording and see what happen in my property, but the camera just capture very short videos, doesn't matter if the event still happen. Not even a minute. People or another event happen I can't see what really happen, if I paid for this services. I believe have the right to the camera record at list the most important part, last mount was a nice expensive truck Cadillac Escalade in front my house and I can't get the video, this is Not good that is Very Sadly; I. We do have 4 Rings Cameras, and we need some more, but we thinking if continue with Ring or not, because, at the began the videos was perfect, and I not even  have monthly payment yet, if is necessary I can prove it. I. We still have some videos for more than 2 minutes until the event finish. Thanks a Lot Amazon to give your Customer the right to share...this is Noting bad. We just keep Trusting Amazon...I or We, wan to continue be your Customer. I just asking to take care better your Customers..."
"Ring sells product with 30 days of service but fails to provide the 30 days of service. I purchased 3 additional units for 4 total and expected 90 days of free service when the app would not set this up I called customer service. I explained that I was adding the 4th device and wanted the free service to extend, he said he could do that and set it up adding the 1year subscription to start after the trials. BUT service was disconnected 44 days too soon and now spoke to rep and supervisor who say they can’t provide the 30 days of service. Seller is using deceptive and misleading advertising."
I have had this camera barely a month. I got a notification of motion at my door so I look and no one is there but a mail voice is coming through my camera. I have shut the camera off and will no longer be using it. I absolutely do not feel safe and I highly encourage anyone looking to buy a camera do you research before buying! When I contacted ring customer support they were very rude to me and ended the chat with no explanation or help. I will no longer support any ring products. I would be cautions about putting cameras inside your home! Stay safe people!
"It is about time to give and fair and truthful review about the product. I have two one in the back and one in the front. As much as i would like to love this, but I am disappointed with some flaws. Live coverage and motion detection most especially with person lags-meaning it stops when it is mostly important to detect and see persons going in and out of my driveway. A few times when i cannot see a complete video coverage of whats going on outside my house. It does not give me a full sense of security most especially when theres a person involve passing by. The video pauses and a few times i dont know where the person went. In fairness to the customer service i talked to when i just got this device. She was kind and helpful but all i got help with is to Reset my device. I am not sure if there’s enough way for customer service to detect from their end how to determine what is wrong with the device. I just wish there will be some inporvements. I have multiple indoor camera at home with reasonable price and it never failed on me. The only thing that i got interested with Ring due to its trusted name, reviews and the ability to store videos with no need for a sd card. I dont know I have mixed feelings about these device up to now. But i am still not giving up."
"Dear Sir,I am so disappointed that my Ring device with motion activated 1080p was found to be defective  I called Ring, com to find out how to connect it and after 3 hours the technician  finally ascertained  that my device was defective.  I am returning it for this reason, and I'm hoping that the NEW one I'm ordering will be perfectly satisfactory.  My electrician advised me to keep the old one and  install the new one which is said to be delivered tomorrowDec.2nd at the same time.  That way he only has to make one trip.."
"Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus with motion-activated 1080p HD video, White (2021 release) 2-*from Garcia Miguel on June 23, 2022You have to re set it everytime you have a power outageThe device is great to have when you have power on but it is a piece of  when you have a power outageWe have power outage problems where we live in Texas.We have outage around every week and I have to re set the floodlight outside my garage...I just got technical support.If you decide to by this product ,you will also need to invest into a wi Fi extender if your cam is further than 15 feet.I have my install in the drive way which is less than 20 ft from router but I have to re set it each time I have a power outage which is happening very often in TX . Unless you want to invest into a extender I would advice you to get a flood light with a further wifi .This is a good camera for those who are willing to pay the extra cash for a wifi extender !!"
"The camera itself works well. I purchased 3 from Amazon during their Cyber Monday sale and planned to install them when my home renovation finished. The return policy at the time said ""Return by January 31st"", so I ordered the wired version of the camera and planned to exchange for another power source if necessary.I was able to install two of the wired cameras, but I wasn't able to get the 3rd camera to turn on after the first time I installed it. I first tried to initiate a return but found out that apparently the return policy through Amazon was only 30 days, despite the fact that my ""orders"" page said I had until Jan 31st. No matter; I supposedly had a 1yr warranty through Ring, so I tried to troubleshoot (didn't work) and was asked if I wanted to exchange. Sure, but as I paid $100+ for a handyman to install the wired camera and we suspect that wiring had something to do with the camera failure, I wanted a solar or battery powered camera instead. I was told that because I purchased the camera through Amazon, not Ring, I could only exchange for exactly the same type of camera. Amazon owns Ring, so.....?? Sunny, the (incredibly unhelpful) service supervisor I spoke with, said that ""our inventory systems aren't integrated yet, so we can't process exchanges for other products, though we will be able to in the future"". Why is that my problem??So, now I have a $400 piece of junk that neither Ring nor Amazon will stand behind. I'd highly recommend purchasing only directly from the manufacturer, or you won't receive any support or warranty coverage despite it being advertised."
"It says this camera can be mounted on ceiling or soffit. It can, but, it points too high. I had to place a FAT wedge on the back side of the surface to make it look down at the ground. And still almost broke plastic base trying get camera pointed down enough to see street and ground area on front of my house. Floodlights are very bright though.Ring needs to STOP making cameras like this WITHOUT supplying customers with a base that will work for ceiling/soffit areas.NO ONE mounts, or wants to mount, cameras on a wall. This is a stupid design.They do make a part for this for inside cameras, but they want to charge you more for it. Ridiculous.Even with the little $50 indoor camerathat you can switch the base for mounting on ceiling, it still won't point swival down enough to see the whole area.But, just on this outdoor camera/floodlight, they need to make it an outdoor camera/floodlight that mounts where almost everyone mounts outdoor cameras, mounted to the eve/soffit area.Who ever is designing these, needs to be fired.OR lower the price so that people buying them can pay the extra money to professionals, like myself, to make their adjustments so that the camera can see what it's suppose to see."
"I was really looking forward to using this floodlight camera, but I’ve been quite disappointed with its performance. Firstly, the lights do not activate with motion as they're supposed to, making it unreliable for security purposes. Additionally, the image color is completely different from my other Ring cameras, which is frustrating when trying to maintain a consistent view around my property. Overall, this product has not met my expectations, and I would not recommend it based on my experience.UPDATE 28.11.24Item was returned to DHL and I can not get my refund from amazon almost a month later and no one can help me. all of the CSR have continued to end the chat on me saying they can no longer help me. at this point I have returned the camera to Amazon and have not received my money. no camera and no money."
"So, Ring had a really good product, but they have chosen to degrade both the value and usability. I had 4 Ring Cam Spotlight cams before I purchased this one. I have the Ring app on my PC, and if any motion occurs in front of any of them, a chime sounds and the Ring app alerts. This is great, for things like the Mailman, UPS, and lurkers. However, for some inane reason, they have discontinued support for this app, so new devices can not be added. So, this alert system will only work until my existing cameras crap out, and I can not have it for this, new camera. This is a significant reduction in serviceability and usefulness. Second, somewhere between 6 months and a year ago, Ring surreptitiously pushed a firmware update that made the previously robust siren, which was a deterrent to loiterers and trespassers, into a milk toast mild mosquito buzz. I used to be able to hear mine from inside, now I can barely hear it standing under it. I thought something had happened, so I did a search and found out about this muting of the siren. Recently, I called tech support, and they confirmed it. So, it appears Ring couldn't give a rats you know what about their customers.  They are going to put out the capability they want you to have, and you are going to like it."
"This would have been my 2nd floodlight. These are amazing at capturing and doing exactly what I need. The problem is that the bulbs can’t be replaced. I am not of the mind to put out $300 every couple of years because I can’t control who comes near my home and the bulbs go out requiring a whole new device despite the camera still functioning.Sadly, I returned it and bought a camera and floodlight separate. But wonderful premise though…"
"The video quality and motion sensing on this thing are great. However, the camera unit is not water tight. I had it mounted out of direct rainfall and it still got water in the camera and motion sensing unit. This happened after having it for almost a year, and of course there's only a 1 year warranty. Consider your options before buying this. It is also not ideal that it has to be connected to wifi to work."
"I have installed about a half dozen of these, and it is a very easy and straight forward installation. Features are convenient and user friendly. HOWEVER, I bought one in October of 2022, waited until around spring of 2023 to install it and the plastic parts that support each screw sheared completely in half right after the 1-year replacement ended. Kind of annoyed and disappointed about it because it was installed for under a year and have never had an issue with previous installs."
"Tl;Dr: This is a good LOOKING product, and does exactly what it says it will. However, photo quality is not at all what it should be, and the mechanics are quite finicky. If you must have an instant-develop camera, keep looking.I researched instant-print cameras and this was supposed to be a good choice if you want a photo larger than two postage stamps put together. Unfortunately, more research after I got it home and tried it out (and assumed I must be doing something wrong) tells me that no, it's just not a good product for what it's supposed to do: take and print photos.The quality of the pictures is terrible. Blurry, with washed out colors, and color that is just plain incorrect (a medium jewel purple came out almost pastel, etc). The lack of control over flash is a serious flaw as the camera's sensor seems to think it needs to go off any time you're indoors and not in the very brightest of lighting, so on top of everything the photos often come out seriously over-exposed. I get the feeling you'd get much better results taking pics from about six feet away (as is the intended use), but didn't waste more film trying that out.You're better off snapping pictures with your phone and taking a few extra seconds to just print them out in a small size. Very disappointed. Really wanted this to work so I could easily take pictures for journaling, but the photo quality is a non-starter, especially for the price.In addition:- The button to take a photo is VERY sensitive, so don't hold your finger anywhere near it until you're ready to take a picture- The frame in the viewfinder is extreeeemely inaccurate for photos that are taken within a few feet of the subject. I went through probably three to five shots before I figured out how to take them without getting several inches cut off of each side.- Definitely get extra film out of the gate (and I recommend a little case, too, otherwise it's just sitting out waiting to get scratched or banged around). The starer pack mine came with had five sheets, not ten, and I went through all of them just on the learning curve."
"The ""pressure plate"" or ""platen"" (metal piece in first image) should be attached to the back cover and presses against the paper to keep it aligned with the roller/feed mechanism. Upon opening it the first time, this platen fell out b/c it either wasn't attached sufficiently or the places it connects weren't molded well. I was able to put it back together and get a few usable prints out, but it fell apart each time I opened it. A small wire that helps hold the platen to the ""door"" came loose and was lost. The interface design is most frustrating. Referring to the second image, note the placement of the power button in proximity to the exposure button. Several times after shooting, then turning the camera to where the print exits, my finger would accidentally hit the power button & start the entire process over before the print made it out, losing the original because it stopped mid-process, then waiting for the accidental one to process & exit, losing yet another print. The buttons should be placed separate from each other, or recessed. The exit slot runs across roughly 80% of the entire camera height, creating another spacing problem should your finger happen to be covering part of it due to trying to hold the camera in an area that isn't going to cause the button(s) to be pressed again. The SD slot & USB connection is on the bottom. The ""charged"" light came on, but it actually only had enough charge for about 3 prints . . . SO, keep it plugged in if possible, and be constantly aware of where you're holding it.  I have yet to open the replacement, but I found no instructions in the first one, except the placement notation that the blue conditioner-sheet that comes with the paper packs. Cramming a quality dye-sub printer & camera together is quite a feat, and worth it if you keep these tips in mind while using it."
It is hard to get a great picture. Film has to be taken all at the same light for the pictures to turn out correctly and to find that light is difficult! We haven’t tried the sd card yet but that might be the way to go.
The camera works but takes very long between each time you take a picture. For example if you are taking 3 pics in a row the picture take longer to develop in between each one. The sticker inc is nice though. Fun for kids.
Prints out dark and streaky
Purchased for my 8 year olds birthday in May. It seems well made. Easy to use. She has fun with it for a few months and then it stopped working. Not sure if it was user error or just a poor product.
"I don't mind the Zink technology. Like that photos print so you can hand them out on site, but still have the images on the SD card so have your own copies.DEAL BRAKER:  The shutter button placement, lack of prominence and sensitivity. I think more photos we taken unintentionally by myself and others than photos intentionally taken. It is placed on the top right edge of the camera with no other space to hold it while framing your picture. Plus it's flat (nearly flush with the camera body) and white. Just like the top of the camera and the power button right next to it. Most frustrating, it barely depresses when you touch it, so the slightest bump takes a photo. Unlike some of the other cameras, this one doesn't give you the option to cancel before you print. God forbid you leave you finger on it for more than a half second, it will just keep taking more and more, so there goes all your film.The Kodak Step model has a button that is raised, so you at least know you are touching the button, as well as space for a finger to hold the camera between the edge and the shutter.I did have 4 other people test the camera and even provided detail warnings and demos of how not to accidentally press the shutter before it was positioned, and all failed. The ability to press down on a button seems like it might be a minor issue, but when you're consuming film, knowing if you even got the picture you wanted or not is kind of a critical thing.Returning for the Kodak Step."
"The camera is super adorable, but I probably should have spent more on a better camera.  I ordered this camera for my 8 year old so I wasn't willing to spend a lot more.  I am a bit disappointed.  She was so excited to use it right out of the box, but it was a bit tricky to figure out.  Almost too simple!There was no cord, which oh well I have a million cords so we figured that out after some searching.  When we first opened the camera we were hoping it would be charged enough to take 1-2 pictures right away but it didn't have enough of a charge.When we finally tried it, the camera was making all sorts of noises and it was hard to figure out what it was doing.  The user guide provided the most basic steps but no details.  I think it would be helpful to have a more through guide explaining steps in more detail.  Such as:  Step 1, charge the camera for X amount of time,  use a ___ type of cord.  Step 2, load paper following the paper instructions (insert more detail here).  Step 3, turn on camera by holding the power button for 3 seconds, the a light will illuminate when the camera is on.  Step 4, press the camera shoot button X amount a seconds until you hear ____ sound.  OR MAYBE A MORE DETAILED VIDEO.I tried finding a video on YouTube but I found nothing of use.  In fact the camera features have changed.  No black and white option, no three lights explaining what the camera is doing.  Once I figure this camera out I will have to post a tutorial since the manufacture seems to say ""You are on your own""."
"What I Liked: the camera automatically prints wallet sized photos and the kit included all the fun extras like stickers, frames to stick the photos on (they have sticky backs), markers and other things to decorate and display your pictures.What I didn't like: The photo quality is seriously lacking. The exposure is SO BRIGHT and the photos look a bit old and blurry, colors are diminished.Overall for a 14 year olds birthday gift she thought it was really cool. (Then again she doesn't have any other photo quality experience to compare it to as it's her first camera)"
"okie dokie so i reaaallly wanted this to work because i wanted to take it to a festival in vegas and AFTER i bought it i read the review lol but i had some hopes. i really wanted to get the grey or black but it wouldnt arrive to my house until after i left for vegas so i got the pink one. now I dont know if anyone else noticed a pattern but all the video and pic reviews that reviewed this badly had the PINK camera....im no professional but im just saying its somethin i noticed lol.  the pink one does NOT come with a charger and i figured out what the problem with this camera is. it jams. simple as that. just like any other printer. except this camera is so small and theres no access to the tray so you cant adjust it to make the paper not jam. the blue card came out because its much thicker than the photo paper and doesnt bend but when you take a picture the paper bends to just underneath the little ""tray"" thats supposed to help it slide out. if you look inside the camera where the paper comes out while the photo is developing youll know what im talking about. I kinda expected this so no biggie ill just return it and take my clunky polaroid. Oh well. hit and a miss...still cute tho"
"This is fun for a kid with the instant printing on sticker paper. However, it is a little disappointing for 3 main reasons:1. The photo paper costs at least 40 cents a picture, which I would gladly pay if the camera wasnt set up to print accidental photos constantly. If you barely touch or accidentally graze the trigger with a strand of hair, it takes a photo. This means a lot of junk accidental photos are taken and 40 cent 2x3 paper wasted.2. The quality of the photos is TERRIBLE. I'd rather have 3 mp with color that isn't completely washed out. We are very fair skinned people and all turn out like Casper on the camera. The photos look like photos you find from the 70s that weren't properly stored. Actually they look worse, because everything looks like you edited the pictures to turn the exposure up all the way.  I bought this based on good reviews online, but with the horrible quality of the pictures I'm shocked anyone would give this camera more than 3 stars.3. The pictures do save to an sd card If you install one, which is the main reason i bought this over other brands. However, iits kind of a bummer that you cant see your pictures before you choose to print them. Every photo has to waste a 40 cent zink paper. So having the sd card is really kind of pointless since you can't retrieve photos on the camera and print them later from the camera. You have to pull the sd card and put it in a computer or something to print at another time (which, with the awful quality of the photos, I cannot imagine ever wanting to do anyway).I think my 9 year old will enjoy this anyway, but even her first comment was ""how come the color is so bad?"" Its shockingly bad even to a 9 year old."
"I'm a photographer and a camera lover, and instant print is my favorite kind of photography so I had to check this out, I mean the reviews made it seem amazing. I got it for myself for Christmas and I keep going back to my instax minis, which cost about the same, take better photos, have a much much much better battery life, and are actually INSTANT. Sure it's fun to have pictures that are stickers (it's not easy to get the photo off the adhesive paper, FYI), and the printomatic can take some really artsy photos once you have spent tons of money on film and thrown away tons of trash photos learning how get the thing to utilize lighting properly etc, but then once I got that figured out it started taking all my photos off-center! I no longer know where to aim the camera so now I have to relearn that. The button is too easy to accidentally press and I have hit it so many times and taken idk how many pics of the inside of the camera bag, if is ridiculous. I could never in good conscience recommend this camera to anyone"
"If your pictures are coming out all orange and blurry, get a micro SD card and update the drivers from the Kodak site.Are the pictures perfect after? No.Are they an improvement? Yes.Would I buy this camera again? No.Does it work well enough for a little kid? Yes.It takes more energy to return it and find a new one. It works well enough for kids. I know photos can be sharper because I print photos on a mini printer with the same paper. My phone photos still come out better."
"These are cute, but the photos are really small and not all that sharp. I like the fact the photos have sticky backs, so the can be used as stickers, but with so many kids with access to cell phone cameras, the quality of the photo becomes a factor. Also, you are always having to buy more film. Not sure my grandchildren are using these gifts much. I wish the photos were of better quality and a bit larger. This camera only takes a better picture of up close things like faces, flowers, etc."
I got this camera because I'm going to be traveling and I have a notebook and I'm so fun to be able to print the pictures and have the sticky back but all of my pictures are extremely overexposed I'm really bummed you can't control whether the flash is on or off it just decides when it's going to go on and off.
"It is such a cute camera and it is a great size. Got it as a gift, the picture quality is not good at all. I wished it would print better pictures."
"I do love this thing but I have some issues with it for what I needed it for. I bought this for my photo guestbook at my reception and it is a little too complicated for first time users. It beeps twice when you press the button and you can’t move or your picture will be blurry. It would be better if it was only one beep and it wouldn’t confuse people. Then having to have someone load the film ever so often, which is fine, but again, not fast enough for the guest book purpose. Then since so many people were using it the camera pretty much stopped working all together, it was about five pictures behind from printing the one we needed at the time and a lot of them did not print. All in all it’s still a cool camera and I will keep it for trips and such, but not good enough to use for a fast paced guest book."
"So please take my review with a grain of salt. Unpacked it, very easy to figure out. No instructions needed. First three 'tests' photos came out very very slowly but in focus, quality of photo is not as we see advertised but good enough and will serve my purpose. What I did not read before I purchased nor saw when I went looking for it today after reading in the booklet that we need, "" Connect a compatible micro USB cable and charger, 1amp or greater to the camera"". This should be offered, or it should come with the camera period. This is my only issue with this purchase THUS far. I got the yellow, thought it was orange because I didn't pay attention. Had I known it was yellow I would've gone with pink or blue. Oh well. Small dislike. No biggy.UPDATE: The first time I used this camera (upon arrival) was to try it out and used three sheets. Supposed to come with 10 sheets. Today (03/08/22) used this camera for the second time and only got 2 prints (total of 5)! Cheated out 5 sheets. Also the camera kept turning off in-between the two prints because I guess it needs to be charged and no USB was included. Feeling a bit cheated and big time irritated as it's too late to return it."
"Bought for my girlfriend expecting since she loves taking pictures. She loves it, but I was expecting a little more for the price. Realistically this camera should only be $45. The pictures are super grainy and faded. It's advertised as rustic or old fashioned, but its just dimmed, grainy, and low quality. Also if you don't hold super still for the picture, you end up looking like the flash mid-run. Again, she likes it, I just was expecting a lot more for the price."
"I know that KODAKs have a history of overexposure for their polaroid but I didn't except for the images to be as washed out as they were. It was even worse then the original polaroid. I do not recommend you buy this if you want clear pictures at all. However, if you are doing a murder mystery play/dinner you could totally use this camera to take old timey poor evidence pictures for guests to take home."
"I just used to once, because I tried to use again and it got paper jammed and I am having a hard time finding support by Kodak!"
"It’s fun, and cute but the pictures take forever to print and you must not move to get a good picture I wouldn’t recommend it for mothers who want their children to sit and look beautiful and can’t!"
"Pictures aren't great-- which is fine since we got it for our 7 year old son-- but it did not come with the case or strap which matters a LOT more for a kid.Would be a great gift for a kid with all listed items-- he loves the photo album, stickers, and markers!"
"I got this as a nice little Valentine's Day present for my partner and me to take photos of us out on unique date night activities. The first few test photos were okay, but we quickly got annoyed and have since put it away entirely.Generally speaking, the camera is awkward to use/hold. I read other reviews saying that this camera doesn't have the ability to turn off the flash, which I thought was totally fine. We'll make it work and have that ""natural"" element to it. The flash quickly washed me out of every photo we took together; I know I'm white, but damn...After about a week of usage, the viewport no longer aligned with what the camera was taking a photo of. You'd center an object, and after waiting a few minutes for the image to print, you'd get the corner of the ""centered"" image. So we just took a few abstract 'artsy' style photos. We will not be recommending this or refilling the film anytime in the future.We'll be sticking to the traditional [film] cameras from now on."
"Better off using cellphone camera, the quality comes out blur and old school I do not like this thing"
I thought I’d like the whole idea of the Polaroid however the quality of the prints are terrible. I’m not sure if it’s the point that they want it to look like the old Polaroid pic but it’s def not the quality I hoped.
"Have yet to take one picture that turns out clear, 20 pictures later."
"I ordered this as a Christmas gift for both my son and my nephew. I was disappointed with the poor picture quality. The camera has to be held perfectly still to get a good shot otherwise it's blurry. I thought it was because they are 10 and fidgety so I tried but I couldn't get a nice clear shot either. For the price, I would have expected better."
"Like the person describing ""chaos"", I had the same experience.  I purchased it for my kids 10th birthday party at the skating rink.  I thought what fun it would be to snap photos with her friends all night. However, the night was filled with not understanding which button to press, heads being cut off, not knowing when or if the photo would print from both adults and kids. I had to let go of the dream because I didnt want to continue to spend our two hour booking dealing with the camera. Also the paper is super hard to find. I had issues even getting the paper before her birthday. The first shipment got lost. I reordered it.Yes, I was driven about this plan I had. Anyways, it was a huge disappointing flop over here not to mention alot of wasted time and effort."
"The camera was just as I expected looks great. However, the quality of the pictures are not that great at first I thought it was just a bad film but when IThey camera was just as I expected looks great. However, the quality of the pictures are not that great at first I thought it was just a bad film but when I purchase another one, it’s just the camera."
"The camera itself is very cute. The photos come out like grainy 90’s Polaroids, which can be a vibe if that’s what you’re looking for. Big thing: the viewfinder only centers correctly when used vertically. If you take a snap holding the camera the “classic” way, the view is low and way off center. Still cute for some aesthetic fun at a party or something like that, but you absolutely will not get quality pictures."
My kids love this camera but the film compartment broke after two uses. Contacted seller twice and no resolution yet. Hopefully for good customer service.
"The expectations was so high, maybe.The paper is too small and the camera get stucked very easily.5 pictures, 3 paper jams.Note that I am using the original Zink paper."
"I bought this for my daughter because it is one of the few that will take color photos, but it’s almost impossible to line up your shot. The eye hole does NOT line up with lens! You have to guess where the lens is actually pointed, because it’s not where you’re looking through the viewfinder. We’re trying to aim a little down and a little to the right to compensate for this, but to me it’s is a huge problem. Especially for a camera!"
"Camera came in perfect shape, with all included items. My only complaint is that it photographs off-center and cuts off the top half of your pictures. Very cute item, and functional if you position the thing you want to photograph in the lower right hand corner of the box. Slightly annoyed, and sometimes a hassle, especially since the film is costly and I've wasted much film forgetting to position the thing in the lower right hand corner. Very cute though, with pretty decent photo quality!"
"The only reason im not kicking myself for buying this is bc 1. It was on sale 2. Its just a back up for my polaroid snap, during a small event.Cons:* as mentioned in other reviews you gave to buy a charging cable separately* the battery cover is annoyingly hard to get back in* takes a lot longer than the Snap to print a picture* the snap has slightly better picture qualityPros:* its a lot cheaper than some of the other cameras like the Polaroid Snap* it does its job take picture and prints within a few minutes* compatible with the zink photo paper so I didnt have to get 2 different types of paper or film. (For just needing a simple back up camera this sealed the deal for me, when trying to decide)"
I haven't decided if I'm gonna try and return it but I'm definitely getting a lot of blurry photos. I've tried taking a bunch of random photos and most just come out blurry
Not the best quality pictures but It’s still pretty cool to have a Polaroid and to have pictures print instantly.
Tried so many solutions to get better photos and nothing worked. The color is off.
It consistently moves out of register during the printing process. We have tried centering properly and it will take a picture of other things. It’s just because it’s super low quality product (physical camera) and pictures (worse than 80s Polaroids). It’s fun to have it print right there but I would stick with a real Polaroid or the Fuji one. It’s worth a little extra for those cameras because the film costs the same no matter the quality.
Bought this as a cheaper alternative to the Polaroid cameras on the market and wishing I would have just bought the more expensive cameras because every photo with this is super overexposed.Does it work? Yes. Is it novel? Yes. Is it fun? Yes. Is it quality? No.
It's very good for like a one time use but you can't video and you can't view the picture unless you print it
Daughter wanted a camera that printed pictures. Taking the pictures has had a bit of a learning curve. She was surprised to find that the pictures were really stickers. The clarity of the pictures is rough and the lighting. Sometimes they are very washed out. Most of the time the pictures are blurry. Fun gift but not a great quality of pictures.Will likely be forgotten shortly but it was a fun couple weeks being used.
"This is a neat little camera and I like the quality of the picture for what they are. It's super light and easy to use. You do have to be careful framing the shot but they indicate that in the instructions so fair enough. BUT...The picture button is seriously flawed and seems designed to waste film. I pressed it for a test picture. It played a little tune which I assume meant it took a picture. But there was no other indication and it didn't print for quite some time so I took another picture. It played a tune. And I waited. It eventually printed both pictures. I put the camera down. Picked it up, and fat fingered another picture.Long story short, the button presses too easily and has no rim protection to prevent accidental shots. And although it's probably a pro that it can take multiple shots before waiting for printing to finish, it's a learning curve. I'd give it at least another star if they protected the shoot button (and power button) and added a couple second delay to prevent double shots.Lastly, even for a simple camera with simple instructions, they are lacking. Does the camera auto power off? They don't say. What do the indicator lights on the back mean? Does red mean its charging or charged? Blinking versus non blinking. Simple things, overlooked, that I have to figure out through trial and error."
Poor photo quality ended up purchasing a different camera
"Purchased w of these cameras for my 6 and 8 year old neices for Christmas. They both took pictures and when the photos came out they looked vintage. We then tried them thinking it's the lighting or the way they took it, and it still came out the same. Other than that, they are having a blast creating little memories for their photo album I bought each if them."
"Cute camera. It's a nice size (not klunky to carry around). I bought it for my daughter (I don't recommend this camera for kids). The picture paper gets jammed continuously. We were only able to successfully print one photo. We wanted to like it, but unfortunately winded up returning the camera. Seems like it would have been a headache to deal with in the long run. I agree with the other comments on how easy it is to take accidental pictures."
"We bought this for vacation photos only to scrapbook. We used it on one trip in April and by the end of the trip we noticed some issues. We did not use it again until recently on a trip in November. It was faulty the entire trip. I wish we could get a replacement to see if it is just a defective camera, but will check reviews to see if others have experienced this.I thought I posted this review awhile ago but apparently failed to hit send.We took this on yet another trip and this time could not get it to work at all (prior times we messed around with it enough to get some photos). The photo paper just jams now. In the past the issues have been that it doesn’t pull in the photo or that it turns off while processing even when fully charged. I have wasted a ton of money on photo paper that gets ruined too. I honestly think we just got a defective camera and that sucks because we love the concept and my kid was bummed every time."
"I bought my first camera (different series than this one) a few years ago and it still works great. I bought for my son’s graduation and used it for people to take pictures and used to make a guest book.  We had another graduation this May and decided to buy another camera to do the same to make a guest book for the next kid.When I received the package with the new camera it looked like the box the camera came in was opened and the film was loaded and where you put the paper in the back didn’t seem to close all the way. I took a few pictures and they looked like they were overexposed. I sent it back (by the way customer service was fantastic) and they sent me a new camera the next day. I opened up the new camera and the paper wasn’t loaded and it also had a cord to charge it. The first camera they sent didn’t come with a cord to charge and the paper was already placed in the camera. So it makes me wonder if I received someone’s returned camera.  I wish could have found the same type of camera I bought a few years ago, it worked perfect and kids loved taking the pictures."
"The photos I took have the analog look of an instant camera that I love, but this camera is super glitchy. My first one quit taking photos entirely after two days, and when I used the manufacturer’s instructions to clean inner roll, the paper jammed inside. I was fortunately able to get it exchanged, and the new one has been fine thus far. (Although I didn’t have the camera for the rest of my vacation, which was the whole reason I bought it.) One of the features I do like is that you can reload an already exposed photo and get a double exposure. (The last photo I shared is a double exposure of the beach and upside down mountains.)"
Received the camera this morning. I bought it to photograph my dahlias quickly to put on their tuber storage boxes for quick view finding.I practiced all day and evening in different lighting. The color is terrible with the printed photos.  I first thought it might be the film in the starter pack but I had ordered 2 new boxes of 50 sheets.I tried film from both boxes . Still the same bad color.I was so hoping this was going to be an easy way to know what I have stored but because the color was so bad it defeated the purpose!
"Iv had this camera for about a 4 or 5 days. I opened it, charged it for a few hours and put the firm in it. The first night I went to a football game and put the camera in my bag. When I took the camera out to take pictures with it unfortunately it said the battery was dead. The second night that I had the camera, I went to a friend’s house. When I took the camera out to take pictures with it the film was getting stuck halfway in the camera, so I took all the film out of the camera and put a whole new pack in, unfortunately it’s still was doing the same thing the film is getting stuck halfway. Also, the camera does not stay charged for not that long at all. When I say, I have tried everything to get this camera to work, I HAVE TIRED EVERYTHING!"
"This was a gift for Xmas for my 9 year old. She freaking loves it.I do not.Prints are 0.50 cents each. Said 9 year old blew threw 100 in 4 days.Prints are blurry and terrible. Color is whack. Sometimes prints streaky. It’s basically like a 1970 Polaroid, but in 2021.No micro USB cord. Luckily we have a billion but this surprised us.No instructions. Yes, it’s point and shoot, but what do the beeps mean? Is the first beep when it takes? Is the second beep when it takes the photo? Is the first when it focuses and the second when it captures? These details would be helpful in trying to get an image that isn’t blurry.All that said.If you have a 9 year old girl, they will love it. Highlight of Christmas for her. Just lower your expectations way way down as a parent. It’s not your camera. But it lives up to the hype and is super fun if you’re 9!"
"I would not recommend this camera - you cannot turn the flash off and no matter what, peoole are backlit. The actual photo is a good 2.5 secs behind you pressing the button (I'm sure this is related to the flash which I already complained about). Candid photos are impossible - they notice the light of a thousand suns flash, turn or move in some other way, and then the photo is taken. Finally, the frame on the eyepiece doesn't seem true to what prints. All in all it's really hard to get a good photo with it. The photo paper quality is fine."
If over exposed and super fuzzy photo is what your looking for this will do the job.
"This is a great starter camera.  Quick to print, easy to use, doesn't smudge easy- if at all.  As far as picture quality- if you're wanting something as good as or better than your iphone, this is NOT it."
"Doesn’t focus pictures, you can’t zoom in and out, very limited use. Save your money and get a better camera when you can afford it."
"This camera produces fair-quality pictures if you take the picture outdoors, if you are extremely still, and if the subject is extremely still. I bought one as did my mom. We both experienced the same issues:1. Paper occasionally gets stuck...won't pull out of the camera.2. Directions for loading paper can be seen--with a magnifying glass--and even then they are comprehensibly unclear.3. The button for taking photos is located in the standard place, but due to the fact that the photo is taken with a quick push of the button rather than holding it down for a couple of seconds, hitting the button occurs often, which means that you've just taken a photo of the ground, or your shirt...wherever it happens to be pointing when you accidentally pushed the button. This can be expensive.4. There is no ""film empty"" indicator, so just when you think you clicked a great shot...oops! No film!Good Points:1. The camera is compact and clean-looking.2. The sticky back feature is great."
They run out fastAlso images kinda low quality
"My dad is a simple man. He still uses the disposable cameras that you get developed. in a world full of technology he just cant keep up. My mom takes photos on her phone and he wanted to be able to do the same - without a smart phone. this is great because of it's simple design and instant satisfaction factor, however the photos aren't the best and its a small learning curve for him. I love the nostalgic and old-school look of the instant photos but you have to make sure you don't move or its blurry, which is sort of - to be expected in my opinion. But i also love the option to install an SD card in case they don't print right! I'm hoping after a few more uses we get the hang of it!"
"Something that the marketing does not inform you of is even though a picture can be printed and saved to a micro SD, you are completely unable to print an already saved image. The main purpose I bought this camera for was to take pictures with another person, and then being able to share two physical copies of the photo.The print speed isn't the fastest, and the image quality isn't particularly good, but considering I bought this for the novelty of handing out photos, I wasn't really bothered by those factors. You're definitely better off getting an instant printer compatible with your phone, and using that instead. The picture quality will be better, you can actually print multiples of the same photo, and you can just print a saved image.This is a toy camera marketed as a real camera, do not purchase for anything you actually want pictures of, and instead gift it to a child who will waste the five shots that come in the box on pictures of grass, and then spend too much money on Zink refills for the child."
"i was so excited for this camera. it worked fine for the first 15 photos, then randomly stopped working and constantly makes a noise as if it’s running. before it quit working, it would also randomly take photos after i turned it off. i’m disappointed that i spent money on this"
"We received the 5mp camera instead of the 10mp camera - according to reviews this has happened to other people as well. Thought it could be user error but obviously it's not. Other customers have had the same issues (pink-shaded images, blurry pictures, extremely poor quality). It seems this version simply doesn't print good quality pictures and did not come with a charging cord, although the cord is a simple micro USB cable. We were disappointed.  Looking at 10mp reviews it seems that camera produces better quality prints. 10mp also comes with 3 distinguishing lights in the bottom left corner of the back panel and the option to print in black & white. Got in contact with Amazon product support (after going through another product) and was able to get a full refund.Explanation given - the option which includes the camera ONLY is 5mp while the bundle lists a 10mp camera - I've seen other reviews which refer to the 10mp with excellent photo quality, option to switch to B&W photos, etc. If that is what you are looking for - pay attention & select the bundle."
"I don’t know what I was expecting but for $50, it wasn’t much. So I was pleasantly surprised when I first used it. I will say, it’s not as good as a Polaroid camera or those Instax Minis bc I have both. But they both also cost more, so like with all things: You get what you pay for.  And there’s a learning curve using the camera indoors bc the lighting is hard to get right. It’s also not as “instant/fast” as the Polaroids. But, they’re nice for what they are: a cheap printable camera you can take places and not get all upset if it’s lost or stolen. Oh and the flash is absolutely worthless. Maybe if used in pitch black it comes out okay, but normal use made my face look like I was a Geisha, lol."
it will stop printing out the paper when it gets low. i missed the return window. man...
"Pictures are not clear, over exposed, blurry and color saturation off a lot. If this was $22 it would be worth it because it's more like a child quality picture. I am only keeping it because it does the job for kids birthday party souvenir picture but if for anything else STAY AWAY from it get another brand."
Not sure how I feel about this. The pic isn’t that great. Clarity is cloudy
"Size is good; quality is okay, it froze the 3 picture e tried to take, had to let it die. The photo frame is off and I wish you could choose If your wanted to print or not; trying to take pictures of kids is hard"
Very cheap for the price. Wouldn't buy again
"This is one of the worst cameras I’ve ever bought and I bought my kiddo a no-name brand $20 one previously that was much much better. It over-exposes and the framing is off. Has zero useful functions. You’re better off buying a Polaroid camera, which is what I should have done.  Kodak has zero option to return these via Amazon."
"The camera description stated it came with a power cord and the box it came in (original mfg box) listed the same but there was no power cord in the box. I had seen some previous reviews that complained about this but decided to buy the camera anyway. To be clear the power cord is a standard USB type used by other digital cameras, e-readers, and a host of digital devices. Easy to purchase at any Wal-Mart. Having said that though, without the cord you can't use the camera right out of the box and the price you are paying assumes the cord is include and you don't have to run out and but another cord just to make the camera work. I think these units might be a run of rejects from Kodak who knew the cords did not make the box. This seller may or may not have know that but from previous reviews and stated returns I have to believe it may have been know. So I won't be purchasing from this buyer on Amazon again."
"The camera itself is very pretty, and the fact that it doesn’t use ink is wonderful! Just because of that I can forgive the not-so-great picture quality, also ‘cause the paper has a sticky back so I can paste the pics on my scrapbook. What I don’t like about the camera is that it’s not very user friendly. It takes a couple tries to figure out how to use it because the noise that it makes when the picture is taken is not very different from the noise it makes when you push the button, so you may think that the picture was taken when it actually wasn’t or you may stay there awkwardly ‘cause you think that the picture hasn’t been taken when it actually has."
"I’m not the biggest fan of this tbh. It was difficult for people to take “selfies” with it, the pictures did not turn out the greatest. It was just a disappointment if anything. Not worth it."
"I was really excited about getting this camera for my boys (ages 7 and 9) to document their summer. While the concept is great, we have run into all sorts of problems. I understand that when you put new paper in the camera, it has to calibrate the printer. It’s supposed to do that one time, with the blue sheet from the film package, however often, it ends of sending out the calibration page, as well as 2-3 more sheets of blank photo paper.  This is super frustrating for my kids, because often we don’t know if the photo they just took will actually print, and it takes a good minute or two for it to spit out the random blank sheets. At that point either the moment they wanted to take a photo of has passed, or they have just moved on to something else. The print quality of the photos isn’t great, but they don’t seem to mind that since they are only putting them in their summer journals. If the camera would print consistently, this would be a lot more fun for us to use."
"I had high hopes for this because I own the kodak smile and it uses the same zink paper, it’s cheaper than fujifilm or polaroid, and the backs become stickers, this model however is just bad, it feels cheap and It’s not very sturdy, the photos came out blurry all the time and it takes forever to charge. It’s just not a great product and i wouldn’t recommend this to anyone"
"I do like this little camera and the sticker prints. So fun for post cards or journals... the quality isn't great and you have to stand really close to the object otherwise it will be tiny in the photo, but it does a reasonably good job and you can make a scrapbook the old fashion way."
"I bought this for a trip and although I got a lot of cute fotos, it came with a long trial and error process. It’s difficult to get the lighting right so that the picture comes out good. On top of that it would often stop functioning for no reason and it’s hard to tell what’s wrong with it, a lot of the times it was just a matter of waiting."
Wasting a lot of film because camera will not hold charge and then camera spits out film without developing photo.
I bought this to use for my kids’ nature journals. We’re avid nature journalers and it’s been nice to snap pictures of where we are and affix the photos to the pages. It’s fiiiiiine for that. The picture quality depends on the natural lighting and the one I have seems to jam up a bit.  I also can’t get the back on to be completely flush.All in all— it’s fiiiiiiine for what we use it for. I’d recommend checking out another brand though… I feel the price point is a bit high considering the overall feel and quality.
I have the Orriginal instax camera and a mini zinc printer from HP and had high hopes for this - as I really enjoy the HP mini printer. The camer is very thin plastic and didn’t even come with a charging chord.Santa was supposed to have delivered this camera to my u believing daughter - and unfortunately it didn’t help his case.She couldn’t even use it on Christmas Day!The photos also come out blurry even in bright daylight and there is no way to adjust shutter speed.
"I bought this camera for my Nephew for his birthday. He was super excited about it and could barely wait to use it. After we charged it, I removed the back panel to insert the film and the panel would not close completely again. I tried everything, but eventually settled on getting it as tight as possible because I didn't want to break the camera. After that, probably about 8/10 pictures printed with about 1/2 to 1/4 of it white. It eventually started printing pictures correctly, thankfully I bought him additional film, but that didn't last long. After having it about a week, the pictures started printing odd colors or with white spots in them, so he has pretty much stopped using it after only having it 2 weeks. The camera and the film are too expensive to be of such low quality. I wouldn't recommend it"
"The camera is made kind of cheaply. I bought this for my 9yr old son and hes already done something to it that it won't close back all the way when replacing the film. Plus the pictures are not that great of quality. Like there's a flash when it's not needed and it makes the pictures look awful. Compared to a Instamax camera (I think that's what its called) which I have one for my daughter.. the Instamax is better quality all around. Durability and better picture quality. Sorry, I hate to leave bad reviews:( bc everything is just made so cheap anymore and its most likely not the sellers fault for the quality.. so I apologize. I still need to tell the truth for the next buyer though."
I wish this came with more film slips ! Quality of the picture isn’t quite like what was advertised.
"Pros:  this product definitely captures the spirit of the moment as you can take a snapshot and print it immediately. Also the zink paper technology is awesome and is plastic coated, smudge proof, and has a sticky back. There’s no toner needed as the technology is built into the paper, and the printer heats the paper to produce the image.Camera includes a micro SD card slot to store photosCons: sadly the optics for the camera are not great and the picture quality is Meh 😑I wish that Kodak would put out a better quality product that had a sensor and optics worthy of the Kodak name- I am giving the camera to a teenager as a graduation gift for the “fun” aspect of using it.I think that the printer portion of the product is great but the weakness of the camera lens makes this more of a toy than a serious photography tool.Personally I find that using my mobile phone with just a stand alone zink printer yields a much better quality print"
it was easy to use and I love that it has the sticker backing. The quality of the photos is obviously not super great but I know that. My issues with the product are that I was under the impression that the camera came with 25 photo sheets. I was only able to get 5 pics and now I already need to buy more paper. That on top of the fact that it doesn’t come with a charger is really annoying. Be sure to get extra paper
"View finder seems off. Pulling to my right, but maybe my glasses.  Took two very washed out photos of my husband in my dining room as the setting sun was filtered into the room thru the trees in our side yard.  Disappointed in the blurry quality of the photos! Flash came on. Outside photos of my cat a little better. Still blurry compared to digital iPhone 13 shots. May improve some the more used. First phots my have been off because of glasses. Outside shots were taken without glasses. Better centering. Will probably send back this camera.Since I have much better photo taking tools. Had hoped to give it to my great niece and had bought two. One to try. One for gift. Looks like both will be returned. Too bad. Would be great first camera for child though or a young preteen."
"It’s hard to lead the paper honestly.  Meaning I loaded it, took a picture and then it prints with a white edge.  So I turn it off back on and it’s fine.  So that wasted a pic.  Then you have to hold the camera REALLY still for it to be halfway decent.  And then hold the button until you hear it take the pic.  I think that they should just bring back the old school one.  Shake the photo and call it a day."
"This camera did not work at all, and the image quality is truly awful. Even though we carefully centered the images in the little frame that pops up, the photos were completely off center. People's heads were cut off in the photos; we ended up with pictures of people's arms and crotches instead. Those images were all extremely blurry and grainy.Also, the camera took a whole day to charge; every time the green ""charge"" light came on, we pressed the power button, but the camera would not turn on and the red ""not charged"" light would come back on. The back compartment also would not close. Unfortunately, I waited until the return window closed to test this waste of money."
"The print and picture quality for the KODAK Printomatic made me miss the polaroid cameras of old, which were much easier to line up for spontaneous photos and seemed far more superior in quality. The zink paper also jams frequently, and only holds a limited amount, so by the time you are done reloading the paper and setting up the shot, there's a good chance you won't even get the picture you tried to set up so perfectly in the moment."
"Purchased for my daughter as a birthday gift and it's just not worth the money. Yes it works. But the pictures are always blurry, even if I do it, u have to make sure you are SUPER still. And they always come out looking over exposed.She still likes to play with it. But for the price to keep buying film for crappy photos it's not worth it. Just hope to save the next person....."
"We have fun with this camera. We use it with the Adventure Challenge books where you take a photo. First of all, it's a fun little camera and does what it is supposed to do: produce instant pictures. Secondly, don't expect hi-res pics. They are small and the quality of the image is average.But, if you want a fun little camera and are not too worried about producing world-class photos -- but rather fun, instant photos of date nights... it's a great camera."
This was a gift for my daughters 8th birthday. She has had very little experience taking pictures with a camera but she was able to easily take pictures the problem is that the coloring is way off and the subject of the photo was always cut off. I chalked it up to user error thinking she is still learning to use a camera. After repeatedly having the same outcome with every picture I decided to try it myself and took a picture of her and made sure I had her centered in the image box on the camera. The picture came out and she was partly cut off. Again I thought maybe I just moved a little so I decided to take a picture of a Lego set and had the camera sitting on the table so it couldn’t move at all. The picture came out and again the it was cut off and the coloring is way off. What a piece of junk. I added pictures to show how it’s cutting it off and the coloring. The first picture is a picture of what I took the picture of. The second picture I had taken my iPhone and taken a picture through the lens of the Kodak camera to show that the area with the frame around it is exactly around the Lego set and yet it’s still cut off. Don’t buy this camera unless you want a worthless camera that cuts off your subjects and turns the colors way off.Our older daughter has an Instax and we should have just gone with the same one for our younger daughter. So disappointed.
"The slide of the back of the camera does not click into place , the tab appears to not have a gap allowing it to grab maybe a production issue."
"some of the picture come out bad, some come out really good. I feel like when the flash is used the picture doesn’t come out well but if you want that old camera photo look then buy it. I just got it to scrap book ☺️"
"We were looking to get an instant camera for our son to use during a recent vacation and were torn between this one at the Instax.Settled on this for the cost savings, but it's not worth it - it's confusing to use, slow to take the picture, inconvenient to carry around, and the flash WILL NOT TURN OFF even in the daytime, so all the pictures are overdeveloped and bleached. Our son actually asked to leave it in the hotel room after the first day.DO NOT BUY."
The quality could be way better!
Cute concept but pictures come out very blurry.
"It's about the simplest polaroid-like camera out there. The lens is off center on mine, so what I point it as, isn't what I get a picture of exactly. The quality of the photos is low, they aren't bad, but they're far from good.It's more gimmicky nostalgia than useful."
This can be a fun camera…but expect to have yo take multiple photos before you get a shot you like.Is what it is. A novelty
"Nice starter digital camera,  high zoom and a simple operation. But, Iike other reviewers  I found the issues with the autofocus to be true.  I take about 3 shoots per subject and find at least one that looks good. High zoom seems to require more shots to get a good pic.  At this price it was worth the hassle of taking multiple shots of your subject."
"I received the camera. Charged the battery, set up the menu and took some pictures. Decided to update the software just in case. That went fine until the update was done. Then the camera turned off and would not turn back on. I am returning and will try again.From setting up and those few pictures, I can tell you the menu was easy to use. the buttons make sense.  It is very, very lightweight. I would get extra batteries because it will probably pull a lot of power since there is no viewfinder and the display will always be on. Also, doesn't come with a battery charger, but does come with a cord and a USB wall plug.It was impossible to see the display in bright light. Will have to see if there is a way to turn up the brightness."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This camera does not record usable video. Unless you have a tripod and you don’t even walk near it, I’d compare it to a video cam from the early 2000’s. But really, for the price the outside shell just feels cheap and it just looks cheaply made (in person). I did a lot of research on this camera and it looked fairly decent on camera but once you hold it, it just feels like junk. The included video was recorded at 9.2x zoom and it just won’t focus, and if it does it loses the object soon after. It also only zooms in segments, after 9.2x it went to 12.4x or something close to that no in between. And the zoom dial was reversed on my camera, don’t know if they all come like that but mine did. We just ended up putting this camera down and using my phone and WAY got better video.If you need a video camera, just use your phone. My old iPhone 6 probably recorded better than this, and probably more stable. But if you’re only taking photos, this camera is decent. The photo included was only clear because I had to lean the camera on my truck or a solid surface. And then after about 15-20 photos I got that.I ended up getting a Canon EOS R50 and boy is there a difference. Got it used for $400 and it just blows this thing out of the park. Thought I could save a little money, but I would just steer clear of this camera."
"The camera itself works great! I'm sure it would make a good daily use camera for the amateur photographer. I unfortunately cannot recommend the texture of the body of the camera, though. The matte black sections of the camera have a texture akin to high-grit sandpaper, which unfortunately makes the entire thing unusable for me. Not sure if it was a one-off problem with the unit I received or if all of them are like this, but I will be returning the one that I received and replacing it with a re-order of my beloved PIXPRO AZ421 (which I originally bought in 2016; it has since died, hence the need to replace it)."
"Right after I purchased this through amazon from adorama, I saw it advertised from another large (wm) box store for $40 less, but adorama would not honor any lower price guarantee."
"What they don’t tell you is, you can’t do hardly anything without a memory card when it comes to the Wi-Fi so buy memory also"
"Ordered this for my wife to take pictures of birds in our yard using a lens hood and UV filter (both must be purchased separately).  It has not been used indoors.  The major problem with this camera is the lack of a viewfinder.  Pictures must be set up using the small LCD screen on the back of the camera.  Unfortunately, when you use the camera outside, the screen shows your own reflection looking back at you and you can't see what you are aiming at. I contacted Kodak customer service to see if anything could be done about this: perhaps a non-reflective coating that could be applied to the screen.  This was their reply:  ""...when hit with sunlight the screen will look black and the only thing you can do is hover your hand over the top of the camera to keep the sun from hitting the LCD screen before pressing the shutter button.""  Unless you have 3 hands or are using a tripod this is an unworkable solution.  The shutter and zoom controls are on the right side of the camera so you hold the camera on the right.  You need to steady the camera with your left hand when the zoom is extended because the camera becomes front heavy.  Using this camera is like standing in a crowd and holding your cell phone over your head to try to take a picture of something you can't really see.  Sometimes you get a good picture, most times you don't.  It's not point and shoot - it's guess and hope."
After a few uses I find that it is a good camera but the main reason I purchased it was to have a burst mode. While it does have one the screens turns off while shooting so no way to follow the moving subject while it shoots. Really not helpful
The User Manual is not organized in a logical manner. It can take hours to understand the many camera options . The options are great but understanding how to use them is very difficult.
"I purchased this camera against my better judgement. I was going on a trip to Egypt and just wanted a solid point and shoot camera, I just wanted a basic camera that would not take a bunch of fiddling with shutter speeds, and other settings... Another reason I purchased this camera is because the Nikon and Canon point and shoot camera's would not have arrived because before i left.This camera's auto focus is so bad that i put it down and used my phone instead. It took horrible ambient photos and the auto focus was blurry.... the comments said the same thing, but, i was desperate for a decent camera.... Again, I thought how bad could a Kodak camera be? It was horrible. do not buy it."
"Likes:1) The lens is very sharp2) Camera feels good in the hand, and doesn't feel cheap (black model)3) Good features for the price4) Intuitive to useDislikes:1) Autofocus performance is very poor, especially at longer focal lengths. I returned the camera because of this one fault. Too bad because the lens is fantastic.2) Would prefer RAW support."
"This camera was not worth the hassle. I spent $222 on because it promised WiFi. I could never get the connection to work. I called support and was told, they were working on it and give it 7-10 days. I called back and was told, it’s still not working. So I decided to return the camera. I was disappointed because Kodak being a household name should be operating so much better than this. So bottom line, don’t waste your money or your time with this one."
This camera reviews has to be a joke. The lighting for shooting videos fluctuates and there's no way to set the light to where you want it! It's not worth the money! One of the bad investments for me!
"Returned. Camera was not new, though so stated it was."
The display is useless as a viewfinder in bright light. It had problems taking a photo scene at sundown. When it works it takes good photos.
"This camera looks and feels like good quality, but unfortunately the image quality is fairly disappointing. For 'standard' photos where you're within 20 feet or so of whatever you're taking a photo of, any modern smartphone will take a clearer photo (see comparison attached between this camera and my iPhone, taken from about 10 feet away in normal daylight conditions). The KODAK PixPro's photo looks okay from an initial look, but if you were to print the photo at a large scale or zoom in at all, the photo very quickly becomes blurry.The 'auto' mode is fairly standard, you half-press the shutter button and it attempts to autofocus on the target, then full-press the button to take the photo. In playing with some of the other manual settings, I was not able to significantly improve the image quality over the 'auto' mode so I have continued to use the 'auto' mode since it is definitely most convenient. With my photo size and quality set to the highest levels, the photos are 3456 pixels by 4608 pixels (or 16 megapixels) but as mentioned before, the definition does not match that of an iPhone camera from short range.One thing that I found odd was that the camera did not include an SD card nor did it include full user manual (only a 'quick start guide' with a QR code to the user manual). The online user manual recommends purchasing a ""class 4 SD card from a name brand with 4GB to 32GB capacity,"" it also states that the camera is ""not compatible with Micro SD, Ultra, Ultra Plus, Extreme, or adapters for any of these other memory cards.""The limited SD card size is super odd - a camera that should be taking high quality photos (i.e. large files) only supporting small (less than 32GB SD cards) seems like a design flaw. Worry not though, I tested my camera with a three different SD cards: an 'approved' Sandisk 32 GB SD card, an 'unsupported' 64 GB 'Extreme' SD card, and an 'unsupported' 128 GB 'Ultra' SD card. All three flash cards worked just fine with no noticeable issues or image quality problems with the larger SD cards.This camera doesn't entirely fall flat of a smart phone camera, however. This thing has incredible optical zoom that would be great for sports, birding, and other hobbies. It also has some other 'fun' modes that work well (long exposure for firework photos, sport mode for fast-moving objects, etc).All in all, the image quality isn't the best but it does have some unique components that work well. If you're looking for a general-use camera, I would look elsewhere. If you're looking to take distant photos that require a lot of zoom without spending a lot more money on a camera, this may fit your needs."
"Pros, Likes, and Features*Easy to get set up and start to operate*Works better outdoors during daylight, not a good indoor camera and would NOT recommend for a indoor camera*Seems solid, no issue with the zoom or the powering on or off. Easy to charge, insert and remove battery and sd card***Cons, Dislikes*Only uses a 32gb SD card max*auto focus and auto flash don't work correctly. I had them on and the pictures would either come out too dark or they would come out good but the colors wouldn't look good. like Christmas pictures today the tree would be brown - it was a fake tree and the tree was green.*Not easy to use or figure out best settings for things - Being in auto mode does NOT help the situation*Would NOT recommend for a indoor camera*I have had cheaper cameras that did a way better job of taking photos than this, and that was 20 years ago - worse resolution only but the photos were bright and vivid just grainy. This the photos are dark, color challenged, and the resolution is much better. I would rather a grainy photo than a good resolution that the photo looks like crap anyways. Could not use this for Christmas - VERY DISAPPOINTED*Did not come with a storage case for the camera, also screen does not pull out or turn or anything. This is more like a higher resolution camera from the early 2000's - Just the pictures aren't worth keeping.*every time I take a picture there is a red light that distracts and then the picture takes and the outcome isn't as expected as when I pressed the shutter button.*Still looking for a good inexpensive easy to use camera - this is not it, and for a Kodak that really disappoints!"
"I enjoy photography, although I'll readily admit to being an amateur. My normal camera is a a mirrorless Lumix G-9, and while that isn't a particularly big or heavy camera, sometimes it is nice to have something even smaller and lighter. This camera is very compact and easy to carry. It takes great photos and videos, with an easy to use zoom, and a variety of useful photo modes and built in digital filters. Over all, I like the way this camera works, but there are a couple of quirks that I really dislike. The first is the lack of a view finder. While the display works well for framing shots under most circumstances, but when I'm outside on a bright, sunny day, the display is very difficult to see, which leaves me guessing about the framing of my shots. So, having a view finder would be helpful, or perhaps a display that was easier to see in bright light. The other issue I have is the placement of the video record button at the top right corner on the back of the camera. Because of the way I hold the camera, I find that I often end up accidently pressing the button with my thumb, recording video while I'm trying to frame and shoot photos. Because it isn't always easy to tell that it is recording, I find myself struggling with the camera, frustrated that I can capture the shots I want."
"This Kodak Pixpro takes some pretty fantastic photos if the lighting is right - I took two photos seconds apart, one with the flash and the other without It, and there is a very obvious difference in the overall photo quality. For the current set price I don’t feel like it’s a bad camera. My old cannon SD memory card fit it just fine which I was happy about. The settings are fairly simple to navigate and I haven’t really run into any serious issues thus far. Though the flash really Carry’s the win for photos taken on it."
This is good for someone that isn’t looking for high quality photos. It’s definitely grainy and the focus is lackluster. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone that has owned a higher quality camera as you would be disappointed.
"I wanted to love the camera, but my iPhone 14 Pro Max takes better pictures. The built quality is decent, made of hard plastic. The photos I took look more like an 8MP camera. There are no details in the pictures. I end up giving it as a gift to my niece. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this camera."
"Photos: Details on photo, bird nest zoomed all the way out then all the way in. Random snapshot in the yard.The zoom on this is incredible, and the I.S. works great - and you NEED I.S. when zoomed in. The combo of full auto and I.S. makes for some amazing zooms. I have a 1200 mm lens on my Canon camera and it does not come close to this zoom level.Photo quality is decent. Photos are 2.1 meg each. As a comparison, the ones from my Canon are 28 meg. So you're not getting the same quality - but this camera is literally 2% of the price of the Canon. In all honesty, I'm carrying this around with me - the big pro-level camera is just too big for daily carry, plus if I go to a sports game, concert, etc. this camera usually gets past the door. The big one never does.Timelapse saves a bunch of individual photos, not a video file.Downsides: It's all plastic, it's not a touch-screen, battery life is mediocre. It lasted about 175 photos. One reason is that there's no viewfinder - the rear screen is ALWAYS on. So for a timelapse, for example, it lasts just over two hours and 130 photos. That screen takes a lot of power.Only one battery is included, no CF card and no charger. The battery needs to charge in the camera. A micro-SD cable is included.For under $225 the camera is an amazing deal. But one caveat - I had a LOT of problems with it getting focus. It would focus, then lose focus. Constantly. To the point where it was often impossible to get a photo."
"Didn’t even get the chance to use this because it literally came broken. It didn’t work at all. Tried charging, and all the troubleshooting tasks that I could find. Nothing worked. Not worth it, if i could give zero stars i would"
Super disappointed waited over 2-3 weeks to arrived came in damaged. When I take picture a red light messed up all my pictures
"UPS picked up my camera early with another return, instead of the 3 days mentioned on return and moreover, I am Just waiting for my full refund now.Thank you,looking forward for my refund.You should of have the camera by now, Amazon."
"Bought this model for easy bird watching, but its Auto Focus never worked well.Not just never focusing on the moving targets (birds), even inactive ones, such as flowers, were unfocused when it zooms bigger than X10.You can find cheaper and more compact models with same zoom range.Finally, I got rid of this camera after only 2 months!"
NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE PICS OR VIDEO!
"super bummed after realizing one of the cameras was cracked open and potentially exposing the film inside. I received the package and clearly the box was damaged (as seen in photos attached), but I was hopeful the cameras were ok inside. I didn’t open the package until the night before my trip (which was my bad) at which time I learned one of the two cameras likely wouldn’t be usable due to the film possibly being exposed or other damage due to it being cracked. pretty bummed but hopefully the other one isn’t also damaged unknowingly..I haven’t developed it to know yet."
Pictures are GREAT! but it didnt have 27 shots as the packaging says.....
All of my photos came out dark. I had the flash on the entire time. Used for part of my wedding. Probably wouldn’t purchase again.
"Took pictures at a grandson’s baptism & one worked fine but the other had old or exposed film, very disappointed"
"I buy so many disposable cameras and have tons of scrapbooks throughout the years. I brought these on a trip to a bunch of Bahama Islands they came out horrible, discolored dark fuzzy. I was very disappointed."
"Pretty disappointed in this product. I’m not sure if I obtained a bad batch, but over 50% of the photos have been unusable. We bought a set of 12 as a gift for our friends wedding and we’re excited on the prospect of capturing the memories of their special day. There were many cameras that didn’t even register all the exposures (roughly 27 I believe) even though it was completely used up.  The photo lab tech was stating could have been due to faulty films.We spent hundreds of dollars on this product (not to mention the amount spent on developing unusable photos). Would not recommend and probably will not be buying again."
"I was excited to find a two pack, and bought them for graduation gifts for my twins. I was very disappointed to receive ONE large box that held the two cameras. So I had to give my twins two silver pouches that had no images or words to indicate what was in them. I don't understand why it would show two cameras and instead actually consist of a single twin pack. The cameras worked as they should. Also, they are ridiculously expensive. From $5 each to more than a nice pair of jeans lol"
"I ordered this June 3 as a prime member for an event June 14th. My delivery status just updated to June 15th. Very disappointed and not likely to purchase from this vendor again. 2 stars because exactly as described, just doesn’t ship timely."
Received box that only contained one camera instead of two. Unable to receive a refund or credit to account for the fact that I only received one camera instead of the advertised two.
"I bought this because I was on a hunt for a good disposable camera so that I can take it back to the old fashion way and enjoy the process of waiting to see the pictures that were taken and keeping the photos in a photo album for a very long time. I came across this one and it seemed to be the best choice with many/good reviews. However, I am actually very disappointed with this camera. I bought 4 packs therefore I have 8 disposable cameras right now and I regret buying so many all at once before trying one out and seeing how the photos develop before buying another. For the most part, on the box it said that the cameras that I purchased don't expire until August of 2017 (which I have no problem with) and when in use, everything worked perfectly. I had no issues with that. But once I finished one whole film and sent it in to get developed, after a few weeks, I received it and came back with at least 2/3 of the photos completely blacked out or so dark that you can't distinguish anything. The few pictures that did develop well looked nice however that was only about 3 or 4 pictures out of the 27 photos and I paid $12 for it to get developed with an additional $13.50 for the camera itself.... I was very excited to use disposable cameras and use it to capture memories and place it in an album that I can look back with my future family or my future kids can look at when I'm gone but unfortunately this disposable camera isn't worth all that money and time. I'd rather take pictures with my phone and get those photos printed out at costco or something.... Really disappointed that this didn't work out."
I bought these for my toddler daughters' Christmas stockings. I was hoping this wouldn't be the case but unfortunately most of the photos are overexposed and the majority of them couldn't even be developed. I got 8/27 on one camera and 9/27 on the other. Bummer.
Unfortunately these cameras came quite a bit beat up on the outside which can sometimes make the film not come out quite as well. Hoping the film will come out ok.
I wanted to take photos for my baby’s photo album of her gender reveal. When I went to get them developed the photos were completely dark. Out of the two cameras that I got developed about 5 pictures came out correct. So 5/44 pictures. I was pretty upset because those photos meant a lot to me and I don’t have any that I can make out. I wanted to like these but they didn’t work for me.
First one worked perfectly. Second camera the flash is broken. Most photos need flash to look good so kinda useless waste of money
"I placed cameras on each table at my daughter's wedding to capture memories. Several pictures on several cameras were blurry or dark.  On one roll, only one picture actually turned out.  I purchased five packs of two at $26.99 each.  At this price point, I expected much better quality.  Furthermore, it has cost me $10.00 per camera to develop the few good pictures on each camera.  Thank goodness for cell phones, because this special event cannot be recreated. :("
"We took these cameras on our family trip with us and the photos developed terribly. We’ve bought these cameras many times but have never purchased off Amazon. We were so excited to get our pictures back and they were all very black and you couldn’t see much. They said there was an error with the cameras, and that’s why they didn’t develop right…bummer. We also spent 40$ getting them developed and they all turned out terrible. Buy in person! They said it can happen from rough transport or extreme heat. Would recommend purchasing at the store!"
"Was really excited to develop my disposable cameras which were used to document my daughter and nieces first birthday party, but every single picture came out completely black. On both cameras purchased. The lady at the photo department told me this happens a lot of times when the disposable camera is sitting around and since I had just ordered the 2pack of disposable cameras from Amazon a week before the party, it’s clear that the camera was sitting around in the warehouse for too long and no longer functions properly. The return window passed. Don’t waste your time with this."
"Bought these for my daughter’s first birthday. Just had them developed and 4 out of 100 came out. All of them were black, fuzzy, and unrecognizable. I’m seeing other reviews of others bought around the same time frame touting the same issue and they may have been sitting in a warehouse for too long. Very disappointed to be losing memories. What a waste of money."
"Was not worth the price, after I found a rechargeable child's camera"
Don't buy these. All the pictures from both cameras turned out totally blurry and not a single one is in focus. This was not user error at all.
Bought a 2 pack.  All of the pictures are terrible and extremely underexposed (photo company's words not mine).  A huge waste of money and lost memories.  So disappointed!
These are so expensive for such low quality and then you have to pay again to get them developed so it’s like $50 for low quality pictures for that you can just get an actual camera which you should do instead and have better pictures
I understand that these are not HD digital photos but literally every single photo taken with these were out of focus. 90% of the pictures were taken outdoor in natural light with no need for flash so they should not be blurry.Bad enough that I paid $15 for the cameras and another $30 to have them developed just to throw it all in the trash.
Photos cost 30$ to develop + $25 here so dumped $60 down drain because photos aren't usable. One came out top dark the other came out blurry
The picture quality was very bad and grainy and the flash barely worked. I would not recommend purchasing because of the hassle
The quality of photos were terrible. All were very dark and blurry. Disappointing.
Anyone who has ever used a disposable camera knows that the quality of pictures that they produce is relatively poor. You also know that they are ridiculously expensive when purchased in any store. This was the cheapest option we could find for disposables with flash to put on the tables during our wedding reception. Didn't get as many pictures on them as we were hoping for - still have a lot of exposures to use (2 months after our wedding). Most of the shots we think were taken by children. Really think about how you want to use cameras at your wedding before you spend the money.
"Huge waste of money, we have tried these cameras multiple times in the last 3 years and we have had maybe 5 pictures turn out decent. 3 years of memories (not to mention the money) down the drain. Literally buy any other camera."
"The processing time on these cameras is a minimum of 1 month per the fujifilm representative. Our cameras still haven't been received by their processing center, and they obviously can do nothing to find them. Buy a digital camera, it will be worth it in the long run. BEWARE DO NOT BUY."
"absolutely unacceptable!!!! I purchased these cameras for my boyfriend‘s 30th birthday and not one single picture came out visible, waste of money!!"
"I sent these to my kids at summer camp since I didn't trust that their expensive digital cameras would make it home in one piece, or at all.  These are fine for the money.  Some of the photos came out well, but most were either too dark or too blown out from the flash.  Let's just say it was a worthwhile experiment to record a few camp memories, but if you really want good photos that you'll cherish, buy a digital camera."
ALL of my photos came back blurry or cropped wrong. The quality of this camera is complete GARBAGE. DO NOT BUY
I didn’t have the flash on and my photos turned out black.
I made sure to check the expiration dates and they were all 2027. 5/14 rolls developed came back almost black.
Don't see how it's walmarts fault.
"I’m not sure if the cameras I received were just defective or affected during delivery but when I received the film back, all pictures were blurry and a lot of them were oddly cropped/didn’t align with the shot…so half the heads in our pictures are cut out. I use this brand of disposable cameras frequently and have never had issues so I’m not sure what happened, just a bummer considering how expensive these are to develop."
"This is roll film and each camera had to be processed separately. Bought 12 of these for a sweet sixteen party, placed them on the tables. Lots of bad photos, some not used to the capacity of the film and camera. Not happy with the processing expense. Could have hired a pro for very little more. Perhaps under different circumstances this could have been a different outcome. Consider these with caution."
"tryed this for first time ,EVERY PICT. CAME OUT DARK ,FLASH DIDN'T WORK .don'y buy this product"
"received 1 camera, supposed to be a 2 pack. Where's the other one?"
"I was supposed to get 2 in my order but only got 1, which was disappointing."
"The flash did not work, the photos we got back were completed black and unusable. Very disappointing unfortunately."
Film appeared old. Most did not turn out
"the package seem to have been through a lot, looks like second hand."
"SO EXPENSIVE TO DEVELOP!! Thought it would be a fun grab gift for the kids.  They were not as interested in it as I thought and it cost nearly $60 to develop because the ""technology and equipment is old""."
The photos don’t even show up. Save your money. I got for a vacation and the photos aren’t even visible. Waste of money and NOT CHEEP.
Purchased these for bridesmaids to take fun pictures during my wedding day. Got them developed at CVS afterwards and none of them turned out. They were all dark and mainly shadows. It was unfortunate because they could have been great pictures..
Well I took these cameras on my Spring Break this year to the Grand Cayman and Cozumel Mexico. First time out of the country and I didn't carry my phone so all my photos came from these cameras.I got them developed today and each camera only had 14 exposures. It showed that I took 27 on the camera but only 14 were able to be developed. This is heartbreaking to me because I feel that I lost part of the experience that I had and I know that I lost some great memories.
"Maybe had 11 of 27 exposures develop properly. I think the film was expired or something, or exposed to sunlight."
i never write reviews but DO NOT BUY. went to get my picture developed and not a single photo came out of the whole roll of film. waste of money buying these cameras and developing!
The cameras were damaged and so the pictures came out horribly I paid 70 dollars for the cameras plus printing the pictures. Better to just go to walmart and buy it.
i ordered these in april for my daughters trip in oct. i just opened each box (they were sealed) to write her name on them as she is leaving tomorrow. each camera was already at picture number 15. they were suppose to be 27 exposures. i don't understand how this can happen or why but am very disappointed in these cameras. not at all what i paid for. didn't think i needed to check them as they were sealed.
"after I got the film developed only 10/27 showed images, not sure if it was the film or developer issue."
"Pretty much what you would expect from a disposable camera. Also handy, lighting must be just right for this camera to work well."
Really upset that I paid for 2 cameras and only got 1
"I really love the antiquity of these types of cameras so I had these two at my wedding for a cute photo booth idea. Which would have been fantastic except for one camera did not develop any film at all, and the other broke before all the pictures could be taken. If you want a reliable throw away camera buy something else!"
I used these two cameras on a trip to Brazil and one camera showed absolutely zero photos when developed and the other showed only four very grainy and dark photos. The man at the photo shop said the cameras were probably expired. The negatives were completely dark.
The flash only worked for the first couple pictures. Maybe they were on the shelf too long.
"This review is from someone who is unfamiliar with disposable cameras.We purchased these cameras to set on various tables during our wedding reception in hopes that attendees would use them for candid shots. This happened, but the resulting photos were horrible.Now, I've used 35mm before, but I could have probably draw stick figure pictures better than the resulting photos of these cameras. Horrible quality."
Don't expect good pictures of this product.  I was very disappointed after paying for this product and having to pay to get the pictures printed did not prove to be the best way to capture your special day.
The film wasn't that good. it was also very difficult to find a place to develop. the nostalgia now comes with also a significant cost. I wouldn't buy.
Takes horrible pics
"One camera was just fine.  The other camera seemed to work,  but only 2 pictures showed up for developing."
Only one camera arrived instead of the double pack promised int he description.
not awesome quality. cheap.
"I try to search for underwater or waterproof cameras and this comes up every time! I see that it is disposable, 27 shots and good price for 2 pack and buy!,,,..WHAT I DID NOT search for! dang it! my bad, but why does it show up for underwater cams? now i have to spend more $"
When I developed the photos they were super grainy. You couldn’t even tell what the photo was supposed to be off. Wouldn’t buy again
"The picture quality was poor—most of the photos came out blurry, even in decent lighting. The flash was inconsistent, sometimes overexposing the images. For the price, I expected a better experience, but it just didn't deliver. There are better disposable camera options out there. Wouldn't recommend this one if you’re looking for quality photos."
didnt get very good photos from these.
Pictures very dark
I gave this product one star because I had to give it some kind of rating to give this review.  DON'T BUY THESE CAMERAS!!!!  My two pack came and I shot all the film of my daughter and her new baby.  These are pictures I cannot replace and the film was either too old or just ruined.  Out of two cameras I got not one sinlge picture.
used it on my vacation The pictures turned out horrible
this camera 📸 works great but i was trying to take a picture and noticed something was in the way so i looked and there was a caterpillar inside of my camera.
Terrible image focus. Wasted money.
Washed out photos; and one of the cameras had a broken photo button. Grrr.
Bought 18 cameras for my daughters wedding. I thought it would be a fun idea to leave one on each table for guests. I just got back all the pictures and 15 out of the 18 rolls had something called light fogged film. I had to spend $250.00 to develop all the rolls just to find out they were no good.  I recommend you go with a digital app instead where guests can upload their cell pics and share that way. This whole thing ended up costing me about $500.00 with camera purchase and to develop them all. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!
film was 3 years old
"This product is horrible. We were so excited to get our prints back from each camera but the quality was terrible. All photos turned out very dark and grainy, even when taken in a very well lit area or outside in the daylight.The second Camera only came back with seven prints developed even though we use the entire film. Complete garbage!!!"
"The cameras were purchased to take candid pictures of my son and daughter in law's wedding.  It was nice to have actual photos very quickly.  However, it was expensive to develop the cameras and only a small percentage were usable.  Some were too dark, others were overexposed.  I would probably stick with the digital camera in the future and just pick from there the pictures I want developed.  These cameras were a disappointment."
"I bought two of these for a whitewater rafting trip through the Grand Canyon. I thought I was taking photos of the most beautiful scenery I've ever seen, but the photos all came back dark and grainy despite nearly all of the pictures being taken in bright mid-day sun. Processing wasn't cheap, either, about fifteen bucks for each roll. I wish I had bought a waterproof case for my digital camera or phone."
"For someone looking at this, the cost of getting a photo to you is a lot of work and money. I got 10 of them for my one-month trip to Asia, and let’s see if it is worth it after this trip."
"After using and sending the film to be developed, pictures from 1/2 of the cameras were blank. Extremely disappointing since these cameras are a bit pricey plus."
i did not receive the same like on the pictures… its the colourfull one… still quicksnap tho
"When I unpacked these, I noticed how one packaging was rather strongly deformed, but didn't think much of it at first. I started shooting with the other camera, which was definitely a lot of fun. However when I openend the second camera today, the flash was completely shattered and the housing was dent - I am not sure whether to use it,or not, as I fear loosing the pictures."
"Got these in January, and printed pictures just recently. I am not impressed with the quality of photos. I suggest to use flash all the time, especially in premises. And as I have read in other reviews, some shots were missing in the final print which is upsetting. But you can’t expect more from these cameras :)"
They broke on me two days into my trip. It was probably just a defective one or got mangled. I’m sure it’ll be okay for others I just may have gotten a dud.
Ordered 4 sets of these for a 50th and can honestly say the quality was like we had dug up some pictures from the titanic. A very expensive purchase and an even more expensive bill to get them developed. I would never recommend these to anyone.
Bought these cameras and none of the pictures turned out. Even in broad daylight they turned out black and the flash did not work. Was told by the developers of the photos that this is a common issue and this type of camera is now being made with a better flash because of the issue with photos turning out like this. Also I was told that it is hard to get all 27 pictures out of the camera and people usually only get 23 from it. Have tried contacting Fuji and have not got a response yet after two weeks. Lost all my pictures from my trip and lost all the money I spent on the cameras and getting them developed.
I bought this product expecting to have 2 cameras which I paid for. When it arrived I was disappointed to find that there was only one camera. I got 1 camera for the price of 2. I’ve heard that many other people have had the same problem. Besides that the camera works good.
Bought for my daughters residential France trip. 1 got lost and the other came back with bottom pushed right in.Easy to use though. Never got to develop the photos camera too broken unfortunately. Pretty gutted
These are great and would love to re-purchase although they have up-ed the price by over double which sucks
"Unfortunately this camera did not work as hoped. When I got the film developed only two photos were able to be developed. The camera shop worker advised me the film did not work, and only two random shots on the film were actual photos. Bit of a shame!"
It should be 2 cameras in a package but I only received 1 camera!!
"I liked the price of the camera and the additional battery. I did not like how the camera performed. It was really bad at taking action photos- very slow shutter speed leaving subjects blurred. If you are looking for a landscape camera this would be acceptable. The color was a bit off too in comparison to my iphone camera photos, this camera had a blueish tint. We sent it back because it was not going to meet our needs."
"I would say everything about this camera and its contents is wonderful, except the microphone. Quality and definition for both cameras, including when you zoom, is definitely there, and each photo setting works really well, however zoom is choppy when recording.The microphone is FAR too sensitive! I tried being very gentle and careful with holding it so it would not be audible in video but even the slightest movement in your hand is heard. Using zoom you can hear the spring inside of the camera when you press it and let go. Also, the sound of voices is not clear at all. If you do not mind attaching a separate microphone, I would say this is great. But as someone who wants to be able to use this on the spot with friends and for memories, I do not want to have to pull out a microphone just to capture moments."
"This is a plastic phone, which is one reason why it's a more inexpensive one. It is simple, very few things to deal with in its menu. I had to change some settings for the exposure to look right. I bought this so that I could record videos of me doing my artwork, to edit them on my computer with good editing software, and post them to social media. I've decided that using my Samsung phone does a lot more and does it a lot better. On my phone I can pause my video recording and then unpause it to continue recording within the same video, without having to start a new video. But the camera makes you start a new video. I'm finding this camera useless for my needs. This would be a good starter camera for a child. I only gave it 3 stars, because this camera was not what I was hoping for, or what I was expecting."
"The picture quality was good but I felt like I could spent half the price and would have gotten something as good. The picture quality wasn’t great, no matter what I did in the settings it didn’t do a good job. It worked best in an area with a ton of lighting but indoors it was extremely grainy and just didn’t look great, even with 64mp enabled. I’d mess with the settings and nothing looked right. The only time the video looked good was when I had it as a webcam but when I took an actual video it looked extremely grainy."
"I saw a lot of good reviews on this camera. That and the price helped me purchase it. I wanted to be able to snap good, clear photos, for my business. My older digital camera was getting very cloudy.  I don't think the pics are really very good at all. Not that sharp, and while I didn't think  I'd get pro quality, I did think it would be much better than this. My old digital was in the same price range as this, so I thought they'd be similar. I can take video, but so far, haven't figured out hoe to upload it thru wifi. Possibly my difficulties are cause by the fact I'm visually impaired and a dinosaur, but I am not real happy with this camera, photo quality, ease of use, etc."
The camera worked very well out of the box with video and taking pictures. I had to return because the time lapse feature was hit and miss. Sometimes it would turn on when I selected it and sometimes I couldn't get it to activate.
"Based on the reviews, I was excited to get this camera but when I opened it it was clear how cheap it is. The buttons aren’t intuitive, for instance I couldn’t figure out how to play back a video. This is definitely a cheap, Chinese made product for any Americans hoping to get something of quality, this isn’t it. The images do come out okay however the shutter isn’t responsive or is slow meaning I often missed the photo because it simply wouldn’t take. I’m returning this to purchase a brand name digital camera of better quality. This felt like it would be completely broken in a matter of weeks."
"Very simple and easy to use camera for beginners. The only issue is the camera quality is no more than my iPhone and that is a real bummer. I’ve uploaded many of photos onto my phone and even used photo editor to enhance the quality, but it doesn’t come out any better than my iPhone. It comes with two batteries, a charger, lens protector, and some other accessories, which is great, but I do not recommend this for anybody who’s looking to get quality content."
"I got the camera to learn and try out some things but it just was not good, paying for the description of the item instead of the quality. But they were able to give me a quick and easy return."
I bought this camera based off of reviews to use while on a trip to Switzerland.  The pictures were dark and not better than my old iPhone.
Very low quality...better to pay more than buy this.
Quality is lacking to put it nicely. The photos came out looking like I took them on a web cam on a 2008 Dell. Bought this camera to supplement DSLR cameras I use for work and it came back to bite me due to the low quality. Just save your money.
Unbelievably bad photo quality across all settings and lighting conditions. It doesn't matter how many megapixels there are when the image is full of artifacts. A refurbished smart phone is going to be leagues past this thing in quality. I'm returning this garbage and I have never returned anything in my life.
"This is the cheapest piece of junk camera we have ever purchased.  I get it, it’s not expensive but I expect it to at least last a year, bought in October and it doesn’t work now.  You can tell when you get it, it’s cheaply made.  Do not waste your money on this junk… get a Polaroid for your kids which has lasted 5 years for us."
"The photos may have been ok or even great if I downloaded them to the computer, but I couldn't tell because the back window is awful.You get what you pay for and this thing was clunky and extremely lightweight.  We are returning it."
"I recieved the camera, so far I like the camera but, the product support is non existent.The camera came with a card inside, which states to activate your 2 year warranty send order number via email to activate. I tried to contact Zostuic several times with no response. I contacted Amazon, with the issue, they could not help me.Where is customer service?"
This camera has terrible lighting. I tried to lighten as much as I could. I couldn’t even use it on my trip out of the country.
Camera was only used a handful of times and will not come on unless it is plugged up to the charger. Don’t waste your money!
"This camera is extremely slow, slower than old digital cameras from the early 2000s. Definitely not worth the price and the sellers are dishonest. Buy a name brand one, this is horrible and worse than your phone camera, even if it’s 10 years old."
I got this camera for an upcoming trip and I tested it when I got it and the photo quality was terrible! Super blurry and terrible quality photos.
This camera is very poor quality. Reminded me of a cheap disposable camera. I was unable to transfer photos for the SD card. Tried with the cable and direct transfer from the card to 3 different computers with no success. Don't waste your money on this camera. For a few dollars more you can obtain one that is much better.
Returned immediately. Extremely cheap and horrible picture.
"The battery will not last anytime at all, that must be why they gave you 2 batteries.  You might get 1 hr usage.  Would not purchase again."
Terrible quality of pictures. Very blurry!
i am an appraiser and this camera made the photos red colored and I had to go back and to take photos and each way was 100 miles
"I have tried several methods of getting the pictures from the camera to my computer, and none of them have worked. Only 4 pictures transferred and I cannot find any of my other pictures in the DCIM files. Also, when I use only the SD card in an SD card reader, it shows nothing is on the card. The camera seems like it takes decent pictures, but if I can only view them on my camera then it is worthless. Don't buy this camera!!!"
"Tried the 24/7 video option and it is horrendous.  Extremely bad pixelation even with a strong signal, wired and tons of bandwidth.  I’ve used ring for many years, very disappointing.  Nest is better video, but unfortunately you can’t create clips with the latest version like the original one.The plans being three times the cost with that option has me looking for a better option.  It used to be a good deal with the alarm and video together with the old plan.  Now it’s twice the price as before with the alarm and basic video, three times the price or more for terrible 24/7 video.Definitely moving to a different camera and probably not staying with the alarm either.  Extremely disappointed."
"I struggled with installation - took me about an hour, and I have 4 extra holes now in the door frame that needs to be spackled and repainted so I ruined the door. There is NO instructions with this, just crappy pictures on this tiny little booklet and you have to guess what they are (I had to google a few of them). There was no information at all about distance, how high to put it, what angles would work best, nothing... Then after finding on google that there was an alternative mount behind a silicone plug, I was finally able to installAnd now I find that the most basic features that I expected to be included (since they are listed in the product description here and on their site) are NOT included.There is NO information anywhere that explains exactly what you get WITHOUT a Ring plan. After research I found that you don’t get any video recordings without a plan, only live view when something triggers an alert.Their chat is only with ""Ring Community"".Still captures are apparently a known issue that has been happening for years and was never fixed. Found that out when I saw that my scheduled hourly still shots were not being captured. Still shots only happened when I opened the app. Since they have no customer support, I assume they also do not provide fixes or updates that would fix this issue.Also there is a major lag between recordings, it struggles a lot to behave like a security cam should behave. I walked in front of the door, took maybe 6-7 sec. before I heard a chime on my phone, then walked away. Came back a min. later and nothing. No chime. No recording. Nothing happened at all. So in a real situation, someone could wave their arm from around the corner (because there is a wall that blocks our door, so the pathway is hidden) so they could wave their arm, wait a little bit, then break into my door without ever being recorded and no alert to me at all.After more research on Google I found out there was a security screw (took a while to find it) and was able to finally secure the camera to the mounting plate and secure the battery compartment - phew! This was not a 5 minute install but I think I got it now.Update : after a few weeks i noticed the same lag happens consistently where I walk out the door, hear a chime on my phone, then walk out of site and come back about 15 seconds later and there’s no chime and no recording. Also not very happy with the “Birds Eye view” it’s not wide enough. I have it installed about eye level so I can see someone’s face if they come to the door. It does not capture movement until they are almost directly in front of the door though. The range  isn’t wide enough to capture someone on the side path coming to the door. Another thing I noticed is the “pre-roll” is black and white and grainy and the usually kicks in to HD color at night and without that pre-roll you can’t see the beginning of the movement. HD is not as clear as I’d like, not like a phone camera for instance."
"The camera has a good crisp view, however it must be plugged in to work longer than 24 hours. The colder months cause the image (installed outdoors) to stutter and stop and lose a strong connection with the WiFi, even with a boost from a Chime Pro. I have other Ring devices that do not have this problem. I am going to try to create a cover with some reflective insulation.Worth reporting are pop up ads on the dashboard that advertise premium protection plans for the device. It is a persistent orange banner that has to be closed out with every view of the cameras in the dashboard. Annoying!"
"I really wanted this camera to work. I have two Ring door bell cameras and subscribe to their plan. So it was natural to add outdoor security cams. Setup was easy and it interface d with my Alexa easily. The software is very easy to configure and motion detection worked well. Now for the bad and the reason I returned it. It would not stay connected. I like to monitor my cameras on my PC and I could not get this to stay connected. I have a very fast  and stable Internet connection.  I even tried disconnecting all my other cameras and e placed this Ring camera right beside my router. It still would not stay connected. I packed it up and requested a return, which was approved. I promptly ordered two cameras from a different brand and they have been connected continuously for over a week.. From my experience if you're looking for a security camera that is constantly connected, this isn't the one for you."
"I upgraded two of my stick up cams to the pro version.  While the HDR upgrade is nice, I wish the quality itself of the camera would have an upgrade too (vs the 1080).  The picture really isn’t different than the regular stick up cams.  I do like the preroll and a few other new features, but they aren’t enough for me to upgrade my other stick up cams to the pro version."
11-27 Update - - - Updated to 3 stars ring reached and is working with me to see if there are updates that can extend battery life.  Nice job ring and we’ll update it again if  actually get additional life out of a charge.**Original comments** Only get about two weeks on the batteries not a good purchase.My doorbell lasts 4+ months
I should have bought a powered model but decided to keep it anyway. I will purchase the hardwired one next time .  Battery life was about two weeks with limited use
"I've got a ring doorbell hard wired.  Excellent picture quality.  I have another ring camera in my garage that is hard wired, excellent picture quality..With this solar light, I have the panel on the south side of the house getting 12+ hours of direct sunlight daily.  It stays charged continuously.  I am happy for that.  But the image quality is just ok.  The first 3 seconds of the video is grainy (see attached picture) then it will suddenly come into focus.  I hate the fact that for 3 seconds I am not getting high quality.  I don't know why the first few seconds do this.  On top of that, the picture quality is fair.  It is half the quality of a hardwired system.I have a cheapo $35 chargeable no name camera that I got which I keep on the deck and it works much better in regards to picture quality.  I got the ring because I did not want to fiddle with having to bring it inside and charge it and I had nowhere outside to plug it in.  I am happy to have a camera but not happy at all with the picture quality of it.  Must be due to it being solar is all I can think of."
"ORIGINAL: The integrated mount for this makes it impossible to place in all but very specific, very nonstandard configurations. It is absolutely stunning to me that the engineers thought this was somehow a good idea. It's sitting on a shelf in my workshop now because I can't come up with a realistic way to use it. Brilliant move, Ring/ Amazon... do better.UPDATED: Ring called me and actually walked me through this. It was not obvious that there was a second mounting position on the back (covered by a small silicone plug) that would work for my intended application, but they pointed it out, and knowing this I'm now happy with the product. I will say it needs to be more obvious. Perhaps don't install the mount on the bottom at all so that it's clear you have alternate options. Anyway, kudos to them reaching out to their customers and addressing their needs, that's excellent customer service.UPDATE 2: I cannot set this thing up. The QR code is too tiny for my phone to focus on. The manual registration process doesn't work. The process fails and fails and fails. This is pure junk. I have had nothing but problems with this device. What should be a 5 minute process has taken me hours and I don't feel like I'm any closer to getting this thing working. What a horrible experience.UPDATE 3: FINALLY got this thing to connect. Apparently the setup process is completely different between Stick Up Cam Battery and Stick Up Cam Pro... they look exactly the same on the setup screen. The QR code thing was very annoying... the manual process was confusing. But I think I'm finally set."
"When it rains the vision is less than par, at times looks bubbley bc raindrops my flood light cam doesn’t do this."
"Faithfully detects motion, initiates recording, makes recordings available in a timely way and provides decent video and audio. However, there is no way to turn off the little blue light that indicates operation. This is a major drawback."
"This is our third Ring, first non-doorbell. The doorbell cameras reach out to 65 feet, in daylight to 75. All the fancy detection features on the stick up are only good to 30 feet. (The average driveway is about this long. Most houses are set farther back from the road than this.) The only place you will see this referenced is when you try to set up the Bird's eye zones. And good luck with that! The view they gave me was so pixelated that I couldn't identify my house, much less which direction the camera would be pointing. Turning off all the added features will get you to 40 feet, sometimes 45. It is easy to install and has a great picture, but it should have better motion detection than a $40 trail cam."
It's just a video intercom without the subscription.They don't make this obvious in the description.They could store some video on the device ... but nope.
"I have this over my garage looking towards a walk way.  Our normal Stick Up Cam was really hit and miss on catching any movement on the walk way, especially at night, even though it's only like 18ft away.  I was really hoping this Pro version with it's ""3D motion detection"" would actually catch the movement, but it doesn't.  It's well within the Green area marker for the overhead mapping.  It's got a clear image in the motion zone section.  Everything looks like it should work fine.  It just doesn't.  Even at max sensitivity with Smart off, it only catches movement about half the time, and never at night.  Oh, and it's probably also worth mentioning that the pathway is light, so it's not because it's in total darkness or anything.  It's just really hit and miss with motion for some reason.  Overall, the camera just doesn't seem like an improvement over the normal version in any real way."
"The ring to me is a giant scam. Has all the stuff you’ll want then comes a subscription plan. Do yourself a favor and buy a monitor, a DVR, storage box, basic small computer and you’ll never have to waste another dime. Now that we got my main issue aside I do want to bring up the pros, it is an easy setup and the night vision isn’t the best but at least you can see. I also like how easy it is to change the battery as well. Anyway, that’s my take on it."
"Setup is fairly easy, except the QR code is too tiny to be read by the Ring app so one has to manually enter in the PIN. Once done the rest of the setup is easy, and the product works pretty well. Motion detection is good and video quality is decent enough.But the ceiling mount is ludicrous. With the Stick Up cams, there is no way to invert the video, so when installed as directed you get an upside down image. It is annoying that Ring (i.e. Amazon) says the unit can be ceiling mounted, and there is even a section on that in the installation instructions.  But if you follow the instruction, you’ll be looking at upside down images with no way to correct.  Only after install did I find this out, as it is NOT mentioned anywhere in the description. Searching the Ring support archives, you’ll find a long thread going back several years on this, and Ring has still yet to correct this which is absurd - it would only take a simple software change to enable, and ironically this feature is available on older and cheaper indoor Ring cameras.It is unacceptable that Ring continues to advertise this camera as capable of ceiling mount, only to find that feature unusable.  Fix it, Ring!!!!!"
"Right now the resolution quality is very bad. I screenshot myself standing in the camera view like Ring has on their website, and I am a total gaussian blur. Not at all like the web picture of the guy standing there on the sidewalk. Ring says it's due to signal strength. I am at -72. Ring says it needs -55 to -20. An odd thing is Ring said it needs to be connected on 5ghz, not 2.4ghz. But router company like Netgear says cameras prefer 2.4ghz. So I'm going to try an Extender and see if I can get it to work on 5ghz with good clarity, or even 2.4ghz with good clarity. If not, they are going back.After two months of testing with tech support, the bottom line is these cameras only take a good picture at about 10 feet for less. Anything farther is fuzzy. The motion detection also only works close up. It would sometimes pick up motion further away, but very sporadic and not reliable. They also do not connect well with WiFi at 70 to 120 feet, even with a mesh point in line of site. They also do not record all the time. Only when there is a motion detection.After some research and trying other camera's, it takes one that costs over $2,000 to get what I want. A good picture at 20 to 60 feet."
"Worked great, pre-roll and wider viewing image.  Then 28 days later started showing black dots in the recording.  I cleaned the lens, re-boot, unplugged and re-plugged.  Black dots only appeared when looking at a red curb.  If something else was in front of the red curb, everything was fine.  Red curb looked like a dotted / dashed red line with black holes in it.  All of a sudden it appeared on Day 28.  Called Ring customer service, went through all these resets,  then it went offline and took about 12 tries to restore it. But black specks remained. Ring said send it back to Amazon being it’s within 30 days.  For $180 what a joke."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The bad...First of all I received my package opened it up and my box was open.  I had to call ring and confirm it was safe to use and install. Second it comes with two cables and no instructions on how to connect these two together.The good... installation on wall was quick and the quali of video is good.
"This camera is huge, I figured it would be similar size to the regular stick-up but it’s roughly twice the size. Cameras should be more discrete not stand out with this bulky shape. Disappointed, was going to replace all of my stick-up cams with these but not anymore."
Worked for a week or so.  Now none of the trouble shooting information will work on it.  Won’t respond at all
"This product ""IS"" defective.  The ball and socket that allows the camera to move in different horizontal and vertical directions would not move.  It was locked.  I bought the same product from Best Buy a week later and the SAME THING was the case.  I quick check on Google and this design from Ring appears to be defective widespread.  I am posting this in November of 2024 after my experience in October of 2024 and don't know if Ring resolved the problem or not.  This is a Ring issue, not an Amazon issue.  Amazon refunded my purchase."
"Purchased the ‘Pro’  outdoor plugin model. Installation and setup were easy like other ring cams, although it took multiple reboots to connect WiFi with direct line of sight to outdoor antenna. Picture is good but I can’t tell it’s any better than the regular plugin cam.  Biggest problem is an apparent complete lack of motion sensitivity to record objects despite highest settings or any other setting. My other 2 standard outdoor stickups are MUCH MORE sensitive to motion. I tested it by driving my very large truck slowly past at multiple distances and it did not record even once.  Buy the older model if considering this fake ‘Pro’ model it’s not worth the money at all. I have many outdoor ring cams and know exactly how to set them up."
"It's giant, nearly twice the size as the old battery cam.  Does not detect very well for distance compared to the older battery cam.  Very disappointed.  I can do jumpying jacks 25 feet away and it will not see it.  the old one could.  I am keeping the previous one and sending this one back."
"They do not warn you this requires a paid subscription to work. The ""free"" trial lasts just long enough that you cannot return it for a refund. Almost as soon as that happens the camera turns into a brick and demands money for any meaningful features. extremely deceptive and unethical practice. Will not be buy any more Ring products."
Outstanding product except for connectivity issues. I can’t get either of mine to stay online for more than a few hours.
Regardless of what RING TRASH department tries to tell you this does not work with the pan tilt base.It has a divider inside where the battery goes that blocks the base from being inserted.Not sure what has happened at the company but the customer service is completely gone and their products don't work correctly.
"The camera came nicely packaged however, the charging cable received is not compatible with the camera. I am unable to charge device."
Disappointing product in that it does not automatically turn on when I leave and turn off when I arrive home. It automatically reminds me to turn the camera on when I leave. Notifications are ok but auto on and off is preferred. I won’t buy another Ring camera until this feature is offered.
"This is a much bigger camera than the rest of the stick up cams I have had, and the quality is definitely better. However, you would think you could adjust the video orientation, but that feature doesn’t exist. For three times the price of other ring cams, you’re better off getting one of those."
"did not include the battery when the instructions said "" install included battery"""
After receiving this camera I charged the battery.  After a week it said it needed to be charged again. After being charged it lasted for another week. I own 3 other ring cameras (I purchased in a store not from Amazon) 2 being on batteries and both last for months at a time.
I have 7 Ring cameras of various types and I only change batteries every 2-3 months.  I had to change the battery twice within 2-days… had to remove it… not sustainable!
"Dear Amazon, don't call it a stick UP camera if you can't mount it..UP. there is no reason I should have to purchase a separate mounting bracket for this to work. I know it was not impossible for you to add an additional mounting point to the top of the camera. I paid a lot for these Cameras, I shouldn't have to be sucked into buying another piece. This feels like a cash grab. You can't tell me no one has tried to mount this to their soffit."
The ring camera sucks because it only records an hour  at a time. There was a car theft that occurred and the camera only got 3:28 and 4:28 nothing in between.
"I owned several cameras for a nursing home I’ve got the cameras on a separate Wi-Fi. The cameras routinely miss days and hours at a time when I called the customer service they put me on hold and refused to answer and kept skipping me around to several different places, then blamed me and wouldn’t take responsibility for their equipment. Do not buy for any reason. Go someplace else"
Don’t waste the money on the pro version.
This camera is listed as being able to be mounted on a ceiling and also shows in the directions as to how it is to be mounted.  The problem is that you mount as instructed and your picture is upside down and cannot be changed.  It is not noted anywhere that you must buy a completely different mount to be able to mount to a ceiling and get a proper picture.  False product description.
"I’ve had Blink cameras outside for years, never changing the batteries. I wanted to see if Ring was better for the distance and wide view, but the battery simply doesn’t hold a charge."
Not impressed. We've needed pics from videos a couple times due to theft and unauthorized people on our property and we've been unable to get anything usable!! It's terrible how the resolution doesn't seem to be anything near what they say it should be. Between that and paying for the service to even have access to the terrible results ... Looking at other camera systems to replace them.
"I bought this camera on May 5th it's been ""off line"" and can't hold a charge even with a solar panel for 3 weeks. I've contacted customer support just for them to tell me ""let's trouble shoot the device"" and won't replace a defective product."
Camera is fine but it would have been nice to know that an adapter is needed to connect the camera to the solar panel... Very poor design and lack of information!
Why do I want to get up on ladder to charge battery every month?  Also the tool included did not fit the screws they showed to use it on.  Crude.
Sooo. I added this stick up camera to my house worked for 1 1/2 mo (right as my warranty went out) Brought it down to charge and she never worked again!. Yet I still have to pay for my subscription for ring... omg.. let's play!I wouldn't invest in this type if this would have been my issue.
"The camera itself seemed great, however needed to be charged after only 12 hours.  Returned."
My old stick up Cam runs circles around this paper weight.  I wish I didn't throw the box away so I could return this heap of junk.
"For the money, definitely not impressed at all. The Birds Eye view thing is a gimmick. Besides the clearer video, I can’t recommend for the cost.Drains battery daily, doesn’t work with 3rd party solar panels."
"I think it sucks that after having to pay for the device, you can only get full user functionality for 30 days. After that, you have to subscribe. I paid for what exactly, the privilege of paying sub fees?I guess that's why you have only 30 days to return this device. That's exactly when it loses its full functionality. Unless of course you pay $50 a year.What a scam!"
The battery was not included. Checked to make sure I didn’t miss the need to purchase the battery separately and did not. Trying to get a battery shipped out to me with no luck so will return.
I don’t know what makes this “pro” but it gets worse Wi-Fi reception than the 4 year old spot light cam it replaced that was in the exact same spot.
The product never worked and customer service is nothing extremely poor. They really need to do better. Amazon is more than this
Don’t buy use the regular cam instead. Will not work for pan tilt and in order to use this camera you can purchase a battery the plug it includes doesn’t bend in order to insert into the charging port.
"Ok product, not great."
Battery only last 3 or 4 days. !!  Junk
$179 for a wireless camera - but doesn’t include the battery to make it wireless?!? Disappointed
The base was cheaply made.not worth the money
"Cameras are great, but batteries last at most 3 weeks during warm weather. I am guessing that will go way down as it becomes winter. I tried buying the wire kit for these, but that doesn't seem to help any either."
This is the worst camera product that I have ever had it will not stay connected to the internet sitting right beside the modem and this is the second one that they have sent me I would buy any other camera besides a ring product
Tried to help my brother-in-law install this in his house. Wouldn’t work and chatted with a bot that did not help. Only gave options to call New Zealand and Australia office and after 25 minutes they decided to send a new one. Hung up and got charged $65 for an international call.
"So my 2nd generation wired stick up cam went out a week ago — just stopped functioning. Unfortunately, since that cam is out of stock, Ring couldn’t send me another power cord to see if that was the problem. But they offered me a discount on this wired stick up cam generation 3 replacement, which was nice. Unfortunately, however, I have two major issues and disappointments with the newer gen3 camera. First, the wired input (plug into the cam) is much larger on the newer one (hammer style), so the hole I drilled in the wall years ago had to be enlarged (almost doubled). Secondly, and much more importantly, the field of vision on the newer cam is only 60% as large as the gen-2 I had. Big difference! I can see only 40 percent of what I could previously. I won’t go into detail (any more than I have😆) but I need at least another half of that missing 40%! And the stock up cam “pro” has the same bad field of vision- no increase. What a disappointment!"
Ok I’ve had camera 5 days - installing was ok only could mount one way !  It needs a cover for weather issue like rain dew on the lense to keep a better picture !!  Also the solar panel is in direct sun all day and battery was fully charged but still decreasing life !!!!!  I hope this isn’t broken why not charging !!!! I have 8 ring cameras now but not only 4 purchased this year !! The lense staying g dry is a issue but I found ring cover for older one so trying it on one camera now - won’t fit new camera that just came out 9-18 I got on the 23 of September!! Please someone have answers are welcomed
"I used a regular stick up camera and upgraded to the pro edition and thought I would get a better pic quality.  I am very disappointed.  The pic quality is horrible and I can't even read a vehicle plate now.  I have many types of the ring products that I like but  I am returning this one.  Come on Ring, you can do better than this."
"Great camera, field of view and easy setup. However I am returning because the battery went from fully charged to 82% in 8 days. I will get the plug in version of the Ring Stickup Pro and return this battery version. Also, it's hard to twist the base to get the battery out unless you have strong hands. If you are older and/or have arthritis, get the plug version instead.Update: I returned the Ring battery camera and purchased the Ring Stick Up Pro Wired. It's perfect. I don't have to worry about the battery draining and am very happy with this version."
It’s easy to set up and the picture quality is excellent.  But the snapshot function doesn’t work at all and the camera sometimes needs several seconds to “wake up” and capture motion.  I’m trying to catch maintenance men coming into my apartment but I’m concerned the camera isn’t fast enough to capture their entrance.
The Picture Quality is not worth $180. Not sure where there justifying the value for this camera The camera misses events and or doesn’t capture the whole event why are theses plug in cameras not 24/7 recording? Why are they not 4K pictures quality? Why is there no dual Smart power mode where the camera has battery & plug in as a dual option? These cameras all seem to have the same image quality of 720 video resolution when you zoom in a little the picture always gets static picture and very boxy and unable to see any quality at all?
I have a couple of the prior gen stickup cams as well which both work very well and last almost 2 months each per fresh charged battery.  This new Pro version only gets 9-10 days tops!  I have all of the same exact settings and even set the new and old cams right next to each other in the same location to test.  Disappointing it drains the battery so rapidly!
"The picture quality is absolute trash. The regular stick up camera is 100 times better picture quality and cheaper. The Birdseye view is not clear like advertise. It is blurred the two speaker is better, but this camera is not worth the extra money stay with your stick up cam not the pro."
Inconsistent pick up of motion and people.
"Apparently the other reviewer doesn’t understand what “wireless” means when they purchased the plug-in version.Hint: it doesn’t mean that you need a battery when it comes with a power cord.Here’s the real problem. Ring decided to eliminate the PoE option from their outdoor cameras. Now I’m not sure what alternate reality that company lives in, but just how many people either have an outdoor rated outlet that’s going to be within 6ft of where this can be mounted or go through the expense of adding one???But sure, let’s have a security camera that someone can just walk up to and unplug at any time. Because of this I can no longer upgrade or update my Ring system, so eventually they will just be phased out and I’ll be forced to move on to another system.Thanks Ring for being completely totally disconnected from your users and reality."
I have purchased 3 of these to add to my 7 cameras I currently have. Not a single one will connect to my network it shows it connected when I check my router but won't allow to finish set up. I have had 1 replaced bought 2 mote thinking it was a fluke. Every single camera is the same expensive garbage. I an returning every single one and solar panels.
Ring needs to at least come out with a 2k camera technology. Lorex is coming out with a 2k doorbell no subscription required.
These are totally terrible unless you want only see clearly 10' from the camera!
This will not connect to our WIFI - we have tried numerous times - we can not use it.
This only has one battery space and no spotlight. For the price difference I wish I’d just got the spotlight cam pro again.
"Likes- (👍)Tall (6.5+FT), works, comes with Bluetooth remote, and is useable, cost is pretty cheap and reasonable for people on low budget/income, holds phone securely,  aluminum body, can be swapped from tripod to selfie stick, (super long selfie stick by the way) (Great for going fishing/camping/catching crawdads), comes with a remote to start/end a video, or take a picture, ETC... Appearance, looks and feels sturdy, Portability is Perfect, small enough to fit in bag that's included, quick and easy to pack up and go as well as open and set up... Grip on phone mount is strong...Dislikes- (👎) #1, The phone mount, (Even though it strongly secures your phone), is PLASTIC!!! Plastic with just normal use, will Crack and break sooner then later!!!, #2, the flexible part of the tripod/Selfie stick bends just with the weight of your phone, (which, if in tripod position, if there is wind of any kind, the video you're filming/taking will be slightly shaking), #3 The flexible part of the tripod (in selfie stick mode) with the weight of the phone the part you screwed into place to connect it will spin and loosen, making you have to tighten it up constantly...#4 In tripod mode, You insert your phone into the mount, and it's UNSTABLE!!! All it wants to do is fall over due to the weight of the phone... (unless you have heavy duty sandbags, tent steaks,, or a weighted plate holding it down and upright... #5 The remote, Yes, it's great to have a remote that's Bluetooth and be able to take a professional selfie/ video without having to touch your phone, however, if you are vlogging, and you start your video with the remote, you still have to touch your phone to PAUSE the video because all the remote is good for (in video mode) is start and end/ stop...With all that being said, I do highly recommend this product if you're looking for a low budget, cost friendly tripod, that comes with a remote...(Picture of tripod in Amazon caption is accurate to what you receive after shipped...)"
"The tripod is 63""You can attach the tilting mechanism to it for another 2 inchesThe gooseneck is another 10 inches.At best, if you take this tripod, stand it straight up and have your phone pointing toward the ceiling; you will get a total of 75"".  However, nobody uses a tripod this way so should expect to get about 65-70"" out of it.If that works for you, then jump on it.  If you're tall like me, this may not be the item for you."
If your in the grass or anything not flat the center will bottom out and you I’ll not get a stable use
"I purchased the 71"" version.When measured, it has a max height of 62""....This is dumb, and I'm pretty pissedI do like the latches on the tripod. They seem like good quality and they have a nice snapping action.But 62 inches??? Come on..."
"I didn’t like that it does not rotate but you just adjust it/ moving it. You need to loosen the screws adjust it where you want it and tighten them, but the pretty cool part is it has 3 different height adjustments and it stands pretty high when all 3 are extended!!"
"I originally begrudgingly marked this as a 4, for one because I hate to give bad reviews, but for two because the versatility and customization are great... I WANTED to love it, the customizable height options, the tilt, the two spots for screwing on the phone clamp are all spectacular! But the legs?! They barely come out at all, which leaves this thing so incredibly unstable, that half the time you can't even get it to stand up without your hand on it without it falling over. To make it work you can ~ sometimes~ get it to stand on its own by shoving clothing or some such between the leg(s) that raise up and the middle to try and weight it down but even doing that I've had it fall over on me SEVERAL times messing up staging and other things and leaving me rushing to make sure my phone isn't broken. Now that I'm through my crunch period maybe I can think of other things to better hold it still as being disabled I don't have the mental or physical energy to return it. While it's not the priciest of products by any means, it's still enough that it should be functioning infinitely better than this. Overall, I cannot recommend the product, and would recommend you look further unless you just enjoy the price point/don't want to look anymore/and have a bit of an engineers brain to rig yourself a little add on to help."
This tripod is okay if using like a self stick and you don’t have a case on your phone. But other than that not sturdy enough for outdoor use in my opinion. Needed to take phone case off to fit phone in the adapter. Falls over if extend angles  since base is lightweight.  Would not recommend or buy again. One thing had lots of adapters for different angles if only not so lightweight the base
The bottom screw is missing! :( it won't stay in place
"After trial and error, I assembled the tripod and placed my phone in the holder. The tripod is sturdy but missing a part. I emailed the address on the insert and explained which part was missing. According to the insert, if there are any issues, all one needs to do is email the company and I will get a reply. Nope, that is not the case. Do not expect help. I spent too much time putting it together to take it apart, repack, and return it. Would I buy it again? Yes. I like the way the tripod holds the phone tightly. The tripod can be adjusted to varying heights. The remote works with my phone so I can take photos and videos remotely. It works. One last note is that the remote directions are printed super TINY. The abbreviated BL in the directions stands for Bluetooth. I think they were conserving ink and the directions are cryptic. The part I was missing I replaced with a screw."
The top is not very flexible. It requires weights on the  legs so  it doesn't tip over. Otherwise  seems well constructed and  functional.
The feet of the tripod are floppy and don’t lock well. They also are not big enough to support the tripod when used at a taller height. It constantly falls over and my phone with it. The connections for the clamp are constantly coming loose. And the phone clamp itself won’t retract back unless I push it.
"I loved this tripod while it worked. It was light, it held all sorts of different phones and cameras. Just overall it worked. I use it around the house for filming things, not hard on it. But 1 month to the day and it has died. I tried to get it to extend the other day and it just kept sliding down when locked. I checked, and not just that clamp, but all of the clamps, had cracked! I guess the plastic just has a certain lifespan under pressure before it gives? Sad."
"Not the most sturdy but it does the job, I wish it bent a little bit more. Great height and able to adjust really easily!"
"The idea of this tripod is stellar.  It has all the right parts for filming and then some (the goose neck).  I used this tripod with my iphone a total of three times before the plastic phone cradle attachment piece broke off.  So sad.  Luckily, I had also purchased a stabilizer (different vendor) which fits perfectly on the tripod, so all is not lost...but sure wish I could have used the good neck."
"The bag and remote that it came with were nice. It has multiple different height extenders. It's mostly easy to use. I really hoped that it would tilt, but it didn't."
Good height. Missing remote. Emailed company and never heard back.
The top where the 1/4 screw goes in broke off. I think it was put in with cheap glue.
I was disappointed that the tripod would fall over when I had the curved extension on it. Nice concept but doesn’t function as it should.
I like the base. Very strong and seems durable. My issue is that the threading of the swivel head and the phone clamp don't line up for me. When you tighten the phone clamp down all the way on the head it only swivels side ways not front and back. The case for swiveling front and back is 100% of my usage. I will have to now go buy a head that swivels 360.
The tripod itself is super easy to use and does what it should. Nice a sturdyThe flexible goose neck pretty much doesn’t hold even an iPhone when it’s bent. I don’t need the goose neck so it still does what I need.
"This is a cheaply made product.  It is very unsteady when extended more than half way up. I was hoping to use this to leave my hands open to take pictures l, but there is no way I will trust it."
It broker after just three months of having it and barely using it. It wasn’t holding the phone well either.
Broke very quickly will not buy another
"The little remote is great. The height range is incredible. I was a little disappointed with how tall the stand is when fully collapsed though. It's taller than my camera bookbag. I did like that the whole unit came I a little drag string bag though. The clip holds the phone very well horizontally but if you want to have your phone vertical, you basically have to clip the phone from the very bottom of the phone (like where the charging port is). It doesn't have the option to hold the back of the phone for vertical shots (like it holds the back of the phone for horizontal)Let's hope it does its job on my trip!!"
Broke within 3 months
"My tripod broke right after the return window closed, did not hold up. Is there any way to get a replacement ?"
it FALLS OVER when the bendable arm is bent horizontal. Returning.
"The bendy part is not sturdy at all and tips over the entire tripod so I had to remove it, the tripod itself is not sturdy either"
I’ve had this tripod for 4 months and wasn’t considered using it. It is already broken at the base. You get what you pay for.
"At first for the first three weeks I loved it-- feels good material, everything is great. But after the return date the thing starts to fall apart-- the base completely screwed off and now the tripod won't even stand properly. Goes to show some things are worth investing the money in. Afterwards you can use it as a hand-held camera but don't expect to be able to put your phone and it and for the stand to still hold up."
"The  product is not the same described, the remote is so bad,  it is like a bad quality toys. The stick itself is  okay, but not what I expected."
"This tripod is fine but you can’t do overhead shots without seeing the base which is really annoying. I guess it didn’t say you could in the description so it’s not inaccurate, but I would have bought one with this function if I considered that, didn’t know better. It’s a bit light so not super stable, especially if you have up high."
It doesn’t rotate properly to move the phone view up or down for a desirable view.
"This is my 1st tripod so it gets the job done but I wish it was a little more sturdy which would cut back on set up time, but overall it’s not bad."
I haven’t had this product for 2 months and the piece needed to attach the phone broke. I’m really upset because I didn’t touch the part that snapped or manipulate it in any kind of way. I will attempt to reach out to customer service.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Dislike the quality
"I purchased the 85"" unit and when fully assembled, including the tripod base, the swivel attachment, and the flexible goose-neck, it's just over 79"". Build quality is pretty good, but there are plastic parts in the tripod shaft the pole slides into that I suspect will not last long."
Needs a stronger base for when you want to bend the gooseneck because it will tilt over at times
What am I missing. Both the instructions and the box showed no phone holder included.  It went back.
Bendy top pice broke on the first day :(
"I bought this because my hubby and I wanted a way to take photos without help during our trip to Yosemite.KEPT/ RETURNED > Returned, not sturdy enough for concrete ground/ uneven ground BUT great in a home setting!I hope this helps!"
"The rubber grips could have been wider, my iPhone consistently pops out, especially annoying making a long video and it pops out in the middle. My iPhone hit the cement once."
Tripod only lasted me 2 months unfortunately. I used I maybe 10 times? Ended up throwing it away /:
I was expecting it to be more sturdy to be honest
It broke after having it for only 2 weeks. It was in the same spot I record in all the time. Didn’t move it much the and the legs broke. Still trying to rectify the situation with the  seller 5 months later.
"Sadly it only lasted me less than a month before it broke, I wish it lasted longer as I was just beginning to use it to track my gym progress"
"It seems like a very nice quality product but both legs were broken when I opened it. It is very tall tho at least, hopefully when I get my replacement it won’t be broken."
Broke in the first 30 minutes. The flexible piece can’t hold the weight of an iPhone 13 Pro. The bolt popped out and when  l put it back in it just spine around and won’t tighten.The tripod itself also wanted to tip over often as it’s not weighted at the bottom.
It is not staying phone with phone case and hi niece is so weak hard to get tight. It doesn’t tight tighter and is so long time. Take a long time to inconvenient and too big to carrier to have it to carry around.
One of the legs Broke from first use.
This stand was woobly from the start but what can you get for that price. The worst thing is that I used it about 3 times in 5 months only to have it break down at the bottom from just pushing down on it a bit (trying to stabilize it).
"I bought this for a trip to Grand Teton National Park and Yellowstone. I first set it up at my house and saw that it was pretty wobbly. The flexible attachment was under utilize because it couldn't hold the weight of my phone and bend downwards without falling over. Unfortunately, the first day using it at the park, the base broke. There is a part where the pole goes into and the screw holds it together, that is the part that was broken. It looks lie it was initially glued.I was able to superglue it and it did okay after that, but still super wobbly. I wish I would've bought a different one in hindsight."

The phone holder don’t open this the second 1 I had to order the first 1 I ordered was missing parts now I had to make a third order do to this part not working I wouldn’t recommend nobody to order from this company please just spend the extra 5$ more on a better 1 u will thank me later my lesson is your blessing.
My husband was extremely excited to receive this tripod. But as he was putting it together it was missing a piece!
kinda confusing not super clear
"I figured out how to put it back together but the design will always cause a problem. It has good features, but the screw at the bottom does not stay in place therefore the stand will not stand up."
"I am missing a screw at the bottom, how can I get this replaced!! Besides the missing screw I think the tripod would be a 10/10"
"I bought this to do photo inspections, I didn’t even get to use it before it broke."
The gooseneck screw is too short so it constantly wobbles and is very stiff.
The bottom portion of the main rod is very weak and breaks easily when closing the legs of the tripod. Mine broke after two uses.
"The base at bottom is poorly glued in and broke free just closing the legs up. Looks like it’s glued around half the bottom and a knob is screwed through the base. I’ll try some gorilla glue, but very poor performance."
"It did its job for the photo shoot, but I’ll look for something better. You get what you pay for."
"This phone holder is absolutely unable to hold a phone vertically. The entire rod feels like metal and it refuses to bend. If you try too hard, you run the risk of breaking it. Arrived today, returning tomorrow."
"This tripod will not stand up straight no matter how hard I tried, everything is installed correctly.,.it just wobbled. I decided to start using my tripod to make more reals and I'm just disappointed 😞 I need my money back!"
"If you are a streamer and use the part that moves it is not very sturdy.  If the weight is distributed outside of the legs, it falls over easily.  Wish I would have returned it."
This is good product but it broke easily as the tripod head is not steady enough so upset only used it 3 times at least
"What would be a great design is ruined by a fatal flaw. The plastic cap at the bottom of the shaft does not remain securely attached inside the tube. As a result, the bolt that extends through the base of the tripod and into the expanding shaft cannot be tightened properly, making the entire thing unstable. I'm disappointed."
I don’t like the mobility of this tripod
"So it doesn’t fit my phone case… I take my phone out of the case and put it in the tripod. It constantly falls over and since my phone is not protected it smashes the glass. $1000 phone smashed due to a terrible product. Also, I could never get it to stay straight with the bendable top connection. I’m always recording crooked"
This product is breaking so easy
Doesn’t support a standard DSL with decent lens if you want to shoot in portrait
It broke in a second and got messed up and I totally don’t recommend. Waste of my money and TikTok shop has better ones. I usually don’t write reviews but anyone who’s considering this for travel. DONT.
It was hard to get it to work..
"Could not attach an android phone, even though it claimed it came complete to do so. Had to return."
"I’ll update my review if my replacement item arrives intact.The box was shoddy looking upon arrival, upon assembly it eventually failed. Let’s see how the replacement works"
It broke after one use
I use this in my salon to record facials. It’s a good sturdy tripod but I’m a little upset it came without a clicker. Also wish the head was able to be adjusted more to center clients face.
"It’s broken, I won’t recommend"
"The neck isn't strong enough. It drops and says, which defeats the purpose of using it."
"I received this package missing the small ""camera"" button that connects to your phone. I would like to receive one if that is possible. Otherwise, product seems nice."
I own.a.selfie and photography studio.I purchased but was unable to.return because it was outside of the due.date.It broke easily
A leg popped out and I couldn’t get the lock mechanism to work after reinserting it. The instructions don’t help at all for trying to reassemble the pieces.
So I finally ordered this because I'm trying to use this for content I open the box and bag and it's missing the piece that's connected to the phone stand. I thought I had dropped it but I didn't see it at all. There's no connecter and there's no screw.
It's not too stable and I regret the purchase.
The bottom of the actual stick has a little screw opening that should be able to screw onto so the stick doesn’t move and stays in place. The tripod is constantly shifting and you’re never able to move the tripod without the main stick falling out of the whole thing. It took me a second to realize that’s why my tripod wouldn’t stabilize because the whole time I thought I received a faulty product.
Unfortunately it’s too late to return this tri-pod. It’s too small to fit any smart phone that came out two years ago to present. I forgot I even bought it thinking it would work when I wanted to try it out. I can’t use it and now I’m out the money. Bad design and inaccurate web description.
This thing only lasted two months before it fell apart!!! Don’t buy this!
This is a bit heavy to carry around.
The main attachment for the camera shake. Not sturdy at all
Super cheaper and not sturdyCompletely fell apart piece by piece
The stand is very flimsy and the top part doesn’t hold the weight of my phone. It just flops over. You also have to put weight on the stand to prevent the whole thing from toppling over.
"Honestly it was fine for when I needed it but I used it 4 times in 1 month and the center piece to keep it locked in broke apart and now it can’t stand on its own , the most I can do now is use it for a selfie stick but I don’t need a selfie stick I NEEDED a decent quality tripod…."
"I ordered this tripod stand after leaving mines in Antigua bc of A: the crazy height, B: the gooseneck attachment, and C: light weight portability. The problem? You can only use the phone mount in landscape mode, with the gooseneck attachment (which means you’re not in the light center), or with a shoe mount piece. As I managed to bring my ring light home and was looking for something that would be compatible with it, I can’t use the shoe mount. Why on earth the screw mount would only be on the back side and bottom is beyond me but I now have to order yet another phone mount to be able to take video in all formats. If they changed the attachment piece, this would be the perfect cost efficient and sturdy tripod for any content creator."
"It's ok. The flexible thing at the top doesn't hold the weight of the phone at all.  I use it without. Makes it more difficult to angle it just right and you don't her the full height as listed without the top part.  But for the price it's just ok.If you want a sturdy one,  this isn't it. Spend more for a better one.  I should have."
"It is a good quality, it is resistant, and I like the remote control and the accessories. But it is heavy, and it isn’t compatible, you can’t carry in your bag, even in a bag pack is too big. That’s why I returned,  but is you wanted to keep in your house or studio, you should buy it"
"I wasn't looking to spend a ton on a tripod with a gooseneck. I got what I paid for.. a cheap tripod at a semi decent price (ended up finding the same one on tiktok for $10 less)  my biggest dislike about this tripod is my cell phone (Google Pixel 7) can make the tripod want to fall over at certain angles. Super annoying, who wants to replace the screen in their phone?All in all I'll be buying another tripod of better quality."
"I use this stand as a webcam stand and not for a cellphone. The stand at about 2/3 the max height has a considerable amount of play. Enough that light wind would be visible in a recording. That is through a webcam mind you, a cell phone is much heavier and would be much more noticeable. I wouldn't trust this all the time but it works in a pinch."
Love the handle to move around. Seems very sturdy. I wish it had a bag to put it in and also a slot to put the remote in on the stand. The little remote is going to be hard to keep up with.
Not sure what I am doing wrong but it’s kind of hard to use. It’s not strong enough to hold the phone. I would not recommend. Might be better to spend a little more money on a better quality one.
"this stand is wobbly, not super secure… does the job but you definitely don’t feel co didn’t with it holding  your things with extreme strength. I use it for a mounted light and my phone as I record and it gets the job done but it’s not the most stable when you’re setting it up. I never fully extend each panel so if you are looking for height make sure you get taller then needed!!"
"Overall this tripod is efficient and easy to use. However it does hold my camera or phone steady, causing every shot to be crooked and not level. Due to this issue I am basically unable to use it. I'm trying to return it if I cannot I will throw it away or use it to remove a wasp nest on my balcony."
I thought the product was suppose to be new but the tightening ring is weak and there were no instructions with it. It still serves its purpose but I’m disappointed it’s not new.
It kept falling didn't hold my phone I had to put heavy item around it to hold up because it falls easy and the holder my phone kept dropping forward
This was a good tripod for the money. The part that folds over was a little bit flimsy but overall was pretty good. Works mostly fine for our needs.
"I tried this with my phone and stand kept falling over. The extension is too long for phone to hang from even though you tighten at the pivot to adjust the angle phone. Also the base even tho it had a tighten wheel at the bottom,  it really still not tight enough.  Only good thing its actually tall enough.  But it doesn't come with a phone holder so this might have been a return. VERY ANNOYING AND DISSAPPOINTING"
"I think this tripod is ok if you’re not using it too often, but it’s not great for my needs. The pros: great height adjustment options; portable bag; bluetooth remote (but I haven’t tried that yet)The cons: very unstable and wiggly; the bendable attachment can’t be bent very far or the tripod will tip right over; hard to get phone in and out of the holderOverall, it’s not the worst, but it’s not great for me."
"The base of the tripod is comparable to others in quality.  However the bendable arm is very flimsy, the twisted section often becomes loose, and makes the tripod topple over to the ground."
"The tripod itself it’s ok, but the remote control is a nightmare it’s range only step , works only next to the phone."
"Honestly it’s nice. But I will not buy it again, it falls over a lot. Sometimes it stands on its own. The remotes works well but only for the volume which I find okay. I wouldn’t recommend this product."
I love it but a little too heavy when I hook my phone on it
really have to play with it before putting the phone it is very wacky and it not as strong as i would like i an iphone xr not sure if that version is heavier but nevertheless it does get the job done and once you position it just right you can get some good content i also like how easy and fast the remote works !
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                I loved this product since day one! It worked okay for the first use. Aftee about three weeks, the remote won’t connect to my phones Bluetooth. Tried using other phones and it wouldn’t work. So dissapointed because I got it for Christmas family photoshoot."
This is as simple as it comes. I like how cost effective it is. I don’t like the bendy arm because with my phone is to heavy and it tipped over a lot. Without using that part it works fine. It also gets as small as about a foot and a half to over 5 feet.
I’m using this for a portable projector. It feels a little unsteady and wobbly at the top for a larger device. It works but not sure on longevity and how sturdy it is. It is a good size and very portable which is nice.
I’m surprised nobody has mentioned this in their reviews… but I am unable to actually use the gooseneck part because my phone is too heavy and the tripod tips over every time. Very frustrating and disappointing. Returning to find a sturdier one.
The phone could not be secured in a portrait position because the screw to secure the phone holder to the tripod would not secure the phone holder.  Portrait photos would as a result be lopsided instead of vertical.
"Pros:- Nice variation in height! Not so good for things needed 6 inches tall, but it ranges from around a foot to 4-5 feet.- Includes a bluetooth remote compatible with ios and android so you can take pictures remotely- There's a water bubble ruler so you can tell if your phone is arranged perfectly straight.Cons (And the reason why I returned it) :- There's not much you can do if you want to angle your phone above the subject you want to photograph, like if you're doing product photography. It only allows you to tilt the phone forwards or backwards.- If your phone is too heavy it's not sturdy enough to hold it in the position you set it at. I used a Galaxy S23 Ultra which weighed 9.6 oz (272 grams) and the arm would droop all the way unless the phone was set fully upright. Not so good if you want your phone to be angled at a way it's facing downwards.In all fairness my phone came out *after* this was made, but I'm making this review to warn others with heavier phones like mine."
I bought this to use for an unboxing video. and the tripod itself is fine. But the flex arm to use for my phone could barley hold my phones weight. I have the galaxy s 21 ultra. taking off my case helped a bit. But it was def a struggle trying to use and position the arm where I wanted it to be
"I really wanted to love this so much . I was excited to get it.  I use an older phone to watch pluto TV on and series I downloaded too . The phone is iPhone x so its a tiny phone , nothing big and heavy like new models . Sadly no matter how many times I change positions on this thing it falls over .... top heavy from a small tiny phone . I can only imagine what it would do on my new phone I have ."
It’s great for the height but the gooseneck portion doesn’t handle weight at all with my 15 pro max when bent. The stand always tips over.
"I like the easily adjustable height.  The gooseneck is good.But the stand isn't wide enough to prevent toppling over in all cases.If the gooseneck is used too far from center, you must make sure it's lined up over a foot, orig will tip over."
"I just received this item. Taking it out of the box, the remote does not work. There is supposed to be a light that flashes when you turn it on, but it doesn't. There is a battery inside but it is a button battery. No way to tell if the remote is defunct or if the battery is dead until I buy a new battery"
The goose neck is not sturdy enough. I have an iphone mini and it can't hold it's weight properly so i'm gonna return this.
"Really great product! Love that it can be used for a phone, camera, or go pro. I would easily recommend this to anyone! However when the movable attachment is on and it is sideways and not straight on top of the tripod it tends to fall over a lot."
It’s good if you have a small phone. I have a iPhone 14 and I think it’s too heavy for the flexible extension that comes with it. Other than that it is pretty great
I gave this a 2 star review because the tripod with the gooseneck was too flimsy to hold my phone...which was the reason I ordered it.  However the remote worked great!
Broke within the third time of me using it
I bought this because it has the best reviews! But it doesn’t work well with my iphone. Always falls off when i extend it. No matter what i do it’s hard to keep it in a balanced position!
"For the price, this tripod is a good deal, especially if you're using it only indoors. I watched this tripod get blown over in some wind with a camcorder on it, breaking the viewing screen of the camcorder right off. It was not at the highest setting either. So I would recommend using some ballast at the base or only use out of the wind. Otherwise, the height adjustments are really nice. It also doesn't stay tight on the bottom by the legs, that comes loose a lot."
"The lowest mechanism that makes it a tripod doesn’t lock well so it will splay open while using it. The mechanism that holds the phone is also tipsy/wobbly. If you tighten everything up, you can’t pan right and left. Overall it seems the quality is decent and it shrinks down and transports easily. It has many adjustable areas. I’ll be returning and getting something else however."
It arrived missing the main phone holder attachment and remote control.
Not as sturdy as hoped but not too bad
"If you have the patience of a saint, this product will do ok for you. Otherwise, spend the extra $10 and get something better. The flexy part doesn’t hold the weight of my phone and sags down after I let go of it. And it will easily fall over if the legs aren’t positioned just right. The “lock” at the base doesn’t actually lock and will collapse with the slightest pressure. It will work well enough while you purchase something else. Would not recommend to any human."
"Works nice with remote for phone, however can’t see the pictures until completed. Doesn't Came with a bag to carry, need to find your own 😠"
"Love the easiness of adjust height. But it’s so tippy once it’s even slightly tall. The neck isn’t sturdy so it dips down once my phone is in it. And in the wind or even a mild breeze forget it, it tips right over. I do not recommend."
"The Tripod has a lot of features for the price including the remote control. I did not use that remote though. Yesterday I tried to catch the eclipse with my iphone and the tripod fell over when extended most of the way. Needless to say, I am not happy. I hope it is only the screen cover cracked and not the phone. We will see. If I were to buy another tripod, I would look for something more sturdy and substantial."
"I got this a couple days ago specifically for my projector. Was super excited to use it so I put it together. But the first thing I noticed was how wobbly it was even after I squeezed every handle it got. I watched videos of others, went on YT, read reviews to see if I was missing something, but nope. It did not fit! So I decided to return it. I was already returning a bunch of things so decided to take this with me to ups as well. They didn’t have the ‘no packing needed’ option on the amazon app for this item, so I thought I could ask the ups people to do it knowing it’d cost me some money, but based on my previous experience, I thought it’d cost less than $10 to have them pack it and print the shipping label. Little did I know that it would cost me 32 DOLLARS! I paid $19 for this tripod and was asked to pay $32 just because they didn’t let me take it to ups and let them handle the boxing & shipping. I have Prime too, but I guess it doesn’t matter?? Needless to say, I got ripped off. Never buying this brand again. They could’ve been more flexible with returning options."
"I was impressed with the sturdiness of the stand, the ease of use, the remote, and the ability to go up to 67""!  The only problem was that the piece that holds my phone would not tighten to hold my phone securely in place.  I didn't want to run the risk of my phone falling off of the stand so it was returned.  A bummer as the stand itself seemed very sturdy and stable."
The bottom part was glued together and it came off. I wouldn't recommend
While I really do like this stand unfortunately the only flaw it really has is the fact that the gears don’t stay tight and I’ll frequently have to tighten them. I keep my tablet attached for easy reading.
"Good height, but the base is narrow, and has a tendency to tip over in the wind."
"It's a tripod that will work for still photography, would not recommend for video.  It's a bit flimsy when fully extended and the head movement (both pan and tilt) are NOT smooth so I don't recommend this if you plan on doing video with your phone.  Didn't expect the world though with the price. Remote works fine with my iPhone."
"The tripod set up easily, and everything worked very well. Unfortunately, I needed light. I had to return my tripod so I could purchase one with a ring light attached."
"I was so disappointed in this video stand.  I bought this to take videos of my daughters soccer games, but when it finally came to video taping her game, the stand would not stay up (kept falling down) no matter how much I tightened it and the handle would not move from the down position.  There were no instructions in the box, so I thought maybe I did not know how to adjust or move it, so I asked someone who has these stands and he or my husband could not get the handle to move.The only way I could move the phone back and forth was by touching the part that holds your phone in place and moving that back and forth (very cumbersome and not a good way to take a video).Maybe I received a bad one out of the bunch, but since I already used it once on my daughters game, I don't think I can return it, and can only throw it away."
We bought this to use on family outings to take pictures. The tripod is a little rickety and the blue tooth controller doesn’t work consistently. Good price for something like this but I guess you get what you pay for. We still got some nice photos using it but it’s not as efficient or effective as we would have preferred.
Works great very sturdy
"Anyone who has worked with a gimbal on a tripod, be it portable or stationary, understands the importance of the minute adustments made possible with a gimbal mount, or at the very least a swivel base. My tripod arrived with no ability to move the head once the phone is mounted except by ""clicking"" in pre-measured increments, or by turning the whole tripod from the legs. The telescoping poles don't swivel, the head doesn't swivel. End of story. Bad tripod, particularly since I purchased this for tabletop and close-up work. since I didnt' try the remote control, I have no opinion on it. Other than the fact that it doesn't work as a camera tripod, this plastic thing adjusts up and down nicely."
"Try pairing remote, with my iPhone does not work!Box it came in packaging no bubble wrap nothing in plastic wrapped remote was loose in box remote does not work. How can I take pictures if it’s extended out disappointed sending back."
"The tripod is fine; however, it only holds phone in portrait mode (can’t flip).  It’s light so a strong breeze may blow it over.  The worst thing about this set is the remote.  It won’t work if it’s behind a person, so one cannot have a hand behind someone’s or their own back, for example to take a picture - it doesn’t work if blocked by a person."
"I’ll lead with the fact that this is not my first tripod purchase. I use them quite frequently. I like this one because of the height, however the phone mount required tightening and adjusting constantly. Ultimately, a piece fell off and could not be reattached."
I was disappointed this couldn't work for me since I was able to get it at such a good price. However the base wouldn't lock into place so every time I stood it up it kept sliding down. And then the holder itself that clamps the iPhone into place was good but the flexible head/stand that it was on couldn't support the weight of my phone so it kept bending down and it wouldn't lock in place no matter how tightly I tried to lock it or what position I had it in. Maybe the other type of head is better but alas this was unusable for me and I had to return this tripod.
"This is the worst tripod for streaming, taking pictures/video, etc. there’s no way to have the background not include some of the tripod. For what this is marketed for- there are way better options. It ruins all my content and it’s just a waste of money."
"I purchased this product to use as a hands free holder, when watching my Android phone.  On the contrary to what the description says, (even without the case) the Android does NOT fit into the holder.  The ONLY way ro make it fit, is if the phone is placed sideways in the holder; and even IF you (finally) do get the phone into the holder, another MAJOR problem presents itself... the tripod canNOT hold the weight of the phone, and the entire tripod tips falling over - NO STABILITY.With this... my phone was damaged.I AM TIRED of these lying sellers providing providing lower than subpar products."
This item is of the poorest quality! I was told by Amazon that they would pay for a return shipping and that they would be picking up the item from my home only two never have that happen! Amazon is one of the worst companies to ever do business with! Not only do they not follow delivery instructions but then their items are of poor quality!
"Not actually compatible with iPhone 13. Have to download an app but the app sucks and doesn’t work. After reading all the reviews of the app, I found only 1 person who actually got the app to work. I can’t get app to work. Very disappointed after waiting a week for this to get delivered."
"Alright I'm giving a warning bc I didn't get one, all I saw was good reviews. Save your money. This item wasn't expensive but if you're living on a budget it is. Nothing was wrong with the delivery. Set up was somewhat easy everything seemed alright until I put my camera on it. It kept falling over. No matter how I stabilized it. The locks don't lock at all. It doesn't adjust like it claims. It's more a pain in the ass. I hate writing bad reviews. This is more of a caution for others to consider before buying. I'm giving you a real a review."
"I returned the item. Return process was fairly simple and straightforward (through UPS and not Whole Foods).I bought this for a phone tripod. While it does turn 360 degrees and adjust up and down, it does not PAN or TILT, or rather make adjustments while shooting. Rather, this is a selfie stick or a phone stand, but not a tripod. (Plus, it was missing the bluetooth remote.) But otherwise, it seemed, upon inspection, of good quality construction."
Get yourself a better one. This broke after a week and i barely used it. but like they say you get what you paid for. look at other options unless you want to waste money.
Did not include the phone mount with my package.
Extended or not it can't support the weight of a cell phone in order to use it I have to put a bean bag on one of the feet to hold it down
"Can't get it to work. Looks nice with a leveler and clip lock. The part the holds the phone upright won't get screwed in, even with lots of muscle power."
"This pod tri’d.It always breaks within a week of using it, the lock mechanism never works right eitherMy remote was glitchy too"
"Not much bad to say about the tripod? Except? The handle strips very quickly, works good, easy to use. But does not last long. I am on my second one and that one just stripped out a couple of days ago. I am pissed."
"when you set up up any the highest setting, my google pixel just makes it fall over.  the gooseneck doesn't stay tight so it swings around when its angled.  Pretty much useless unless you're holding it like a selfie stick without the gooseneck.  don't buy this."
"Quality build and functions as expected, the major issue however is that the bottom legs will pinch you BAD!  if your hand is down there as you adjust.  I have had countless stands and never have I seen such a hazard.  It a bit painful when it pinches (see pictures)"
I had high hopes for this product.  Very flimsy.  The only thing great about it is the height. Would not purchase again and do not recommend.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Do not buy! It’s just cheap plastic! Knobs do not work properly! Not worth the time or money.
Broke within a few weeks. First the phone holder snapped and then the flexible arm snapped. Very unstable and falls over very easy
"Was very excited to receive the tripod because it is extremely tall however it is very flimsy. It sways if you are trying to take pictures in a windy place and once your phone is attached to the gooseneck, it will become very unstable."
"Less than a couple days after I got the stick, one of the legs broke. I had bought a selfie stick from the same brand before, and the same thing happened. The quality of materials used is not good, although the stick is functional and tall. So it’s a pass for me, 3/4, meh grade"
"I love the versatility of the tripod, but I was desperate for the remote to work. All it does is turn the volume up and down on my phone, which was completely pointless. I really needed a remote to stop and start my videos."
The height options are great. More routing options for different angles would be just as great.
"this stand does not work the legs are not sturdy, had to throw in trash. ive found better cheaper price beware it is cheaply made"
Broke after 3rd use and didn't come with a remote.
"Sigh... our daughter really wanted to like this product to film her drawing.  But, as soon as she put her tiny small iphone on it, the tripod tilted/fell flat.  I just can't believe anything like this would be manufactured."
Pieces unscrew and get lost easily so watch out for that. I barely used Jr and lost important parts.
"It’s OK but IMO it’s too heavy and large, even when folded it won’t fit regular backpacks"
"I (22, F) bought this tripod for my wedding. When I was woken in up in my slumber, I stepped on it. It hurt my foot. It sliced it. Do not step on the metal while half asleep. It is dangerous. You might end like me and have to walk on your heel and apply neosporin every morning. Make sure you put the bandaid on it too so you don’t have to peel the sock off."
This thing is the biggest piece of junk.It’s weak. It’s flimsyYou cannot use the extended flexible attachment at all.You can try countering the weight by bending and angling but good luck. This thing falls no matter what you do.THE ONLY REASON THIS WAS ON SALE IS BECAUSE OF HOW CRAP IT IS.
"The tripod is a steal, a low price and it performs well. It's easy to adjust, has plenty of adjustments, and is very easy to setup. It does everything it needs to."
I like the quality of the product
"it doesn’t move, only up and down, which is not very convenient for filming"
Wish the bluetooth had more distance on it. You cant be too far from the tripod or it doesn't work which kind of defeats the purpose of the bluetooth remote
As soon as I attach my phone to it it starts falling over. I should have paid more money for a better one!!
"product came bent up and defective in package, but i had to take it on vacation so i said i would still use it . when i got to the airport the bag the product comes in ripped suddenly (very cheap material) , causing the tripod to fall out and completely snap. didnt even get to use it . 😒 because i really need the product im going to purchase it again but hopefully i dont experience this again .mine did come with the remote ."
Too light to stand up. the phone was heavy for it that it tipped over. Then during adjustment I broke it. ( this part I would say was my error ).
Cheaply made even with the righting screws loosened all they way it’s all still so stiff that the hand broke first time trying to turn it
The stand itself works great but the shutter remote came with it for my iPhone never worked (bluetooth never paired). I have I iPhone 13 mini and the latest iOS 16.2
I purchased to film content as a eyeLash tech. My iPhone tilts the tripod it’s not sturdy what so ever!I have to try and keep my foot on a leg of the base. Will be purchasing a different tripod. Don’t recommend.
"You cannot shoot a straight vertical shot with this stand if using a cell phone. It will always be tilted drastically to one side. This is very disappointing, but I am otherwise satisfied with this purchase."
"Light tripod, which is fine, and remote works. Quite wobbly, which is to be expected, given that the three legs are only at the bottom and the phone is just supported by a long vertical rod. My main gripe is that at least one of the axes will not lock the phone in place regardless of how much its locking nut is tightened down. The phone therefore droops or tilts (depending on how you have the whole assembly oriented). Somewhat disappointing, even for a cheap tripod."
Bummer - This doesn’t hold my I-phone in its case. Everyone has a case so I’m not sure why they made it so tight. It looked promising out of the box… but I had to send it back. Bummer!
The lens does have a rotary zoom rather than the push/pull from the original EF version. But it is still a dust magnet. It sucks in dust when you zoom out and you have to mail it in to get it cleaned by Canon.
"Looking at the MTF Chart from Canon this lens is not as good as other real tele zooms. Compared to Nikon 500mm (and similar) at 30lines/mm the contrast is about 83% in the center. The Nikon 200-500 and 500mm are above 95 - 98%. That means you need to get much closer to get the shot with this lens which is around 2 pounds lighter than the 200-500 from Nikon. Zoom range is fantastic and sharpness is highest at 100mm focal length.At 500mm it is a f/7.1 lens. You want to go to F8 -9 to get the sweet spot of sharpness, if there is good light. Perhaps mirrorless reduces this issue by putting the focal point you choose to the best sharpness by the AF system. Everything else could be less sharp. Shooting single point or eye-AF is perfect to maximizes quality of your pictures with this lens.AF is great on R5/6, which I have tested. Birds in flight takes good skills and a specific setup, like double back button AF setup.Perhaps for its weight, and size you will grab this more often than not to go hiking. This may even justify the high price for a lot of people locked into Canon gear. If money and sneaking close onto your subjects is not a problem it is the recommended solution. The limitation with the RF teleconverter isn't such a big issue - It is just a cumbersome.IS is works good on R5/6 perhaps not 8 stops as advertised. (8 stops = 256 times longer exposure time for a sharp shot.) It about 5 stops at 100mm and 3 stops 500mm.The RF800mm Is essentially a 500mm lens with a 1.6x tele converter. Perhaps it is much less sharp comparing the MTFs. The 30 line/mm from the graph becomes with the teleconverter a 19mm/ line graph."
"I’m giving 3 stars because to be fair the amount of pics I took with this lens was really minimum but I ended up returning it because #1 IS HEAVY (but really really really heavy) as soon I felt the weight I knew there is not way I will bring that lens with meAlmost anywhere. In addition to that, the only few pics I took really didn’t look too different to the photos a normally take with any of my other lenses. The photos where just like random photos of the front of my place but I wasn’t really impressed or excited about the photos I saw like to pay that amount of money."
"Nice glass works well with Canon R5. But it just isn’t fast enough for the price. After F4.5, I constantly have to change settings on the camera which makes me think it should be faster on the long end. At 100mm, it’s fine but at 300mm+ I would rather spend more money and get a faster lens.The reach is nice. The glass is amazing. It’s just not fast enough."
I wanted this lens to be great but it’s just not as sharp as a Canon RF lens normally is.  I was  disappointed and sent it back.  Maybe it’s just this particular lens.
"I just received this lens last week and took it on a birding trip over the weekend. Out of 491 pictures, less than 10 were as sharp as a lens of this price point should be, which I have to assume were just coincidences. I've watched dozens of reviews on this lens, and I know its sharper than this. So, when I got home I went to my local neighborhood lake and took 200 more photos in perfect light and very close distance from birds that are used to being around people. Again, less than 10 were sharp.I know this isn't a 600mm F4 prime and I don't expect that type of performance, but this thing is significantly less sharp than my kit 70-300 that I used to shoot on my rebel T7i. When I can't get a tack sharp picture of a perched yellow-headed-black-bird that is less than 8 feet away with a $3,000 lens, something is wrong.All sample pics were taken on stationary birds, from between 6 and 15 feet. 300-500 mm, F5.6 -  F7.1, ISO between 100, shutter 1/100 - 1/250I have submitted a return request. Amazon only over a refund, otherwise I would request a replacement. I will order another of the same and hope to amend my review soon with good news and 5 stars across the board!"
"I believe, Canon was once a good photography company, and Amazon was once a good shipper. In my case, things on their end were not excruciated correctly, and everything went wrong, and neither company performed as they should.Amazon delivered my signature-required cameras by throwing my package at my front door without the required signature (I was home hearing it). I was so upset about Amazon throwing my cameras I purchased the extra insurance through Canon at $550.00 to keep them safe.Oh boy, no! They said I purchased the warranty after 90 days; it is only one-month old. Next, I had to apply this new warranty to the camera, and their systems went crazy! They should do this in their house! Next, it cost me hours of communications with Canon to get a warranty on the camera Amazon throw at my front door. RUN AWAY!!! Please don't buy from Canon or Amazon! Neither company performed well and cost me extra warranties!"
The item send to me was used and defective.
"Was disappointed in this RF lens. It is a good quality lens, when I am used to great quality, sharp as a tack L series Canon lenses. Was hoping for better to replace my heavier 500mm lens and my 100-400 L series lenses, but the quality isn’t quite there yet."
Paid for a NEW lens; received a lens that had been returned.
"I have a love/hate relationship with this lens.  In good light, the results are fantastic.  But if we're honest with ourselves, many lenses deliver in good light.  F7.1 is unacceptably slow for this price. Nikon's 180-600 has more reach and is fast at f6.3, and significantly less expensive to boot.I've also had a number of focus issues when the lens is fully racked out.  It have to pull it back to 300mm, focus, and then zoom in and refocus.  I've lost too many shots because of this.Build quality is excellent, and if this lens was under $2000 I'd have been a lot happier with it.It's just too expensive for what it is."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I really don't like the IS unit design of this lens. Check the following video out for what I meant. The IS unit inside the lens barrel is not parked while not powered. People say that this is by design to save weight. Since this is a fairly new lens, I am not sure if Canon has long-term testing on this. If you are a very active photographer, be aware of this while traveling/hiking. For the long term, not sure a lot of the normal shaking will cause center alignment issues. Other than this, it is a good lens."
"I've been a Sony camera fan for 15 years and have owned one or several of them for that long. I don't know if they are ""better"" than the competing brands because I've never really given them a chance. Sony has always managed to convince me that my pictures turn out better than they should, because their cameras are better at photography than I am. That's all really want in a camera is to know that I am limiting its potential and not the other way around.I moved to full frame with te a7 and on to the a7ii which is what I used this lens on. I had previously used the zeiss 55 1.8 as prime on a7, which might have ruined me on the topic because that lens is magical. I had hoped this would come close with a vastly lower price tag so I gave it a chance.It is a good lens. But when placed on the a7ii in my hands it rapidly presents itself as the weakest link. Despite updating firmware the autofocus just didn't do what Sony does so well, which is get me the picture without much input from me.It's priced fairly and you'll get nice shots at the 50mm range with it for sure, so if you just need a cheap good lens I give it five stars for that. But if you're shooting full frame the follow up question is why you are putting a good cheap lens on a $1,500 camera.I couldn't answer that to my satisfaction, and this is the only lens or Sony camera product I've ever opted to return. Not because it isn't good, but because it isn't just totally amazing.If you're in the a7 line, spring for the zeiss 55. It really is worth it. The non-zeiss Sony 28mm and the Sony 85mm 1.8 (not the G just the basic) are fantastic as well. All three of these deliver what I want in primes, the 50 gives me no enthusiasm over a variable lens. It's just a good cheap lens. With funk af AF..."
"I returned this lens, because the AF is actually as bad as everyone says it is.I compared it directly to my 30+ year old minolta 50mm 1.7 mounted on an LA-EA4 adapter on my A7ii camera.  The Minolta focused faster indoors.  That is ridiculous.  This lens is an embarrassment for Sony.  I wish they made something under $500 before stepping up to the Ziess.  The 85mm 1.8 is a masterpiece and sells for $600, so Sony just needs to put that focusing tech into a 50.Meanwhile, if you are looking for a cheap prime, I would recommend the samyang 35mm 2.8.  It is super small and only 85 grams, it focuses faster than this lens and is often on sale for about the same price.  If you keep the subject centered and can crop, you won't get the same DOF, but with more responsive AF you will have more keepers when trying to keep up with moving subjects or lower light.Until Sony makes a better version of this lens under $500, I will stick with a pair of 35mm and 85mm FE lenses that can be acquired new, on sale, for about $820.  If you need this focal length, the 55mm 1.8 is the only AF option.  Otherwise, pick up an older fast manual focus nifty 50 and a cheap adapter, and you will probably have better results than this clunker of a 50mm."
"I was so looking forward to this, an inexpensive fast prime lens for the Sony FE mount and have been so comprehensively disappointed by it that I have to write a brief review. I've used this lens for portraiture, architectural and some nature photography in various lighting conditions and it is almost universally worse than even the A7's kit lens. Here are its problems:Focusing time - This lens takes so incredibly long to focus, even in decent light, that it is painful to make your subjects wait for the shutter click. In low light, just forget about it finding the right focus, because it will fail you every time.Focusing quality - Not only does the lens take too long to focus, when it actually ""finds"" focus and the focus peaking will indicate something is in focus, using the DMF and focus magnification assist will help you learn that no, what it thinks is in focus is actually still quite blurry and the focus point is either in front or behind your subject. This constant need for fiddling to find the exact focus point essentially renders the autofocus useless.Focusing sound - As others have pointed out, this lens is rather loud and its use for video is really limited unless using an off-camera recording device a significant distance from the lens itself.Cyan fringing - After a long portraiture session, I launched Photoshop to discover that all of my photos shot at 1.8 had serious, irreparable fringing around the models, requiring a serious investment of editing time just to get the photos usable. And we're talking several pixels deep of cyan fringing. Astoundingly unacceptable.I should point out that I've used this with both the Sony A7 and the A6000 with similar results, and that both cameras were on the latest firmware (as of November 2016), and that none of these issues that have plagued the lens since launch have been addressed. At this point, the lens has decreased in price and I can't get much money for it used, so I will just hang on to it at hope that Sony fixes the massive issues it has created for itself with this truly underwhelming lens. Please buy any other prime, even if it means spending more."
"For the price you really don't have another native lens option. As others have stated the auto-focus on this lens is probably the worst of any native FE mount lens. First it uses a DC motor, so lots of pulsing to focus. Also the motor is fairly audible so not the best choice in video. For the price the image quality is excellent. Bokeh is smooth and non distracting. The lens design is some what of a 'classic' so it is more susceptible to flare than many modern lenses.I have actually found using this in continuous autofocus increases the usability of the focus greatly. For some reason single focus loves to hunt and give up in low contrast situations when the continuous does a much better job.Video auto focus is a lot better than you would expect, but I would say it's critical that you have an external mic or you might pick up clicks from the DC motor.I recently received my A7III with Sony's newest focusing technology and the same issues remain, and the lens is at the latest firmware (3)."
"I'm using this on a Gen 1 Sony A7.Picture quality:  4.5/5 - excellent color, nice bokeh, good skin tones, it's not a Zeiss, but for the price, you're getting seriously good image quality.Focus speed:  1/5 - It's not good.  And by not good, I mean slow.  There's a lot of hunting and it takes much longer than it should to lock on.  Even in good light, which is the most disappointing part of the lens.Build:  3/5 - it's a nifty fifty and is built slightly better than the nifty fifty from Canon.  Good quality plastic.  Feels good in the hand.  It's very light, just like Canon's fifty.Sharpness:  I won't rate this quite yet, but it seems to be good.  Again, not Zeiss sharp, but it looks good.Were it not for the near unacceptable focus speed, this would be a strong 4/5 if for nothing else other than value, but it's that bad.I'm going to try to upgrade the firmware and hopefully that will help.  I'll update if that is the case."
"For the price you pay do not expect amazing things. This lens struggles in low light to get focus and is considerably louder than most lenses. Video is low light will result in the lens wandering at times to find a focal point as you move. For toy or model figure shooting this works well in a controlled and well lit environment but you cannot get too close as the focal distance leaves a little to be desired. I am ordering a couple extension adapters to compensate for that focal distance. For portraits, this lens does a pretty good job for people on a budget. Expect good clean images at around f3.5-4 and if you are using full frame you get pretty good bokeh. The bokeh may not be as smooth as some would like however. I would shoot lights in low light and could clearly make out the edges in the bokeh balls where the blades form the aperture were picked up.Overall a good lens but not great. You get what you pay for.Shooting with Sony A7"
"Initial impression review, mounted on A7 II:1. Appearance and build quality is nice. It matches the A7 aesthetic. Metal mount, plastic body. (3.5/5 stars)2. Image quality for still photographs is good. It's a prime. Sharp in center, less sharp in corners. Some CA. Stepping down helps a lot. (4/5 stars)3. Autofocus for photography is ok. But the DC motor in it is loud compared to other E-mount and FE mount lens. I had to turn off pre-focusing cause it was noisy. Turning off live preview increases AF speed and accuracy for still photography but I like having this setting on to see what the image will look like in real time. So it's annoying. I don't use the camera for video, but other reviews here have noted that the lens is too noisy for video. (2/5 stars)So for now the overall review is 3.2 stars out of 5. I will keep it though and hope for a firmware update (hoping, not expecting). Decent for still photography."
"For what is costs, the sharpness of my lens was really quite impressive.  Unfortunately, the ability to lock focus is the reason for such a low rating.  A sharp lens that cannot lock on is not worth much to me so it was returned.  There's always the option to manual focus, but there are better and faster lens if you want to go that route.  I paired this lens with my Sony A7II (with current firmware) so newer camera versions may have better luck with the focusing. With that being said, for a couple hundred dollars, I'd still say this lens is worth a shot.  The plastic body keeps the lens lightweight and the sharpness is great - just keep your fingers crossed that it's able to lock on!"
I expected new item but box was damaged Like it was used before I didn't find any information that it will be used
"I was extremely excited when they announced this lens.  As poor photographer that shoots with Sony's excellent new mirrorless A7 system, I had hoped it, like the ""nifty 50"" Canon 50mm 1.8, would offer exceptional image quality on a budget.  Unfortunately, not only does it fall short of the Canon, there is absolutely nothing I can say to justify the purchase of this lens- it literally does NOTHING well.The first problem you will discover, is that when combined with the mirrorless cameras, the autofocus is as close to useless as anything I have ever experienced.  When shooting anything darker than outside, mid-day direct sunlight, the lens will hunt for up to 10 seconds, then lock on to absolutely nothing.  The recent firmware update helped this, but if I were rating it on a scale of 1-5, it would go from a 1 to a 2.  This alone renders the lens utterly useless for a professional, but it's honestly so bad I don't think an amateur could find any use for it either.Next, the image quality is utter garbage.  The chromatic abberations and color reproduction are some of the worst I have ever experienced:  Worse than cheap canon kit lenses, and certainly worse than the cheap 28-70mm kit lens that comes with the Sony A7II.In conclusion, there is NO reason for anyone to purchase this lens, ever.  Save your money for the overpriced but excellent 55m Zies."
"I am actually a Canon photographer so it was expected that I would purchase the metabones adapter since my A7sii would be used primarily for video and I have a large Canon lens kit. That said I recently purchased this lens because I have been using the A7sii for vacations and this form factor is light and more convenient. I never used the auto focus on it since I rarely use it anyway and the metabones supports it, but not that well. With the Sony lens I was expecting it to work great since it's a Sony product, but in fact it bricked the auto focus all together and even the metabones doesn't work now. My camera is way passed the return date and now I'm stuck with it and see no reason to return this lens since the manual spot focus works and that's primarily what I use. Great little lens for the money but at a cost of messing up you auto focus, which this camera is prized for. So I would reconsider before buying this lens"
"I have the same lens in the crop-sensor version, and I was excited to have this in the rotation when I moved to full frame. It works as expected, but I was disappointed in the build quality. It's not expensive for what it does, however (product photography in this case) and I still recommend it, but it is the definitely the cheapest feeling of several Sony brand lenses I own."
I purchased this lens for my sony a6000. I was looking for an inexpensive portrait lens and decided to give this a try. Picture quality I'd good but is slow to focus and is quite noisy while attempting to find focus. I would probably spend the extra $200 for the SEL E 50mm f/1.8 lens which has very good reviews. Good lens if you are looking to ad a 50mm prime lens at a low cost but the slow and noisy focusing is a little frustrating. Still takes good photos for the $$$ spent.
The price is really great. The len produce sharp image at this price and near quality of 55mm f1.8 len. The only thing I dont like about this len is that auto focus a little bit slow and noisy. I need to update firmware to fix auto focus hunting issue. Auto focus issue give me so much trouble to solve the problem. If I didnt do any research I will never ever fix the auto focus hunting  problem. Note: I saw a lot of review mention A7MK2 & A7R2 & A7S2 have no auto focus hunting issue after update latest firmware.
"Compared to price performance it's great, but, not so great in comparison with other 50mm F1.8 by other manufacturers for their own camera suites, i.e Nikon lens for Nikon FF, Canon for Canon FF etc. Sony has an awesome 50mm f1.8 OSS for NEX line at same price bracket, don't know why they couldn't build one for full frame, maybe they want to push their expensive Zeiss line.Really noisy and too slow to auto focus, it hunts a lot in low light;  but works great, actually too good as MF or DMF."
"I may exchange it or wait for a firmware update. Sharp throughout from f4 up, there is a lot of fringing in the corners from 1.8 to f4. I suspect that will get better as we get updates. I will update this once I know more. I am sure that the issues with the AF will get fixed but right now it is not working real well. I own or have owned 6 other Sony FE lenses, but got none on opening day."
"The first thing I noticed with this lens is it's incredibly LOUD autofocus motor. In addition, autofocus is not always accurate and can take a while to converge.I didn't spend much time analyzing the photos it takes but my first impression is they lack the wow factor provided by my other prime lenses. I am by no means a camera expert, but I'm not satisfied with this product. I will return it and try the Zeiss 35mm instead."
"This lens is very light, size and weight are what is expected from a mirrorless lens. However, optical resolution and sharpness are subpar, never sharp enough even with no motion. I used it on A7RII and the lens can’t match 42MP, there’s just not enough optical quality. Autofocus is on the worse side among any other AF lens I experienced: it keeps hunting for focus, makes noises, slow. As a parent I have to shoot the kids running around and I expect the lens to freeze the moment right there but this one is too slow, by the time it focuses, the subject is gone. I understand this is one of the cheapest Sony AF lenses but after 1 days of shooting with it I learned even f/4 Olympus MFT system is sharper and has faster AF."
"I was sold with several reviews recommending 50mm prime lenses, although the picture quality is fantastic, I still don’t find much reasons to spend on this one, I find the 25-55mm lense included in the A6000 bundle is very handy.I agree, the portraits you can take with this one is a big seller, but most times indoors ans small spaces a 35mm can be more useful than this one."
"I couldn't decide between 3 or 4 stars. I'm very well aware that you get what you pay for so I wasn't expecting the absolutely greatest lens on the market but the focusing is just insanely loud and pretty darn slow. Optically, for the price, it's hard to beat. But the construction/sound of the lens is why I had to drop the points on this one. I would still recommend it if you're on a budget and looking for a fast 50."
"You get what you pay for. If you are not shooting pro shoots and just want to practice/everyday photos, this is a fine product. - Not for pixel peepers.If you are working or looking to become a professional photographer, I would not recommend this lens and would definitely recommend buying the best you can afford. Invest in quality.This lens is not sharp, although I did like that it was a very fast lens for the price.Pros- light weight- fast lens, cheap- Great for travel if you don't care about this lens getting beat upCons- cheap build- images are not sharp- extremely slow and loud Auto focusing (compared to the Sony Zeiss, G, and Gmaster series)"
"The image quality is very nice, probably not as good as the upgrade but for the price it's really good. Especially for a starting photographer. However, the auto-focus is not good. It's loud and take forever to focus. I'd say you get what you pay for. If you need a lens to take some quick pictures, get this one. If you need something heavier duty with better focus, upgrade to a better one."
"It is ridiculous that this lens is made in China, and I bought it in Amazon US and shipped it back to China, because Amazon US has the best price. The focusing speed and noise is acceptable on my a5100, but the sharpness is not as good as my expectation. The image is not sharp at f1.8 and chromatic aberration is obvious. I don't have Zeiss 55mm to compare.Maybe my expectation is too high."
"I saw everyones review about the slow focusing. OMG i thought they were exaggerating this thing is really slow especially in low light. When its bright it focuses ok, I've upgraded from an t6i so im used to somewhat fast focusing. Image quality is great though cant complain. Also the AF motor isn't loud in my opinion. It's more quiet than canon's 50 1.8 (Non STM)"
"Poor, sluggish results on my A7. I already had the Sigma Art 60mm f2.8 with the baffle removed, and I was looking forward to the increased control of the depth of field and slightly wider field of view, but I found the autofocus hunting to be very frustrating -- I generally had to use manual focus. I retuned this lens after attempting to use it for about 30 minutes. Also, the image quality seemed rather poor, but this may have been in part due to the fact that the autofocus was both inaccurate and sluggish.  IQ and performance don't hold a candle to the Zeiss 55mm, but of course there's that huge price difference. The Sigma isn't as ""fast"", but provides good, consistent quality with the baffle removed, unlike this thing on my A7."
"I biggest problem I had with this lens was that I felt it was a bit slow (focus) and a bit noisy (focus).  I also noticed that (at least on my copy) that the focus tend to creep or move without input from the camera.  Became very frustrating.  I wound up sending it back.  When I did take pictures with it, they were excellent with very nice quality."
I purchased this lense due to price. The construction is excellent and the image quality it very good. The MAJOR drawback is the AF (auto focus). It really strugles to find and hold focus especially for video. Photos on th ither hand it seems to work just fine.
Had a difficult time focusing but when it did it took really nice pictures. It was just too frustrating to use so I returned it and purchased a more expensive 85. I’d recommend this lens if your patient and not trying to take pictures for other people.
"Picture quality is 5/5 for the price. Build quality is average, but it feels like it'll last. Autofocus holds this lens back.... shooting running dogs/people is challenging and requires a decent learning curve to understand how the lens behaves."
"The image quality of this lens is awesome but it’s autofocus is terrible. It will search for focus, grab focus, then search again without cause. It will also pulse while trying to focus. It is built well and makes great images, but the focusing issues are hard to overlook."
"The image quality is good at this price. But the auto focus is slow and very noisy, and it usually fails when environment is not very bright. I am very disappointed. Given a second chance, I would definitely choose the Zeiss 55mm f1.8."
"As far as image quality, the Sony FE 50 mm F1.8 lens is on par with the other ""nifty-fifty's"" offered by the likes of Canon and Nikon, but I was greatly disappointed with its AF performance, hunting every time (even in daylight). This is a good lens if you're willing to overlook its slow AF performance and are on a budget. If you have the money, invest in the Zeiss 55 mm F1.8 as it blows this lens out of the water in every way. You get what you pay for."
"Picture quality is good for the price but my problem lies with focusing both manual and auto. The focus noise of the lens is loud, which is a problem because i primarily do video.. Also heavy focus breathing. Slow auto focus."
"This lens has pretty decent optics.It's a little soft wide open at f/1.8, but we can't expect perfection for $248. If you stop down a couple stops, it's perfectly capable of capturing sharp images.But what's not fine is the comically slow autofocus.Even in fairly bright light (shooting at ISO 200, f/4, 1/580s), the lens racks in and out quite a bit before achieving focus, and that makes it very frustrating to use.Good gear just gets out of the way.This lens gets in the way.Two thumbs DOWN."
"I had used old cheap nikon 50mm/f1.8 lens (not AFS version, many people complaint about its focusing performance) and had no really hard time about focusing. So, when I read some one mentioned the focusing issue of this lens, I was not serious about that. But after I used it for a while, I would say it's a really problem, sometimes very painful and made me feel very sad to miss those opportunities. Would not recommended."
It is fine for me as an amateur that takes photo from my family time to time.
"As the rest have mention, the lens is slow to focus or just keeps hunting for ever. And that's at f5.6!Otherwise and photo quality wise is a decent nifty 50."
"Preordered this lens with moderate hopes. I knew I would most-likely get a passable image with slow autofocus, probably sharp at about f/4. Which is exactly how this lens performed! I was happy... For about 7 days...Then, I switched on my a7S and heard nothing but a scary clicking sound. I quickly turned it off and checked the lens. Everything looked fine. So I turned it back on... More clicking. Not only clicking, but the lens wasn't responding to anything: the aperture wouldn't open and the focus wouldn't change! It was stuck at f/16 and completely useless.I contacted Amazon and Sony and neither of them provided and customer service. So now I am stuck with a useless, $300 piece of fisher price plastic.Would not recommend to a friend."
The lens itself is built ok but the focus hunts way too much and can be slow at times. The quality of the picture once focused is very good.
"After upgrading both the firmware on the a7r camera and 50mm lens, the auto focus did improved a bit but it's the lens is pretty loud.  If you don't mind the noisy focus motor and are on a budget, I would recommend it."
"i do really love it , really good lens ,just bad for deliever, they throw out it to my front door, voice is very loud, I am not sure it's damaged in the further easily or not . I felt it's able to have a complain."
"This lens is beautiful, sharp and marvelous. But the autofocus `hunts.' I suspect that a firmware update should fix this. But I am bugged about it. With the exception of the auto-focus `hunt,' I would give the lens four stars."
It’s a cheap lens so the build quality won’t be great. AF is slow and is pretty inaccurate. It gets the job done.
"I finally had to send it back. I thought I could simply use it with manual focusing and it works great that way but too many times I needed the camera to do the work for me because I didn't have time to manually focus without losing the photo I was seeking. Also, when it does attempt to focus, it's rather loud."
"very sharp and light weight ,great shallow depht of field ,I would  have given a 4 star if it was not for the noise it make when focusing, and it worth the $198.00 no more maybe less."
"Size and price are great. Sharpness was not there for me. I was going to use this on my a7, but using my a6000 with my 28mm 2.0 yielded better results."
Compact and light weight. But autofocus hunt in my a7iii
The Autofocus take a while to focus and sometimes it doesn't focus on the subject. Not the best but you do get some clear shots when you are shooting manual.
Awesome IQ. The focusing just didn't cut it for me. I had read it was slow but I never thought it would be this slow
"Everyone: The autofocus on this lens is TERRIBLE. Just look through any other review site before making the mistake of purchasing. I'm saying the focusing is barely usable. Seriously, it will hunt in any light over and over. In low light the lens simply will not gain focus."
"Takes forever to focus, sometimes mis-focusing a quick-moving shot. Ok for the price, but sucks since it's Sony glass for a Sony body. Wouldn't purchase again, also couldn't afford the $1k lens... So I guess you get what you pay for. Great depth of field like any 50mm lens, but auto-focus is s*%#."
"Nice lens. I'm still on the fence about the sharpness. It's great quality, but only ""ok"" in the sharpness category."
"Loud on focus, not a quick focus. But gets the job done for the price."
"Doesn't allow for manual focus in photo modes, takes a while to focus, but not bad for the price"
Good lens for semi- pro photographers!
"PROS:-This lens is plenty sharp on my A7S.-Autofocus works well above 3-4/fCONS:-Overpriced. You can buy a Canon 50mm for $140 less. Shame on you, Sony.-Made of cheap feeling plastic-Kind of squeaky when adjusting focus"
Image quality is actually very nice but I really just couldn’t deal with how slow the auto focus is on this lens.  Having to wait 4-5 seconds for the lens to focus is a deal breaker for me.
Cons: The focus hunts. The focus is much slower than the kit lens. Noisy. There's a lot of green fringing in the bokeh.Pros: It's light in weight.
Terrible hunting lag during auto-focus.I have the A7ii and A6300. Same issue with both.The focus drag is unbearable.I was satisfied with the image quality for the $$.2 stars with the current focus hunt - 3.9 stars without
picture quality is good but focusing is slow and noisy.
not professional but works!
The lens is very sharp but the auto focus is hit or miss. It’s very noisy when trying to acquire focus and in low light it’s practically impossible to have it grab focus. If you shoot in low light I would strongly suggest going with another option.
It's ok
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I got an A7II with the kit 28-70mm, then I got 24-240mm which I love. Then i got this. I didn't think Sony would put out such crap. Might have been OK 2015-2016, they need to stop selling it ASAP.Ok pictures, really cheap plastic, sounds like a lawn mower when focusing."
Invest in something else. The autofocus is horrendous. You're better off buying an old vintage manual focus lens than buy this.
"Ok sharpness but it's extremely slow to focus and very loud. It's actually worse than my $50 yongnuo lens that I use on my Canon crop sensor camera.It's an ok buy if you urgently need a nifty fifty... Otherwise, save your money. Because holy crap... 👎🏾"
"Well priced, good quality build. However, it is very slow to focus (forget about shooting your kid with it!)."
Can't speak on it's application for photography but don't even think about using this lens for video. GAHBAHGE
very noisy and is much slower getting in focus then the kit lens.
"The auto focus on this lens is very lacking, makes a lot of noise and does not end of focusing. I tested it in a few shots and returned it within an hour of receiving it."
"Had to return it, I have a Sony A7RII and this lens won't focus.  Keeps searching, searching, click, then a blurry photo.  Sad, because the reviews weren't bad, so either I got a bad one or this lens sucks!"
Fringing is unbearable! Don't waste your money.
"The autofocus is too slow. for a 50mm f1.8 you expect fast focus.  this doesn't deliver.  The cropped lens is way faster.  Sad, the pics are decent, but now great."
"I received the wrong lens, the post specified a fe (full frame lens) and I received a crop sensor lens."
You get what you pay for.Simple as that.In one word this lens it's Cr@p
"This lens is a pain. Not sharp, and has trouble focusing. Get the 55mm."
"slow and noisy focusing, works as the price."
"For what it is, It's a nice little lens.  I put it on an a7riii, as the only lens I initially purchased when I purchased the camera. Coming from Nikon, and using almost exclusively Nikon's nifty 50 1.4, I was extremely disappointed.  This lens comes nowhere close to Nikon's (and presumably Canon's) version.  AF is slow, and hunts quite a bit, sometimes never finding focus at all where Nikon's 50mm nails it no problem (tested side by side).  I had high hopes, though I had read negative reviews.  Sometimes you read negative reviews and find that they are unfounded and people are just complaining and having high expectations.  I guess this review could be one of those maybe, lol.  Don't get me wrong, for the money its a nice lens, and if you are outside on a bright day, taking pictures of slow moving or still objects, $200 is an absolute steal and I would highly recommend it.  However, if you are taking pictures indoors, expect the lens to hunt for focus quite a bit.  And in extreme low light situations it is frustrating but sometimes workable.  ultimately, it was the lens I bought so I could start taking pictures immediately while deciding on which ""pro"" lens to buy (I'm not a pro at all).  So for that purpose, it was a success.  I love 50mm focal length, so I ended up buying the Zeiss 50mm 1.4 and while it's HUGE, I love that lens so much. But. despite the excellent image  I still throw this little lens on the camera sometimes for around the house and sometimes as a walk around though due to it's size and convenience, although I would love to check out the 55 1.8 for that purpose eventually.In terms of picture quality, it does actually take pretty stellar images.  It's just that getting that stellar image is sometimes difficult with this lens.  And although I could definitely and immediately tell the difference between this lens and the zeiss, my wife had a hard time guessing which was which when looking at pictures.  All in all, $200 is a great deal for a lens like this, if you think of it as a starter lens before a larger purchase."
"Pros- Decent image quality.Cons- Slow and noisy auto focus.- if you are interested in video I would say stay away as the sound of the lens focusing will get picked up.- The front element extends slightly when you turn the camera on - not a big deal, but thought it was worth mentioning.This might be an OK first lens if you are just starting out.The 55mm F1.8 Sonnar is a much better lens (quiet, fast focus, great image quality, not much bigger), and is 4 times the price.50mm f1.8 lenses are traditionally good but cheap... but I dont think there is currently an option that properly fits the bill for the A7.The FE 50mm F1.8 Standard Lens is cheap but I would say not good enough.The 55mm F1.8 Sonnar is great, but is perhaps more than 2 times the cost it should be (compare this to the prices of the Nikon or Canon f1.8 equivalent).I've bought and sold a lot of lenses over the years (including this one).If I were to do it all over again, I would skip this lens and either spend more to get the1.8 Sonnar, or wait for good 3rd party lenses (Sigma, Tamron Tokina)"
"The biggest complaint about this lens in its short time since its release has been autofocus - speed and sound. I'm using it on an A7II, and the focus speed can be really, REALLY slow. In this way (running current firmware 3.10, by the way), I'm surprised (and skeptical) that I read so many pre-release reviews claiming quick AF. It's not. There are times when it can acquire focus in a little less than a second, but other times where it will hunt for 2-3 seconds before finally locking on; sometimes, it confirms focus when it's not in focus. Anyone accustomed to DSLR-speed focus will be sorely disappointed. Mirrorless users will still be left wanting better.I've been using older Minolta AF lenses (50mm f1.4 and f1.8) via the LA-EA4 adapter, and they are notably faster. I'm holding out for a firmware update, as this sort of thing should be able to be remedied in that manner; otherwise, it's hard to recommend for anything other than completely static subjects.I don't find the sound of the autofocus to be objectionable, except that it takes so long to acquire focus (regardless of lighting conditions) that the sound of back-and-forth racking of the lens is annoying.Image quality seems to be quite good for a consumer-grade fast prime. Colors are nice, lens seems very sharp above f4, and center is great at 2.8. Again, though, compared to the older Minolta 50mm f1.7, this falls behind.Assuming Sony can release a firmware update before the return period is over, I'll hold out for that and update my review."
"This lens has relatively high image quality, but I returned mine.The autofocus hunts badly and is about 1/3rd the speed of the 85mm (which, is also 3X the cost).  It just felt too clunky to be useful to me.The bokeh is great unless you have a close focus point with light sources in the background corners.  You'll definitely get cat eye and odd shapes in those shooting circumstances wide open.The build quality is what you'd expect from a sub $300 autofocus prime:  not substantially robust.My recommendation is to try the 85mm before committing to the 50mm, and if it's a better fit, save for it and skip the 50mm.  If you're on a budget and can deal with the shortcomings, it will still take lovely shots."
"Using this on a Sony a6000 and A7r iii.  Very soft at 1.8 at center, gets a lot better when stopped down to around 2.0-2.2.Auto focus is acceptable. This is not for focusing on fast moving subjects. If you used the Canon ef 50 1.8 before the focus speed is about the same as that, but slightly better. Build quality is ok. Light weight and has a very plastic feel. Focus motor is very loud.This lens is wayyyy overpriced at $250 1-2 months ago. Now it seems to be selling at around $200, which I think is still pretty expensive. I was able to get it used at $168.  Honestly I think it should be sold around the same price ($125) as Canon ef 50 1.8 stm, since its pretty much the same lens and the Canon's in my opinion is built a little bit better than this."
"I enjoy shooting with the 50mm but for some reason when I'm in video mode, you can hear the lens focusing throughout the video which is absolutely horrible."
"Pros:  Decently price 50mm AF native FE lens. The optics on the wide open side 1.8-2.8 are decent and from 2.8 on very nice.Cons: AF in low light is TERRIBLE. AF in studio light situations with a model moving around is also not great. The lens does not open the iris while focusing so if you are shooting say F8-11 in studio with strobes - the AF will hunt ALOT - and a good chunk of photos become softer than they should be.Recommended uses:  Outdoors, or Bright lit subject matter. The lens performs better indoors at 1.8-2.8. Great for family pictures etc - wouldn't recommend if you are shooting kids indoors in lower light."
So I ended up buying this lens in the B&H store assuming that it would be better than the previous model. WRONG!!! So I purchased this lens for my Sony a6300. Knowing how great the previous Sony 50mm f/1.8 OSS lens was I thought it was a no brainer well I was wrong and what's even worst is how they're in the same price bracket although the new lens does not and I'll repeat does not have video stabilization. If you're into shooting video and have the a6300 make sure all your lens have stabilization.Oh so let's get to the best part about this lens. The motor for the autofocus is extremely loud. So if you recording anything that involves audio your footage is over because of how loud the motor is. All in all get the older model I did!!! It's 1000% better and the reviews on that lens speak for itself. Not sure what happened with this Sony fail but I'm sure hoping Sony will explain wtf happen....
"Decent image quality; autofocus is slow and the motor is really noisy. Not on par with some of the other 50 1.8s by Canon and Nikon, but if you only have $200 for a sony lens your options are pretty limited."
"The picture I included is taken with my Canon 50mm stm 1.8 lens on a Sony a7rii. I'm using the Sigma MC-11 adapter and I have a fast focus and the picture is very sharp on the Canon lens with great colors.  I've owned the Sony 50mm FE lens twice.  It was fairly sharp with manual focus, but it was super slow with the AF and constantly made a grinding noise when it was focusing.  I don't have the eye focus with the Canon lens but do have facial focus.  I bought the Canon lens and Sigma used for about the same price as the Sony 50mm lens.  The cool thing is that with the Sigma MC-11 adapter I'm able to use other Canon lenses too.  I'm also using a 100-300 Canon zoom lens that works great on my Sony.  I may add other Canon lenses down the road (many are so much cheaper than the Sony brand).  I do understand the benefits of using native lenses, but this combo has worked great for me.I still have the Sony 28 f2 and 85 1.8 native lenses and happy with that and my Canon lenses.  However, everyone is different with different needs...this is just one guy's opinion that works for him."
I dont know if my camera is compatible or not but it is ridiculously bad. I can’t seem to get it to focus on anything from 1-20 feet away. It looks blurry and it just doesn't give me the photos i see other use. Btw im using a Sony A7R IV. Maybe its too new or isnt compatible. The quality of the material is great and for the price its a steal but still not if you get photos like mine.
I bought this lens for my Sony a7II camera mostly because of the price and I have had good luck with other inexpensive Sony primes for aps-c cameras. The photos I got through this lens were good. They were sharper than the kit lens and some other zooms I have used on this camera. The big downside is the automatic focus. It was very sloooowwwww! It would go past focus up to three times before it would finally get there. This is a lens built for E mount full frame Sony cameras and it was that slow? Third party lenses with an adapter were much faster and more precise in the focus department. I guess Sony wants you to pay four to eight times as much for a decent focusing prime lens. I took it back for a refund.
"I made the mistake of buying this lens because of the price. The lens is about exciting as a trip to cleveland. It has Terrible autofocus as it hunts about 70% of every photo i take with it, and its very loud. And it sometimes will not focus at all. Worse focusing lens I've ever bought. The aps-c 50mm 1.8 is LIGHTYEARS better than this. My a7r2 does not deserve this cheap, slow lens. Will return it so I can get the zeiss 55 1.8."
"Terrible hunting lag during auto-focus.  Even paired with my firmware-updated A7SII, the focus drag was unbearable.  Image quality a bit soft wide open, & the motor noise was noticeable.  It drags as a photo lens, and unacceptable as a video lens.Nikon's cheaper nifty-fifty 1.8g produce far better pics & faster autofocus.I guess I'll wait for Sony's firmware update (should it address this issue), or see if they release a 2nd version of this lens in the future."
"There's an equivalent of this lens for Canon made by Yongnuo, it costs $60, that's what this Sony lens should really go for.  Flimsy, loud and slow AF on A7R MKII"
one of the slowest auto focus lenses I’ve ever used. If I had to choose between a manual lens or this it would be a cheap manual. Only reason I give it 2 is if you can get the focus to finally zone in it can capture pretty smoothly.
"Hi ,I am not sure why my brand new lens was not company sealed and i got it as open box and i am not sure whether its used lens or not."
Plastic lens with okay image quality. It is the slowest and loudest focusing lens I have ever tested. The focus motor is so loud it sounds like R2D2. I sent it back cause it is far behind the Sony APSC 50mm Nex lens.
"Slowest.... Autofocus..... EVER!Ugh, was very excited about this but now so disappointed. A decent, cheap, nifty 50 is something every camera owner should be able to enjoy but this is certainly not it. Cheap plastic-y feeling. 0/10 would not recommend."
Not an oss lens
"I did quite like this bag initially, but after using it for nearly a year now, some issues about the design have become apparent. I am new to photography within the last year or two, so these were things that I didn't think of when purchasing the bag. There are some good things about it as well, so I will list both below.Pros:-It claims to be waterproof (I say claims because I have not yet tested this)-There are multiple zipper pockets that are secure, and they are different sizes to accommodate different needs-The tripod holder is nice, but it would need to be quite a small one to fit-The dividers within the large compartment are nice to be able to separate lenses and whatnot-The removable dividers in the large compartment are secured with velcro, but you are stuck with their choice of hook or loop side of the velcroCons:-The large main zipper compartment is not well designed. Wherever the zipper has to turn a corner, i frequently have issues with it getting hung up and not zipping or unzipping smoothly. Also, if you are wearing the bag when you want to try to get into that compartment, you either have to be very careful in getting the contents out, or you have to only unzip partially and reach into the compartment.-The messenger bag style strap is uni-directional because of the way it is sewn and the shape of the strap. This bag would have benefited greatly from a regular straight strap that was able to buckle to either side of the bottom of the bag so it could be put over either shoulder.-If you aren't using the additional securement strap, where is nowhere to connect it, so it just hangs there. I keep having to loop it around something else to keep it from hanging down at my hip."
"When I pulled it out of the box I thought this is perfect. A small pack to carry my camera and a few things.After putting my stuff in it, I think it’s a touch too small. Once your camera in there all other pockets are tiny and in some cases the pockets are pushing on others. Fit is a bit tight when on with the cross strap. I am not a big man either. 5’ 10” 155lb.On the plus I love the color. It is well padded and the camera is snug. Didn’t feel super cheap, but we will see after some use."
"This is a nice camera bag. But it is really very awkward to wear and use. It's meant to be slung over one shoulder, and allow for access to the camera from one side, but it's really awkward. Also, if you're left handed, this isn't for you as it can't be used on either shoulder."
"Like this bag overall, but after a few months of light use (not a professional photographer, only use my camera occasionally) some of the stitching for the top carrying strap is coming undone. I weighed the bag with all of my gear and it weights a bit over 7 pounds. This is carrying a DSLR, 3 lens, and a small tripod. The bag seems to be well built, and I hardly use the top carrying strap so I'm not sure why it's starting to come undone. If this were a regular backpack I would not be a concerned, but given the value of the equipment I'm carrying it is of major concern.The padding seems good and decently protective against accidental bumps. What would really help is if there were straps on the bottom of the bag to hold a larger tripod. I've tried storing a standard sized metal tripod on the side of the bag, but it does not work well for a couple of reasons. The strap is not long enough to go all the way around the tripod, so you have to weave it in part of the tripod (assuming the tripod is not in a protective bag). The pouch for storing the base of the tripod is barely big enough to store the tripod in it. And if you do manage to get a standard sized tripod in there, you'll find that the bag is very off balance. Two long straps on the bottom would really help so a standard sized tripod could be lashed to the bottom of the bag for even balance."
"If you are overweight or chesty, this is not the bag for you. I extended the straps as far as they can go and it fits like a tactile harness.I love the color. It is super durable and the zippers are strong. It is easy to open and close. It is very lightweight and I love all the extra pocket space. It fits my camera very nicely. I just can't wear it as it is designed to be worn, and that's the whole point of my buying it so I'm disappointed. I will not be posting photos as that's a sight no one wants to see."
"Placement of the zipper would make accessing your camera on the go a bit precarious to any additional lenses you are carrying. My Nikon d7000 with attached Tamron 18-400 lens did not fit. This is my main shooting lens, needs to fit assembled for me to keep, item was returned."
The top compartment is open with no dividers so all of the small things for the camera will be jumbled up. I wouldn’t recommend this for a camera case.
"Not to comfortable,  no extra space to put two camera"
"It's nice and made well, but tiny, uncomfortable, and good luck with bigger lenses. My 70-300 Tamron has to go in the top part because it will not fit in the main part with camera."
"I shoot a lot of conventions and was looking to downsize from a large backpack to a sling bag with the hope of easy gear accessibility and comfortability. I had to reorganize the inner dividers to accommodate my Canon EOS Rebel T6s with a 17-55mm lens and battery grip. It was a tight fit, but it fit - sideways, and wasn't easy to take out on a whim.The bag does not sling around as easy as the description implies, and (as a female), I find it to be incredibly tight around my chest area, even with the strap loosened all the way. It's also not very comfortable on my shoulder, riding up near my neck rather than staying put. If you carry a weighted body or multiple lenses, you will most likely experience this as well. I did notice some abnormal stretching in the bag, and while I didn't find any tearing, I'm not confident it would hold up with further use.I had difficulty fitting my memory card and battery holders in the bag -- if you carry them loose, you probably won't have much of an issue with this. Don't bother trying to fit your wallet in the ""hidden pouch"" because I wasn't able to zip it up with a standard-sized wallet. My iPhone 8+ also didn't fit in this pocket, and while I could have stored both in the front pocket, I wasn't comfortable doing so, given how easy it is to access.The bag was cumbersome when experiencing a manual security check, as even with all the zippers opened, security personnel had issues with exploring each compartment thoroughly.The bag is probably best suited for a point-and-shoot camera or smaller mirrorless or DSLR system, wallet, phone, and various incidentals - cleaning gear, tissue, etc. As I mentioned earlier, I'm not confident it will be able to meet my needs during future photography outings and am in the process of returning it in favor of my backpack."
The buckles on the straps to adjust the straps to an individual body.  Especially for some one who has arthritis in their hands.
"It’s a bit too small for a large adult.  Also, there aren’t enough dividers to accurately spread out my camera equipment.  Overall it worked for my needs, but I had to add an extra divider to it so that my expensive camera equipment wouldn’t fall out when it was opened.  (Sadly, this actually happened).  If you are a small framed body, then it will likely meet your needs fine (my teen aged son has the same bag & it works perfect for his thin frame).  The quality of the bag itself is good.  The zippers and the connections snap together nicely and I like the color.  For me, its just a little snug around my middle, so for any serious traveling it wouldn’t work.  I did like all the pockets and once I put in an extra divider it works.  But, it needs a little more engineering to make it my perfect bag."
Item is smaller then I expected. I'm a big guy and it looks like I'm wearing a dolls backpack and the strap are very tight around me even though they are fully stretched out. Everything else wasn't to bad. I may be returning it.
"While the camera storage seemed great, the second I put it on, I knew it was getting returned. There is an awkward 2nd strap that you have to hunt to see anywhere before you purchase - and it creates a pretty undesirable look and feel on woman. If you choose not to buckle it, then you just have a random strap hanging.  Too bad - I had it all packed with my gear and was excited to use it!"
"Surprisingly you can really get good camera bags for about $40.  This is not one of them.  It feels extremely cheap.  But I will say that it did hold my Sony with a small zoom lens in the main section and a regular prime in the upper area.I immediately tossed it aside, will donate to goodwill.  Update, I did actually use it for a trip with a standard and zoom lens.  It served the purpose, but the bag hangs awkwardly over the shoulder."
"Ok *LEFT* SHOULDER sling pack with Velcro dividers for SMALL dSLR cameras. Mediocre to medium quality throughout. Room for three tiny lenses or one small to medium dSLR camera, and two small lenses.It accommodates a Sony a7 - but the Canon 5D is a squeeze.Additional pocket for a rain poncho or a big wallet. It has a handy belly strap too - but not big enough for anything more than a 34” waist (my size; fully expanded, wearing only a shirt).The snap clips are poor quality (and hard to open). Nor do the ones on the side of the bag appear to serve any purpose.So I’ve used it a few times now and even managed to get an iPad in with the Sony a7. Snug but not shoe-horned in.Overall I’m not happy with it and I’m already looking for a replacement. It doesn’t sit comfortably on the shoulder without being “braced” with a hand, and is inclined to slip off. (I’m 5’8” and have reasonable shoulders!)Honestly - if I’d taken enough care to notice that it was a left-shoulder item, I wouldn’t have bought it.Silly me."
"Speaking as a shorter female who has had other sling bags, this is very uncomfortable. It's also very long and hits below my back. The extra-wide strap in the exact middle pulls at my chest in a way that a man would probably not notice. And the strap is so wide that it puts too much pressure at my neck and out on my arm socket. I started to feel nauseous. The pockets are great, in fact, they are extremely useful. the pocket for a tripod is awesome. It's just so amazingly uncomfortable."
"First, I have a small-ish camera, a Canon R10, which is about the same size as a Rebel T7.  My complaints about this bag will apply less the larger your camera body is.The root of all problems with this bag is that the velcro fuzz isn't all over the inside, and in fact only reaches about 25% of the available surface.  So no matter how you arrange the dividers, the area for your camera body is, in my case, HUGE.  So large that my camera isn't even secure when I open the bag.Related to the first point is that even if you buy extra elastic straps to retain your gear, there's no place to attach them that helps.Finally, even where there's velcro fuzz, they opted for strips instead of full surface, which greatly reduces the holding strength of the dividers.  Just strapping a tripod to the side causes the dividers to come apart.It's just so much stupid lazy design, I feel crapped on for trying it out."
"When we were unloading at a train station from a cab, this camera bag fell out of the trunk from the low deck of a hatchback to the asphalt below. Even though our lenses were packed exactly as shown in the photos, one of our lens filters shattered and left bits of broken glass throughout the bag, rendering unusable until we could properly clean it out.This is not “shockproof” as advertised."
"I like having a messenger style camera bag with a side opening panel. Makes accessing my camera easy while wearing the bag.  If your considering this one because of the low price (like me) - here are the shortcomings that I have found.- It’s small enough it works for my Sony APSC camera and 18-105mm lens, but it would be too short if i had a longer lens (w/hood)- The internal Velcro dividers are awkward to configure.- the external zipper support buckles are unadjustable and because they are lose, really serve little purpose.- bottom padding is thinner than I’d like and corners have no padding.But I do like that is has a water bottle pocket, a side strap for a travel tripod and a couple other pockets for miscellaneous stuff.  Not bad for the price, but not ideal."
"I initially thought I like this bag because of the padding and protection, however it doesn’t fit my lens well. Lower compartment doesn’t allow quick access and shoulder strap not comfortable. It’s a good bag for small lens and smaller cameras."
"Really nice quality bag, materials well made, pretty red color, interior sections are well padded. My biggest complaint is shown in the photo, that there is a huge wasted space in the biggest compartment. There is no padding or even a mesh net to prevent things from slipping out when you open the compartment, so I’m afraid to put anything there. It’s a shame, because I have a long lens that I thought would fit perfectly there, and it does fit - but I’m not risking putting my expensive lens in an unprotected area!Otherwise I like the style and feel of the bag. If I weren’t outside my return window I’d try to return it and get something else. But now I’m going to have to see if I can rig up something to put there to prevent my equipment from sliding out so I can use that compartment. It’s a huge disappointment to me."
I guess it’s my fault for buying a returned item. Components missing from bag and stuffed with a hat. Would’ve been great if inspection was done before being sent
"Great camera bag. I use this to carry my Nikon D5600 and two lenses, plus all batteries and chargers, SD cards; etc. This bag really fits a lot of stuff and has a place for it all rather than just shoving it all in a generic bag your camera came with. The crossbody is the best kind of camera bag in my opinion, it makes it much easier to sling around and not be in the way when you are trying to take pictures. This bag has a clip to strap it across your chest. When this strap is clipped no matter how loose or tight the back strap is it rides up. Being a woman it is uncomfortable around my breast when it rides up. So in turn I cut this strap off the bag"
"I was so excited when I bought myself a really good digital camera to replace my old 35mm camera. I really liked the feature of being able to wear this bag (cross-body...unlike as it is shown in the pictures) and then slide the bag around to the front to extract the camera out of the side pocket without having to take off the pack. When I loaded my camera and accesories into the bag, everything seemed to fit just fine. However, when I strapped my tripod onto the bag, then the bag did not work at all for me anymore. If I had the strap loose enough to swing around to my front, then the tripod kept bumping into my right arm. If I tightened the strap so that it wouldn't hit my arm, the end of the tripod hit the back of my head. So with regrets, I am returning this."
"Very nice pack, too bad they didn't make the straps long enough for normal sized people. A snug fit with a light shirt on, with a jacket forget it.Sorry to have to return this pack. Do better next time."
"This bag slings only on your left shoulder. If you carry a bag on your right shoulder, mainly most right handed people do, this bag will not work. The strap is curved to fit only left sided only and doesn’t have ability to swap sides for carrying. Not a good design. Also camera location runs small for lens area. Anything bigger then a 105mm F4 lens, won’t fit."
"Sling bag, yes. Only hangs on the left side, Which I guess I'm being picky but I really don't like. Plus there's an extra long strap that clips into the main strap essentially creating a backpack not and easy cross body or sling camera bag to take on or off. Would've been nice of the pictures we're more accurate. Small space inside; have to store camera and lens separate, which means you’ll have to put the camera together every time you take it out of the bag. Too much work for an poorly described  backpack."
"This camera bag is quite versatile and has adequate  space for a hobbyist photographer.  With over four pockets, you have ample pockets for storage of extra battery, battery charger, lens filters, lens wipes, SD cards, 2 lens , 1 flash attachment, mini-tripod, and camera body.The sling strap does not support wearing the bag and utilizing it while shooting.However if you are moving into the prosumer photographer level, this bag is inadequate.  If you need to carry more than two lenses and a battery holder, this is not your product."
"I really liked it at first until my daughter accidentally connected the waist clip upside down (why this is even able to happen is beyond me, should make one way grooves...) and I tried for a good hour with a screw driver to get it unstuck.  In the end I had to break the clip...Aside from that it is a nice bag with many pockets.  Could fit a full size camera and 3 lenses no problem."
I have tried to get used to this bag for more than a month. It is so awkward to use. You can't just swing it over your shoulder and go. The straps are located in weird places. I thought it was more of a backpack. I fo not recommend it.
"If you have a small aps-c mirrorless camera, (like my Sony A6400) it's gonna move around quite a bit. I needed something slightly bigger than what I have to carry some of my gear. This kinda fits the bill but also doesn't feel great. The dividers kind of suck. They can only be placed in specific locations where there IS velcro attachment points, and they don't feel as if they attach securely. Not to mention there is no real sense of rigidity, and things feel like they move around quite a bit when walking around. My biggest complaint about this bag would be the dividers to be honest. The rest of the bag feels good but the dividers are where they really cut cost it seems. I do love that the top compartment is completely seperate from the bottom."
"I have ordered this bag in Deep Teal (teal outside with blue interior) twice and each time they've sent me Storm Green (dark green outside with orange interior). It's incredibly frustrating because it seems like a well made bag and looks like it would suit my equipment well. But I hate the color and for $40 I don't want to be carrying around an ugly camera bag, even if it is well made."
The quality seemed  good. Just made to strap around a more petite or small waist or chest area.
"This sling bag use left shoulder only. If you used to use the right side or both shoulders, it may be very uncomfortable. Returning it."
Got this bag for my husband's birthday and he finds it a bit confusing all the compartments other than that it gets the job done.
"Bag arrived a couple days ago. Just got around to taking it out of the packaging. Looks like it could be a nice bag but the stitching is bad in a couple of spots. Since other reviews showing faulting stitching and tearing on a few uses, I'm going to send this back. Never got to use it and won't trust it to hold thousands of dollars worth of equipment.Two of the photos are very minor but the worse is the one that holds the straps. It's worse in person than what the pic shows."
Not the best looking. One of the longer straps broke. Good storage though lots of pockets. Can fit a big body full frame. Hard to fit a zoom lens in the other compartment. Does the job for me
"I love the size bag and all the compartments, but the color is not wine red like the photo portrays. It is more like a red in general, unless they shipped me the wrong one, but this is not the color I ordered or the photo communicated."
"Sling bags are great, but this one isn't. It's not sturdy and has very minimal places to put dividers. Additionally, the Lowerpro 250 sling has more space for gear, while remaining the same relative size.This bag is fine for like 2-3 months, and then it starts to fall apart."
I purchased this bag in hopes of having an easy way to hold my camera and lens while on a trip.  The bag looked descent but had issues most notably that the clasp broke on the main component. This made it near impossible to remove anything.  The only other issue I had was that the bag kept wanting to slide off.  Maybe it was just how I was holding it.Proper construction in other areas and may be good for the amateur photographer.
"The bag is ok. Pretty good, actually. But the strap.. it's too stiff, and padded. And all the mini straps. And it's right shoulder specific. I mean, what the heck! When I think of 'sling', I think of EASE OF USE. Grab it and throw it over a shoulder, EITHER SHOULDER. This is like a backpack with one strap."
Took awhile to figure out how to use the design of pulling it around front to remove camera. Like that feature. Is great to be able to access the camera or lenes without having to take bag off and set it down. Nice bag over all. Only complaint is that the camera compartment is really deep so is too big for the camera and detachable separators don’t attach in a way to fix this issue.
Wish I could return it. I am 5’6 female and it’s way too big and Awkward. Probably ok for a taller person. The bag is too big and the straps are not comfortable and don’t sit right
Great product bit the stitching for the zipper came out after two days causing the zipper to get stuck.
"Now I understand why they just showed the pic of woman with her backside showing.  The buckle placement isn't flattering or comfortable for me, it's in the front and under/ over the breast area."
I'm right handed and this bag is hard to handle. Wish it was strapped on the other side...
"I was super hopeful that this would be the camera bag I was searching for. I loved the color, size and spacing for multiple camera lenses, etc. However, the shoulder strap was just not comfortable at all and rubbed against my neck. After wearing it around the house with my gear for a just a couple minutes, I could tell it wasn't balanced right, but the way the strap is positioned I couldn't change it. I can't imagine wearing it for a long session or wedding. Returned it and still looking for the perfect bag!"
I love that this fits all of my lenses and accessories. I cannot figure out the belt wrap around and how it's supposed to fit. When I do put it on its super awkward!
Small. I have a black magic 6k and it hardly fits. Not enough pocket space. Has interchangeable dividers but it is velcro and dose not hold. It also is only one way to create dividers.  You can't customize pockets to really fit personal needs. The sling on it is uncomfortable. Makes it feel as if you are carrying extra luggage rather then an accessory.
"Nice backpack for minimal carry. Body, 3 lens and assorted items.Left sholder carry only. I didn't consider this qhen I bought.  Left handed and always carry on right sholder. So awkward for me"
"I am sorry I really can't give a true review of this product.  I was looking for a back to fulfill a certain need.  Sorry to say this did not do it, so I returned it."
"Not sure why I bought this bag.  Simply horrible design.  Be careful when using this bag.  It just feels like your camera is going to fall out.  Only remove your camera when you place it on a flat surface and away from the edge.  Still feels like my camera is going to fall out even on the table. You can’t take out your camera on the move.  It good for storing your camera, meaning you put it in the bag and not move it.  Just get a normal top loading camera bag.  I’m pissed off that I’m out of my return window.  I would return it twice if I could."
"I purchased this camera bag for carrying my camera and one lens while traveling. The return window closed before my first usage. The handle ripped on the FIRST use. Fortunately I noticed it before the bag fell and broke my camera. I’ve submitted a claim to Mosiso but have not heard back from them. Even with a replacement, I will not feel comfortable that the bag is secure enough to protect my camera. I would strongly recommend against purchasing this bag."
I have only used this a few times outside of my house.  the seam around where the camera is stored ripped the first time I used it.
"Wish it was a bit wider as larger lenses are too big to fit. Other than that, its pretty good."
"Stitching coming out just shy of 4 months of light use. Started with just the top loop and now extending into the stitching of the strap to the actual bag. I don't usually leave reviews but since this is meant to be a bag for some pretty expensive equipment I thought I'd warn others off buying it. In the future I'm going to resume buying from my local camera shop, I don't even know why I bothered purchasing from amazon. Just as a note: I can't speak to its water resistance because I don't live in a place with much weather but based on the durability of the bag itself I wouldn't trust it."
I ordered burgundy..this bag is clearly RED! Nice compartments though.
I think it's pretty very functional but way to small for all my equipment.
"Not a huge fan, it’s a durable bag however not very much room for a DSLR that has multiple lenses. Not to mention the way that the zipper opens on the side is not very adequate, If you’re not careful things could fall out"
I really liked this bag but taking it out on a hike it kept falling off my shoulder.  I returned it.
"I used this bag for my new camera and lenses, but I found that it didn’t hold or fit my accessories well. There should have been an extra divider or two which might have helped but it wasn’t big enough to hold my camera base with no lens and the other additional 2 lenses I have securely enough for me to feel comfortable. I would’ve returned it but because of illness I missed my return window. So I’m stuck with a bag that I can’t use and ended up going with a different brand that had a better security strap and more dividers."
Seems like a decent quality but it simply didnt fit me comfortably. If you are petite you shouldn't have a problem.
"It holds what I need it to hold. However, the straps are very confusing.. which makes it difficult to take it places"
Was much smaller than I thought it would be.  I handled it very gently and it started to rip at the seams already.  Probably should spend a few more dollars and get something bigger with better quality
"My camera barely fit into the bag with the lens on, even though it's about the same as the pictured camera in the advertisement."
So I bought this bag for my Mavic Pro which it fits great with all it’s gear. But two months in the handle at the top of the bag just broke. I would call this shoddy workmanship. If one handle broke two months in what can I expect in the coming year.
"Although I like the style, this camera bag is a bit smaller than I expected. So, I am a bit disappointed."
"Nice case , it little smaller then it looks .  Already looking for another bag."
It barely fit my dslr and is quite uncomfortable to carry for any period of time.
"Too small for a DSLR, tripod and 3 lenses with accessories. Very nice otherwise."
But gotta be very careful else you can drop the gear when opening the zip!.
"It is a nice camera bag, it is small though."
I dislike the size of the bag and the lack of space. there are different compartments but they are basically useless because you can’t fit hardly anything in there. If you have a lot of lenses or extensions tubes this bad won’t hold but 4-5 and if you have telephoto lens or long lenses forget fitting anything in that bag. wish i had returned it because i really wasted my money.
"2 months in and the top strap rips off on one side, then the shoulder strap starts to tear. I didn’t expect high quality at this price point, but I expected to last at least 8-12 months. Spending the extra money for better quality."
"Okay case but there is a side fastener with a plastic clip on it. The clip is fine but the nylon they used did not grip, so it falls off at the slightest tug. That's not good near a cliff. The clip is made to fasten to another bag. Very poor design if you need this clip. Otherwise okay bag."
The strap/handle at the top broke within a month.  Compartments are well padded for camera and accessories but it is a small bag overallThe one shoulder strap really didn’t work for me and made it hard for quick access to the camera
"I actually like the concept of this bag along with the multiple pockets for organizing as well as the strap for a tripod.  However, the top handle broke on my third use.  I’m not an avid user and all I carry is a small Sony camcorder, a tripod, my keys and wallet.  I can’t say I would recommend this."
"Used couple times, and the stitch tear down"
If you want a small camera bag this isn't it.  If you want a big one and bulky this is for you.
Too tiny and way too rigid… it just didn’t feel quality. There wasn’t much space inside either. It’s a tiny sling bag that isn’t really comfortable on your shoulder. I returned it immediately.
"I am scared to even use this bag anymore because the handle & strap have bot ripped. The strap is half way off, the handle is completely detached. I LOVED the simplicity & size, as I attend concerts often but I can't trust this bag or company with my equipment."
"Kinda irritated. Haven’t had this bag long, bought At the end of June and didn’t start using to middle of July and I’m not rough on my stuff and the main strap that holds it on your back is already separating from the bag."
"This is extremely small and I was not expecting that! I would barely be able to get a DSLR and 3 lenses in it. Also, ergonomically it was uncomfortable."
"Great looking, nice quality. Unfortunately it’s 110% only for your left shoulder. And it’s actually pretty uncomfortable IMO. The shoulder strap at the neck curves in and rides your neck."
This wasn’t as comfortable as I had hoped. The carrying strap is wider than necessary. One of the buckle straps came detached after only one day of use.
I was disappointed with the size
I really loved this bag at first. But it’s broken already. I haven’t even had it for 4 months and the top portion broke.
After 2 days the side panel of main interior compartment ripped. Unfortunately a month and a few days from purchase date so no way to return.
"It was too small. My fault totally, should've checked the measurements"
"I like the camera bag but when I use it during a rainy day, it damage my Nikon D3s and my paper work I had inside."
"The cross body strap broke immediately out of the box, I can’t trust putting cameras and equipment in it."
The bag was so small and it’s a left shoulder strap. Sad to say it was return back.
Looks cheap.
I only used this camera back pack a handful of times and the pocket stitching let loose. STAY AWAY.
I loved it until the strap ripped from the bag one day with no warning. Very light use. Disappointing. No response from the seller.
The size was perfect fit to my gadget the total weight is about 5lb. It’s not quite heavy  but it become to break in a month.
I don't know but they added to many zippers and when you walk it makes a lot of noise..
