"I wanted a wide-angle lens camera.  I guess I didn't get that with the T7.But the camera was o.k., but I need a difference camera or better lens."
"The charger that came with this camera does not charge the battery in this camera, I haven't been able to use this camera once since purchasing"
"I purchased this camera for Christmas and new year ever, unfortunately the quality of picture were low comparing to my iPhone. During standby it keeps making click/shutter nose. Hence, I returned the product. However I was charged restocking fee, after contacting Amazon support. The reseller message that charger is missing, which is wrong accusation and unethical claim by reseller."
"For my use, not having a flip out screen really killed my enjoyment of this product."
Can't register the camera with Canon. They say it's not a US product.
wish it would take ef or fd lenses
I was so excited to get this camera to take videos and pictures of my sons football games only to find out the video file isn’t compatible with iPhone so I can’t even download them to my phone. I am FURIOUS after spending hundreds of dollars and now I stuck with a camera that won’t even do what I bought it for. Canon needs to let people know this ahead of time. Ridiculous!
"For those buying this product in the US, please be aware that they camera is for the UK/CA market. Therefore, you will not be able to register the camera with Canon in the US and therefore will not be able to get the warrantee, support, etc. Other sellers on Amazon do sell cameras for the US market. It will be displayed at the bottom of the camera near the serial number.  Sorry I didn’t take a pic. I already returned it."
"Maybe I don’t know how to use it, but I waste my money"
"There is no microphone jack, clean HDMI output, or other basic features that any $400 camera in 2023 should have. Takes great photos and videos."
"The look on my daughter's face when she opened her birthday present and found the camera bag was stained and dirty, the rear screen was scratched, the lenses were covered in fingerprints, and she realized she got a used camera and we paid full price.Pretty disappointing. Going to a box store next time. Figured I'd be okay buying from Canon. But apparently they're another one sending out used gear as new."
"This camera would be okay if it wasn’t for the fact that my battery is never sufficiently charged. Be it a battery issue, or a charger issue, it is not good when I’m outdoors trying to photography wildlife and the battery drops so quickly.  I will say, the photo quality isn’t terrible, but be aware this camera is very loud."
Charged the battery till light turned green only to find out the camera shutter was glitching back and forth and no display along with no button functionality. So basically nothing worked at all and it was delivered to me this way... Replacement has been ordered. Only thing I can have a good rating would the customer support. Seems as if they sent me a returned camera or a bad one in general not sure what happened here. At this price though I was sweating bullets and really hate to have to go through sending one back and getting a replacement..
"Buy it, just not on Amazon. I was about to buy it at Best Buy, but they had to order it and it would take too long, so I went with the familiar option; Amazon. It got here quickly, but the battery charger didn't work. Leave the expensive tech to tech stores and everything else to Amazon. Very good camera for beginners, though."
"I bought the Canon EOS Rebel T7 DSLR camera for streaming videos on social media.  I was unpleasantly surprised by the poor quality of the video.  The quality reminds me of the early days of the digital cameras when pictures were dark and pixelated.  For the price, this camera is disappointing."
When I got the camera the lens were broken and it was messed up.
This camera or lance is not giving me a cleaar picture of what's being taken.  I'd like to have it replaced.
"All the SD cards I buy don’t work in this. Even the ones that are formatted for it. Talk about a complete waste of time waiting on the shipping, a complete waste of time that I couldn’t get it to work as I waited for SD card after SD card to come in the mail; and talk about wasted money on junk. Do not buy."
"This is the second Rebel T7  I have bought in the last 6 or 7 weeks. The first one had a messed up sensor on it. I sent it back to Canon for repair. It came back worse than when I sent it. They wanted me to send it to them again. HA! But, I had a ton of lenses for a Canon I cannot afford to replace, so I am stuck with one.This second one has what appears to be oil spots on the photos. I am returning it and lenses or no, I am going to purchase a Nikon."
I don't know any of the features due to the fact the camera wouldn't format sd card. I called canon  NO ONE KNEW HOW TO FIX PROBLEM.  they wanted me to send it in.  no I'll return this crap and buy a Nikon.
Great upgrade to the T6 except they crippled the flash shoe by removing the universal hotshoe pin pin. (Non iso compliant) It will not work with non Canon flash or manual triggers. Canon and Amazon tech were unable to provide a solution to fire remote flashes except for optical trigger which doesn’t work when the camera body is enclosed in a photo booth head and the build in flash cannot be used. Canon said this is a stripped down version and doesn’t expect the user to require remote flash. Other than that this is a great low cost entry level DSLR camera.
Not that good of a camera but great for beginners.
Not what I thought it was
"We have gone through the included manual, followed instructions on-line, as well as YouTube instructions.  Even a professional photographer was unable to connect it with our WiFi in our house (we DO have WiFi, and have no problem with other devices.  It was a total waste of over $500.  We'd return it but due to having COVID, we ran over the deadline and now seem stuck with this sham of a camera."
The camera is good however the video features is not working it stopped recording at two second
COULD NOT GET THE ITEM TO WORK. SENT IT BACK TO THE SELLER AND STILL (WEEKS AFTER) NO REFUND.
"Received the camera, and it was fine, but not what I was looking for at this time. Trying to return it has been nothing but a nightmare. Amazon customer service is pointless."
"Update: Contacted Canon directly, Customer Service was very good. Will be sending camera for repair at their expense.Camera was delivered January 5th. I've only taken approximately 50-75 photos with it. I flew to Florida for a photo safari and now the camera does not work. Not happy at all."
"I literally purchased this for the sole purpose of being able to drop videos from the camera to an iPhone or iPad, and I have just learned after unpacking it and trying to utilize it for my students, that it is NOT POSSIBLE and the videos must first be transferred via USB to a computer, and then emailed to the phone. I am extremely disappointed by this."
"This is my second Canon camera, great camera but the lens fell apart after the second use. Didn't drop it or anything. Took it out of the camera bag and it just fell to bits. Of course the return window is now closed. This is the second photography item I have had an issue with from Amazon. The other was a LED light wand to be used for light painting that was never received."
"Camera itself is ok, nothing to distinguish itself from the pack of aps-c cameras.  The lens is terribly slow, most kit lens' stink.  Savvy buyers can pick up aps-c cameras for nearly nothing today (I literally can't give my xt1 away!).....and spend your money on a couple lenses that you won't outgrow."
"I ordered this from this selection because it was to come from Canon new. When I received it the box the camera came in and the box for the 75-300 lens both had the factory seals cut, nothing was in the factory packaging, and there’s no manuals."
"arbitrary fees from refund on procam order, camera would not focus when lens and camera were on autofocus, poor communication, no explanation of partial refund until askedrevoke authorized seller status from this company, terrible experience debating over $25"
"Easy to use, low cost and very good outdoor image quality but not so good in low light room. Had cold shoe mount that is NOT Single-Contact Hotshoe. No way to use with Speedlite Camera Flash. The fake zoom lense is also confusing as people tried to adjust it while using the camera."
All pictures we've taken haven't been clear..tried adjusting but to no avail..good camera but that is a big flaw..we had it a couple weeks and stinks the money we spent
This is the perfect Christmas gift for my daughter who is just starting into photography.Just the right size.
"I liked this camera as I need it for simple videos nothing fancy and it was cheaper than buying a new phone..well I’ve gone through idk how many avenues of finding a mic for this camera…thought the usb would be fine for my external mic but nope it’s just for charging and connecting to a computer. So I got a 3.5 mm mini mic and still doesn’t work, so I figured it was the wrong type of mic so I got an adapter..still nothing. There’s no way to access this on the camera or on the computer when connected. I needed the sound to be crisp and clear with this mic, it makes it useless and I’ll just use my phone instead..smh. Will be returning."
Focus was good and the lighting of photos. Easy to handle also. Even the kids were helping with it.
It’s an ok camera for someone brand new to using a camera. The picture quality is not great but it works well for videos.
I love how beginner friendly and the size of this camera is but I could not find the same battery it have so that I can charge one while the other is being used to keep a consistent flow in picture taking. I even visited this brand's store and they didn't sell it either. If it wasn't too late to get a refund I sure would have gotten one.
Didn’t come with the SD memory card so now I have to buy one for myself
Screws are missingPorts are warpedFrames bentSeems like this was returned before.The box came in intact and well.
Quality is not what I expected but I did appreciate 2 cameras in 1
the camera works good don't get me wrong. its just that when i try to use my microphone it does not work like at all. like it goes completely quiet like its on mute. i need this mic because i need the back camera and the mic on the camera doesn't really pick up the sound on the back camera.
To start its definitely not a sony a600
It factually is a camera. It functions properly but those are the only good things to say about it. No matter what I've tried every picture comes out blurry. Any modern cell phone takes better quality pictures than this hunk of garbage.
I hated it ... Its take only blurry pictures
The camera was easy to learn as there weren't too many complicated buttons.  The touch screen on the back was great.  That's where it ended for me though.I've attached three photos.  The top of each photo was taken by the camera.  The bottom of each photo was taken with my Google Pixel 7 Pro.The 1st photo the camera couldn't focus on both flowers.The 2nd photo the camera did well with the statue but the words on the sign are blurry.The 3rd photo the berries were a deep orange.  The camera was trying to add lighter color that wasn't there in real life and which the Google Pixel kept removed.The Pixel was easier to carry as I could put it in my pocket.  The camera I had to put it in the supplied bag and carry it in my hand.Not sure what you are looking for in a camera but this one most likely isn't it.
The quality is terrible! I do not recommend.
"In a nutshell, my phones camera is much clearer and has better zoom capabilities by far. For reference my phone is i phone 14. Returning this product promptly"
"The camera wasn’t what I wanted. Too many settings, not enough zoom. I guess for the price it was ok but I had trouble getting the picture right"
This is not a bad camera but it’s not the best either. Getting into photography this might be the camera but this camera is equal to Iphone quality or worse than iphone quality. If you want to get into photography as a beginner on a budget this could be the camera.
"I was sooo in love with this camera at first, but in less than 24 hours of delivery, when i try to reverse the camera a record it freezes completely and then shuts off and restarts itself! I am a youtuber and i cannot deal with this! The focus is okay it’s not the worse, the battery life is decent enough! The size of it was perfect but due to the issue it’s really not a good product for me to use with my youtube content! I’m a bit disappointed but maybe in the future before selling they can double check the camera before packaging!"
"My iPhone 14 Pro Max takes better quality photos. Even after adjusting all of the settings. Camera will freeze in the menu, and have to shut off and turn back on to continue. Not very impressed with this product."
"I used the camera while on vacation and the photos I took were great, but after I charged the battery, and turned the camera on, the camera shut itself off after five seconds and was no longer operational.  I contacted customer service and they were of no help.  All I can say is, you get what you pay for.L Rawlings"
I like the camer quite a bit but I am unable to connect to WiFi. It also does not come with a zoom lens.
"So the camera setting photos are blurry, the wifi will not connect and when I bought it, it was 159.00, now at 135.00? not at all happy with the camera"
This camera is NOT what it's worth unless you are using it SOULY for still/non-moving photos. The focusing on this camera is absolute garbage and fails to focus even with simple objects. I highly recommend getting a name brand camera rather than this cheap camera. I bought it in hopes of using it for an Airshow. But ended up getting really crap pictures. Even my phone was able to take a LOT better pictures than this. Please for the love of God. Do not make the mistake I made and just avoid this camera all together.
The camera itself is super easy to use and very beginner friendly! I personally did not like the quality of photos and preferred my phone.
"My three year old was SO excited about having a real camera in his Easter basket this year. Once we charged it, it lasted less than a week before it was unusable due to him dropping it outside on our sidewalk. To be fair, he dropped multiple times. Even so, I would expect a camera advertising an age range from 2-12 to be able to withstand drops. The screen is completely blank so we can’t see his pictures when he takes them… or even navigate to take pictures. He’s very sad that his camera is broken. So am I. This is probably a great camera for older kids, but skip it for younger kids."
"This camera is suppose to be 16x zoom, but indeed is line 5, my cell phone has .more zoom, and for some reason the SD card is used one time and after that don't recognize the card and the audio on recording is almost non existent, I thought it would be good, is Canon, but disappointed"
We tried several SD cards and nothing! returning it. Formatting will not work because it wont read SD.
"i bought to take general pictures outdoors of animals - the 16x zoom is absolutely terrible for that. i can't believe, in 2024, ANY camara would be sold with such a short zoom. my 20 yr old camara has FOUR times the zoom strength!  i also found the ""auto focus"" to be total crap - manual focus was ok.  also, when i saw the ""canon"" name, i thought there would be better customer support than just a gmail contact address. very disappointed."
"I initially really liked this camera. I received it for my birthday and enjoyed filming with it, but I got tired of recording audio separately (the built in audio recorder is okay but I wanted the kind of quality you get with an external microphone) with my Blue Yeti. So I decided to get an external microphone that could be hooked up to the camera so I could record external audio and film at the same time. I bought a Rode mic and while the camera registered it being plugged it, it wouldn’t record any audio. It was completely mute. I returned it and got another Rode mic which also didn’t work, and a third Saramonic Vmic which also didn’t work (same mute problem). After trouble shooting it with the Best Buy employees, they concluded that the microphone jack where you plug in external audio is either faulty, or doesn’t accept TRS/TRRS (external microphone standard for cameras). Seeing as I saw another review mentioning using the microphone jack without any issues, I’m guessing the camera does accept TRS/TRRS and mine is just faulty. I’m very disappointed, and wish I had discovered this camera was faulty before the return window closed."
"I watched a few video reviews on this camera and from what they said I decided to go for it. Its awful. This camera cannot even focus... the screen is large but you have to press it hard to get it to click on when you're clicking.  Not to mention the fake aesthetic to it. It comes with a fake lense protector and the lense cover is just held on by a string you have to tie on yourself. Says it comes with an SD card, mine was missing. In other words, don't waist your time. Skip this buy."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                It wouldn’t work correctly with Wi-Fi and it would shut down while recording
"Bought it to make shooting videos better and easier.  It did neither.  I supposed it could be good for just taking photos but there is a reason it is marked as ""Frequently returned itemCheck the product details and customer reviews to learn more about this item"".  I returned it literally the day after I got it."
Camera is great. Easy to use. Problem is with the cord that came with it. Did not work. Would not charge.  Did not even get to use it once!
bought a sd reader now camera is great. dosent take best pics
looks and feels cheap.
"Purchased for baseball game photos.Quality is not good on the zoom, very grainy w no details."
Dont waste your money on this camera.
"I so wanted to be pleased with this camera.  However, it appears to just a be a toy  for kids.  My old cell phone camera has 8 MP and it clearly outshines this camera and its supposedly 64MP.  The focus is always blurry, no matter what the setting.  Save your money."
This product has great review but has not lived up to it. I am now stock with a useless camera since the return window has passed. I tried out all the features in a systematic way with a selected bunch of indoor features and none of the pictures are better than my 1phone 14.
"First and foremost, this camera does NOT take high res pics or videos, many are grainy and blurry. Secondly, I can't get the pics/videos off of of the camera because it is NOT recognized by any of my laptops or desktops when I plug it into the USB ports!You may as well take the $160 they're asking for this and flush it down the toilet or throw it out the window of your car as you drive down the road as the quality (both picture and workmanship)  is THAT bad. I know of another person who ordered it and I found out that theirs broke a week after the return window closed!Its as simple as this you GET what you PAY for! I'm throwing this in the garbage since I cant return and buying a brand name thats reputable. Live and learn, I knew better but bought this anyway and now I'm paying for it literally by having to buy a new camera."
My cell phone is better for pictures
"Zooming is horrible, I brought it for my home inspection business and it was worse than my note phone. Do not buy."
Taking pics in dim lighting is like trying to light a wet match. There is this film line running across the screen when taking a photo and it has a hard time focusing. I did a test photograph out doors in light and it was also pixelated.
"I wouldnt even recommend this camera for beginners. You can only take really up close photos or it is just a complete blur, the camera quality just isnt there, but thats to be expected with a $150 camera. even with being up close the camera isnt good quality as it states it is."
Great camera but it’s definitely not 4K
The camera works well at the moment; It has good image quality and its touch screen is easy to use
"I guess I should have known better than to buy a camera branded simply as ""Camera""!! But I needed to replace a previous camera in a hurry, and am on a very limited budget. Long story short: after less than two months, the electronics in this thing failed totally, for absolutely no discernible reason. RECOMMEND AVOIDING THIS ITEM LIKE THE PLAGUE!!"
Especially long distance photos and videos have very low quality.
The QR CODE WAS INVALID
"It takes good pictures during day time or a well lit area but if it's night time or the lighting isn't good than it won't come out as good.Returned the camera after printing the pictures, everything came out blurry,"
"I was hopeful this would be a decent camera from prior reviews. Tried it out, once zooming in, picture quality gets blurry at about 10x. Also takes the worst pictures, no matter if zoomed in or out. Just all around blurry. Returned this piece of junk."
"I don’t like that the camera does not focus at all, we have seen every you tube video on this cameras and select the same exact settings they show and the pictures still come out unfocused, blurry, not of great quality at all. The phone takes better photos than this camera."
"This camera is worth $70-$84 i just got it today, decent's looking camera feels good in your hands but its very blurry in full zoom I thought this might do the job. I guess I have to dish out an extra $450 to get a name brand one. I'll be returning it very disappointed couldnt do a small job."
My camera battery on my old camera died so I was looking into new ones I thought it was a budget friendly camera and the reviews are great......it's a good toy camera in my opinion but not meant for professionals
"I bought this to send to a friend in Cuba who believed the description. It apparently is not even close to accurate. It does not take photos in raw format as stated, and the video resolution is worthless because the lens is terrible. A six year old mobile phone takes better videos than this camera. They had saved so long for a camera, and because I sent it to Cuba, I can’t get it back to receive a refund. What a shame. I wish I could give it zero stars."
I dont like that u can't change the lense
"The fact it says "" camera"" on it is a give away on its quality. It's not a DSLR. It doesn't have manual focus like it said. Use your phone instead of buying this camera. In addition the QR code for the wifi sends me to a site asking for money. Macro isn't macro. Most photos look grainy. Not 64mp looking at all. Kids toy not for photography."
"Camera Was A Great Price, Upon Recording My Live Show It Turned Itself Off And Ejected Its Own Battery . Ruined My Live Recording ."
Camera feels cheaply made.  Not really what I was looking for.  The WiFi button doesn’t work 😮‍💨
Not the quality of photos and video as advertised...poor quality photos
quality is not good. thought i was making a smart purchase for a beginner camera and its awful.
its not as good as it days and i hate having to go back and for just to see the pictures  and it came broken the pice for the light  dosent hold on to it
If I could give 0 I would. This is a toy camera for children. Highly saturated and pixelated. Made in china. You know how you press the button to take a picture? And you can feel the shutter of the lense? Yeah there’s none of that just an electronic 💥 sound for the picture being taken. It’s like having a toy phone take a picture.
I was fooled by all of the positive reviews and bought this. After unboxing and trying it out a bit I started looking deeper into the reviews and found the more realistic reviews and couldn't agree more. The camera looks nice but my phone takes much better photos. It's no good. Keep looking for something better. I returned it immediately.
Brought camera for my daughter 14th birthday and the pictures come out blurry every time.
"What company would sell a product that is only compatible with Windows 8 or lower?  Apparently this scamster company.  Just for reference Windows 10 was released on July 15, 2015 to manufacturers!  So if you have PC that is less than 8 years old this camera won't work on your PC.  Wow, that's just breathtaking in it's audacity to list a product incompatible with any PC manufactured in the last 8 years.  Shame on you Saneen"
I thought it would allow other lenses.  Plus the focus is horrible.
the quality is really bad and after every button it makes a  loud noise
The pictures turn out awful. I am returning.
The camera was a good size and weight but the camera quietly was very grainy and slow. Would not recommend if you are trying to take good photos. Maybe for kids to play with.
My dislike is that I can’t change the length
Absolutely terrible quality and missed the window to return. Save your money!
Not great but I expected that for the money
"What a bad quality for pictures, is better to invest in something good than something that is bad quality."
I have not found anywhere where i can get additional batteries. I wish i would have know that there may be no options for additional batteries. Would be very helpful.
"Not that great, my iPhone 11 has better picture and better close up lensesActually wish I would have Checked it out better… low quality"
"Pictures are very grainy even on 64mp, my phone camera is more compact and easier to carry than this bulky bad quality camera, I was super excited to get this camera, now it was a total disappointment."
My boys love this little camera
Overpriced & poor quality.
Thought I would just deal with the poor quality photos since I already purchased it and just use the camera for recording purposes instead but unfortunately the damn thing will not even come back on and I only used it twice and only had it for a month. And can’t request a refund since I’m past 30 days so I don’t recommend using this product. Cheap but not worth it.
It says that the camera is 4k but the quality on the camera is no where near 4k all the photos I take are very blurry and also the battery life is not very long
Cheap Broke  I Want My Money BACK Or Replaced with A Better one  ASAP... Really Don't Deserve Any Stars. please refund or exchange camera
This camera was not good quality and stop working after a weak
Terrible wifi transfer photo’s.  Really bad knobs operating system . No way to take steady shots if object is in motion.
"Low quality and no name ,wasted my money on this"
The worst camera I have ever bought. It just sits on the shelf now. The pictures are awful that it produces.
"I’m very surprised at how poorly this camera performed.1. It’s not “user friendly”.2. Blurry images regardless of range nor which feature was being used.3. It had multiple paid reviewers post videos of the product, everything seemed to check out, however, nothing checked out as the reviewers testified to."
Quality was not what I was looking for. Not even for a back up camera. Looks are deceiving…
"I ordered this device. It was trash. Instead of them issuing my refund to my account they got it from, they issued the account to an Amazon account card. Im not happy. The money was drafted from an account that i would have liked my money to have been back deposited on."
"I just got this camera today. After toying with it a bit, I'm going to return it.It's advertised as 4K, but if you set the video quality to 4K, the end result is really laggy. I found a sweet spot at two settings down at FHD, but it was really frustrating that the quality advertised didn't work well.Plus, and my greatest frustration with this camera, there's NO AUTOFOCUS IN VIDEO MODE. I scoured the settings and the web trying to figure out how to turn it on but came up short and other reviews of the camera I was watching in my research showed that any videos filmed with it had that same lack of focus. It captures good video far sighted, but anything up close will never be in focus.Mind, if I bought the camera for photography, I would have kept it. The autofocus works smooth as butter on photo mode and captures really good quality photos, which can be transferred to your computer extremely easily.However, I bought this camera for filmmaking, which it regrettably does NOT work well for. Definitely thinking twice from now on before buying a camera online."
"Upon opening the box, it seems to come with everything you will need to get started taking pictures and making videos. From here, things start to go down hill. The still shots actually come out pretty good. The problem is the shutter button seems to have to be double pushed to get the shot off.  There is a slight delay and you often will miss the intended shot.The 4K setting only records in 15 fps. Footage in 4k at 15 fps has an extremely noticeable wobble effect. The next setting down still studders at 30 fps. Everything under 1080 p would be usable if not for the horrible audio quality.At this time, I can't speak definitively on battery life, but it is seeming like the battery life is not the best.I wish I had better news, but in my opinion, you should save your money and by a quality camera."
"In all honesty, this is a camera that I would buy for my 8-10yr old nephew/niece who said they were interested in photography. Has the most basic camera settings, but the quality of the image is poor."
The picture is awful. Not worth the money.
"I don't understand all the positive reviews for this camera.  I have multiple cameras that I use with ease and this was so complicated to go from one setting to another.  The instruction manual was also about useless.  There are settings for different types of scenes and actions, but I could not figure out how to get to them!  If there was an option that was less than one star, I would give that!"
I bought this camera because of the reviews but I can’t get it to take a quality picture. This is not a 4K camera as advertised. The instructions are cheap and vague and something I would expect to pay $29.99 for not what I payed. I even downloaded this picture to my computer and it’s grainy. I have tried several of the picture settings to no avail. I’m very disappointed and will be returning this product!
Everytime i put the sd card in and it clicks it just falls out. It won't stay at all. I'm not sure why it's even made like that. So I can't do anything else cause the sd card won't go in so don't know how the picture is or anything. I would record it but for some reason it won't let me.
"I was so curious... how could they produce a camera that does all of these things for this price.  I found out. Easy to use, lots of features, printed instruction book, two batteries, memory card, cable for data transfer, what's not to love?  This camera's image quality and shooting experience reminds me of the images that we produced in 1999 when we bought our first digital camera.  Slight lag in the shutter, very poor low light quality, no flash just an super bright lcd (a great concept if you also had a flash).  On the other hand this camera has so many things going for it and has so many features that if you need an outdoor fun camera that only has a digital zoom, go for it."
"tbh it's a nice starter camera. Just know, you really get what you pay for. The quality is decent and the camera itself feels nice and sturdy. The reason I say you get what you pay for is because the camera quality on an iPhone is better than this. I also wish there was a way to not display the date/time on the pictures."
"I bought this while it was on sale. I thought this camera would work well for a budget photo booth for my wedding reception. The bottom of the camera allows it to be screwed into a tripod, and the flip screen is perfect for both taking selfies and setting up the camera for timed shots (for the ghetto photo booth). I find if you want it to work with a Macbook, you need to link the USB directly to your Macbook, which means you definitely need a USB C cord.  Of all the similar options out there, you get what you pay for in value. Group shots of people are mostly blurry. You’re better off using your smartphone if you want sharp group images. Other photos close up seem fine."
"I bought this camera and it only turns on when it's on the charger cord when I unplug it , it turns off very disappointing"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Super cute and good size for a digital camera, Quality isn’t the best and depends on lighting but is good for quick memorable pictures for that digital camera look !"
Not great indoors. My eight year old loves it though.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Quality isn't as good as I was expecting. Also does not process the higher quality when transferring on iphone. Took for ever to download on the app and even after they weren't transferred to my camera roll so idk where they went. Quality of pictures is good and video is average. Only kept it's quality when I downloaded on a laptop so that would be preferred. Transfering was super easy. For a good price, you get just good quality, but wouldn't say it's 4k."
"What I like about this camera is the flip up screen so when your in video mode you can have it on a tripod and see how to angle the camera. It's not as high if quality as I thought I was getting, but it has decent photo quality."
"The camera is cute and exciting because the screen flips up so you can see yourself if you take a selfie. But, the app that is supposed to sync the camera photos to your phone doesn’t work. It (the app) looks like the very beginning stages of a sketchy off shore drop shipping. The camera is supposed to have its own WiFi which is how it connects to the app—the WiFi is too weak and not secure to connect to the phone. It’s sad because I was really excited."
Camera has pretty good quality for the price that was paid. All functions were easy to manage and figure out. The only reason I gave it a 3-star is because some of the photos came out looking stretched out even when the photo itself was super clear.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The focus is not very good and I think that’s one of the main part of a camera
It’s nice but the quality is a bit less than I expected. It’s good for regular photos with friends
"the camera quality isnt terrible for what you pay for, I was excited to use it for little trips and such just to have some other storage places, but the camera doesnt even work off the charger... im guessing i got bad batteries but like really lol idek what kind of batteries they came with so now i just have a broken camera in my closet..."
"Only complaint is that it didn't come with a lens cap. Other than that, it is a pretty good low price, middle quality camera."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            After doing a lot of research, I decided to buy this camera because some of its reviews convinced me. When I got it and started testing it, the first thing I noticed was that the lens was exposed at all times; it doesn't close automatically like most digital cameras. When I started taking photos and videos, I could see from the display that they weren't very good quality. But I had hopes that by transferring them to a computer or cell phone they would look better. In reality, the difference isn't much. So I ended up returning it. I think I'll wait until I have more budget to buy a better quality one."
"This may be good for selfie videos but it’s really not great for still shots. It’s hard to move around the commands and the auto focus stinks. I should have returned it, but I was past the window. Just keep using your phone if you want photos."
"I really hope this black camera would be great, but it's been nothing but trouble. Every time I put in an SD card, it just restarts and wipes out all my photos! It's honestly so frustrating. I was looking forward to using it to capture some memories, but it's been completely unreliable!"
"the sound audio isn’t great it’s very low , Camera wouldn’t work after charging for more than two hours runs out of storage fast!"
"the camera is very light in weight and has no lens cap cover....there is a function menu with many choices, none of which have any explanation in the instructions....so i used my best guess and set up for 'standard' images with medium sharpness and everything mostly on 'auto' and i got a bunch of very soft focus images and no detail that each ate up 5 Mb per image (for a 70 Kb image result) ... so not sure whats going on....the camera autofocus is very active.....everything is done electronically, there are no moving parts, so even though the menu says this and that is selected its anybody's guess what is happening inside the machine  ...downloading images is straightforward........more testing and an update will follow...UPDATE:...i can't focus the images...the autofocus is very active and hunts up and down, won't settle down...the manual focus is through the half-depressed shoot button on top...i get one image in focus out of 10....i need a camera that's easier to use, this one takes images but the focus issue seems to be an insurmountable problem"
"After eagerly upgrading to this highly-touted 4K camera, I was left seriously disappointed by its performance.First off, despite claiming 4K resolution, the image quality doesn’t live up to the hype. In low-light settings, the photos and videos are grainy and blurry, reminiscent of older 1080p devices. Even in well-lit environments, the level of detail is lacking, and the sharpness just isn't there. For a camera advertised as delivering ""ultra-high-definition,"" this is a major letdown.The autofocus is another glaring issue. The camera frequently struggles to focus properly, leaving images oscillating between sharp and blurry. This makes it extremely frustrating to capture clear, consistent shots, especially when you're trying to work quickly.Lastly, the color reproduction is equally disappointing. Instead of rich, vibrant colors, the footage often appears flat and dull, with skin tones looking off and overall color accuracy well below expectations for a 4K device.In summary, this 4K camera falls far short of what I had hoped for. If you’re expecting crisp, high-definition results, you’ll be sorely let down. It’s a clear reminder that not all cameras with high specs deliver on their promises."
"I purchased this 4K camera with high hopes, but was disappointed. The photo quality in low light conditions produced grainy photos. The autofocus was delayed. A very clunky and confusing menu system is frustrating to work with. I did however, like the selfie option just wished the screen swiveled 360. I appreciated all the accessories that came with camera."
I am about to return this.
"Like many other things on Amazon, it’s just cheap Chinese garbage.  The battery life goes down after you take 5 photos, the quality of the photos and videos is not good.  Bottom line, it’s cheap for a reason.  I like to buy things I already know are good through Amazon for the convenience of it but anytime I take a shot on something that I’ve never used, it turns out to be junk and this is no different.  Now I have to contact Amazon and get a refund and deal with customer service that doesn’t speak English"
Bought this for my teen .. easy set up photos not the best video is ok sound is awful!. I'd spend a little more money for a better camera
"The mega pixels are great, but the auto focus doesn’t work well. I ended up with about 1/3 of my photos being blurry."
"Not sure if I recieved a defective unit, but I am returning this camera. I was not able to get it to charge either of the included batteries. I tried various wall warts as well as various USB cables, yet I was unable to charge the batteries.Be advised, the camera also does not include any form of lens cover or protection when turned off, this could lead to damage if not handled with care."
"The app they provide with the camera for instant upload to your phone is faulty. It will have you scan a QR code that takes you to download an app “Zero Cam”. The app doesn’t work, it throws you in a loop over and over again saying “connect over time!” instead of letting you connect when you set the camera up. I am leaving a 1 star because this was the sole reason I purchased the camera to begin with, I feel like if you don’t have a functioning app to go with that should be stated from the jump."
"Shuts off randomly, camera is black doesn’t take pictures a total waste of my time and money. I wanted this for my trip but got it broken and couldn’t even use it. If I could do no stars I would!!!"
"Goes out of focus the moment the photo button is pushed. he fixed focus seemed to stabilize, however, the final picture is TERRIBLE...BLURRED!!  ZERO STARS IF THERE WAS AN OPTION."
"It turned on for 5 minutes and then shut off. I tried everything, even charge the battery for hours and it won’t turn back on. Very disappointing camera, returned."
"I purchased this camera over a month ago, and from the moment I got it, it wouldn't turn on, which has been frustrating to say the least."
"Very blurry, the battery died very quickly after a long charge. Did not realize it isn’t touch screen, no way to control the zoom in and out, quality of phot was very pixelated. Just no. Very unhappy with this camera."
Big mistake.  I should have just kept using my phone. At least you can tell what the subject is in the picture.  It's awful.
Doesn’t work at all. Flash just stays on and pictures don’t turn out at all. Rip off.
"I needed a small camera for a trip, so I didn't have to lug the big one around. I purchased this one to save some money. I am totally disappointed in this camera. 2/3 of the photos do not focus and I am no stranger to a camera and how they operate. Save your time and money and purchase something with a brand name. This one will be used by our toddler granddaughter for fun."
"I purchased this 4K camera with high hopes, but it has proven to be a major disappointment. The photo quality is bad in low light conditions with grainy photos. The autofocus is not good, it feels cheap to the build, the battery life is very bad, and it does heat up very fast. A very clunky and confusing menu system is frustrating to work with. avoid this model. And buy the Nikon or Sonny might be a better option."
I had ordered one and loved it so I decided to buy it again as a Christmas present for my brother since he liked the one I brought myself. I reordered it maybe a week after I got mine and when I received it there was NO camera just a black charging cord nothing else
"absolute worst…. dont waste your money, just buy the more expensive cameras. the app doesnt work & pictures on camera are always blurry & out of focus."
Camera doesn’t work I followed all instructions and it’s still not working
Every picture you take is blurry. My iPhone take better pictures than this. Would not even give 1 star. No matter what you do every image is a blur and can’t make it out. Tried all settings to fix it
"he packaging and texture of the camera are quite good, but the photo resolution is a bit low. It's suitable for kids to practice photography with. It seems like the camera has built-in memory, so there's no need to buy an additional memory card, which is a nice feature."
Would not recommend this. The quality is very subpar and the app to transfer your pictures from device to phone doesn’t work.
Literally horrible quality pictures. The “flash” is not a flash. It stays on. It’s the worst flash I have ever seen. Why are people writing good reviews? That’s the only reason I bought it
"garbage, blurry picture. cheap quality. don't buy"
It’s fun to have but my phone takes better pictures I’ll just be returning this camera sadly
Brand new out of the box… Camera won’t stay on unless plugged in.  Returning and investing in a better one.
"was not good quality at all how the pictures described it was , the buttons were also really loud and my phone was overall better for pictures than this"
This was missing key items such as the 32gb card
Stopped working after the first day. Would only turn on if plugged into the charger.
Received a camera wrist strap only. No camera.
"WORST CAMERA EVER, SAVE YOUR MONEY! this camera is faulty"
Returning because camera will not operate without being plugged in
"When I got this camera I thought I was doing something wrong, it doesn't turn on if it's not plugged in. The camera will be fully charged and when I unplug the charger the camera turns off. Very disappointing"
"I am disappointed with it because there is no lens cap, so I have to be careful . Not worth the price. It doesn't offer features that justify its price,it makes me feel like it's  waste of money. There is a significant discrepancy between the product description and its actual performance .Overall, the product fails to meet my expectations and is not recommended."
"The screen had a crack in it right out of the box, and the packaging was damaged too. It's embarrassing as I had planned to give this as a present, but it looks like a used camera."
"I am extremely disappointed with its performance. The image quality is bad, with BLURRY pictures that are completely unusable. No matter how many times I adjust the settings, the focus seems off, Even in well-lit environments, the photos look grainy and lack clarity. The Camera quality also feels cheap,  I would NOT RECOMMEND this camera"
"Bought that for my daughter because she ask for it, but disappointed on the pictures quality, I don’t think it’s 4K, my daughter currently owned a iPhone 11 even took better quality pictures. Not worth to try."
This is great starter for kids doing photography or video. Not the highest quality but not a cheap plastic one either. Middle ground beginner
"This camera is terrible in every aspect and design, to get the SD card out you have to open the battery compartment, which when doing so you loose all the settings as in date and time on the camera and you have to completely reset everything. If you use the cord to download the pictures to your computer instead of taking out the card it drains the batteries very quickly. Even when not using the cord to download, the batteries drain very quickly, it's such an issue that it's one of the trouble shooting things that they have listed with this camera. There solution is to shut off any apps or things on the camera you're not using, tells you to turn down the brightness of the screen. Really your solution to this problem is to disable features that are on this camera, what's the point of having those features if when using them they drain the batteries very quickly. Let me explain what I use this camera for, to take pictures of items I sell on line. I put in a new set of energizer batteries, tested them with my ohm/volt tester, they tested 1.58 volts. I took 17 pictures downloaded them by using the cord and then I took 10 more pictures and the camera shut off and right before it did it said batteries expired. So I took the batteries out and tested them and they tested 1.28 volts, which will make most things still run, like my game cameras. There's definitely an issue with these cameras and the power they use and how fast they drain batteries. I've also have had it lock up and stop working several times and it wouldn't shut off or do anything, had to open up the battery compartment which takes all the power from the camera so it will reset and then close it and then turn it back on. I had a Sony Cyber shot which they don't make anymore, for over 10 years and I took literally thousands of pictures with it and it cost half as much and the pictures were clearer and of higher quality than what this camera is capable of taking. I would still be using the Sony, but some how it developed a gray spot that was showing up in all of my pictures and it was causing potential buyers to ask what that spot was on the item. So I had to stop using it and bought this camera thinking it would work great for what I was doing and also work great for taking pictures of nature and wildlife. I wish I would have sent it back right away, but I figured I would give it a chance to get better, because they said it would if I did the update. Well it's only gotten worse with time instead of better."
"I am currently taking a digital photography course and needed an affordable digital camera to use for projects. This one is a good price for what it is able to do; the image quality is great (don't be fooled by what you see on the camera's screen, the images look fantastic once loaded onto a computer) and i personally found the controls to be easy to learn for a beginner (even without a manual) but I just wasn't satisfied with the focus. This camera does not have manual focus as a feature, only auto focus, so you're kinda at the mercy of it. I personally would like to be in full control of my camera and its settings, but unfortunately this camera lacks a feature that I find is imperative to its use. At first I thought it was my fault that the camera would not focus, maybe I was too shaky or breathing too much etc. etc., but after some trial and error and a bit of research- I found that the main problem with this camera is its inability to focus well. It will focus, it just takes a Herculean amount of effort to get it to do so.I'd say that the KODAK AZ405 is great for those looking for a relatively cheaper option with which to begin their photography journey, but if you are considering buying this model I'll warn you to make sure that you have enough patience to deal with its focusing issue to prevent becoming so frustrated that you throw it out a window."
"I tried many diffent settings and the three options for the camera focus and no matter what setting this camera loses focus and the image gets blurry. Plus the photos are dark and not natural looking, they are usually darker and has too much color in my opinion. My samsung s21 phone takes pictures 100x clearer and sharper than this camera, and they would be clear enough even with low light. I guess this camera is only good for sunny days.  But not being able to focus fast anough and taking dark pictures with low quality makes it useless  for me. Plus the lens cap falls ,it won't hold in place. I am returning it and getting a Nikon instead now  ! By the way I sent the camera back and AMAZON gave me the full refund with no stress, the problem was the product ,not the Amazon, Amazon did a good Job  !"
"Since becoming a mother, I’ve been wanting to get a camera to capture moments instead of always using my phone and taking up storage space! This is a great beginner camera! The camera is lightweight & I’m excited to use it .Some cons are there don’t seem to be many videos on how to use this camera to it’s entirety as far as the different features and the user manual is super short and doesn’t tell you much. The only other con which isn’t a huge dealbreaker for me is that the autofocus is extremely slow . I’m going to test it out for a few days and leave an updated review !**** okay after a few days I had to come back and update my review. The autofocus is still very slow which ended up being a deal breaker after all seeing how other cameras capture photos and the picture quality isn’t that great on the camera (it could be different once downloaded but I’m not sure) . Don’t recommend the purchase"
You can't take multiple pictures at a time. The quality of the photo however is nice. Old technology.
It did not have the eye view
"I used this product for photographing a model in amble light situations. I am not a professional but even after doing some research and studying this camera for use, I could not find a pleasant photo to show for it. I tried each camera setting, adjusted each of these setting, and even fixed the lighting in each of my photo areas. Still, my photos would come out blurry, noisy, Or underexposed. I tried to give this camera the benefit of the doubt and see if the video setting was any better than the photo. I admit this camera has decent quality, video recording but, after trying to view that same video on a computer(Lenovo- chrome book) I was unable to see the file or video. Which again became a big disappointment.  Although I read the reviews before purchasing this camera I still had to give it a try for myself! After trying this camera out I would not primarily recommend this camera to any friends! I can say that you get what you paid for. This is a nice cheap camera which has potential if you’re invested in learning how to use it or invested in purchasing camera accessories to make your photos pop. 2/5 Stars."
"This camera was a little heavy and bulky for me. Lots of options which may be great for some, but being new to photography. It was more complicated than I needed."
Takes dark pictures even with the flash on
Bought this last minute for a summer camp. Terrible focusing ability no matter the settings. Super disappointing. Returned.
It does take pictures. And it does use AA batteries and it was inexpensive. These were three criteria I had for a camping camera. Outside if that it doesn’t have many admirable qualities. It’s slow to fire up. You will almost certainly need to use a tripod for stabilizing. The features that it does have are buried in layers of menus and it has a bit of a learning curve to figure out what combination of menu items will get you the desired pasture speed and fstop you need. This is definitely NOT for quick moving animals that may be gone in a blink. For landscapes or passive scenes it should be fine.
"Bought this as a first camera for my wife. She loves taking pictures so she’d always take my phone as it has a better camera. So I decided to buy her this $185 camera as a gift expecting it to at least match the camera of her iPhone 11, with a better zoom. Boy was I wrong. I’ve attached a picture to the review, just look at it, a half-baked potato would’ve done a better job. iPhone 11 photo beside it for comparison.Perhaps photographers are gonna laugh at me and ask what I expected. But let this be a caution for beginners like me – save yourself from a headache, don’t buy this camera. Phones probably do a better job at this price point anyways, don’t bother and get a more expensive option straight away or just keep taking iPhone pictures"
"I wish I'd listened to the reviews more. I bought this for the lens that could zoom (mainly to take pictures of backyard birds), but the photos simply aren't sharp enough. They're really no better than my older phone. The plus is that it's a very easy camera to use and would be good for someone who wanted something basic. But honestly, if the quality isn't that great, why wouldn't someone just use their phone???"
I bought the camera for it's zoom capabilities.  The camera takes great photos of subjects that are close.  However if you use the zoom the photos behind blurry and worthless.  My cell phone camera does better.
Very difficult to get a photo that is clear resolution & editing in an app after loading onto computer doesn’t help any. Also difficult to get lighting set for each picture. Everything is too dark. I bought it to train my grandson to use a camera. I’ll just let him use my pro camera! I would’ve returned it but it was a gift & window had closed by the time he got it.
Not a terrible camera but definitely not what I expected. On overcast days the pics are blah. Otherwise the pics are clear but not as good as a typical smartphone camera. Haven't used the recording function much but it seems to be about the same as still pics.
"Using The words Digital and Vlogging is Misleading. The camera DOES NOT connect to wifi (it is not a feature) to easily upload to my phone or any apps. Also doing research on it is a TASK! No one barley did a review on the camera, nor cares for it. IM OVER IT"
"Lens cap keeps falling off, seems to be missing two of the felt pads"
When transferring video from My new Kodak PIXORP AZ 405 to my editing software the Video transfers BUT NO AUDIO!MOV (Motion JPEG) does NOT work in all video editing programs.
"I am not happy with the quality.  I cannot get this camera to focus right.  Buyer beware, I should have sent it back."
"This camera was the worst perchase I have ever made. I bought it on May 20th, and it is June 11th, it has shut off completely and will not turn back on. It does have amazing quality, the pictures came out great and is very easy to use. The battery lasts a very long time. It zooms very far in and is a very nice camera. But I do not recommend buying this its usage life is very short. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!"
"I owned a similar Kodak camera many years ago, so I thought this would be a great camera for my trip to Alaska. Wrong. So glad I had my phone camera for a back up. As far as ease of use, sure it was fairly simple to operate. Settings were not too complex to figure out.But the picture quality is just terrible. It wouldn’t focus 90% of the time. I tried and tried to adjust the settings, nothing helped. I finally gave up the hopes of getting any kind of quality picture out of this camera. The Kodak brand did not live up to the standard it once had."
Image quality is not at all as advertised. The camera does not focus well on smaller items or subjects. Macro setting is useless. Image is not true to color.
"The picture quality is so bad, I wish I returned it."
"this thing sucks, bought it for distance pictures and the zoom is blurry and will not even zoom all the way in. would not recommend"
"Very poor quality camera, sent it back"
"Giving 1 star because I can’t give zero.  Within 2 months this camera completely broke: randomly shuts off while shooting, randomly won’t turn on, lens won’t retract, and now it permanently won’t turn on.  Window for return was 30 days.  Fighting for my money back because I took it to a camera shop and they told me it couldn’t be repaired."
"This is the second exact same camera we've purchased. The first one lasted 6 months. The second 2 weeks. Kodak should be ashamed for putting out such a terrible performing product. The review is a reflection of the camera/manufacturer, not the two different companies we purchased them from. DO NOT BUY!!!!!"
"Very Disappointed Took great pics . Now it won't turn on . Or . comes on , then shuts off. Lense won't close They didn't allow me to return it"
Picture quality was horrible
Don’t waist your money. You can take better picture’s with your phone.
The zoom was terrible on any setting. The images were blurry and unusable. I tried a tripod to stabilize the camera and it was still blurry. Very disappointed and returned it. I expected better of Kodak.
Should have heeded the warnings of other reviews.This camera yields the same image quality as my child's $50 toy camera. Item returned for refund.
Horrible camera. Picture quality is awful. I was very disappointed in the camera.
"Even with  careful, steady use, photos are blurry."
Camera stop working after less than a month
Cannot transfer pics or videos to I Phone or I Pad
"This camera is an engineering marvel, It seems like a ½ sized version of a Digital single lens reflex camera (DSLR). You can control everything.shutter speed.lens opening, light sensitivity (iso) and on and on. Practically anything the big boys can do,this camera can do. It even has a 40X zoomEXCEPT IT CAN'T TAKE A SHARP PICTURE. It’s difficult to get the auto focus to stay focused on one object, it keeps changing.  I tried a faster shutter speed coupled with a higher ISO(3200), I tried a smaller aperture for greater depth of field. I tried landscape photos and bird photos.I waited for the square in the center of the screen to turn green (takes too long to use on animal photos),  I finally got desperate and put the camera on a tripod on full auto.Then I got an acceptable picture. The anti shake mechanism doesn’t seem to do anything.I really wanted this camera to work out. I had the notion to use this as a backup camera when I travel. I cannot recommend this camera because of the difficulty  of using it hand held. You can squeeze out the occasional barely acceptable photo but not consistently.The flower photo is acceptable but lacks real sharpness. It was taken in bright sunlight with the camera on auto mounted on a tripod. The other two in bright afternoon sunlight. I selected these as the best of the 110 pictures that the batteries would take before being exhausted. the vast majority of the photos  were unusable."
"If you need to save space on your phone, a camera is a good way to do that.  I don’t know how to attaché the strap to hold it"
"The zoomed out feature is useless for videos. In 40x zoomed, when trying to record animals, it keeps flicking in and out of focus. It is out of focus most of the time. There is no setting to stop it from doing this. I do not recommend."
But it didn’t work didn’t turn on not sure why
This camera is loaded with features has 20MP and 4x optical zoom. Great value camera to learn how to use advance features without spending piles of money. but just can't get over the fact that it uses non chargeable batteries. really makes it a pain if your using it heavily or doing videos.
The amber light kept on blinking. Not sure what sort of quality control it undergoes
"I bought the camera for family photos at Christmas, and the camera came with this defect that seems to me to be from the factory. You can see a black spot in the image, in the upper left and right corners. As if the lens had a problem. The camera zoom is also having a problem. Disappointing and sad."
This camera doesn't focus or doesn't detect anything. It always takes blurr images and videos.
"poor quality camera, and poor quality taking photos...lag on simple shotslens cover falls off without motionsimple photo takes llllloooonnnggg time to be taken40x zoom is a joke with poor stabilisationno, don't buy it"
"dont not buy.  mounting nut in base for tripod broke from the body of camera, falling on the ground damaging camera  nut is plastic"
Great camera just be on the understanding that it not rechargeable batteries and will end up spending a fortune on batteries
It's a good looking cam that does the job. But it's a bit outdated. A bit of bluetooth would have made it worth the money.
"Not a bad camera although the lack of view finder makes it difficult to frame a really good picture,the mode choice wheel is too loose and can easily change without you noticing, it's OK for snaps but if you want to take more serious pictures get something with a view finder"
Frankly you can get better pictures from a disposable camera. This is just a complete waste of money so avoid at all costs.
"For the price of this camera is expecting better. I almost feel bad by my girlfriend this, our iPhone cameras are literally better than this thing."
"Alot of different settings. No apps to download, just be patient when learning how to use,and read the instructions properly."
"Ended up returning for a refund as the camera was unable to focus on every shot I took. After trawling to web to find out what I could be doing wrong or if there was a certain setting I needed to use, it turns out that this is a known issue with this camera, which I as a complete novice attempting to buy my first ever quality bridge camera had no idea about.Honestly, my IPhone 8 took better quality pictures than this camera, so don’t waste your money on this."
"Easy point and shoot,Lens cap will not stay on, therefore the lens gets scratched and dirtyI am a senior and my hands shake, so even though the zoom is nice, without a tripod the pictures are blurryI should have returned it within the first 30 days but wanted to give it a better chanceMy main complaint is that the return window should be longer"
"I got this camera to photograph wildlife and  as a step up from my old mobile Samsung S8 camera. I was impressed with the zoom and is its main feature. I find the 20Mpixel a bit miss leading and the options for picture saving is of three quality settings as a Jpeg format. no raw mode. focusing is automatic, even in manual mode. Macro is poor. if using HDR its slow at taking the photo, even with a quality fast Sandisk SD card. For ease of use and features I keep going back to my mobile.In short, over priced for the features it has, Samsung S23 or Apple equivalent will out class it. in fact my old Fuji finepix s8200 is better for stills and that's from 2014."
"Not to sure, picture quality seems dark, battery life short , lens cover very loose , sd card stopped working after a few days of using it , good price, hopefully will get better"
Bought this for 18th birthday present.  He loves it
"Camera does not display. It does start, allows me to change settings but no display from lens (yes. cap is off). I have also tried to communicate with Amazon and only hit road blocks, have not spoke with anyone about the order specifically. At one point I was told I would be sent an email...I was not."
Doesn't matter what program I chose the pictures are blurred. So disappointing
"Bought this in Oct. As Christmas present for daughter. Only took a couple pictures and quality wasn't great ,got someone that had similar camera to take a look at it ,and the zoom focus button didn't work ,tried contacting company through the links listed on Amazon, but only replies were to say wasn't eligible for refund and when email company it said it was wrong department given me the same email address as what I had written too .so complete run around ..not impressed."
"Was disappointed  that the lens cap keeps falling off, bit concerned about scratching lens"
Don’t bother. My child is in 4h. I thought this would be an easy to use camera for him. Every single shot is blurry . Even when I change it to sport mode. And when he turns it on and off again it resets everytime. This is not worth the price
"Terrible camera, super slow at actually taking a photo and mediocre quality. Drains batteries super quickly."
I dicided to return it even before trying it because the ergonomics are bad and I can do without it.
"The camera doesn't take clear photos. In all modes, the photos are blurry. I needed for an event and I wasn't satisfied with picture quality,  and ended up using my camera on my cell phone."
for the price thought picture quality would be better it's as if your taking pictures through a toddler pretent camera. It's awful quality
This camera is impossible to use - tiny buttons all over it with tiny symbols on them. Absolutely confusing and frustrating. I sent it back immediately!
Got this camera for Christmas and the quality of the pictures just aren’t great. I wanted to start using this to take pictures of my children instead of my phone but the quality doesn’t match my phone pictures. Really disappointed
"Update #1 - The Instruction pamphlet is a tiny 13 page, 2.75 x 4 inch size.  I happen to have 7 power reading glasses for my art work and it took all of that just to read it.  Locating where to change the camera's language from Chinese to English was not easy but I eventually did it. Obviously this is the main accomplishment that is needed. I will add another update regarding the camera itself.  The instructions talk about formatting the micro sd card but with no instructions on how to do this. This will be part of my next update.Update #2 - I return VERY FEW products, especially after originally seeing higher than average reviews for it. Although there was some mention of having to format the micro-SD card, one small plus is that the card worked as sent without me having to do anything to it. Luckily I had a micro-SD card reader.  If you don't, then be prepared to buy one. Not sure if you can download the images  through the charging cord.  Didn't see that fact anywhere.  If you own a MacBook, good luck on accessing the SD card.  Apple stopped building these into their computers.  You will have to spend more money for an external plug-in auxiliary device to read SD cards on your Mac,  That cost me more than the camera, but I already own one. However, I also have an old Dell and looked at my pictures that way. I quickly discovered that I had to go into the camera's settings and put every quality setting on the highest mark to take a decent photo. Also, the camera was set from the factory to take burst shots and to reset that to taking one shot at a time was another big chore by just playing with the menu.  Not so difficult if you have some experience with camera menus.  The photos were just so so. My iPhone takes much better pictures, plus on my phone I can blow them up without loosing clarity.  Not so with the photos this camera takes. Trying to blow them up was not possible. If you are a photographer, you know the importance of having this ability.  Bottom line here is that this camera is not even worthy of 1 star."
"the best this camera has is a front screen great for viewing yourself after holding down the ""Ok"" button. the camera click sound can be turned off, the other sounds, i couldnt figure out how to turn them off. not a silent camera. my camera had issues saving files to the memory card and transfering them.i successfully got it to connect to my PC and Chromebook computer as a webcam.it doesnt record audio well at all. it only records the sound of cracking and something falling. i never got it to record a single voice. it has easy to read and learn settings, making it great for kids. it comes in a cute color pink.the video quality is decent. the camera photography quality isnt. you need good lighting to work with it. great for someone who has a lighting and a microphone set up, but needs a budget video camera. definitely not great for photography. i wouldnt gift this to a child 😂i would add a photo or video from the camera, but somehow the technology deleted all my photos and videos after i recorded it on the 64gb micro sd card given."
This camera should not have such high ratings. The image quality is terrible.
"Don’t buy this. The claim of 64 megapixels is bogus interpolation. The lens is a tiny pinhole. The zoom is digital zoom only, nothing to do with the “lens”. This is basically a crappy webcam in portable form. Nothing but 5-star reviews (at the time of writing) is extremely suspect."
This camera should be around 60-70 dollars for the quality. Lacks brightness but if you’re looking for something for 90s aesthetic it works
"Don't waste your money on this cheap digital camera. It worked for a couple of days, then it didn't turn on anymore, and the seller is not responsible for anything."
Was not what I expected screen was not lit up well very hard to see pictures
The buttons do not work. You have to push several times and still may not work
"This may be good for selfie videos but it’s really not great for still shots. It’s hard to move around the commands and the auto focus stinks. I should have returned it, but I was past the window. Just keep using your phone if you want photos."
"Tl;Dr: This is a good LOOKING product, and does exactly what it says it will. However, photo quality is not at all what it should be, and the mechanics are quite finicky. If you must have an instant-develop camera, keep looking.I researched instant-print cameras and this was supposed to be a good choice if you want a photo larger than two postage stamps put together. Unfortunately, more research after I got it home and tried it out (and assumed I must be doing something wrong) tells me that no, it's just not a good product for what it's supposed to do: take and print photos.The quality of the pictures is terrible. Blurry, with washed out colors, and color that is just plain incorrect (a medium jewel purple came out almost pastel, etc). The lack of control over flash is a serious flaw as the camera's sensor seems to think it needs to go off any time you're indoors and not in the very brightest of lighting, so on top of everything the photos often come out seriously over-exposed. I get the feeling you'd get much better results taking pics from about six feet away (as is the intended use), but didn't waste more film trying that out.You're better off snapping pictures with your phone and taking a few extra seconds to just print them out in a small size. Very disappointed. Really wanted this to work so I could easily take pictures for journaling, but the photo quality is a non-starter, especially for the price.In addition:- The button to take a photo is VERY sensitive, so don't hold your finger anywhere near it until you're ready to take a picture- The frame in the viewfinder is extreeeemely inaccurate for photos that are taken within a few feet of the subject. I went through probably three to five shots before I figured out how to take them without getting several inches cut off of each side.- Definitely get extra film out of the gate (and I recommend a little case, too, otherwise it's just sitting out waiting to get scratched or banged around). The starer pack mine came with had five sheets, not ten, and I went through all of them just on the learning curve."
"The ""pressure plate"" or ""platen"" (metal piece in first image) should be attached to the back cover and presses against the paper to keep it aligned with the roller/feed mechanism. Upon opening it the first time, this platen fell out b/c it either wasn't attached sufficiently or the places it connects weren't molded well. I was able to put it back together and get a few usable prints out, but it fell apart each time I opened it. A small wire that helps hold the platen to the ""door"" came loose and was lost. The interface design is most frustrating. Referring to the second image, note the placement of the power button in proximity to the exposure button. Several times after shooting, then turning the camera to where the print exits, my finger would accidentally hit the power button & start the entire process over before the print made it out, losing the original because it stopped mid-process, then waiting for the accidental one to process & exit, losing yet another print. The buttons should be placed separate from each other, or recessed. The exit slot runs across roughly 80% of the entire camera height, creating another spacing problem should your finger happen to be covering part of it due to trying to hold the camera in an area that isn't going to cause the button(s) to be pressed again. The SD slot & USB connection is on the bottom. The ""charged"" light came on, but it actually only had enough charge for about 3 prints . . . SO, keep it plugged in if possible, and be constantly aware of where you're holding it.  I have yet to open the replacement, but I found no instructions in the first one, except the placement notation that the blue conditioner-sheet that comes with the paper packs. Cramming a quality dye-sub printer & camera together is quite a feat, and worth it if you keep these tips in mind while using it."
It is hard to get a great picture. Film has to be taken all at the same light for the pictures to turn out correctly and to find that light is difficult! We haven’t tried the sd card yet but that might be the way to go.
The camera works but takes very long between each time you take a picture. For example if you are taking 3 pics in a row the picture take longer to develop in between each one. The sticker inc is nice though. Fun for kids.
Prints out dark and streaky
Purchased for my 8 year olds birthday in May. It seems well made. Easy to use. She has fun with it for a few months and then it stopped working. Not sure if it was user error or just a poor product.
"I don't mind the Zink technology. Like that photos print so you can hand them out on site, but still have the images on the SD card so have your own copies.DEAL BRAKER:  The shutter button placement, lack of prominence and sensitivity. I think more photos we taken unintentionally by myself and others than photos intentionally taken. It is placed on the top right edge of the camera with no other space to hold it while framing your picture. Plus it's flat (nearly flush with the camera body) and white. Just like the top of the camera and the power button right next to it. Most frustrating, it barely depresses when you touch it, so the slightest bump takes a photo. Unlike some of the other cameras, this one doesn't give you the option to cancel before you print. God forbid you leave you finger on it for more than a half second, it will just keep taking more and more, so there goes all your film.The Kodak Step model has a button that is raised, so you at least know you are touching the button, as well as space for a finger to hold the camera between the edge and the shutter.I did have 4 other people test the camera and even provided detail warnings and demos of how not to accidentally press the shutter before it was positioned, and all failed. The ability to press down on a button seems like it might be a minor issue, but when you're consuming film, knowing if you even got the picture you wanted or not is kind of a critical thing.Returning for the Kodak Step."
"The camera is super adorable, but I probably should have spent more on a better camera.  I ordered this camera for my 8 year old so I wasn't willing to spend a lot more.  I am a bit disappointed.  She was so excited to use it right out of the box, but it was a bit tricky to figure out.  Almost too simple!There was no cord, which oh well I have a million cords so we figured that out after some searching.  When we first opened the camera we were hoping it would be charged enough to take 1-2 pictures right away but it didn't have enough of a charge.When we finally tried it, the camera was making all sorts of noises and it was hard to figure out what it was doing.  The user guide provided the most basic steps but no details.  I think it would be helpful to have a more through guide explaining steps in more detail.  Such as:  Step 1, charge the camera for X amount of time,  use a ___ type of cord.  Step 2, load paper following the paper instructions (insert more detail here).  Step 3, turn on camera by holding the power button for 3 seconds, the a light will illuminate when the camera is on.  Step 4, press the camera shoot button X amount a seconds until you hear ____ sound.  OR MAYBE A MORE DETAILED VIDEO.I tried finding a video on YouTube but I found nothing of use.  In fact the camera features have changed.  No black and white option, no three lights explaining what the camera is doing.  Once I figure this camera out I will have to post a tutorial since the manufacture seems to say ""You are on your own""."
"What I Liked: the camera automatically prints wallet sized photos and the kit included all the fun extras like stickers, frames to stick the photos on (they have sticky backs), markers and other things to decorate and display your pictures.What I didn't like: The photo quality is seriously lacking. The exposure is SO BRIGHT and the photos look a bit old and blurry, colors are diminished.Overall for a 14 year olds birthday gift she thought it was really cool. (Then again she doesn't have any other photo quality experience to compare it to as it's her first camera)"
"okie dokie so i reaaallly wanted this to work because i wanted to take it to a festival in vegas and AFTER i bought it i read the review lol but i had some hopes. i really wanted to get the grey or black but it wouldnt arrive to my house until after i left for vegas so i got the pink one. now I dont know if anyone else noticed a pattern but all the video and pic reviews that reviewed this badly had the PINK camera....im no professional but im just saying its somethin i noticed lol.  the pink one does NOT come with a charger and i figured out what the problem with this camera is. it jams. simple as that. just like any other printer. except this camera is so small and theres no access to the tray so you cant adjust it to make the paper not jam. the blue card came out because its much thicker than the photo paper and doesnt bend but when you take a picture the paper bends to just underneath the little ""tray"" thats supposed to help it slide out. if you look inside the camera where the paper comes out while the photo is developing youll know what im talking about. I kinda expected this so no biggie ill just return it and take my clunky polaroid. Oh well. hit and a miss...still cute tho"
"This is fun for a kid with the instant printing on sticker paper. However, it is a little disappointing for 3 main reasons:1. The photo paper costs at least 40 cents a picture, which I would gladly pay if the camera wasnt set up to print accidental photos constantly. If you barely touch or accidentally graze the trigger with a strand of hair, it takes a photo. This means a lot of junk accidental photos are taken and 40 cent 2x3 paper wasted.2. The quality of the photos is TERRIBLE. I'd rather have 3 mp with color that isn't completely washed out. We are very fair skinned people and all turn out like Casper on the camera. The photos look like photos you find from the 70s that weren't properly stored. Actually they look worse, because everything looks like you edited the pictures to turn the exposure up all the way.  I bought this based on good reviews online, but with the horrible quality of the pictures I'm shocked anyone would give this camera more than 3 stars.3. The pictures do save to an sd card If you install one, which is the main reason i bought this over other brands. However, iits kind of a bummer that you cant see your pictures before you choose to print them. Every photo has to waste a 40 cent zink paper. So having the sd card is really kind of pointless since you can't retrieve photos on the camera and print them later from the camera. You have to pull the sd card and put it in a computer or something to print at another time (which, with the awful quality of the photos, I cannot imagine ever wanting to do anyway).I think my 9 year old will enjoy this anyway, but even her first comment was ""how come the color is so bad?"" Its shockingly bad even to a 9 year old."
"I'm a photographer and a camera lover, and instant print is my favorite kind of photography so I had to check this out, I mean the reviews made it seem amazing. I got it for myself for Christmas and I keep going back to my instax minis, which cost about the same, take better photos, have a much much much better battery life, and are actually INSTANT. Sure it's fun to have pictures that are stickers (it's not easy to get the photo off the adhesive paper, FYI), and the printomatic can take some really artsy photos once you have spent tons of money on film and thrown away tons of trash photos learning how get the thing to utilize lighting properly etc, but then once I got that figured out it started taking all my photos off-center! I no longer know where to aim the camera so now I have to relearn that. The button is too easy to accidentally press and I have hit it so many times and taken idk how many pics of the inside of the camera bag, if is ridiculous. I could never in good conscience recommend this camera to anyone"
"If your pictures are coming out all orange and blurry, get a micro SD card and update the drivers from the Kodak site.Are the pictures perfect after? No.Are they an improvement? Yes.Would I buy this camera again? No.Does it work well enough for a little kid? Yes.It takes more energy to return it and find a new one. It works well enough for kids. I know photos can be sharper because I print photos on a mini printer with the same paper. My phone photos still come out better."
"These are cute, but the photos are really small and not all that sharp. I like the fact the photos have sticky backs, so the can be used as stickers, but with so many kids with access to cell phone cameras, the quality of the photo becomes a factor. Also, you are always having to buy more film. Not sure my grandchildren are using these gifts much. I wish the photos were of better quality and a bit larger. This camera only takes a better picture of up close things like faces, flowers, etc."
I got this camera because I'm going to be traveling and I have a notebook and I'm so fun to be able to print the pictures and have the sticky back but all of my pictures are extremely overexposed I'm really bummed you can't control whether the flash is on or off it just decides when it's going to go on and off.
"It is such a cute camera and it is a great size. Got it as a gift, the picture quality is not good at all. I wished it would print better pictures."
"I do love this thing but I have some issues with it for what I needed it for. I bought this for my photo guestbook at my reception and it is a little too complicated for first time users. It beeps twice when you press the button and you can’t move or your picture will be blurry. It would be better if it was only one beep and it wouldn’t confuse people. Then having to have someone load the film ever so often, which is fine, but again, not fast enough for the guest book purpose. Then since so many people were using it the camera pretty much stopped working all together, it was about five pictures behind from printing the one we needed at the time and a lot of them did not print. All in all it’s still a cool camera and I will keep it for trips and such, but not good enough to use for a fast paced guest book."
"So please take my review with a grain of salt. Unpacked it, very easy to figure out. No instructions needed. First three 'tests' photos came out very very slowly but in focus, quality of photo is not as we see advertised but good enough and will serve my purpose. What I did not read before I purchased nor saw when I went looking for it today after reading in the booklet that we need, "" Connect a compatible micro USB cable and charger, 1amp or greater to the camera"". This should be offered, or it should come with the camera period. This is my only issue with this purchase THUS far. I got the yellow, thought it was orange because I didn't pay attention. Had I known it was yellow I would've gone with pink or blue. Oh well. Small dislike. No biggy.UPDATE: The first time I used this camera (upon arrival) was to try it out and used three sheets. Supposed to come with 10 sheets. Today (03/08/22) used this camera for the second time and only got 2 prints (total of 5)! Cheated out 5 sheets. Also the camera kept turning off in-between the two prints because I guess it needs to be charged and no USB was included. Feeling a bit cheated and big time irritated as it's too late to return it."
"Bought for my girlfriend expecting since she loves taking pictures. She loves it, but I was expecting a little more for the price. Realistically this camera should only be $45. The pictures are super grainy and faded. It's advertised as rustic or old fashioned, but its just dimmed, grainy, and low quality. Also if you don't hold super still for the picture, you end up looking like the flash mid-run. Again, she likes it, I just was expecting a lot more for the price."
"I know that KODAKs have a history of overexposure for their polaroid but I didn't except for the images to be as washed out as they were. It was even worse then the original polaroid. I do not recommend you buy this if you want clear pictures at all. However, if you are doing a murder mystery play/dinner you could totally use this camera to take old timey poor evidence pictures for guests to take home."
"I just used to once, because I tried to use again and it got paper jammed and I am having a hard time finding support by Kodak!"
"It’s fun, and cute but the pictures take forever to print and you must not move to get a good picture I wouldn’t recommend it for mothers who want their children to sit and look beautiful and can’t!"
"Pictures aren't great-- which is fine since we got it for our 7 year old son-- but it did not come with the case or strap which matters a LOT more for a kid.Would be a great gift for a kid with all listed items-- he loves the photo album, stickers, and markers!"
"I got this as a nice little Valentine's Day present for my partner and me to take photos of us out on unique date night activities. The first few test photos were okay, but we quickly got annoyed and have since put it away entirely.Generally speaking, the camera is awkward to use/hold. I read other reviews saying that this camera doesn't have the ability to turn off the flash, which I thought was totally fine. We'll make it work and have that ""natural"" element to it. The flash quickly washed me out of every photo we took together; I know I'm white, but damn...After about a week of usage, the viewport no longer aligned with what the camera was taking a photo of. You'd center an object, and after waiting a few minutes for the image to print, you'd get the corner of the ""centered"" image. So we just took a few abstract 'artsy' style photos. We will not be recommending this or refilling the film anytime in the future.We'll be sticking to the traditional [film] cameras from now on."
"Better off using cellphone camera, the quality comes out blur and old school I do not like this thing"
I thought I’d like the whole idea of the Polaroid however the quality of the prints are terrible. I’m not sure if it’s the point that they want it to look like the old Polaroid pic but it’s def not the quality I hoped.
"Have yet to take one picture that turns out clear, 20 pictures later."
"I ordered this as a Christmas gift for both my son and my nephew. I was disappointed with the poor picture quality. The camera has to be held perfectly still to get a good shot otherwise it's blurry. I thought it was because they are 10 and fidgety so I tried but I couldn't get a nice clear shot either. For the price, I would have expected better."
"Like the person describing ""chaos"", I had the same experience.  I purchased it for my kids 10th birthday party at the skating rink.  I thought what fun it would be to snap photos with her friends all night. However, the night was filled with not understanding which button to press, heads being cut off, not knowing when or if the photo would print from both adults and kids. I had to let go of the dream because I didnt want to continue to spend our two hour booking dealing with the camera. Also the paper is super hard to find. I had issues even getting the paper before her birthday. The first shipment got lost. I reordered it.Yes, I was driven about this plan I had. Anyways, it was a huge disappointing flop over here not to mention alot of wasted time and effort."
"The camera was just as I expected looks great. However, the quality of the pictures are not that great at first I thought it was just a bad film but when IThey camera was just as I expected looks great. However, the quality of the pictures are not that great at first I thought it was just a bad film but when I purchase another one, it’s just the camera."
"The camera itself is very cute. The photos come out like grainy 90’s Polaroids, which can be a vibe if that’s what you’re looking for. Big thing: the viewfinder only centers correctly when used vertically. If you take a snap holding the camera the “classic” way, the view is low and way off center. Still cute for some aesthetic fun at a party or something like that, but you absolutely will not get quality pictures."
My kids love this camera but the film compartment broke after two uses. Contacted seller twice and no resolution yet. Hopefully for good customer service.
"The expectations was so high, maybe.The paper is too small and the camera get stucked very easily.5 pictures, 3 paper jams.Note that I am using the original Zink paper."
"I bought this for my daughter because it is one of the few that will take color photos, but it’s almost impossible to line up your shot. The eye hole does NOT line up with lens! You have to guess where the lens is actually pointed, because it’s not where you’re looking through the viewfinder. We’re trying to aim a little down and a little to the right to compensate for this, but to me it’s is a huge problem. Especially for a camera!"
"Camera came in perfect shape, with all included items. My only complaint is that it photographs off-center and cuts off the top half of your pictures. Very cute item, and functional if you position the thing you want to photograph in the lower right hand corner of the box. Slightly annoyed, and sometimes a hassle, especially since the film is costly and I've wasted much film forgetting to position the thing in the lower right hand corner. Very cute though, with pretty decent photo quality!"
"The only reason im not kicking myself for buying this is bc 1. It was on sale 2. Its just a back up for my polaroid snap, during a small event.Cons:* as mentioned in other reviews you gave to buy a charging cable separately* the battery cover is annoyingly hard to get back in* takes a lot longer than the Snap to print a picture* the snap has slightly better picture qualityPros:* its a lot cheaper than some of the other cameras like the Polaroid Snap* it does its job take picture and prints within a few minutes* compatible with the zink photo paper so I didnt have to get 2 different types of paper or film. (For just needing a simple back up camera this sealed the deal for me, when trying to decide)"
I haven't decided if I'm gonna try and return it but I'm definitely getting a lot of blurry photos. I've tried taking a bunch of random photos and most just come out blurry
Not the best quality pictures but It’s still pretty cool to have a Polaroid and to have pictures print instantly.
Tried so many solutions to get better photos and nothing worked. The color is off.
It consistently moves out of register during the printing process. We have tried centering properly and it will take a picture of other things. It’s just because it’s super low quality product (physical camera) and pictures (worse than 80s Polaroids). It’s fun to have it print right there but I would stick with a real Polaroid or the Fuji one. It’s worth a little extra for those cameras because the film costs the same no matter the quality.
Bought this as a cheaper alternative to the Polaroid cameras on the market and wishing I would have just bought the more expensive cameras because every photo with this is super overexposed.Does it work? Yes. Is it novel? Yes. Is it fun? Yes. Is it quality? No.
It's very good for like a one time use but you can't video and you can't view the picture unless you print it
Daughter wanted a camera that printed pictures. Taking the pictures has had a bit of a learning curve. She was surprised to find that the pictures were really stickers. The clarity of the pictures is rough and the lighting. Sometimes they are very washed out. Most of the time the pictures are blurry. Fun gift but not a great quality of pictures.Will likely be forgotten shortly but it was a fun couple weeks being used.
"This is a neat little camera and I like the quality of the picture for what they are. It's super light and easy to use. You do have to be careful framing the shot but they indicate that in the instructions so fair enough. BUT...The picture button is seriously flawed and seems designed to waste film. I pressed it for a test picture. It played a little tune which I assume meant it took a picture. But there was no other indication and it didn't print for quite some time so I took another picture. It played a tune. And I waited. It eventually printed both pictures. I put the camera down. Picked it up, and fat fingered another picture.Long story short, the button presses too easily and has no rim protection to prevent accidental shots. And although it's probably a pro that it can take multiple shots before waiting for printing to finish, it's a learning curve. I'd give it at least another star if they protected the shoot button (and power button) and added a couple second delay to prevent double shots.Lastly, even for a simple camera with simple instructions, they are lacking. Does the camera auto power off? They don't say. What do the indicator lights on the back mean? Does red mean its charging or charged? Blinking versus non blinking. Simple things, overlooked, that I have to figure out through trial and error."
Poor photo quality ended up purchasing a different camera
"Purchased w of these cameras for my 6 and 8 year old neices for Christmas. They both took pictures and when the photos came out they looked vintage. We then tried them thinking it's the lighting or the way they took it, and it still came out the same. Other than that, they are having a blast creating little memories for their photo album I bought each if them."
"Cute camera. It's a nice size (not klunky to carry around). I bought it for my daughter (I don't recommend this camera for kids). The picture paper gets jammed continuously. We were only able to successfully print one photo. We wanted to like it, but unfortunately winded up returning the camera. Seems like it would have been a headache to deal with in the long run. I agree with the other comments on how easy it is to take accidental pictures."
"We bought this for vacation photos only to scrapbook. We used it on one trip in April and by the end of the trip we noticed some issues. We did not use it again until recently on a trip in November. It was faulty the entire trip. I wish we could get a replacement to see if it is just a defective camera, but will check reviews to see if others have experienced this.I thought I posted this review awhile ago but apparently failed to hit send.We took this on yet another trip and this time could not get it to work at all (prior times we messed around with it enough to get some photos). The photo paper just jams now. In the past the issues have been that it doesn’t pull in the photo or that it turns off while processing even when fully charged. I have wasted a ton of money on photo paper that gets ruined too. I honestly think we just got a defective camera and that sucks because we love the concept and my kid was bummed every time."
"I bought my first camera (different series than this one) a few years ago and it still works great. I bought for my son’s graduation and used it for people to take pictures and used to make a guest book.  We had another graduation this May and decided to buy another camera to do the same to make a guest book for the next kid.When I received the package with the new camera it looked like the box the camera came in was opened and the film was loaded and where you put the paper in the back didn’t seem to close all the way. I took a few pictures and they looked like they were overexposed. I sent it back (by the way customer service was fantastic) and they sent me a new camera the next day. I opened up the new camera and the paper wasn’t loaded and it also had a cord to charge it. The first camera they sent didn’t come with a cord to charge and the paper was already placed in the camera. So it makes me wonder if I received someone’s returned camera.  I wish could have found the same type of camera I bought a few years ago, it worked perfect and kids loved taking the pictures."
"The photos I took have the analog look of an instant camera that I love, but this camera is super glitchy. My first one quit taking photos entirely after two days, and when I used the manufacturer’s instructions to clean inner roll, the paper jammed inside. I was fortunately able to get it exchanged, and the new one has been fine thus far. (Although I didn’t have the camera for the rest of my vacation, which was the whole reason I bought it.) One of the features I do like is that you can reload an already exposed photo and get a double exposure. (The last photo I shared is a double exposure of the beach and upside down mountains.)"
Received the camera this morning. I bought it to photograph my dahlias quickly to put on their tuber storage boxes for quick view finding.I practiced all day and evening in different lighting. The color is terrible with the printed photos.  I first thought it might be the film in the starter pack but I had ordered 2 new boxes of 50 sheets.I tried film from both boxes . Still the same bad color.I was so hoping this was going to be an easy way to know what I have stored but because the color was so bad it defeated the purpose!
"Iv had this camera for about a 4 or 5 days. I opened it, charged it for a few hours and put the firm in it. The first night I went to a football game and put the camera in my bag. When I took the camera out to take pictures with it unfortunately it said the battery was dead. The second night that I had the camera, I went to a friend’s house. When I took the camera out to take pictures with it the film was getting stuck halfway in the camera, so I took all the film out of the camera and put a whole new pack in, unfortunately it’s still was doing the same thing the film is getting stuck halfway. Also, the camera does not stay charged for not that long at all. When I say, I have tried everything to get this camera to work, I HAVE TIRED EVERYTHING!"
"This was a gift for Xmas for my 9 year old. She freaking loves it.I do not.Prints are 0.50 cents each. Said 9 year old blew threw 100 in 4 days.Prints are blurry and terrible. Color is whack. Sometimes prints streaky. It’s basically like a 1970 Polaroid, but in 2021.No micro USB cord. Luckily we have a billion but this surprised us.No instructions. Yes, it’s point and shoot, but what do the beeps mean? Is the first beep when it takes? Is the second beep when it takes the photo? Is the first when it focuses and the second when it captures? These details would be helpful in trying to get an image that isn’t blurry.All that said.If you have a 9 year old girl, they will love it. Highlight of Christmas for her. Just lower your expectations way way down as a parent. It’s not your camera. But it lives up to the hype and is super fun if you’re 9!"
"I would not recommend this camera - you cannot turn the flash off and no matter what, peoole are backlit. The actual photo is a good 2.5 secs behind you pressing the button (I'm sure this is related to the flash which I already complained about). Candid photos are impossible - they notice the light of a thousand suns flash, turn or move in some other way, and then the photo is taken. Finally, the frame on the eyepiece doesn't seem true to what prints. All in all it's really hard to get a good photo with it. The photo paper quality is fine."
If over exposed and super fuzzy photo is what your looking for this will do the job.
"This is a great starter camera.  Quick to print, easy to use, doesn't smudge easy- if at all.  As far as picture quality- if you're wanting something as good as or better than your iphone, this is NOT it."
"Doesn’t focus pictures, you can’t zoom in and out, very limited use. Save your money and get a better camera when you can afford it."
"This camera produces fair-quality pictures if you take the picture outdoors, if you are extremely still, and if the subject is extremely still. I bought one as did my mom. We both experienced the same issues:1. Paper occasionally gets stuck...won't pull out of the camera.2. Directions for loading paper can be seen--with a magnifying glass--and even then they are comprehensibly unclear.3. The button for taking photos is located in the standard place, but due to the fact that the photo is taken with a quick push of the button rather than holding it down for a couple of seconds, hitting the button occurs often, which means that you've just taken a photo of the ground, or your shirt...wherever it happens to be pointing when you accidentally pushed the button. This can be expensive.4. There is no ""film empty"" indicator, so just when you think you clicked a great shot...oops! No film!Good Points:1. The camera is compact and clean-looking.2. The sticky back feature is great."
They run out fastAlso images kinda low quality
"My dad is a simple man. He still uses the disposable cameras that you get developed. in a world full of technology he just cant keep up. My mom takes photos on her phone and he wanted to be able to do the same - without a smart phone. this is great because of it's simple design and instant satisfaction factor, however the photos aren't the best and its a small learning curve for him. I love the nostalgic and old-school look of the instant photos but you have to make sure you don't move or its blurry, which is sort of - to be expected in my opinion. But i also love the option to install an SD card in case they don't print right! I'm hoping after a few more uses we get the hang of it!"
"Something that the marketing does not inform you of is even though a picture can be printed and saved to a micro SD, you are completely unable to print an already saved image. The main purpose I bought this camera for was to take pictures with another person, and then being able to share two physical copies of the photo.The print speed isn't the fastest, and the image quality isn't particularly good, but considering I bought this for the novelty of handing out photos, I wasn't really bothered by those factors. You're definitely better off getting an instant printer compatible with your phone, and using that instead. The picture quality will be better, you can actually print multiples of the same photo, and you can just print a saved image.This is a toy camera marketed as a real camera, do not purchase for anything you actually want pictures of, and instead gift it to a child who will waste the five shots that come in the box on pictures of grass, and then spend too much money on Zink refills for the child."
"i was so excited for this camera. it worked fine for the first 15 photos, then randomly stopped working and constantly makes a noise as if it’s running. before it quit working, it would also randomly take photos after i turned it off. i’m disappointed that i spent money on this"
"We received the 5mp camera instead of the 10mp camera - according to reviews this has happened to other people as well. Thought it could be user error but obviously it's not. Other customers have had the same issues (pink-shaded images, blurry pictures, extremely poor quality). It seems this version simply doesn't print good quality pictures and did not come with a charging cord, although the cord is a simple micro USB cable. We were disappointed.  Looking at 10mp reviews it seems that camera produces better quality prints. 10mp also comes with 3 distinguishing lights in the bottom left corner of the back panel and the option to print in black & white. Got in contact with Amazon product support (after going through another product) and was able to get a full refund.Explanation given - the option which includes the camera ONLY is 5mp while the bundle lists a 10mp camera - I've seen other reviews which refer to the 10mp with excellent photo quality, option to switch to B&W photos, etc. If that is what you are looking for - pay attention & select the bundle."
"I don’t know what I was expecting but for $50, it wasn’t much. So I was pleasantly surprised when I first used it. I will say, it’s not as good as a Polaroid camera or those Instax Minis bc I have both. But they both also cost more, so like with all things: You get what you pay for.  And there’s a learning curve using the camera indoors bc the lighting is hard to get right. It’s also not as “instant/fast” as the Polaroids. But, they’re nice for what they are: a cheap printable camera you can take places and not get all upset if it’s lost or stolen. Oh and the flash is absolutely worthless. Maybe if used in pitch black it comes out okay, but normal use made my face look like I was a Geisha, lol."
it will stop printing out the paper when it gets low. i missed the return window. man...
"Pictures are not clear, over exposed, blurry and color saturation off a lot. If this was $22 it would be worth it because it's more like a child quality picture. I am only keeping it because it does the job for kids birthday party souvenir picture but if for anything else STAY AWAY from it get another brand."
Not sure how I feel about this. The pic isn’t that great. Clarity is cloudy
"Size is good; quality is okay, it froze the 3 picture e tried to take, had to let it die. The photo frame is off and I wish you could choose If your wanted to print or not; trying to take pictures of kids is hard"
Very cheap for the price. Wouldn't buy again
"This is one of the worst cameras I’ve ever bought and I bought my kiddo a no-name brand $20 one previously that was much much better. It over-exposes and the framing is off. Has zero useful functions. You’re better off buying a Polaroid camera, which is what I should have done.  Kodak has zero option to return these via Amazon."
"The camera description stated it came with a power cord and the box it came in (original mfg box) listed the same but there was no power cord in the box. I had seen some previous reviews that complained about this but decided to buy the camera anyway. To be clear the power cord is a standard USB type used by other digital cameras, e-readers, and a host of digital devices. Easy to purchase at any Wal-Mart. Having said that though, without the cord you can't use the camera right out of the box and the price you are paying assumes the cord is include and you don't have to run out and but another cord just to make the camera work. I think these units might be a run of rejects from Kodak who knew the cords did not make the box. This seller may or may not have know that but from previous reviews and stated returns I have to believe it may have been know. So I won't be purchasing from this buyer on Amazon again."
"The camera itself is very pretty, and the fact that it doesn’t use ink is wonderful! Just because of that I can forgive the not-so-great picture quality, also ‘cause the paper has a sticky back so I can paste the pics on my scrapbook. What I don’t like about the camera is that it’s not very user friendly. It takes a couple tries to figure out how to use it because the noise that it makes when the picture is taken is not very different from the noise it makes when you push the button, so you may think that the picture was taken when it actually wasn’t or you may stay there awkwardly ‘cause you think that the picture hasn’t been taken when it actually has."
"I’m not the biggest fan of this tbh. It was difficult for people to take “selfies” with it, the pictures did not turn out the greatest. It was just a disappointment if anything. Not worth it."
"I was really excited about getting this camera for my boys (ages 7 and 9) to document their summer. While the concept is great, we have run into all sorts of problems. I understand that when you put new paper in the camera, it has to calibrate the printer. It’s supposed to do that one time, with the blue sheet from the film package, however often, it ends of sending out the calibration page, as well as 2-3 more sheets of blank photo paper.  This is super frustrating for my kids, because often we don’t know if the photo they just took will actually print, and it takes a good minute or two for it to spit out the random blank sheets. At that point either the moment they wanted to take a photo of has passed, or they have just moved on to something else. The print quality of the photos isn’t great, but they don’t seem to mind that since they are only putting them in their summer journals. If the camera would print consistently, this would be a lot more fun for us to use."
"I have used many cameras on the market and thought this would be a fun gift for my daughter. This camera works worse than her toy camera, and non of the prints came out good. We tried outside, inside, and even in studio light and every single picture is orange and overblown like crazy. I don’t understand how something this bad is even on the market. It feels like cheap plastic and papers get jammed, we have tried two different packs of Zink paper. Do not buy!"
"I had high hopes for this because I own the kodak smile and it uses the same zink paper, it’s cheaper than fujifilm or polaroid, and the backs become stickers, this model however is just bad, it feels cheap and It’s not very sturdy, the photos came out blurry all the time and it takes forever to charge. It’s just not a great product and i wouldn’t recommend this to anyone"
"I do like this little camera and the sticker prints. So fun for post cards or journals... the quality isn't great and you have to stand really close to the object otherwise it will be tiny in the photo, but it does a reasonably good job and you can make a scrapbook the old fashion way."
"I bought this for a trip and although I got a lot of cute fotos, it came with a long trial and error process. It’s difficult to get the lighting right so that the picture comes out good. On top of that it would often stop functioning for no reason and it’s hard to tell what’s wrong with it, a lot of the times it was just a matter of waiting."
Wasting a lot of film because camera will not hold charge and then camera spits out film without developing photo.
I bought this to use for my kids’ nature journals. We’re avid nature journalers and it’s been nice to snap pictures of where we are and affix the photos to the pages. It’s fiiiiiine for that. The picture quality depends on the natural lighting and the one I have seems to jam up a bit.  I also can’t get the back on to be completely flush.All in all— it’s fiiiiiiine for what we use it for. I’d recommend checking out another brand though… I feel the price point is a bit high considering the overall feel and quality.
I have the Orriginal instax camera and a mini zinc printer from HP and had high hopes for this - as I really enjoy the HP mini printer. The camer is very thin plastic and didn’t even come with a charging chord.Santa was supposed to have delivered this camera to my u believing daughter - and unfortunately it didn’t help his case.She couldn’t even use it on Christmas Day!The photos also come out blurry even in bright daylight and there is no way to adjust shutter speed.
"I bought this camera for my Nephew for his birthday. He was super excited about it and could barely wait to use it. After we charged it, I removed the back panel to insert the film and the panel would not close completely again. I tried everything, but eventually settled on getting it as tight as possible because I didn't want to break the camera. After that, probably about 8/10 pictures printed with about 1/2 to 1/4 of it white. It eventually started printing pictures correctly, thankfully I bought him additional film, but that didn't last long. After having it about a week, the pictures started printing odd colors or with white spots in them, so he has pretty much stopped using it after only having it 2 weeks. The camera and the film are too expensive to be of such low quality. I wouldn't recommend it"
"The camera is made kind of cheaply. I bought this for my 9yr old son and hes already done something to it that it won't close back all the way when replacing the film. Plus the pictures are not that great of quality. Like there's a flash when it's not needed and it makes the pictures look awful. Compared to a Instamax camera (I think that's what its called) which I have one for my daughter.. the Instamax is better quality all around. Durability and better picture quality. Sorry, I hate to leave bad reviews:( bc everything is just made so cheap anymore and its most likely not the sellers fault for the quality.. so I apologize. I still need to tell the truth for the next buyer though."
I wish this came with more film slips ! Quality of the picture isn’t quite like what was advertised.
"Pros:  this product definitely captures the spirit of the moment as you can take a snapshot and print it immediately. Also the zink paper technology is awesome and is plastic coated, smudge proof, and has a sticky back. There’s no toner needed as the technology is built into the paper, and the printer heats the paper to produce the image.Camera includes a micro SD card slot to store photosCons: sadly the optics for the camera are not great and the picture quality is Meh 😑I wish that Kodak would put out a better quality product that had a sensor and optics worthy of the Kodak name- I am giving the camera to a teenager as a graduation gift for the “fun” aspect of using it.I think that the printer portion of the product is great but the weakness of the camera lens makes this more of a toy than a serious photography tool.Personally I find that using my mobile phone with just a stand alone zink printer yields a much better quality print"
it was easy to use and I love that it has the sticker backing. The quality of the photos is obviously not super great but I know that. My issues with the product are that I was under the impression that the camera came with 25 photo sheets. I was only able to get 5 pics and now I already need to buy more paper. That on top of the fact that it doesn’t come with a charger is really annoying. Be sure to get extra paper
"View finder seems off. Pulling to my right, but maybe my glasses.  Took two very washed out photos of my husband in my dining room as the setting sun was filtered into the room thru the trees in our side yard.  Disappointed in the blurry quality of the photos! Flash came on. Outside photos of my cat a little better. Still blurry compared to digital iPhone 13 shots. May improve some the more used. First phots my have been off because of glasses. Outside shots were taken without glasses. Better centering. Will probably send back this camera.Since I have much better photo taking tools. Had hoped to give it to my great niece and had bought two. One to try. One for gift. Looks like both will be returned. Too bad. Would be great first camera for child though or a young preteen."
"It’s hard to lead the paper honestly.  Meaning I loaded it, took a picture and then it prints with a white edge.  So I turn it off back on and it’s fine.  So that wasted a pic.  Then you have to hold the camera REALLY still for it to be halfway decent.  And then hold the button until you hear it take the pic.  I think that they should just bring back the old school one.  Shake the photo and call it a day."
"This camera did not work at all, and the image quality is truly awful. Even though we carefully centered the images in the little frame that pops up, the photos were completely off center. People's heads were cut off in the photos; we ended up with pictures of people's arms and crotches instead. Those images were all extremely blurry and grainy.Also, the camera took a whole day to charge; every time the green ""charge"" light came on, we pressed the power button, but the camera would not turn on and the red ""not charged"" light would come back on. The back compartment also would not close. Unfortunately, I waited until the return window closed to test this waste of money."
"The print and picture quality for the KODAK Printomatic made me miss the polaroid cameras of old, which were much easier to line up for spontaneous photos and seemed far more superior in quality. The zink paper also jams frequently, and only holds a limited amount, so by the time you are done reloading the paper and setting up the shot, there's a good chance you won't even get the picture you tried to set up so perfectly in the moment."
"Purchased for my daughter as a birthday gift and it's just not worth the money. Yes it works. But the pictures are always blurry, even if I do it, u have to make sure you are SUPER still. And they always come out looking over exposed.She still likes to play with it. But for the price to keep buying film for crappy photos it's not worth it. Just hope to save the next person....."
"We have fun with this camera. We use it with the Adventure Challenge books where you take a photo. First of all, it's a fun little camera and does what it is supposed to do: produce instant pictures. Secondly, don't expect hi-res pics. They are small and the quality of the image is average.But, if you want a fun little camera and are not too worried about producing world-class photos -- but rather fun, instant photos of date nights... it's a great camera."
This was a gift for my daughters 8th birthday. She has had very little experience taking pictures with a camera but she was able to easily take pictures the problem is that the coloring is way off and the subject of the photo was always cut off. I chalked it up to user error thinking she is still learning to use a camera. After repeatedly having the same outcome with every picture I decided to try it myself and took a picture of her and made sure I had her centered in the image box on the camera. The picture came out and she was partly cut off. Again I thought maybe I just moved a little so I decided to take a picture of a Lego set and had the camera sitting on the table so it couldn’t move at all. The picture came out and again the it was cut off and the coloring is way off. What a piece of junk. I added pictures to show how it’s cutting it off and the coloring. The first picture is a picture of what I took the picture of. The second picture I had taken my iPhone and taken a picture through the lens of the Kodak camera to show that the area with the frame around it is exactly around the Lego set and yet it’s still cut off. Don’t buy this camera unless you want a worthless camera that cuts off your subjects and turns the colors way off.Our older daughter has an Instax and we should have just gone with the same one for our younger daughter. So disappointed.
"The slide of the back of the camera does not click into place , the tab appears to not have a gap allowing it to grab maybe a production issue."
"some of the picture come out bad, some come out really good. I feel like when the flash is used the picture doesn’t come out well but if you want that old camera photo look then buy it. I just got it to scrap book ☺️"
"We were looking to get an instant camera for our son to use during a recent vacation and were torn between this one at the Instax.Settled on this for the cost savings, but it's not worth it - it's confusing to use, slow to take the picture, inconvenient to carry around, and the flash WILL NOT TURN OFF even in the daytime, so all the pictures are overdeveloped and bleached. Our son actually asked to leave it in the hotel room after the first day.DO NOT BUY."
The quality could be way better!
Cute concept but pictures come out very blurry.
"It's about the simplest polaroid-like camera out there. The lens is off center on mine, so what I point it as, isn't what I get a picture of exactly. The quality of the photos is low, they aren't bad, but they're far from good.It's more gimmicky nostalgia than useful."
"UPDATE:So here is my update. Of course after the return date it completely quit working. Won't do anything but be a waste of my money.I just needed a camera so I wouldn't use up all the space on my phone. It definitely isn't a DSLR camera, yet for the price it does a good job. Just realize that this is a BASIC camera not anything extravagant.  Either way it is nice for the price!"
"I personally don't think it's worth it. I had originally bought this for content creation. It had the flip screen and the feature to connect the mic which was the main stuff I was looking for. The audio sucks, doesn't even have audio settings to begin with as well. And I thought ok well maybe it'll get better when I get a mic to connect it to... wrong... the mic would make the camera have a buzzing noise. I thought maybe it was the mic so I got a replacement for that and even a replacement camera as well. Still did the same thing again, so it's just not a good vlog camera. Probably good for taking pictures but that's it."
"The product was not what I expected. First of all, I couldn't feel its weight in my hand. It looked like a child's toy. Then I took a photo with it and the photo looked a bit blurry. These two points made me think I should return it to the seller."
Don’t expect good quality out of the photos.
the camera not capture high-quality images
This camera would be good for someone that is just starting out taking photographs and wants to learn or maybe someone that doesn't know anything about cameras and just wants to take pictures of family members just for the memories. Do not buy this camera if you are looking for anything to come out clear this is nothing I will recommend or refer to anyone the quality is just not there at all. It was nice however that they sent an extra battery.
"It records videos - most of them are corrupted. mov file. Nothing can open them. On top of that, many times I wanted to record something, only to find that my camera was frozen and couldn't shoot video."
"It feels like there are no 4K pixels, only 1080 pixels bad ones. Product this camera I don't recommend."
"The focus effect of this camera is not very good, and it is not good to take photos normally, and the photos are not clear and good-looking enough, not worth recommending"
This quickly broke and is not worth purchasing. I'm returning it.
The box was all smashed and opened. There was no plastic on the battery’s or camera its was definitely used befor I got it
Don’t waste you money on this camera battery doesn’t hold after fully charge and took a few photos and battery dies
Very cheap quality camera very lite plastic battery life is very weak zooming pixel quality is horrible don’t waste your money
We got this camera last week and brought it with us to Disneyland yesterday. But it really disappointed us. The picture comes out blurry when we try to capture the happy moments on rides. A waste of money. Will return :(
"The photos are grainy, blurry, and nothing like what was advertised. Even my phone takes better pictures. This is not worth the price at all."
i never seen the ugly camera like that，like a plastic toy，it is not small，it's not what i want，it is not 啊valueproduct
"Received with package look like some already use it. Battery can’t charge. It takes 30 minutes figuring out the result. Finally to fix, try the quantity terrible. Bed experience."
"The pixel is not good, the function can be too simple. The whole camera has no texture."
Bad quality camera.don’t waste your time or money. Battery dies in 15 minutes.the low quality picture.it doesn’t focus well.so disappointed.
This camera is extremely slow. Not worth the price. This camera is very poor quality. I prefer better quality as the price is not cheap at all. Returned immediately.
The captured image is unclear.
"It instructs you to pull the label off. Sadly, there was slight resistance when I pulled it off, so I stopped and noticed that it was sticking like glue in certain places."
"I know this wasn't an expensive camera, but I didn't expect what I got. It fit in the palm of my hand! I bought it for my grandson as a Christmas present. now I have to return it and try to get him something else! I was very disappointed."
Functions like any other camera. Plastic and feels like a toy.
"it has a display on in that for a toddler, and it was difficult to use it. So I bought a Kodak which was more expensive, but it works great."
"After trying to read very small manual, trying to set up for hours, and no luck downloading into laptop, I sent back.  This camera is not user friendly at all.  Manual is ridiculous.........I have had many years taking pictures with other cameras.  I don't have enough years left to get this one set up."
"The camera is okay, picture quality is not the best, but the nano/micro/mini or whatever miniature sd card size is the problem because I can't find a reader for it."
I was disappointed in this camera the pics were out of focus and I could not figure out why dont advertise point and shoot its not true
"I bought this camera thinking it would be better then my Samsung. Don't give in to the ""4k"" resolution. This camera feels like I'll brake it if I sneezed."
I know you get what you pay for. It’s cheap and photos are terrible.
The sounds quality was not good and it was so difficult to navigate. I would not recommend.
Came open and incomplete.. I return it.
"Very poor quality. I wanted something low cost for my son, but I wish I had spent more on a more quality product. The battery life is terrible. It comes with batteries but for some reason still needs to be plugged in to charge? It's lightweight like a toy, not like a real camera. Save yourself the trouble and buy a better camera!"
"This is infuriating. I opened up this camera this morning and have been using multiple compatible chargers to get this thing going…. no chargers are working so I look up online if this has happened to anyone else with this camera - lo and behold there are plenty of reddit and other posts about this camera and their battery not working upon opening.Some people stated removing the battery for 5 minutes and reinserting it worked for them, but for me this has not worked.Unfortunately will be returning this item - thankfully this falls within the return window.Super disappointed in this - this caught me off guard because I’ve watched plenty of reviews for this camera and none of them mentioned this as being an issue."
"These are some photos i took with it, and they do look great but it wasn't for me. It's more of a vlogging camera and I know it was but it also takes decent photos but I like that I can't only zoom 2x and I cant put a lens on it. It also only shoot raw photos. Has a all plastic built except the lens but it had kind of a cheap feel especially since the one I received had a raddle noise."
"Biggest reason this camera is being returned is that it DOES NOT stream in 4k.  It does NOT even stream in 1080??? WTH???  The max resolution is 720p for streaming.  The colors on the camera are ""bold"" but not natural.  See pic.  The on on the right is the Sony, the one on the left is a $60 camera.  While the Sony has a wider angle lens the colors are not natural.  In addition, the background on the Sony becomes out of focus.  I don't have a pic but when testing this with a cheap cam the cheap cam out performed and was easily able to read a clock and see sharper details in the background.  Extreamly disappointed in the performance for streaming."
Please someone help. When I record a video longer than 17 minutes I am not able to transfer the video to my laptop for editing because it shows the file is too large. How do I adjust that? Thank you. I need to be able to record an hour long video and to actually transfer it to my laptop or pc for editing. Thank you
"So I bought this camera and it was missing some parts like to try putting memory card in the case I was supposed to come with their were not here and I was checking over and like I’m very confused why is it on the camera they came and even the lifespan, extra money for the entire like pack set you know to come with the camera but the camera was supposed to be like $400 alone by spent more over $400 to come with other stuff, so I just wasted extra money from nothing and I never disappointed. The quality of the camera is good and I actually like it as you know the looking at the camera screen it’s really nice but yeah that’s all."
"Going in I knew this was targeted to beginners. But once I got it in my hands, boy was it tiny. The video quality wasn't great. The built-in mic sounded awful and when taking stills, it only shoots in JPEG and not RAW. Why!? My phone (Google Pixel 7a) does a much better job than this thing and more! Not to mention the app for transferring the images/video is terrible and crashes halfway when transferring. And the battery life is atrocious. Completely unusable for my needs. A GoPro has more functions than this plus better quality images/video."
I REALLY wanted to like this camera but the picture quality was no where near as clear as an iPhone camera no matter what settings I put on. I will sadly be returning this as I have no use for it now. The camera not having a flash was another reason I have chosen to return it.
"So a big selling point on this for me was the articulating screen. I film a lot of content but had read that it took great photos as well. It does neither well. Even in perfect lighting my images were washed out, grainy and flat. The auto focus continuously misses, and the LCD screen is absolutely atrocious. I found myself buying many different products just to attempt to make this camera better but at this point I’m returning it for the E10."
camera is defective. barely recording 2 minutes it shuts of and on and you can hear clicking noises. I decided to use the camera months later to find out it does not work properly. Highly disappointed especially with the price I paid.
"I wish I would’ve seen an honest review on here that mentioned what a disappointment this camera is. I bought mine a few months ago and I was so excited. It’s the first camera I buy in 10 years. When I started using it I was so let down by the zoom quality. But nevertheless I decided it was worth keeping because I spent almost $800 bucks on it, it must be good right??? Nope 👎 now i can’t even charge it and I can’t even return it. Trust me , it’s a waste of money! Sure, it’s easy to use, for the couple months that it lasts. But the performance is NOT worth it. What a disappointment"
"I don’t recommend this camera. It’s very cheap, won’t charge and the fuzzy thing for the camera quality is broken. It won’t fit in the slot. I’d recommend shopping around before purchasing this camera especially if you need it for a special event."
"Bought this mainly for Vlogging- video of myself with closeups of gear. Just was not happy with the detail that it provided. I even made sure that the camera was positioned close enough so no zoom was needed and I felt the video was still pretty lackluster, even after trying a few settings. Battery life is poor, but spare batteries are cheap. My old Canon S100's picture quality was better. It did do a good job of focusing on me and the menus and touch screen were ok. Sound quality was good and it picked up the sound well. I returned it within the 30day window as the picture quality- maily detail- was not there."
While we do enjoy this camera and it's ease of use no one seems to mention the battery life is an HOUR at best. So while you might be able to get almost 9 hours of 4K video on that memory card be prepared with extra batteries at hand!HUGE DRAWBACK: When you run out of battery (and you will) if you swap out the battery before removing the memory card the camera will DELETE EVERYTHING YOU HAVE FILMED and the memory card will be unreadable by ANY device. We lost almost an hour of footage just by swapping out the battery. This seems like a HUGE drawback no one has mentioned anywhere else.
"The camera came with a depleted battery, no charger and no SD card. Just didn’t expect this. I guess this is what you get today ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ The shipping was super fast though."
"Not sure if I need to order another battery but for vlogging, thought the battery would last longer.  Think it stayed on for an hour off and on during a cooking tutorial before had to recharge.  First vlogging camera so not sure if that is normal.."
CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP - TERRIBLE DISLIKED VERY MUCH - THE SELLERS ARE JUST AS TERRIBLE. Don't buy this camera it is definitely not worth the money and seller is TERRIBLE and unethical.  The camera feels like a disposable camera.  The sellers-PROCAM have it way overpriced and when trying to return they will slap on restocking fee of 50%.  They will not refund at 100% knowing you are within the return window and they approved the return.  CAUTION STAY AWAY from this one.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Purchased this camera in January as a Valentine’s gift for my wife. She’s just now opened the box to use it and the camera is inoperable. We charged it and inserted a new memory card which the camera said it was unable to read.Then we tried a few more memory cards I use for a Sony AIV that I own and those didn’t work either. We then tried turning the camera off and which didn’t work without removing the battery.We’re a bit disappointed because we can’t return it being as though the window has closed. I would just urge those whom are interested to do a lot more research than I did before purchasing this model camera
"I love how compact and easy it is to tote on the go for quick shots. The picture and video quality for the price is great. The only downside is the battery life, it’s horrible. I charged the battery the night before to use for the following day and after an hour of unplugging a fully charged battery, it was depleted and said battery exhausted and I never used it, so how could the battery be down already? It’s very annoying and makes the camera less dependable when you’re out capturing footage. Other than the battery being trash, it’s a cool beginners camera."
"Although I'm sure from the reviews it's a great camera, I haven't been able to use it since it doesn't come with an SD card for memory OR a charger!!!! $100 later and I get the wrong charger for it which is adding to my aggravation of why they don't include one for the battery that died after maybe 5 minutes of use."
"My phone is clearer than this camera in both video and camera shots, images were grainy even in great lighting. Battery life is terrible. I returned, not worth the price tag."
"I wanted to use this as a webcam and the image was sharper with more detail (too much detail) but it couldn’t accurately pick up light at all. I had lights on and it was so dark. I tried adjusting my settings in OBS but nothing helped. I have a Logitech stream cam that is SO much better than this! I was so disappointed. I also wanted to use the soft skin filter, but saw that’s better for pictures. It can’t track my face while moving to keep it on and it couldn’t track my face from a reasonable sitting distance when I was still, I had to be right up close to the camera, so that was useless. The background blur was also not even enough to notice! This is extremely expensive for what it is. Shouldn’t be over $100."
"The camera is very small , and not good deal at all, I returned mine just the next day after receiving it and the took 15% of my money for restock fee witch doesn’t mention on the description when I was buying it .i return the package very perfect on the same box but still took my money . Do not buy ."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Very disappointed. I’ve been looking forward to this delivery, only to unbox a used item. Nothing was sealed. Camera seemed dusty. Smudges/fingerprints were on the lens. The screen didn’t have a film protector on it and the camera didn’t show me a setup up screen when turned on. All signs point to used. Might try to order again and hopefully get the unused product!"
The cam is not worth the price and not easy to use
"This camera is over hyped. Vlogging wise, it will not disappoint, but as far as still shots, very disappointing. I waited to purchase this and thought it was better than the ZV-1, but it's not. I do media and I needed a great point and shoot unlike my other cameras, but this is not it. Probably going to return."
There's no real instruction manual.
I gave this camera to my sister as a christmas gift and the battery is trash. She left it on the charger for HOURS & it still didn’t work. Camera said it had 4 hours until it goes dead but died before that. So you telling me you have to keep it on the charger for it to work? yeah refund my money i ain’t returning nothing
We just received this and this is exactly how it came out of the box. You can see that it is very used and scratched up. We are immediately sending it back for a refund.
"The camera is cheaper compared to most. However all the additional equipment you’ll need to purchase will equal a better camera, with a worth it higher price. Returning it asap."
"Opened box to find the sony box to look like it had been opened, not sealed.  Opened up that box to find nothing sealed, including the camera screen, no battery in box, unless it was already in camera.  There were no tabs to pull to enable battery.  Fingerprints were all over camera screen, and the camera was very dirty.  cords were not tied up, microphone cover was dirty, and messy.  I did not even try to power it on, just initiated a return."
Sony should have added more than just contrast detection auto focus.  This camera hunts focus way to much.  I see people giving this camera great reviews and when I see their videos I end up with a headache because of the focus issues!  If Sony does a software update that adds more than contrast detection auto focus then I will re-buy this camera.  Its all it really needs to be a great lightweight content creation camera.
"The video quality suits my needs, but when I try to transfer the video to my iphone it takes about 25 minutes for a 5 minute video and over half the time it messes up half way through and I have to start over.  This makes it so that it can take well over an hour just to transfer 5 minutes of video."
sent it back because the stabilization was very poor. My cell phone camera does better
"Tried with 3 different computers, tried it just as a camera and after all this time I'm boxing it with the trash"
"For this price, you would think this camera would have a flash!!! Are you kidding me!"
"Why? Because it's cheaper and offers little wider angle than ZV-1? If Sony had done ZV1 correctly, there would be no need for this ""downgraded"" camera with it's lack of features, inferior auto focus, no viewfinder, no flash, etc. It makes no sense as an alternative to other ""vlogging"" cameras, including sony's own zv-1 or e10. It's a dumbed down, overpriced camera for dumbed down buyers who have no idea what a ""good"" camera should be.  Every once in while, Sony takes these weird missteps into lalaland (remember the A3000 or Q series body only cameras?). If you're a serious vlogger, why would you buy this cheap carp? This is ONLY to rip off uninformed buyers. Notice the price for new is already dropping like dead flies? Wonder why!"
"I can no longer get the lens to pop out, worse customer service ever,,"
The camera was only used once and it is now three months later and it stop working. The camera don’t even turn on!
All I want to do is talking head videos for YouTube but this thing focus hunts when I’m just talking. And the usb c steam mode is 720p and fuzzy. I have a cam link to get full resolution but even then the focus hunting makes it look unprofessional. I’ll wait for something better. The 20mm is perfect lense size
"Very disappointed. There was no Audio Output and the Volume was turned up. I watched so many videos to get the settings right and still, nothing."
Huge disappointment that a brand like Sony doesn't have its app available in my country.
Camera quality is not good and some items that should be with the camera were missing
"The item is useless, very bad quality"
"I charged the camera, and then set it up to use as a webcam. Didn't last more that 2 hours with a usb-c to usb-c connection. Tried the cord it came with, still same garbage.Contacted support, and all they would say is return it. Not attempt to try to identify the problem, or help me fix it. On top of that, they said that it must be just this camera, and if I wish, I can buy another after waiting a month to get my refund.I have bought lots of stuff, and when ever I do talk to customer service, they have always tried to help me identify the problem, and then fix it if they can. If the camera is good, then they should just offer me a new battery, but no, just waste your time sending it back, and good luck finding another one.Maybe it is just the battery on this on, but I will never know. 1/5 for customer service.In other news, the picture is great, and if the battery could hold a charge while being plugged in, 5/5. But, lack of any help from customer service means I will not know. Won't even offer me rush delivery if I buy a new one."
"Was expecting better from sony, but quality of the picture is not good. Better to take photos using iphone 11"
"I really liked this camera—it’s lightweight, stylish, and easy to use. However, the battery life is disappointingly short."
"The camera came on time, but DID NOT include an SD card or charging cable, which was disappointing."
Do not buy. Seller advertised as new but when it arrived it was an open box defective used item. I returned it immediately but was told I will have to wait for 60 days for a refund of my $750 as I had paid extra for the insurance. Criminals!!!!!!!
A Rechargeable battery pack and a wind screen were supposed to be suooplied in the box but were missing.
Great little camera a little bit too stripped down! You will be better off getting the ZV-E10
"The USB streaming only supports 720! Why a 4k USB-c Camera is limited to 720 on streaming !!The product information was wrong, the Black shows white photo and the White shows black photo. I talked to Amazon and they are careless to fix, they told me to choose by name, so I ordered the Black by name, I got the white, very frustrated with this purchase."
Ordered this camera as a Christmas present. Appears to be a nice little camera but I will never know because as I was getting ready to set it up so it would be ready for the recipeant I found that the package was missing the memory card. I was not given the option of receiving one or I probably would have kept this camera. Beware and check your box if you are buying this as a gift.
Did not receive an sd card in pkg
I was excited to use it but I can only turn it on when it’s attached to the cord? Not sure if anybody else is seeing the same problem. I might have to just return it but not sure
"The camera is small and easy to use. Battery life is good, menus are easy to navigate thank goodness as the User guide is almost useless. Focus is slow and picture quality is mediocre. Flash sometimes goes off after the picture is taken. Zoom just distorts the image by enlarging the already grainy pixels. This camera doesn't even come close to the 20+ year old Samsung, Canon, Olympus etc. That we could buy for $50 years ago.I don't see how it got such high reviews. Mediocrity is the new norm in cameras under $1000.00.Just give it to the kids so they can take DMV quality pics."
The threaded handle already is splitting and it takes poor pictures inside the building. It feels cheap and is difficult to charge and download photos. You can’t tell if it’s charging. Not a user-friendly camera.
Cute camera easy to use but it is plastic. Thought it would be metal or something
The screen is garbage and you can't tell if it's clear or not fully.And night time pictures just don't come out but daytime images can be beautiful
"Camera takes very good pictures.  User manual is very incomplete and difficult to read, type is very small.  Most of the things that are in the menus are not documented.  No brand name or manufacturer listed on the camaera .  The online store in Amazon is no help.  User guide says to contect them with any questions but doesnt provide a link or email address to do that."
Pics were blurry and device was not simple to use
"No matter what I did, the photos were out of focus. Maybe it's just user error but long before cell phones I grew up using digital cameras! I was expecting something very simple and easy to use.. just turn on and take pictures. Unfortunately that's not what I got with this camera."
"The camera is okay, picture quality is not the best, but the nano/micro/mini or whatever miniature sd card size is the problem because I can't find a reader for it."
"This was trash on its first trip. It was purchased for my 12-year-old son to use on vacation. After he complained of poor photo quality, I checked and adjusted the settings. It was no surprise that excessive digital zoom resulted in poor pictures, so I educated my son on that point. The resulting images were worse than none, as either another camera was not used to take the same picture or the time spent taking the photo was not used for viewing wildlife. Pictures are grainy to the point of a watercolor look at best. In a small number of photos, the best-focus area was nearly adequate, but the out-of-focus background or foreground was hideous. Attached is his best shot of the wildebeest crossing the Mara River on the camera's last day."
I was disappointed in this camera the pics were out of focus and I could not figure out why dont advertise point and shoot its not true
"My daughter bought this for a family trip. Anything more than 5 feet away is totally blurry, and even some of the close ones are blurry. I’ve had kid cameras half this price that take better photos. Not a single image is passable. Don’t waste your money."
Trash
I bought this for my autistic child to learn to take pictures with. The problem is the settings constantly change themselves and the pictures are blurry and non focusing.
This came without the SD card.
Picture quality is just okay!
it was not a good cam
The quality of the camera is bad. It’s doesn’t connect to your phone or computer smoothly you have to download apps. They are giving me a hard time with returning it. Don’t waste your time.
"The camera it’s self is really pretty and the perfect size, however right out the box - we opened it to try it out and we noticed, the screen would freeze and the camera would auto restart every time we tried to take a picture."
Looks nice...But not a good quality camera  as far as clarity and zooming  in and out compared to a standard smart phone camera.
It was not what I thought it was. Not enough information on how to use the camera. Price to much for this product that is not that good
"I graduated first in my medical school class so I'm an intelligent person.  This go pro has very difficult controls.  Mine had no readable instructions;  only microscopic print that I could not read.  Then they insist that you install an app on your cell phone (probably so they can track you). The reason I bought the thing was because I didn't have a phone!  Why buy this thing if you have a phone?  Then they say go to their website, but the website download doesn't work for my computer.  Then the camera doesn't work.  I just wasted a lot of money on this piece of junk.  I will never buy anything from this company again."
"I upgraded from a 3 to the 12 and find the menu awkward to use.  First you have two on and off buttons, one on the side, allows you to select different functions, the other, on top starts the photo or video command and start shooting, press again and it turns off the camera instead of just stopping the filming.  The user interface is anything but obvious and user friendly.  I gather that with the added features they had to find ways to incorporate them into the menu.  As they say, if the UI requires you to read a manual or search online, it's bad design"
"Overheating hasn't been a problem, yet. But it has gotten hot. Price dropped $100 since I bought mine within two months - may be worth it at the lower price. But due to price drop and not much of an upgrade, I'd go with something other than gopro."
"Bought this to replace my GoPro Hero 4 for motovlogging. I had it for just over a month and had multiple issues. SD card corruption, audio not working, it's annoying and cumbersome to change the batteries, and the icing on the cake was that it will NOT pair with my DJI Mic 2 bluetooth microphone.Just to change the batteries I have to unplug my mic from the media mod, unscrew the camera from the mount, take off the media mod (which is a pain in itself), replace the battery, then put it all back together.I've been a loyal GoPro user for a long time, but I had to end up getting something else for what my intended use is. The camera quality is great and I love the mobile app, it's just not good for my specific application."
"I have purchased multiple cameras of different formats over many years. This is my first GoPro. It's my last also. Nearly every time I try to use it, It shuts off and when I turn it back on I get a message saying that it overheated. The first time it happened it complained about my video card. I purchased the appropriate video card... Didn't help a bit. So then went online and searched for why GoPros get too hot, and I found a video on YouTube telling me that if I bought a metal case it would help drain the heat away from the camera. So I spent $45 on that. That doesn't help too much either. 1 out of six times it will work for a while. It shuts off every single time. If I had checked it out before my expiration I would have returned it. Don't waste your money. There's something inherently wrong with the way these cameras function. If it was $45 I could say oh well I lost some money and it was a mistake. This was an expensive purchase and I deeply regret it."
"Tried this camera hard to navigate and set up . There is a learning curve for this GoPro, its not for me. I bought a GoPro 10 easier to navigate, longer battery life."
"I was trying to use it for my sons' baseball games and it would just overheat after about an hour and a half.  It wasn't even very hot (80s), but it was in direct sunlight which I expect was the problem.  However, for a camera that seems most useful outdoors, this is a major issue in my opinion.  We have rigged solutions to it like putting a fan on it or covering it, but it's ridiculous to have to turn to an aftermarket solution for this."
"Send back as it is a repackaged unit. Disappointed to open the box and see that all the cables weee unbundled and the camera unit itself was dirty with water spots indicating use.Will buy a replacement direct from GoProReplacing a Hero 12 that is used for auto racing and was damaged to to significant impact, overall happy with the Hero 12, just knowing they are delicate don’t want to start with something someone else returned."
"Main set back is cloud being ill manageable. Its very difficult to upload videos and photos in the social media. Once it gets uploaded in the app, it should go to the cloud and then download in phone. Only then can post in my social media. It is not user friendly. But has good video and picture quality."
"An unexpected problem and an unpleasant problem - the camera turns off due to overheating, after 15-20 minutes of work.The main part of the overheating was “removed” by more gentle settings, it only remains to find metal legs that will work as a heat sink, since plastic ones contribute to overheating."
Great video quality but once it overheats it shuts off and that happens at around the 15 min mark.
Battery life is far too short
"Buy it for the picture quality, but pass on it for the insta360 because it's software and connectivity is absolutely horrendous. Works almost never making it an absolute nightmare to set up shots, sync footage to your phone, or really use it in any way other than a beefed up DLSR. GoPro the company's support is almost non-existent for rectifying offering only canned responses, and if you're hoping this will get fixed with software updates: they've been getting complaints about it for over HALF A DECADE.There are better options."
"Disappointing Firmware Update Experience with GoPro HERO12I recently purchased the GoPro HERO12, excited to use it for upcoming adventures, but I’ve been thoroughly disappointed due to a frustrating firmware update issue. Despite following all the recommended steps, the firmware refuses to update, leaving the camera unusable out of the box.I’ve tried multiple methods, including updating via the app and manually through the SD card, but nothing has worked. The lack of clear troubleshooting guidance and the fact that such a critical step doesn’t function as it should is incredibly frustrating.As a result, I haven’t been able to use the camera at all. For a product that’s advertised as top of the line, this experience has been underwhelming and disappointing. I expected much more from GoPro and hope they address these firmware update problems quickly."
"Camera keeps turning itself off and on after I turn it on.  Contacted customer service who said I needed to buy a different SD card. I am using a Scandisk Ultra card which worked fine when I first began using this camera.  GoPRO is now saying that I should be using a Scandisk Extreme and they said that “yes, it will work with Scandisk Ultra, but it will stop working and you need to purchase a Scandisk Extreme card.”  What?  It works, but then it won’t work and I have to spend more money?  And, everytime I use the camera it tries to upsell me on their cloud subscription, which I have to acknowledge and dismiss before I can use the camera.  DON’T WALK, RUN FROM THIS CAMERA!  There are lots better options out there that perform better and have longer battery life."
DONT BUY FROM THIS SELLERI was having troubles being able to record for a couple races. Maybe 20min at a time. Turns out the battery is junk. Make sure you check the battery when you get it. Mine was 18 months old so it came with a diminished capacity. Didnt know that for awhile and wouldn't you know its past the time you can return it. Beware of this seller. Buy direct from the company I'm sure they will take care of you.
don't buy this if your going to try and video anything in low light or dark sky.  Its not made for it despite all the reviews stating otherwise
"I've used GoPros since the Hero 7. This was my upgrade from the Hero 9. I don't notice any difference at all and, even worse, the 12 does not shoot in Narrow. How do they not improve anything but actually drop features?"
Could not get this to update and work for the life of me. Looking to get back into an older gonpro with less tech
I've tried multiple SD cards and all the app says is that it encountered an error. Gonna be returning this for sure.
"On the second use, I got an SD card error indicating I should remove the card.  I did and discovered water in the camera.  This was after swimming in the ocean in less than 5 ft of water.  Extremely disappointed.  Edit 20 mins later: the entire camera won’t even power on now."
"Touch screen broke after a few uses. Reason why I got it was having water proof camera while kayaking. Not sure  how it broke. Put in my kayak while getting into water and when I went to mount, screen was busted. I bought the GoPro for something that would stand up to physical activity. I guess I got the wrong impression of what this camera is used for. Then found out go pro does not repair its equipment."
"Camera didn’t work half of the camera was missing, there was no damage to the box yet when I opened it the whole front of the camera was missing, wasn’t even in the box does go pro not have quality control?"
Unit failed after immersion in ocean water to a depth of a couple feet.
"No competent customer service and no way to reach the company. After writing an extensive report about the problem and error message on the GoPro contact page, a CS person who had a script and no real knowledge asked me to take a picture of the error message and send it to a link she provided. She told me she had no way to access the information I had already provided.I thanked her and returned the camera and accessories to Amazon."
Opened it and my child droped it one time. Menu screen stopped working. Not worth the money or aggravation. Also you have to subscriptions etc..  just set it up. buy another brand.
"Camera was damaged when I received it, requested a refund and now I have to go take it to the post office. Horrible experience, i was really looking forward to using my new camera"
The GoPro was a fake 😓
Do not buy!!! It overheats and because the firmware is not stable it will turn itself off with no warning
Can't use it if it won't update. It won't update so can't use it. Ha.
This camera was good when it arrived after a while it just frozen as you can see and won't turn back on.
listed as brand new but the seal is open.
The price is exactly the same as last year. Didn't work at all. Had to return.
You would think the 12th version of anything would have all the bugs worked out. These are trash. I thought i had battery issues and after the 3rd new battery and multiple memory cards with same results we finally realized it was the camera. This is supposed to be an action camera and slight vibrations rattles the battery loose and it dies. We use for on track (smooth asphalt) use. I have spoken to several people we race with and everyone agrees these are the worst camera option out there. Save your money and buy something else.
"Here’s the review of the GoPro Hero 12 based on the feedback you provided:---Review of the GoPro Hero 12: A Disappointing ProductThe GoPro Hero 12 is by far one of the most disappointing products I’ve ever used. To start, the battery life is abysmal—it barely lasts, and if you’re expecting to use it for a prolonged shoot or activity, forget about it. It overheats every 3-4 minutes, sometimes even sooner, which renders it practically useless in the middle of any action.Now, let’s talk about video quality. While daytime footage is passable—ranging from reasonable to good—the nighttime video performance is horrendous. Any scene with even slightly lower lighting is simply unusable. The image becomes so poor that you’ll struggle to get anything worthwhile out of it.But the worst part? The constant overheating. It’s a recurring problem. Every few seconds, the camera gets too hot and shuts down. This happens in the middle of capturing crucial moments, leaving you stranded without the footage you need.This product simply doesn’t deliver on what it promises. In fact, it fails at its core purpose—capturing action reliably. If you’re thinking about buying the GoPro Hero 12, I’d strongly advise against it. It's a terrible product that doesn’t live up to expectations in any sense. Save your money."
Im just wondering when gopro will address the overheating problem with temps over 85 degress.  i had mine in the shade and still got an overheating notice on the camera. cant they make them with a fan or maybe white or both?
Camera burst into flames when charging almost caught house on fire and caused bodily injuries. GoPro support only offered 15% off on a replacement.
i upgraded from hero 11 and it was a huge mistake. this go pro hero 12 is awful. doesnt connect to my computer. iphone. macbook. tried hours and hours to find a fix only to realize its a faulty gopro..
"I bought the GoPro specifically to use the labs firmware for long time lapse. Long story short, I've never gotten it to run for more than around 12 hours, regardless of the settings. Even eschewing the scheduled photo functions, no matter what power source I've plugged into, no mater what settings I've used, the camera will inevitably bork itself after around half a day of shooting.As an aside, when you do manage to get some footage I strongly suggest a workflow that eschews GoPro Cloud completely. There is no way to download more than 25 full resolution raw photos at a time. When you're  taking hundreds or thousands of photos a day, that's less than ideal.Given that the Labs firmware functions don't work well, and the standard time lap functions... also don't work very reliably, I'd recommend shying away from GoPro. There are competitively priced action cameras with larger sensors, better battery life, and less of a tendency to self-sabotage. Don't be lured in by the promise of GoPro's feature set, it simply doesn't deliver."
and tricks you into thinking their cameras work and don't just randomly freeze and crash after 5 min
"This camera is irritating. I bought an extra battery & a 3 battery charger seperate from the camera. Even this isn't enough. The camera heats up super fast, sometimes causing the camera to freeze. The previous versions had a known RAM problem that was supposed to be fixed. I've probably spent an additional $200 dollars on top of the price of accessories. A $500 dollar camera that doesn't work. Engineering needs to take a much better look at this design. RAM RAM RAM how hard is it to have enough operating space to run this camera. On top of that there is no zoom and I understand why. I think they really dropped the ball on the GoPro 12. I'll never buy another one. If this is a Quality Control problem they must have been short handed on the day this camera was tested if at all."
Never again will I stray from DJI. To many things to list. Just not impressed at all. The only thing in my opinion that this has over the 11 is no overheating issue. That and a better menu. That’s it.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Won't turn on  after only one use😢 😭... I bought this camera on the 22 of April to restart my YouTube channel only used it once just to test the quality which loved,I even used it in a secured case just to not get it wet. Then i got busy with work, now that I'm ready for another adventure just to find that no matter what I do the camera won't turn on... sigh!!!"
The battery is going to cause burns and explode
great camera but overheats like crazy and shuts down in the Middle of a recording.
"I bought the Go pro after reading a number of reviews and after watching videos of it in action. It works considering I have only used it once but I was disappointed at the video quality indoors, (I haven’t used it outdoors yet). My iPhone 11 does a better job taking brighter videos indoors than this go Pro. Another worrisome point is overheating. The camera shut down due to overheating about 25 mins into a video recording. Not ideal at all."
"I love that it’s a wifi camera, because I can download my pictures onto my iPhone and then send it to my printer to print out the pictures.  The things that are challenging are too many features I have no idea why I would need those options and the second is that even with the auto focus some of the pictures print out really fuzzy.Also, some times when I press the button to take the picture it won’t take the picture so I have to press the button a couple of times to get it to take the picture."
"The resolution for videos is really good. The picture quality is not the best especially in low light. A lot of my pictures had a red cast on them. Photos came out blurry with low color vibrancy and resolution. The size of the camera is compact and easy to hold. Bought for myself, did not think it was worth the price so I returned. With good lighting the pictures come out better."
"The camera is a decent size and gets the job done, but the quality of photos taken decreases the further away you get. Camera also had a shutter noise that I couldn't figure out how to turn off, but that could be user error. It doesn't come with a neck strap, so you have to buy one. One thing I really liked was that you could flip the screen to take selfies."
Ready to shoot out of the box. A good way to start your passion adventure!
I did not like the quality of the pictures and focus of the camera. The pictures were blurry and didn’t zoom very well
Very grainy pixel photos
"When I ordered this I wrongly assumed that the focusing could be done manually as I didn’t see any reviews talking about it. Though the setting is called manual focus, you are not in actuality able to manually focus this camera to your liking. It takes quality photos and has a cool phone connecting feature so I wasn’t too mad but it is not exactly what you’d expect."
"It works well but it’s not that great of quality but you get what you pay for. I like it, wouldn’t use it to vlog."
"I decided to purchase because reviews said easy to use. That was true; however, the poor quality of pictures negated that. Indoors or outdoors just wasn’t clear enough and colors seemed artificial, at times. I kept the camera and tried to take pictures at different times of day, but same results. Too late to return."
We planned this camera for our upcoming trip but quality in day and night was not good. Not even close to 4k. Our iphone 13 pictures looked much better. We also transferred sample images to desktop to check clarify and not at happy with the camera description
The camera itself is very nice looks professional my only down side was that I want the pictures and videos more clear.
"This camera, even though it's not highly advanced like a Canon, it is a good start if you want to get into the world of photography.  It is very easy to use and has a good image quality."
After one use the battery door will not shut.  Picture quality is good.  Just not worth the hassle
Doesn’t take good quality photos
Very cheap quality. Difficult to use. One of the main reasons why I returned it was there was no way to turn off the sound. Everytime you touched a button it beeped.
"I like your camera because it is easy to set up and use, but unfortunately I was disappointed with the camera quality. I wish you the best with your company."
The app to download pics would never work to download any pics.  I could never connect to the wifi  and this will not work for me.Returned.
I tried taking good pictures with this but I do not recommend this to anyone. It has very poor camera quality.
"Worst camera, it is barely more than a toyI used all functions.Battery life was weakAuto focus focused over and over and over and would never settle.Manual focus barely worked and sometimes would not focus.Picture quality was lacking when you could get it to focus.Videos def not in 4k. Other options were not much better. Often lines would shoot across the image and flash like it couldn’t handle the lighting.Burst mode took terrible photos.Timelapse video was the only half decent mode and even it was terrible quality. This thing isn’t worth $20 let alone $100This company should be ashamed."
"The quality of the pictures is terrible. The flash does not work and it is impossible to take pictures at night. The videos, even worse. All pictures or videos look pixelated. It is a horrible camera. Better to spend money on a more expensive camera. I am in the process of returning it because it is horrible. It's not even good enough for my kids."
"I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. Every picture I took was blurry. It's very cheaply made. My first review was taken down for unknown reasons. Their is no profanity no harassment, not any reason the truth about this low quality camera shouldn't be allowed."
The camera is very cheap looking. It feels like it is made out of plastic. Looks like a toy camera. There is no viewer window to take pictures. You only use the screen. We returned the camera.
"Does not record audio when using external mic, tried TRS and TRRS and still silence, other than that you get what you paid for when it comes to image quality and built-in mic."
"When I tried to attach the camera to the tripod for an upcoming video shoot, the compartment that houses the battery continuously pops open and will not reseal. I’ve had the camera three months! There’s no troubleshooting option to assist me. No option to chat with anyone and of course, passed the window to return or replace 😡😡😡😡😡"
It felt cheap.  I sent it back the same day I received.  Return/refund process was easy & fast.
"All of the description is a lie. The camera quality is not 4K at all, the picture is blurry, the zoom is terrible. Don’t waste your money."
This camera takes pictures just like a I phone do why waste your money on this when yu can take with. Your phone!!!! Don’t have no kinda professional photograph kinda look don’t buy this
Do not buy this camera. It is a piece of Chinese junk. I purchased for outdoor pictures and my iPhone takes better pictures.
Bought this for direct transfer and it doesn’t work as advertised
The focus was horrible. No matter close or far nothing was in focus
"I didnt expect ""great"", but I expected better."
Do not recommend.  Take’s horrible pictures.
Obviously not 4k camera. Very light and plastic. Was not expecting amazing quality but it's worse than my phone camera
there is nothing to like about this camera!!!!
I can’t use it there was not battery charger I’ll look to see if I can buy one separately very disappointed
I got this camera as a gift to vlog my experiences for a conference. It worked well took good pictures and such but my one problem was that the camera was too noisy. So it was some trouble taking it out to take pictures of video since it made so much noise. I could not find a volume button so I took limited pictures. It’s a nice small camera and fits in backpacks snug. The camera is a bit slow and you need to press the button and wait a bit. It does have the ability to give filters and it works well. The pictures are good quality and are clear. One last thing is that the audio is iffy so you do need a mic to be able to get that feature of good audio. But overall a good product and works good for the price.
Wanted something affordable and the reviews were good but I bought it and the camera quality is not good it washes you out.
No aperture or shutter speed options. Thought these were pretty standard settings for a camera
"This camera takes blurry pictures. I was not impressed by the quality of the pictures. I tried to return it but the only option is to drop it off at Whole Foods. I don’t have one of those near me. I contacted customer service and they said that’s the only option. I should be able to mail it back even if I have to pay for shipping myself. So you are forcing people to keep a camera that doesn’t take good photos! It should say that in the description that there is only one way to return it, because I wouldn’t have ordered it. WASTE of money!!!!"
"I wouldn't waste your money. Your phone camera is better. The picture quality and videos aren't as clear. However, the color is nice."
"This camera is CRAP! I used the ""auto"" on the camera and in both inside and outside, the pictures were blurry or you couldn't even see them at all. I do NOT recommend anyone buy this camera. I bought it for my daughter's wedding and thank heavens others also took pictures. Of course, I ordered it and now the window has closed to return it. Again, DO NOT purchase this camera."
This cameras super cheap….. Quality is very crappy. My iPhone takes better photos. Pretty disappointed.
features and zoomablity and not able to use my own lenses
"This is my first ""action"" camera.  I got it so I can record the walks with my dogs. Not exciting but where we walk, there are sometimes unsavory characters and off-leash dogs.  Picture quality is good.  Sound is fine. Battery life is one hour, which isn't long enough but to be expected for a camera in this price range.  I have to set the recording setting every single time.  And the buttons are placed in such a way that I hit them inadvertently. I can't count the number of times that I've accidently changed the settings because I hit a button, only to find that the camera was turned off or is in photo mode after the walk. This has happened so often that I am paranoid about it so I take the camera out of the clip to check (because you can't see the screen when it's in the clip) only to discover that it was fine but then I hit the button putting it back in the clip, either turning it off or changing the mode.  Playback is also frustrating because the camera buffers constantly.  Finally, when I attach the camera for charging, it turns on so I have to turn it off.  Every. Time. WHY????"
"So, I am going to say right off the bat, I paid $83 for an action camera, I was expecting an $83 action camera. Short handed, that's not what I got.Shortly after getting this camera I immediately set to taking it through its paces. Between dash mounted footage, motorcycle helmet footage, and eventual PodCams (podcast video accompaniment), I needed to get a strong feel for how well this camera handled it. I took it around my yard on the two modes I will record video (1080p60 and 4K24). Then I strapped it to my motorcycle helmet and went for a ride. I picked up a decent amount of footage.Now, I am going to briefly cover the reason I took half a star from my actual rating. I used the iSmart DV app (as the product description says to use, since the original one has been depreciated) to activate the recording for the ride, because it's mounted to my helmet, that was being worn. I expected that it would record until I brought my phone back out and stopped it from the app as well. Turns out, after my half an hour ride, it only recorded about 3 minutes of it, because at some point it decided to stop recording. This was annoying, but I can live with that, I don't really have faith in App controls, so I will just use the included remote control to do it from now on.Moving on! Once I took the footage from the various modes off the camera and transferred them to my PC, I previewed it all. Mind you my expectations were pretty low, since it's an $83 action camera, but what I watched was astonishing. The 1080p60 was the best of the two modes I used, because the framerate made it seem much more lifelike than the 24fps 4K. Either way, I definitely did not expect such video quality with this.  Now that we know I like the video quality, I am going to break down the keypoints I look for in cameras, and various devices as a whole.Build Quality: Now, it's not a solid block of metal that you are confident would sustain being pitched against a concrete wall, but it's not a flimsy piece of hollow plastic either. It's lightweight without feeling super cheap. I'd say the one thing that will most certainly become an issue later in it's life is the battery door. It's just difficult to get off that you lose finesse, and must utilize focused brute force. One day that motion will break the tabs. Hopefully Akaso has some sort of minor parts store one can purchase a new battery door from, for when that time does come. Quick note, the mounts, remote, and various accessories this comes with are all well built as well.Video Quality: Crisp, clean, and pleasurable, as long as you have sufficient light. There aren't many cameras like this that do all that well in super low light, but this wasn't awful. However, note that your frame rate will drop a bit if you are in a noticeably darker room.Audio Quality: Junk. As expected. They all are. Mind you, it is there, but like every action camera I've ever used, the audio is not clear and far reaching, but muffled, because I am fairly certain they all drop them under the solid plastic casing, not exposed to the air. So the sound is muffled. That's true of all action cameras of this size, if you are looking for audio quality over video, you want the Zoom Q8, it has nowhere near the video quality of this camera, but it records studio grade audio with many interchangeable mic modules you can buy.Battery Life: Lacking. You can get a little over an hour recording 1080p60 on one charge. There are two redeeming factors here that saved it from losing more of a star. 1) The camera comes with two batteries, doubling the life. 2) The camera still records when you have the camera plugged into a charger or external battery, so if long life matters, you have options. Plus getting more batteries isn't crazy expensive anyway.User Interface and Controls: Simple, easy to understand, and feature rich. The included remote is pretty killer too.  It does have the ""wifi"" option, and for basic operation that is cool, but my experience with it, as stated above, was not great. 5 different video modes (720p120, 1080p30, 1080p60, 2.7k30, 4K24), and 2 still image modes (single and burst), as well as a time lapse option, it's hard to ask for more really.Additional features: MicroSD card slot, up to 64GB, use class 10 or higher. A 64gb calss 10 card gets you over 6 hours of 1080p60 footage without switching cards.Included accessories: Well, the fact that it comes with ANY gives it an edge, but it comes with a solid starting base of accessories for mounting, charging and controlling. Way more than the big brand GoPro.Now that I've said that magic word (GoPro) let me end on this:I've rented a GoPro Hero5 to use on a road trip. I pulled that footage up today and compared it to the footage taken with this Akaso, two clips nearly identical light, identical settings, and this Akaso kicks it's butt with video quality. Hands down. So, for less than a quarter of the price, you get this camera that out classes the Hero5 and comes with well, a lot, whereas that Hero5 $400 pricetag just gets you the camera. No deal GoPro, Akaso, you're winning. I look forward to getting the three more I need, and pumping out great video content, care of Akaso's great camera.EDIT:The biggest plan behind this camera was to get one per microphone for my podcasts. That's when I quickly learned something irreversibly bad about the cameras as a series. I'll start off with a note that everything else I said is true, of the first camera I received. However, upon receipt of two more to round off my mic came, I realized that one of the two I received was different. Sure, the model number was the same, but there's a laundry list of things different. The ""features"" remain the same, but one sensor needs to be back about 6"" from the other to capture the same image. It's as if one is zoomed in a bit further than the other. The software itself reacts just slightly different as well. For example, when it's plugged into power the cameras all turn on automatically, however when you long press the power, the different one doesn't shut back off, but instead goes into something of a sleep mode.But in the end, I returned all of these cameras today because of the primary flaws:They record at a mere fraction of a fraction variance of speed, add in that occasionally when the file switches to a new, it loses a frame or more. This leads right up to the complete inability to sync recordings together into one cohesive project. I can't record the same event, in 3 different angles, and make a single video out of it without losing sync with all of them by the end.So, if you are planning to use more than one of these, prepare to run into a lot of issues. Consistency in equipment is a must for production equipment. Unfortunately these just don't have it. So, if app you need is one single high quality action camera, go ahead and grab this. Me? I'll be getting a round of Zoom Q2Ns, because they make consistent equipment for professionals."
"Function and quality of this camera is pretty good. I bought this as a back up replacement for my GoPro as it was on it's last leg. The camera is a decent replacement when it works, but it does have issues and problems.Pros:-Comes with 2 batteries and charger, while also having pretty decent battery life on 1080p at 30fps-Comes with everything you need-It is pretty straight forward on what is what, and can record for quite some time.-Has a screen for previewing recent footage-The back screen will turn off but will keep recording, so if you are recording for a while it will turn off the preview screen after a certain amount of time.Cons:Personally I have ran into more cons than anything with this, which is quite disappointing. It became more of annoyance to me.-It seems to be picky with how you input the SD card somehow. Sometimes the card works fine and other times a Card Error will pop up. Not sure what is the problem here as it is random on when it happens. Most times it is a constant Card Error, but every once in a blue moon the SD card will work randomly. I've tested it with multiple SD cards, new and old, and will still get the Card Error. I notice that if the card is put in correctly, then the start up will be a bit longer, but most times it is short and notifies about the Card Error.-While being able to preview what you just recorded on the camera itself, if the camera is turned off, you won't be able to preview it afterwards and will have to transfer it to your computer to see it again. It will not show it again afterwards, which is weird and some what not well thought of design in which it seems that it removed the file.-Recording while charging is odd, as I attempted it a couple of times, but due to the card error it will not record anything. On times when I did not get the card error and to test the charging while recording, the camera seems to restart itself upon being connected to a power bank, in which the Card error prompt will show up and basically be unusable.In all it is decent, but I am completely unsure why the Card Error prompt will pop up when the SD cards I used were mainly brand new. Having this error made it unusable and I would end up inserting and reinserting the card hoping for it to work SOMETIMES. Wanting to preview the footage after turning it off and on, is an odd choice to ""remove"" what was recorded. If you end up wanting to charge the battery and preview the footage while it is charging, the footage would be ""removed"" due to the restart upon plugging it in to charge. I am a fan of it when it works, but that is only about 10% of the time. The fact I have to constantly insert and remove the SD card in hopes for it to work is the killer for me. If you're desperate for an action camera and have a bunch of micro SD cards, then this may be for you. Otherwise, buy at your own risk."
I bought this for my kids to use for filming random things instead of always asking to use my phone. It was fun at first but they lost interest quick because the video quality isn’t that great when we look at it on the computer.
"The price of this action camera is fine compared with others but you get what you pay for, the quality of the video is not 4K even with a u3 SD card and it doesn't have any motion focus, so if you use it for extreme sports wont do the trick. Also the main reason it gets 3 stars is that the screen freezes very veeeery often and you need to format the SD card for it to stop happening until it happens again. So annoying. If you are on a budget, wait and save a little more and pay for better quality action camera."
The camera seems good and it takes decent quality pictures and videos. As well as the battery run time is decent. However the application sucks and is far from polished
"It was really good for the price. The only thing I disliked about it was that you couldn’t transfer the files to your pc with a cable. You had to transfer via wifi or else the video gets corrupted. So for the past 3 weeks I had to transfer by using the wifi function. Other than that, it’s good, maybe it was just mine. But now I got the V50x and first time transferring to my pc, it worked perfectly."
"I didn't expect this to be a GoPro, but I did expect clean HDMI because I wanted to use it for a live video feed. Alas, display icons can not be removed and I am going to be returning this. I can not believe that now - in 2024 - manufacturers haven't all figured this out.The button-only (no touch screen) interface makes this difficult to use. The thing I liked most was the remote, which worked out of the box and is way better than anything I've seen GoPro do. The mobile app is also good, and overall easier to use than GoPro's mobile app.As a low cost action cam with basic features, the AKASO EK7000 is OK. If you need something for live streaming in a home studio environment, look elsewhere.I'm in touch with support about a partial credit or return. So far, support has been surprisingly responsive, which again is way better than GoPro. AKASO has potential to really do well if they can just get with the times on the tech."
"Purchased this to shoot time lapse pictures and video for an indoor, air conditioned event.  Had an old GoPro I had used for this before, but wanted to upgrade to HD, etc. The camera was mounted in a safe place in the room. The first failed experiment was when this camera stopped taking pictures halfway through the second day of taking time-lapse pictures.  It acted as though the SD card was full. Not only would it not let me take further video or pictures, but wouldn't even let me change to the settings screen while that SD card was inserted.  On exploration, the card was only 50% full.  I purchased a second SD card, hoping to at least capture video at the festivities of the event one evening.  I shot about 30 minutes of video, then turned it off for 30 minutes.  Then turned it on again.  It captured a bit over 30 minutes of video before it just straight up stopped.  Having left it there as a stationary camera, I wasn't aware until after the event was over that I missed out on some of the most important bits.  This second card was only 10% full when it quit.It's important to note that the camera was plugged into a power source the entire time so this wasn't a matter of the battery running out or overheating. I also triple verified that the SD cards were compatible (high performing, brand name).  I also verified that the ""auto turn off"" timer was off (further evidenced by the fact that it ran for significant periods of time without issue).I'm not sure what to conclude other than the camera wasn't built for long-term use and may overheat.  Unfortunate as what it did capture was decent quality for the price."
"Takes great up close stills and video, but can't get the camera to zoom. No instruction on how to do that either. Needs a better manual. Only reason it got 3 stars, is the extras it comes with and the fact it comes with 2 batteries. 5 stars if you can tell me how to get it to zoom."
"***Update 07/30/2018: I wouldn't recommend this camera anymore.I have used this camera enough to give a much better review on its operation.My use is for Motocross so the cameras were used either mounted to our helmets or onto our dirt bike handle bars.The helmet mounts are horrible. The double sided tape falls off every time. Granted we are in Texas so its hot but I had the helmet inside for a week after I cleaned it and applied the mount. Second I got it outside and it sat in the sun for 30 minutes the mount fell right off, not even riding. Just sitting in the driveway while we were loading up the bikes...Operations issues- I will say I got a lot of video using these cameras. At least 5-8 hours worth of video. All of it on trails or on a motorcross track. So not a calm environment at all. The video is decent if mounted correctly and using the correct type of mount. Water proof case is useless if you are doing anything that you want to have the sound in the video. There is a non-water proof case that does the trick, but that leaves the entire camera exposed(on top of a helmet this is not a great idea to use).The main issue we have with the camera is when riding yesterday we had videos of no more then 10-15 minutes long. We would pause in between sessions. I noticed during rides the cameras would be off when we get to the end of a ride. Okay I thought either the battery died or it over heated. No big deal, leave it off for a few minutes and swap the battery good to go. Nope come to find out all 5 times that happened yesterday when the camera ""died"" it would corrupt the video. This means I lost almost an hour worth of video because the camera malfunctioned. The camera dying and losing the final part or even half of a session wouldn't be that big of a deal but losing the entire video because of that is just something I cannot live with. This is an action camera, why would it overheat or not save a video before the battery dies...For this reason I can no longer recommend getting this camera, especially if you are doing something outside where the camera may get hot. Losing hours of video because your action camera shuts off suddenly and corrupts your entire video is not something I would be willing to deal with. I will be going with a name brand action camera from now on.**Update 06/05/2018: After receiving the second camera there was one bubble under the screen. Support reached out to me after I reported it to them telling me there is another screen protector on the screen (one that is supposed to stay on the screen). They informed me I could take it off. Taking off the screen protector eliminates the bubbles on the screen for obvious reasons(it doesn't leave any glue or anything on the screen so don't worry). After using the camera during vacation its pretty awesome, especially for the price. I didn't record anything in 4K yet but I have used it underwater as well as on my dirt bike. I will update with a video from the camera once I get my card reader. At the moment I can say I would recommend this just for the price compared to other ""action"" cameras.Pros:PriceDecent cameraEasy to use once you figure out what the buttons doDid I mention price?...Cons:No handle to carry it (easy purchase on amazon for under 10$ though)Screen protector has to be taken off to get rid of bubbles during production.Instruction manual**Update 05/31/18: Used the original camera on vacation and it seems to take good video/pictures aside from the bubble issue.I recieved numerous emails to update my review to a 5 star simply because they sent me a new camera but I waited until I saw the new camera first. Glad I did, when I returned from vacation my new camera was waiting for me and guess what, it has a bubble under the screen as well... waiting for a reply from cs regarding this issue since thats two cameras with bubbles under the screen... Seems to be an ongoing issue I guess. The new cameras bubble isnt as bothersome as the original but still an issue in my eyes.**Update 5/25/18: Seller contacted me and has sent a new camera out to replace the one with bubbles under the screen. Will update once I get the new camera and actually try it out. **Camera seems to work good. I will be taking out dirt bike riding tomorrow to really test it.Some issues with it though.Camera comes with all kinds of mounts and stuff but no handle to actually hold the camera while its inside the water proof case??? So when you hold it while its not mounted to anything you have to work around the annoying mount brackets on the bottom or go spend more money for a handle.Also my camera has spots and a piece of hair under the screen. It appears there may be a screen protector of some sort on there that doesnt look like it should come off. I peeled the plastic off the screen that has the writing on it telling you to peel it off already but there are bubbles on the screen with a red hair under one of the big bubbles. Not sure if its under a factory screen protector or the screen itself. Kind of ruins the camera for me so I maybe returning it..."
Didnt work as great as I wanted it to.  Does work great close up when recording conversations but gets terribly blurry if trying to see the video when zoomed in.
"UPDATE - Aug 3.  Never received any response from AKASO and the web site provides little in customer support and just links you back to their store which is AMAZON.  So poor customer service even after emailing AKASO.  I did order another brand of ""Chinese Go Knock-off"" camera as I needed something for this weekend's diving trip.  When it arrived. I tried their lithium batteries in the AKASO and viola, it worked.  So the problem noted below is from defective batteries used by AKASO, NOT THE CAMERA.  So I am increasing my star count for the camera, but because of defective batteries and poor customer service, think AKASO is a 2 star company and selling a three star camera.  But, if you purchase, thoroughly test the batteries and replace if they do not last.UPDATE -  Camera has stopped working after use snorkeling in Belize. Pretty much kept it and batteries dry but while viewing video, just stopped working and will not power up.  If I plug it into USB, the camera comes on and can see files stored on micro SD card.  Powers on and off, but none of the menu items work and once it disconnects from the micro USB, does nothing.  I have tried searching for solutions online and warranty information.  One note is that the camera gets very hot when enclosed in the waterproof case. I do not know if overheating was the cause of failure or not.  It is also difficult seeing when it is in recording mode through the display when underwater. Have contacted AKASP for any assistance.  Will update this review based upon the response received.  Just received the AKASO 4K EK7000 Action Camera and upon initial use and discovery my first impressions are positive and this may be a great value for the $$. The camera has most of the features I was looking for plus some added features and photo options.  It is generally simple to use with power, and two option/navigation buttons, plus comes with a remote control and wifi capability so I can operate the camera hands-free or view video and photos via cell phone. Also, comes with an extra battery with recording time lasting close to an hour. The camera also has time lapse capability which I plan to use to take pictures of the upcoming super-moon. Plus it can handle a 654 GB SD card without any problem for hours of recording. First limited uses and trial videos at all image setting are excellent.  I had purchased a GEEK PRO sports camera a few years ago (no longer listed on Amazon) to take snorkeling in Cozumel, but the camera's video mode kept freezing up after few or several minutes of operation. None of the buttons would work and the only way to reset was to remove camera from waterproof case, remove battery, reinsert and power up.  I ended up losing hours of great underwater video, especially of a giant sting ray I chanced across.  Returned the product as soon as I returned stateside. Thus, I spent a lot of time researching and reading reviews, before settling on the AKASO this time around.  While this sport cameras all operate the same and have same interface and setup options, how they stand up over time is critical.  While I have had the AKASO just a week, I have already put it through the tests and am pleased with performance, features and quality of results on all settings.  Plus, camera comes with all the mounting options you can imagine at a fraction of thecost of name brands, like GO PRO. Will update my review only if I encounter problems that would affect my star rating.  See other reviews for more technical explanation of features, capabilities and utilities.

"I purchased this because it was considerably cheaper than other brands, but there's a reason. First of all, I was very disappointed it didn't come with a detailed instruction manual -- you're supposed to download it online. Also has a lot of random pieces that I have no clue how to implement. For video quality, it's clear but extremely shaky. Photo quality reminds me of my old 3MP camera from 2007. Would not recommend purchasing unless you're broke"
"Camera is decent, fisheye lens is a little distorted. A lot of accessories for mounting. I need to use waterproof cover at times for outdoor video on my boat. Sound recording is then muffled and not usable. Cannot connect external power or microphone when waterproof case is on and cannot connect both power and mic as they use the same port. Wish case had cutouts so you could attach power or mic and still be water resistant as I won’t be using it underwater. Just hope it doesn’t rain when I need to use it. Battery life is not good at all if you leave powered on. Maybe 2-3 hours at best, and will shutdown probably right when I need it. The remote won’t power it on, must be in standby, and the remote isn’t waterproof. App is ok to transfer video to my iPhone/Mac for editing. Not a terrible product for the price, but probably will return and buy the “real” camera."
"Yes this is a 50 dollar camera that is submersible in water.  That said, it is janky and clumsy.  The instructions are scattered on the set up notes included, the app you have to download and just toying around with the buttons. Picture quality is okay.  And I mean just okay.  By today’s standards, sub par.  I’m not loving this device and I don’t recommend it."
"My 3 star rating will revise up/down dependent upon my experience with the replacement camera.The good:- I'm a first time action cam buyer and didn't want to spend a lot of money because I'm not sure how much I'll really use it, so I figured for $85 what the heck.  What I liked was the image quality-- While I've only used it 1 day so far (in the bright sun) it took great vids at 1080 60fps. I have no need for 4K so I didn't try it. Even indoors with normal house lighting the vids look quite good.  As I use it more I'm going to experiment with 1080 at 60fps vs 30fps as well.- The waterproof/protective housing seems like it's great quality.-  The mounting is GoPro compatible so there are a ton of options available to be purchased.Neutral feelings:- The documentation is poor but I figured my way around it fairly easily. I think the menus could be a bit more intuitive on the camera, but I'm trainable like a dog.- The day I used it I was really disappointed in the battery life.... about 42 mins each of continuous recording, about 1/2 what they claim.  But I reran a few tests in my house and ended up getting around 85 mins of continuous recording on each battery, so that made me happy.  The batteries take 2-3 hours to charge in the camera, so an investment in an external charger is a good idea.  They can be purchased for around $15 and include 2-3 extra batteries.  Just make sure you buy the PG1050 batteries that have two rounded edges as some sold are square corner and fit too tight in the camera.- While it comes with lots of mounting accessories, the helmet mount is a joke because they give you a flat mounting plate that won't fit on a curved helmet, so I had to buy some proper helmet mounts for about $10.- While they give you a wireless remote, it doesn't tell you if the camera is recording or paused, so if you can't see the camera, like when it's on your helmet, you are reliant on others or have to take it off and look at the camera to see if it's recording.- There needs to be better audible annunciation chimes to tell the user if the camera was just put in recording mode or paused mode.The Bad:-- My camera's USB port was wonky and loose.  It would often come disconnected from charging or when connected to the computer anytime the USB cable moved. It was an unreliable connection charging or when connected to the computer. This problem was experienced both with the provided USB cable as well as the one I use for my phone which I know works fine.  Frankly it may be why I experienced poor battery life because possibly they weren't charging properly due to the USB port.  I have sent the defective unit back for a refund and have already ordered a replacement.- Support... what support?  The Akaso website is a joke, contains no documentation, no where to get tech support and no where to download firmware updates if they even exist.  So it seems we're rather on our own during ownership.Summary:Hopefully the USB issues are resolved with the replacement camera and no new issues arise.  I'm going to be running it through its paces in the next couple of weeks and I really want it to work out, because the video is great and the camera is a fraction of the price of a GoPro or Garmin etc.  I will post an updated review in a few weeks."
"So the camera doesn’t come with an SD card, which I did read in the description so I’m not faulting them for that. Just takes away from the excitement of my item arriving since I’m still waiting in the SD card in the mail before I can even use the camera. The camera comes with a lot of mounts in the box however none of the mounts supplied in the box work very well with clipping to a hat horizontally, which is the purpose I purchased one of these cameras. Also it seems a lot of the mounts are incompatible with the water proof case. Brought the price point up for me significantly as I had to purchase both of these things separate and I still can’t use the camera since it doesn’t come with even small internal storage"
This is a terrible camera if you want to be able to record in 4k. It only records for 10 minutes. According to the user manual you will only get a max of 26 mins on 720p. I should have saved my money for a Go Pro. 50.00 wasted on this camera
The playback button stopped working on first use. I would be concerned about durability although video quality is great for the price.I would try a higher model of this brand to see if they are more durable.Camera and app are easy to use on Android.
Had this for almost a month now it won’t turn on at all before hand the image was crisp and just as good as go pro idk if I just got a defective one but did enjoy product while it lasted
"Ok so I bought this because I wanted to use it on vacation.  I didn’t open it until I got to my destination because I’m pretty good with putting things together.  First the camera was so difficult to get off the packaging mount, the battery opening is impossible to open without using your fingernail, replacing the battery cover is impossible does not slide in and click you have to push on it and it’s such cheap plastic it warps and cracks.  There is also misinformation on the Amazon page it says the camera uses up to a 32GB card but then it says on another part that it can use up to a 128gb"
"I purchased two of these to record my bike rides, and to capture scenery that for one reason or another I often can't or don't stop to photograph. I went in knowing this by no means was going to attempt to replacement my mirrorless, but perhaps thought it could compete with my iPhone 6.I had 1 with me that I used to capture stills, and one that recorded video at 1080p (60fps).Here are my observations; first the good.As others have mentioned, the price is hard to beat. I was able to purchase 2 of these for the price of 1 go proThe ability to use gopro mounts is a plusThe fact that it records videos in aprox. 15 minute bursts is nice, as another review had mentioned it saves you should (and when) the battery goes dead; it's also no the most difficult thing to stitch together the different clips into 1 videoThe photos it produces aren't bad, but they're not great either. Somehow my 8megapixel iphone camera still produces better still photos to view on a computer screen. Why this isn't under the bad is because I have not yet tested printing the photo to see which looks better once you actually print.The bad:I had previously charged both batteries fully, but found that after a 1 hour bike ride when I returned home the camera that was recording had actually run out of battery and turned off as I went down the driveway.1 hour of run time, takes 3-5 hours of charge time; that's not idealsome of the accessories provided are useless/cheap plastic.If you attempt to use the handlebar mount you will need to have flat bike bars, my road bike (drop bars) are far too fat for the mount to go on. Also, if you attempt to face it backwards on your rear triangle in order to get it to stop wiggling you have to make it very tight, however once it is that tight the slightest bump cracks the plastic. Cheap and uselessThe attached screws handles are often too long, luckily they can be replaced with spare bike bolts I hadThere are a million attachments and half of them are useless (at least for my purposes)The 1080p video isn't great. I had attempted to slow the video down to see if I could read automobile license plates as they went by - the cars were in a 45mph section - everything was a blur, looks fine as motion but don't expect to be able to see detailsI went for my ride about 3 hours before sunset. With the exposure left on default all of the highlights were blown out and the shadows were even light. It was fairly even light so I'm a bit disappointed.*two notes:I have since adjusted exposure down 1/3 of a stop; I have also changed the resolution to 2.7k at 30fps to see if details are more clear, I will also do a test at 4k at 25fps and down half a stop in exposure. Once I have done another test I will update with those results."
"Honestly, for the price, really not that bad of a product. It rattles quite a lot unfortunately, I'm using it on a motorcycle and the rattling is audible enough I can hear it from my tank to my helmet. Image quality is good, stabilization is good, so on. Will update this if I have any further commentsThe app however... horrible, I don't even want to use it. Can't download my videos, it just crashes"
"The picture or video quality is just meh. When it said superior quality and 4K support, I expected a better one. And this comes with a lot of mounting related accessories, but with minimal information how to use all those parts. Came across a video here which shows how to use some of those. But still lot of information is missing and I don't know what some of those parts are for. For eg: there is a backdoor protector, not sure why it is needed when compared to the default backdoor which comes with it."
Thought this would be a great deal mediocre at best during the middle of my first hike. With full battery on display just dies won't power on so I go to take out the battery and swap it out the pull tab on the battery rips off so now I'm in the middle of my adventure and can't get the battery out.  Next after I recharged the battery through the camera I'm in the middle of my hike and the screen freezes it's like a black screen with a logo and will not do anything I literally have to power it up and power it on three or four times for it to unfreeze.  No one wants to deal with this in the middle of the adventure that they're using it for. Lastly an absolutely most irritating I had this mounted on my bike and all the video that I captured in both 60 FPS and 30 FPS are super super shaky it cannot keep up with high speed capturing if I sit it down on a flat surface that doesn't move image quality is great but if you're moving around don't expect it to capture everything and give you a flawless video at the end.  Lastly I'm not a video expert but I thought there would be a more drastic space consumption between 4K 30 1080p 60 and 1080p 30 it was only a matter of 40 minutes or so of record time that seems inaccurate in the actual scope of recording. Last irritation Factor is the push button remote it worked flawlessly in the beginning but after using it for 2 days I would have to deliberately hard press and hold either the record or the camera button for it to acknowledge sometimes I'd have to press it twice just to get it to acknowledge the camera and then press it again to record so if I was in a quick record situation I'd miss it every time. on the positive side it's cheap the case held up well I did a jump and it fell off and fell into the water and bobbled around camera was just fine everything was crystal clear the accessories are mediocre at best they do not interlock with actual GoPro connections or clips I did not try the self-adhesion pads as other reviewers have stated they are horrible so I stuck with my GoPro ones that I had extremely disappointed in this little camera.  Hope this helps.
I thought this was going to be a great little camera because a buddy of mine had ordered one but come to find out the camera I received did not work to expectations on recording video the battery is only lasted 15 minutes no matter how low or high you had your setting set same batteries in my buddies camera bought from the same people just a different color and model the same batteries lasted for over an hour and a half to two hours which leads me to believe that the camera itself was just a flawed camera I will purchase another camera but maybe or maybe not from the same company. I had very high hopes for this camera because I bought it specifically for a cruise I was going on to use underwater since it went up to 131 ft I was disappointed to find out that I was not able to use the camera at all due to the fact that it used the battery life up within 15 minutes as mentioned I didn't say it was a bad company I just said I had a flawed camera my buddy's camera he bought from the exact same company works great
"I'm curious about all the five star reviews on here about this camera. Mine has many issues. Maybe I got a ""bad"" one? I ordered the AKASO EK7000 because I wanted a cheap, lightweight camera with time lapse stills and 1080p video for my Syma X8C drone. 4K video was really just a bonus. For less than $80, I thought I'd give it a try. After a month of use, my opinion of it is that it's a decent video camera with really great features but it's awful at still photography. Clear, sharp pictures are kinda an important function in a camera. The 12MP still photos look like they're just upscaled 4MP pics with harsh over sharpening. The pics are truly unusable. No detail, muddy looking. Wouldn't even think about printing them.However, video at 1080p and 720p is really good. The 4K 25fps video is also good (when it works) as long as you have a monitor that can display the entire format. Same with 2.7K. I have tried the wifi connection with their proprietary app, but it'll just stop recording a few seconds in. And it disconnects all the time. Also, the Time & Date on the camera is very buggy. It just doesn't track time consistently. I'll set it, then a week later the date is off by 4 days and several hours. Then there's the crashing while trying to use 4K video. I'll rotate through the camera options to video, press the record button, and the screen goes blank. There's no video being recorded, and none of the buttons work. I have to pull the battery out and reinsert just to get the camera to power back on. This seems to only happen with the 4K video, not 1080, 720 or still photos. It's pretty hit or miss to get it to work.THE GOOD: you can't beat the number of features at this price point. The package comes with loads of connectors, straps and accessories. The waterproof case seems air tight and easy to control, though I haven't used it underwater. I like the wide angle point-of-view of the lens. All of the video formats look pretty good.THE BAD: still photos are horrendous. Time and date won't hold. 4K video sometimes freezes the camera forcing me to yank the battery out to restart. Wifi FPV app disconnects a lot. And if you're looking for an instruction manual, sorry."
"Be aware this comes with a large amount of small plastic accessories that you probably will not be able to figure out how to use. Additionally, when I did use it, the battery life is so short that it rendered it all but worthless.  The video quality seems good but make sure that it’s short because you will run out of power.  Definitely was not one of my Amazon purchases."
The camera works great but the case for the camera was broken in the box.Makes me kinda worried on the quality of the other accessories it came with.
"I bought this for my nephew who is 12. I have a gopro hero 7 black and he loves using my gopro he is just rougher than i like on the camera after watching his footage. The day it arrived I set it up for him it recorded and everything worked fast forward to yesterday Memorial day we went out to the springs and when the record button is pushed the camera either locked up or lines ran across the screen and didn't record. I formatted the card in the camera and that is when this started, I put the card in un-formatted the night it arrived it recorded without any issues. Here is what I found I bought him a class 10 U3 64gb Samsung card with 100mb/s write speed the card is good for 4k I checked it against fakes it's a legit Samsung sd card. If you press record and your Akaso Ek7000 freezes or throws lines across the screen back down the resolution what we found worked was 1080p 30 frames anything higher and the camera freaked out. To format the card or change reolution once powered on press the mode button until the wrench is displayed then press the top record button. Once inside settings the mode button exits and the record button is enter the side buttons scroll. with Resolution highlighted press the record button set it to 1080/30 then press mode button to exit out of settings. The app I can't get to work on an iPhone 8+ or a Samsung S8+ i only connected successfully once it froze.I could return the camera but recording in 1080/30 will be fine for a 12yo it takes photos just fine this is a test to see if he will take care of it then I will get him an official GoPro. My nephews love the springs and they film fish, turtles and back flips off the dock with my gopro but now they have their own to use and my GoPro is no longer bounced off the bottom or banging against the rails climbing up the dock. Hopefully this helps someone i couldn't find anything on a freezing or lines across the screen for the Akaso brand."
"Update:After I left my original review, they reached out to offer a replacement camera. Unfortunately, the issues I described were design flaws, not manufacturing defects. But after discussing the issues with them, I believe that these problems will be addressed in the next version of the camera. And based on their responsiveness, I would absolutely be willing to do business with them again.Original Review:I've had this camera for 6 months, and there's a few things you should know. This camera takes decent video, but there are some really annoying issues.  It's optimized for high speed in bright daylight, so if you use it indoors, it will capture every single flicker of any florescent light in the space, and the video will be pretty grainy. The microphone is optimized to pick up only the sounds of the person using it, so it doesn't even pick up a karate instructor shouting on the other side of a large room. If you wear it mountain biking, it'll pick up what you say, but not anything your buddies say.One of the things that's gotten on my nerves more and more, is that the default of this camera is to stamp every single photo and video with the wrong date. (attached image). Every time you swap out the battery so you can charge it, the date resets to a date a couple of years ago. And it resets to a default of stamping the videos with the date. So if you're out on the trail, and swap batteries to keep going... the rest of the videos that day will be stamped permanently with the wrong date.And the video upload software? Once you pair your phone and the camera, they only stay paired for as long as the camera is on. Which means every time you want to download pictures, you have to go through an unnecessarily obnoxious process to re-pair the camera. It is faster to just take out the sim card and plug it in to your computer.I got this camera because it was affordable, but I'm about to start shopping for something that annoys me less."
"Got this for my cycling commute; wanted my mom to be able to sue someone for when I was invariably killed by a careless motorist. My first helmet cam; I didn’t necessarily want to dive into a GoPro, but I wish I had. Decided to get a “starter camera” after looking through dozens of models, reviews, pros and cons.It comes with an almost overwhelming number of mounting options, though I really only needed the (un-curved) helmet mount and waterproof case.Nice to have two batteries, as they burn through charge quickly and can switch out to a fresh battery after a couple commutes.The downside is that the Date/time  needs to be reset with every battery change or memory card format; I always worried that if there were critical footage I needed for a collision or injury claim, that I’d have forgotten to set the date.The waterproof case worked well, despite some heavy PNW rainy commutes. Audio quality drops off sharply with the case in use.The phone app interface wasn’t very fluid, requiring a manual Wi-Fi connect every time.Overall: it was my starter camera, and I’m going to keep it as a backup, but if you want a good camera for cycling safety, just invest in a good GoPro.I got one for the holidays and it’s just better on every level."
"I purchased three of these cameras (black, blue, gray). As I had three cameras, it was easy to spot common faults. The thing that surprised me is that it seems like all three cameras appeared as if they came from different manufacturers. The case of one was slightly different to the case of the others. One camera had battery already inside and one spare. Two of the three cameras came with battery chargers. One with the battery chargers came with a 5v power supply, the other didn't.The camera appears to use a 3rd party phone app for control (not surprising for price). What was surprising (enforcing the idea of different chip manufacturers at least) was inconsistent wifi naming. The UHD 3840x2160 (""4K"") video was captured at 25fps, which may be a show stopper for US buyers. Conversely the 1080p/720p options where 30/60/120fps (up to 120fps for 720p, up to 60fps for 1080p). Audio differed by camera, as did file naming. One camera named video with FHDxxxx.mov where xxxx is a number, 0001, 0002 etc. This camera captured video in 5 minute chunks, ~ 61000kbps video, ~1400kbps stereo audio, at 44KHz. The other two cameras captured in 9:27 (9 minute 27 seconds) chunks, using date/time naming scheme, same video bitrate give or take, 127kbps 48KHz audio - the differing audio formats was surprising.Battery life: Capturing at highest definition without Wifi, battery lasted 60 minutes rather than the expected 90 minutes. This varied slightly between the cameras but each around 60 minutes.""Waterproof"" case: All three cases were used in a damp environment. While I did not see any direct signs of water getting into the cases, the video of all three were spoiled by increasing misting due to humidity inside the case. This could have been pre-existing moisture inside the case.Video quality: Video quality was ""OK"". I did see a ring for the lense, and per above, an increasing humidity.Compatibility with GoPro: I was able to use GoPro mounts with these cameras.Accessories: The cameras came with a huge bundle of accessories. Almost something for each scenario. They also came with zip-ties, safety wires and other things I had not considered.Conclusion: Quality was ok - about what I would expect for the price. I felt like I got my moneys worth. If you want quality - go for GoPro. If you want something low cost, these work."
"Allow me to tell you about this abysmal waste of my hard earned money.I was looking for an inexpensive action cam to mount to my motorcycle and also to record the game nights that my friends and I do on the weekends. So I bought this product after reading so many stellar reviews, and for the reason that it was far cheaper than a gopro. I watched some videos, and was thinking to myself ""Why would I ever spend a few hundred bucks on a gopro when this looks just as good!"" Now I know...The day this camera showed up on my doorstep, I came home and popped it out of it's packaging. I popped in a 64 gig, class 10 memory card, fiddled with a couple of settings and turned it towards my dog. I pressed the record button, and 3 seconds later it froze. Puzzled, I held the power button until it shut off, and powered it back on. Trying again, it ran for about 8 seconds before freezing. Being of the stubborn type, I tried a smaller card, grabbing an 8 gig that I happened to have nearby. It ran better, but after about 4 minutes it froze again. I messed with it for the rest of the night, and the next day put it on the dash of my truck to see if I could get it to work. The longest it recorded for was 10 minutes before freezing again. One thing to mention, when this camera freezes, it does not save the video.The following weekend, I hooked the camera to my handlebars, and went for a ride, and to my surprise, it actually ran for about 20 minutes! I held on a little bit of hope as I went to my friends house for game night. I arrived, and found the camera still running. Pressed the button to stop it, and took it inside with me. All seemed to be well. Talking with one of my friends about the issues I was having with the camera, she told me that they were the same problems that she was having with the camera she bought for $40. Talk about frustrating, I paid twice what she did, and we have practically the same product. The only difference, is that hers doesn't have a remote.So we dangled the camera from the chandelier to start recording. I checked on it from time to time and it was doing just fine. I felt hopeful that maybe it just needed some use to start working right. When the battery died, I popped open the case and pulled the camera out, and immediately noticed that it was HOT. Like, hotter than I was expecting. We pulled the battery, and let the camera cool down for a minute before putting a new battery in. With the new battery in, I powered the camera on and received a ""Card Error"" message. When I put the card in my laptop to see what was happening, I was prompted that the card was malfunctioning and had to be formatted to be used. So, all that video I took (including the ride) was lost. I believe that the heat from the battery corrupted the data on the card. I was able to format the card and save it, fortunately.At this point, I've had the camera for about 2 weeks, and only been able to make it function properly once, and even then there are glitches in the video (frozen pixels and jerky footage at times). I sincerely wish that it would just work as intended, because when it does work, the video is incredibly clear.Bottom line, this camera is unreliable and a total waste of money. If you want to get a camera for you kids to play with, get one of the $40 ones and let them go nuts. Don't bother wasting your time and money on this one. About the only thing that this has been good for, is that I've been able to figure out the placement and mounting style for the gopro I ordered which should be here next week."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Used this camera to record a POV on a roller coaster not the best quality but it’s pretty good for what it is. Still recommend GoPro over this but it will do the job if you’re on a budget. The mic/audio on this camera needs some work.
"Camera is great, colors are perfect and detail is outstanding, but the plastic case that the camera fits into for outdoor use has a defect in the exact center of the lens cover.  The defect is INSIDE the lens cover, too, and cannot be removed.  The net result is that every person I record with this camera in the case ends up with a slightly out-of-focus face.  Imagine a tiny drop of water in the exact center of your lens as you record and you can visualize the defect.The defect is only visible to the naked eye if the case lens is held so that sunlight reflects off it at an angle and it is viewed with a magnifying glass.  Since the lens seems to be made of glass, it seems to be some kind of manufacturing defect.  But for the life of me I cannot imagine any process that would put a defect directly in the center of the glass. The precision of it is perfect, almost as it it was designed that way.  And you cannot feel it with your finger, either because it is too small or because it is inside the glass.I bought a second camera kit for my son and his seems to be OK, which is good.  But I planned to use mine for my outdoor bushcrafting lessons and with that blem in the lens cover, cannot do the close up videography that I needed to do.UPDATE - December, 2018: During the summer, I took my Akaso swimming in the waterproof case.  My mistake was putting the camera in the wrong protective case.  I accidentally put it into the case with the slots for a strap, which is NOT WATERPROOF.I was horrified to see the case fill with water with my camera submerged in it.I removed the camera from the case, shook the water out of it the best I could, removed the battery and placed the camera on my dashboard of my car for two days.  When I installed the battery and turned the camera on, it worked perfectly.  That was about six months ago and this camera still works perfectly.  The microphone still needs an external mic jack, but otherwise, this little Akaso ROCKS."
"My wife said she wants evidence of how I was killed on my motorcycle, my fault or theirs, so she gave me permission to buy an action camera. I have it mounted on my helmet and I've used it twice now on my commute and as seen in the pic, condensation has formed INSIDE the ""waterproof"" case. The only times I've open the case was to change batteries. I was in a dry environment when I did this (my living room) yet somehow moisture has found it's way inside.4K: The 4K setting only runs at 25FPS (frames per second). I'm not even sure it's a true 4k, the video was pixelated and the quality of the 1080p 60FPS setting looks much better. Seems they added the atrocious 25FPS 4k just to be able to advertise that it's a 4k camera. I mean... there is even a giant ""4k"" right on the front, which a coworker got excited about after seeing, until I told him about the fps rating.Battery: it barely last long enough for my commute, which can be between 45 mins and 1 hour. And once the battery dies, the time and date stamp reset which is annoying.Mounts: This camera comes with a decent amount of mounting options though the adhesive leaves much to be desired. Thankfully it also came with a steel cable incase the camera detaches because that's what happened on my first outing. I ended up super gluing the mount to my helmet to keep it in place.Quality: I've never owned a gopro so I cant compare quality but I've owned quite a few Chinese dash cams from amazon and it's about on par with those as far as quality.Price: $60 vs $500, hands down no contest to the competition.Stabilization: minor bumps in the road cause the image to shake pretty badly.I dont regret the purchase, I will still use it for commuting but once I'm able to afford it, I'll probably buy a gopro or some other reputable brand of action camera."
"i'm being generous with 3 stars. So as far as the camera goes, its ok, wish it had some image stabilization but its adequate for my uses so 4 stars. I really like that it came with a backup battery and can also be used while charging.The packaging and accessories were very much sub par 2 stars at best. the view screen of the camera came scratched up, How that happened  with it inside the ""waterproof"" case for protection, I don't know. That wasn't too big of a deal, as it doesn't affect the camera's usability.Speaking of the waterproof enclosure: it was badly scratched as well. there was a protective film on the back of the case (where the camera's view screen goes) but no protective film on the lens cover which was so badly scratched as to make the waterproof case unusable due to inability to take pictures with all the scratches.  Whose bright idea was it to ""protect"" the back of the case but not put the same protective cover on the lens cover????? While I don't often ride in the rain, I did a ride this weekend where I missed out on some great shots due to having to stow the camera when it started raining.The handlebar mount screws are not long enough to allow for attachment to my road bike handlebars, it took 3 trips to the hardware store to find screws long enough. (5mmx30mm) incase anyone else needs to know. I'm not sure how it will work using a waterproof case but the non-waterproof mount for the camera kept shaking loose and I would have to stop and re-tighten to keep from loosing the camera and mount.I haven't tried any of the other accessories yet, but overall I am disappointed in the quality of the accessories that were the main selling point of me buying this specific product. I have already had to waste time and money finding new screws to mount the camera, (which prevented me from using it on one ride) now I have to spend even more money buying a new waterproof case (which prevented me from using it for another).  I have had the camera for two weeks and so far really haven't been able to use it for what I bought it for."
"I was really excited when I received this sports cam.  I currently use a GoPro and a few other cameras to shoot footage aboard our sailboat, and this was to be a nice addition.Right out of the box I found that the remote does not work.  It flashes when I press the buttons, but the camera does not respond.  Then I download the app for both my iPad and my Andriod Galaxy Note 3.  I could never get the iPad app to connect.  All it would tell me is that the ""preview feature"" is not available.  The Android app worked once, crashed, and then I kept getting the same message as on the iPad after that.  These two features helped sell this camera for my purposes.Other than that, the camera seems to take good video and stills.  I am pleased with the quality, but to have two features fail right out of the box is not good.  Had everything worked I would probably have rated it four stars for quality, and maybe even five when you consider the price.  I even ordered two extra batteries and an external charger before I found out that these two features were broken.  Now I'm thinking I'll need to cancel that order and send this camera back.Update: After spending the weekend with this camera, I have found twice that it has crashed when connected to a PC to transfer files.  I had to disconnect it, pull the battery, then connect again.  It has worked the second attempt after the crashes.  I have also found that the sound quality is too low to be usable.  Little to no high-frequency response, so the sound is always muffled.  The tests that I have done are with the camera out of the case, so that was not the issue.  Also to note is that the camera loses its date and time information every time you replace the battery.  Really annoying.I contacted the seller regarding the apps not connecting through Wifi, and was responded to quickly with an alternate suggestion.  I downloaded both for my iPad and my Andriod phone.  The Android phone app would not connect.  The iPad app worked, although I could not successfully download any videos to the iPad.The only thing I will be able to use this camera for us clipping onto our boat rigging to video while underway.  In that case, audio is not needed.  It seems that the best video is produced when you are in 1080p at 60 fps.  The 4K mode is much more stuttery than it should be for 25 fps.  The 2.7k mode seems to work okay, but for 60 fps, you need to stick to 1080p.My experience and other equipment: I own a DSLR, a GoPro Hero, several Canon video cameras, a high-end PC where I do my editing and uploading to Youtube where I have had several channels, one of which I started 10 years ago.  Not new to videoing and by trade I have been an EE for the past 20 years.Conclusion: Would I recommend this camera to a friend?  No, not if I wanted to keep the friend.  I will hang on to it because it was so cheap, and I will use it for fill in shots, but nothing more.  There are several other inexpensive 4k cameras out there that cost around $20 more, and they have a faster chipset and a better light sensor in them.  I've seen the tests, and the other cameras works many times better than this one."
The buttons and functions are a bit of a pain to have to cycle through stuff. But the quality of the pictures and videos is very good
The sound issue is fine at lower speeds like for bicycle riding or a motorcycle through town but not great at higher speeds 55 mph or higher or while using the waterproof case. The customer service however is excellent and defiantly deserves another star. Video quality is good for the price.
"We got snorkels for Christmas with Go-Pro mounts on them so we thought we'd buy this camera as it seemed to get good reviews. Bad decision. First, my kids used it outside to make little videos with friends and it worked fine...until it overheated and stopped responding to any buttons!  It wouldn't work at all until we removed the battery, let it cool down and tried again. They actually didn't tell me about the problem until we took it to the beach for our first snorkeling adventure. Got it all set up in the case (which didn't quite seem to close right, so both my husband and I were a bit skeptical of it working properly), took it out on the reef and then the buttons stopped working again! Went back to shore, took it out of the case and the camera was SO hot! Had to remove the battery to get it to turn off, let it cool down, put in a different battery and tried again. Same deal. The heat from the camera actually seemed to create some sort of condensation/fog inside the case so we finally just gave up and left it on the beach while we enjoyed the reef without digital memories. :-/I would definitely NOT recommend this camera; do yourself a favor and pay the extra few bucks for something much more substantial and durable.UPDATE:I’ve upgraded my review as I was contacted by the company and offered a full refund, despite it being past the proper return window. I appreciate the company’s willingness to stand behind their products. Since others have enjoyed them quite a bit, perhaps we just got a dud. I’d be willing to try another of their products again in the future!"
"I purchased the camara Oct. 23rd 2024  Each time after riding I remove the camera, and reattach camera to the bicycle mount. On November 29th 2024 when riding the mount broke as you can see in photo . this is made out of plastic. Cheap material!! what's next ?"
"Some problems with this cheapen the entire device. Getting straight to the points, the waterproof case is crap, the buttons on it don't work. On examining the buttons, I can see on two of them that don't work the plungers are just a touch shorter than the others, maybe a millimieter or less, but enough that the plungers can't properly press the buttons on the camera itself. To prove this, I slid a small piece of folded paper inbetween the camera and the corresponding buttons that didn't work to account for the short plunger and viola, the buttons would now work while inside the case. So that might be a work around but I think it's an unacceptable solution. Next is the ""EZ iCam"" android app - TOTAL crap, doesn't work. Phone says its connected, cam changes from waiting for wifi to wifi ready but no difference on the app - there is no control at all. Usually it would connect without asking for a wifi password but a couple times I could get it to prompt (but can't remember how I made that happen) but still no difference. The camera is usable outside of these problems. I don't have a 'real' gopro to compare it to, but my son who has one (but is only 12) is not impressed with it. However, the low price is the only thing keeping it in the competition, because you can buy 2, 3 or 4 of these over a single gopro. Overall, if you can live without the wifi and are willing to dink with the case if your buttons suck then I'd say its a good choice to start with instead of a several hundred dollar gopro, especially if you are planning to use it for any gnarley stuff that risks damaging your cam. The wrist remote is probably an okay substitute for app based control, but there's no feedback for you to know if you are really controlling it without looking at the camera itself. If you get it, I'd recommend getting the 3 battery plus charger you can find on Amazon for only about $17, which would arm you with 5 batteries total. Hope this review helps!"
"The unit fogged up in the case which made it hard and the battery length could of been better. For what it was, it was bad besides that."
"I had high hopes for this little camera, but the video quality was poor. When I compared the videos with what I took on my phone, it wasn't even close."
"I downloaded the app, and it does not connect to the camera. They decided to use Wi-Fi, like it's a network printer instead of Bluetooth to connect to the phone. It failed. I can't understand why. So far, as a stand-alone camera that requires either removing the or plugging into the computer with a USB C cable. I'm debating on how important the phone connection is before keeping or returning it."
"the video and picture quality were as expected. The problems I had with this camera ultimately made me return it.1. the most important one of all. if I took 10 videos driving in 1 day, 4 of them were not viewable and claimed corrupted to my pc and phone unable to view them. regardless of the cameras intended use, I assume every owner wants to have access to their pictures and videos. This one used for my dash cam and completely useless when I need to retrieve a video is just not going to cut it.2. the app is buggy and connection was an issue. having to close and reopen the app to get the connection process to finish. afterward the videos would not all play or open. once again useless.3. the user interface on the camera leaves much to be disired. Its not intuitive and leaves you better off using the buggy app.4. the battery life is horrible. the camera produces alot of heat without a battery using just usb c power supply.for my desired use it failed miserably"
"I am changing my review from 1 star to 3 stars from the below that I originally wrote becuase I found that installing Quicktime player worked to download videos and they are great videos.  However, the 4k is useless, it freezes the camera and you have to turn off/on to get it to work. I eventually just switched to 1080p 60fps and the videos are of good quality. You essentially get what you pay for.I would like to give this a better rating but I have been unable to view my videos clearly after making them. I watch them on the camera itself and they look great but when I try to download them or watch them on an external source I always run into an issue. I first tried by hooking a micro USB from the camera to my laptop and the drivers failed on its attempt to install.  So then I downloaded the app on my tablet (new Samsung s2) and connected to the camera via WiFi. When I watch the videos they are very choppy and do not play through as I see them when I watch on the camera itself. Then I decided to download one of the videos on the tablet instead of connecting to it by WiFi, which takes forever and also did not work. The video play back was much crisper compared to the WiFi video however it began trying to load every few seconds and would ultimately stop playing. I also tried all of this on my smartphone (note 5) and received the same results. Also when I would go to the gallery on my tablet the video would be there but would fail to play when clicked, coming up with an error message. The last and final thing I have tried is plugging the SD card into my laptop. When I open it, you see a videos and pictures folder, I click on videos and all the videos I have made are there but also won't play at all.  Becuase of this frustration I have to rate it accordingly."
"We never had an opportunity to use the camera as it was ruined on our first attempt.  My family took a trip to Hawaii, and this camera was purchased to record our snorkeling adventures underwater.  Because I did not wish to mount the camera to a grip, carry a tripod, or hold the camera while snorkeling, I elected to strap the camera to my wrist and jump into the water.While common sense would direct me to understand that the two slits in the clear, rubber-sealed back was not waterproof, my mind was under the impression (at the moment of trying to get ready to snorkel) that both CLEAR, RUBBER-SEALED backings to the waterproof box were, indeed, waterproof.  I saw the clear, sturdy back that sealed firmly to the main waterproof box and thought I was good.Both clear backs that connect to the waterproof box/housing are NOT waterproof.  Only one is waterproof.  With the strap inserted into the back, it wasn't as obvious to me when preparing to jump into the water.  I simply grabbed it, put the back on, sealed it shut, and jumped in.The box immediately filled with saltwater, and the camera was immediately ruined.  We took no underwater shots while in Hawaii.The ONLY clear backing that is waterproof is the solid one that you will need to use a mount with.We planned ahead and purchased this camera 3.5 months before we left, which means I cannot return it, so we now have a box full of accessories and a camera that we cannot use."
I purchased the camera for YouTube content creating and it works but the video quality is not that great. I wanted to use 1080p60 but it almost looks like it’s lower than 720 so I had to up to 4k30 but I lose out on the fps. 4k image looks more like 1080 resolution but since this camera is pretty inexpensive I would say you get what you pay for.
"THIS IS THE MOST DETAILED AND HONEST REVIEW IN THE WHOLE SOLAR SYSTEM!!! TRUST EVERYTHING I SAY! I DID NOT GET A DEFECTED ONE! Okay, I bet everyone that is reading my review right now, came to this product because of the 4 star 5,000+ reviews this camera has. Well, those that gave the camera 5 stars have really low expectations and don't know what a good action camera is. This is as bootleg and cheap of an alternate GoPro as it gets. You know what, I'm gonna just jump right into the pros and cons:PROS:1) It is small and portable (but so is every other action camera)2) The remote is very responsive and comes with custom bands3) Includes a lot of accessories (only mounts though. No chest strap, head strap, selfie stick, etc.)4) It is $230 cheaper than a GoPro5) It takes videos and pictures6) Case is watertightCONS:1) It is $230 cheaper than a GoPro. You get what you pay for (which is basically a piece of trash)2) The lighting must be perfecto. If it is a little dark then it exaggerates it into looking like it's midnight.3) The case and camera are both made of plastic4) THIS DOES NOT HAVE SLOW MOTION!!5) THIS DOES NOT HAVE TIME LAPSE! (it says it does, but it ain't video time lapse)6) The 4k setting is just about as useful as a lead pencil that ran out of lead (25fps, which is laggy and crappy)7) THE BATTERY LIFE IS REALLY TERRIBLE!! IT DOESN'T LAST LONGER THAN 40 MINUTES EVEN AFTER A FULL CHARGE!!8) THE CAMERA QUALITY IS TERRIBLE!!9) DON'T TRUST THIS!!! BELIEVE THE OTHER BAD REVIEWS!!OVERALL:Just save up your birthday and Christmas money and get a job, and then buy a GoPro or a YI+ (trust me, they are AMAZING). And if not, then get the YI lite action camera ($99). I just use the AKASO as a paperweight."
"The actual footage is decent and fine other than the fact that it's a very skinny FOV. It's not a 360 lol. Probably only 75° FOV in front of you. I tried using the glue on mount to get the camera on my helmet but there's no flat spot anywhere on the helmet, so the glue mount instantly fell off. I then resigned myself to drilling a whole through the chin of my helmet to get the mount on there. Several hours later and 3 trips to home depot, i got the thing mounted on my chin very securely but the camera doesn't pivot up high enough to show the road. Right now I'm just recording my speedometer and my tank. It's been less than fun experience. Too difficult to mount to my helmet. I used all the extensions provided and will buy another one to make it work right. Once i get this thing recording right I'll include all the hours and extra costs in my review."
"This camera was only slightly better than a $40 option I also tried.  The screen was very clear, but the recorded video had horizontal lines on it making it nearly unusable.  The audio quality was terrible and the WiFi connectivity was useless due to lag and dropout at a short range (30ft).Not waterproof at all, just has a waterproof case.  Also, the battery compartment is very difficult to access and not hinged.  If you drop this outdoors, it could easily get lost and render the camera useless.  You have to have a screwdriver to get the battery lid open, unless you have long (and strong) fingernails.The camera came on a base that was glued to the box and I destroyed the box getting it off.  Not sure if that base was intended to be used again, but they do have some impressive glue on that particular feature.  It was more of an annoyance for me.  Pass on this unit and get a better quality action camera."
"Comes with a wide variety of attachments and extra pieces likes velcro, a steel cable, mounts, etc.It might be a little hard to get used to the menus but overall the navigation is not complex. The quality is mediocre at best, I wouldn't recommend it for action footage specially, as the image stabilization is basically non existant"
"I really liked this camera.  It took some getting used to, but we used it for skiing and snowboarding and in my opinion the camera quality was great!  The sound however was lost a bit, maybe being in the case, but it was always scratching, unless we were not moving.  We took it to a creek across the street and got some great under water video of crawfish, minnows and other under water creatures.  Again the sound does not come out the best, but the under water video and pictures were great.  This is about 6 months into owning the camera, the new had our first issue with it not turning on.  I went online and found some information, and was able to get it to reset.  We took it on a trip to do some cliff jumping, and it worked great again.  The camera did not malfunction and we got some great out of, under and in water camera views, sound not that great, but camera quality was awesome.  We did have some fogging issues since the camera runs hot and the weather was drastically different in the water and in the snow, but we pushed through those small issues.  Then the small piece holding the battery in, cracked, so it was a pain to get the battery in and out.  And at about month 9, the camera would no longer turn on and I could not get it to reset.  For the money I paid, I think we got our monies worth, but would have preferred to have it last a bit longer.  I will most likely buy another one for the price and see how it works, since two at regular price is still cheaper than some others for 1.  All in all, I liked the camera."
"The entire controls were programmed with too many or unnatural functions coded to buttons for my learning curve. The snap button Didn't take Pic it changed modes. The zoom button changed another mode. Confusing to use while trying to get underwater shots while snorkeling. Day 1 and 2 of use I managed to capture some pics but quality was questionable. Some pics weren't in focus. Day 3 it didn't capture anything shot.  Didn't like the only instructions had to be downloaded. And when I used app to view downloaded pics, the download was to app not to phone and you couldn't see the photos only connected via wifi. No supplied SD card a negative. Couldn't use until I bought one, mind you I was in Belize , a foreign country to me. On the good side, the case was waterproof. And came with enough adapters to strap it about anywhere."
"The listing of the product claims the camera has ""stabilization"", but there's no...not for EK7000.  It's literally not usable for me, because it's so shaky.  :("
"So far. I do reserve the right to come back and trash it if it does not continue to do a great job. I was pleasantly surprised to see the quality of the video for such a reasonable price. IMHO I could have probably found one that do better but I don't think you can beat this for the money you'll pay. Like other modern devices it's needs to have a way to update the firmware, but it had trouble installing windows 7 device drivers so maybe it does have a way. Because of this I'd rather give it a 4.5. It better than a 4.2nd review, took it 4 wheeling yesterday, always a good test, and here are the results.The video I got was good except for one thing. I used the water proof case, lots of water on my trails, And even though I cleaned and cleaned on the glass covering the lens and the lens itself, there was a blurry spot, big enough to be significant, right in the middle of the picture. I had noticed this before but figured it was a finger print. It was not, and I cannot find a defect int he glass. Without the case there is no blurry spot. I don't know if this is normal but i'll contact the manufacturer. .5 demerits#2 This is probably a battery issue, but the camera stopped on it own after about 20 minutes. I never noticed it at the time but later one, I saw that it recorded about 8 gb of action in 2 files. I restarted it and it recorded one more 4 gb segment and never restarted. I missed some really good action. When I checked it, the battery was pretty much gone. That's another demerit I think,#3 I tried recording in different modes to get more time/ GB . At the lowest setting of 720 (30 fps) it still records at 120 fps and uses double the bit rate as 1080 so in effect uses more space at 720 than it does at 1080 120 fps. This makes no sense to me. another -1#4 I could use a battery extender but not with the water proof case which is no good anyway because of the blur. another -.5Net result, While thinking I had a 4.5, I've downgraded it to a 2.5 but still giving it a three just to be nice.Next review -- Downgraded again ... No tech support, you are on your own baby. It's going back next week.Image attached is but one of the issues I'm having. I actually took 2 pics with the camera, one in and one out of the waterproof enclosure. This is the one inside the enclosure, the other had no blurry area at all."
"the video quality is decent.  the issue is the sync and download time.  I have several short videos, no more than 9 minutes each.  once you contact and sync your phone, that 9 minutes clips take 18 minutes each to download.  during this time, you cannot do anything with your phone, or the download stops.  I don't have a reference point from GoPro, but I would hope there is a back-end sync that reduces this time."
"Do some research before buying this cam.I bought this cam to mount on my JetSki. What I later learned is, thr bazillion clips, mounts and adjustments needed to get a decent continuos anngle is simply a hassle ..AccessoriesThis kit comes with a host of extra adapters, includes a handle bar mount -nice touch. There is also a remote for starting and stopping video or for snapping pics (includes arm band straps.Image QualityMost reviews state the videos from the Akaso EK7000 are actually scaled up to 4K at 30tps. My images were just ok. 1080p at 60fps gave the best results. 720p/120fps were noticeably grainy. Supposedly for slow motion shots -mehImage stabilizationThis cam has no image stabilization which is something I overlooked.Battery LifeThis cam comes with two batteries, theya re charged from the camera and it takes a while. I got about 60mins of video, with the back display off. Enabling the cameras wifi, crushes battery life to about 20mins. Transferring photos to your phone drains the battery faster.  I find setting the screen timeout to 1 minute helps battery life.App / SoftwareThe recommended iSmart Dv app for iOS (over wifi) is basic and half works. I'm using an iPhone 6 (iOS 10.3.1) and the app crashes when accessing the camera settings, so I can't adjust the cam remotely. Trying 15 other apps didn't help -this category is loaded with knock-off apps and cameras that work sub-par.Bottom LineIf your looking for a down and dirty average GoPro knock off for watersports, and don't care about image quality (for average FB or YouTube) this camera and others like it will be fine.Give the 36OFly a look. It's water proof with no special case, and has built in memory up to 64GB -no microSD cards."
"TLDR: Upscaled 4K garbage, with a misleading item description, and lack of full, advertised functionality. Buy a more expensive camera or search far and wide for a good 1080p one. These 4K ones are unacceptable.= = =I do stock footage to earn my keep and cheap action cameras help save on overhead and are usually reliable. You can get clean video with a 1080p action camera without paying the higher prices of other 4K action cameras. I brought one in 2016 that was 1080p wifi ""hd"" camera. It was fine but I didn't know how fine until I brought this junk.First off, I think some of these 4-5 star reviews are NOT being 100% truthful and are unaware of how poorly made this camera is. This camera is 4K-upscaled-garbage. It is NOT true 4K. The image and picture quality for video is unacceptable. I'm not even going to go into sound quality (you shouldn't use action cameras for sound anyway). I attached 2 screenshots from a driving instructional stock footage session I shot a few weeks ago. One is from the camera I brought in 2016 (1080p); and one is from the ""4K"" camera I brought and used yesterday. I'm sure you can see the difference, despite the angle and different models.I also want to make sure you know that the ""wide angle"" field of view (FOV) is not consistent over the 4 different video size and fps settings. You can't get the 170 degree FOV, unless you use the ""2.7K 30Fps video"" setting, and ONLY this setting. Yes, that's right. The 4K, 1080p and 720p settings do NOT have the 170 degree, wide-angle FOV that the camera is supposed to have—or as advertised.Do NOT buy this camera. It is literally 480p image quality upscaled to 4K. What does ""upscaled"" mean? It means they—whomever is making these things—are taking small images (like 854x480p) and resizing it to 4K dimensions (3840x2160). If you want 4K, really check to make sure it isn't upscaled, which may be more expensive, or you might get lucky, like I did in 2016, and find that gem of a camera with true 1080p, if you do not require 4K image quality for video. Good luck."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            August 2022, update: (DOWNGRADED TO THREE STARS) I have questions about setting TIME LAPSE intervals and LOOPING VIDEO settings. I've asked the seller for help and she keeps telling me how to set the DELAYED PHOTO, even when I specify TIME LAPSE IN CAPS LIKE THIS and not DELAYED PHOTO to make it more clear. It's been super frustrating. I'm sending the camera back and trying a different model. I hope that will help. :)June 2022, initial review: (FOUR STARS) Actually really happy with the camera. Good video/photo quality. I'm returning and getting a replacement because both photo and video have two fuzzy dots dead center on screen. I can see them on the small display on the back of the camera so initially I wondered if they had something to do with focus or exposure since they're right in the middle of the screen. But they show up in videos and photos. Yes I've cleaned and double cleaned the lens, and no, it's not on the waterproof case. :)  Side note: the back door of the waterproof case did have a very small scuff/scratch on it so I did wonder if the camera was not brand new. Looking forward to the replacement. Another side note: really disappointed in battery life.  *researching extending that and/or buying more batteries*"
It sank! Kayaking with it it sank. In lake Hartwell. In it's waterproof case and working too. But it sank! I wonder if the go pro floats?
"I wanted this thing to work. $50 something, what a deal! No, it is not. Decent picture only on "" 4k mode"". Still like VHS of late. Stabilization is a joke. Picture jerks.. WIFI is not usable. If you're lucky to make it work, you might not find anything in the download folder. I could not. It takes 1 min to download 1 min video. But ACASO folder on my Android smartphone was still empty.  SD cards. For whatever reason, the device rejected all my SD cards (from 16GB to 256GB, formatted in FAT32). They were perfectly working in other devices.  The trick here is to format these cards using this camera, just follow instructions. Remote was working fine. I will retest the camera one more time and update if I see anything positive. But for now it is not even close to GoPro."
"The pictures and videos taken were darker than expected. I'm not sure if I needed to adjust anything for pictures or videos with better lighting, but I'm still testing it. Annoyed that it came with no worded manual, just picture instructions that were vague."
"I received a replacement after the first camera stopped working after one use. I made sure the batteries were charged but on the second day of usage, I would turn the camera on but the screen would be black and I was not able to turn the camera off unless I took the battery out. I followed the directions on the troubleshooting page but the camera still doesn’t worked. I used it for 3 hours the first day. The camera quality is decent. Not GoPro quality but still acceptable. I haven’t seen many reviews where the camera started working so maybe it’s just a me problem."
"Camera itself is amazing, but the camera, while officially supports 4k, does not support 4k while on loop mode. Why?Also,the Android app does not seem to be the best, to say the least."
Comes with lots of knick-knacks to mounting but the image quality is not very good and I have not been able to get my phone to connect to the wifi on the unit
"When I got the box the camera was screwed in so tight that it was extremely hard to release. The Wi-Fi keeps disconnecting & I get a reconnecting message while in in use. It has two batterys which is nice, but they take 5 hours to charge, so guess you have to be charging one while using the other, but a battery lasts 90 minutes to 2 hours so you would need 3 batterys to have continuous play with a double battery charger, and have to switch batterys every 90 minutes, if you plug the camera into a power source you can have continuous play so you could buy a small external charger & plug it into the camera for continuous play, you can also plug it in at home & use it for a security camera. The camera itself is not as good as my I-phone camera or a $120 dollar range cannon, Nikon or other competitive cameras. It is an average camera, cheaper by comparison. The listing price was $119 dollars on sale for $58 dollars and it is definitely not a $119 dollar quality camera. The software works but is primitive or old fashion. It is median user friendly to learn to use. ""THEY ALSO GIVE A GIFT FOT GIVING THEM A FIVE STAR RATING IF YOU TAKE A SCREEN SHOT OF YOUR REVIEW & SEND IT TO THEIR WEB SITE"" so I would not trust any five star reviews you see here, they are in effect paying people to give good reviews with gifts. The camera does not zoom so everything appears really small in the picture. It meets the minimum requirements for their advertisement, but is nothing exceptional. I'am not going to lie to get a free mystery gift from them which could be a cleaning cloth ????"
"I bought this on a lark and I can say that it's pretty unimpressive. I've tried using it mounted on my bike, and also handheld, and the picture quality is pretty blurry, oversaturated, and generally ugly. The attached is from 4K30fps with EIS enabled. I've mounted my cellphone and it produces a better picture quality with less shaky cam than this camera. Very disappointed."
"It's a decent little camera with a lot of accessories, but almost zero instructions included. It does give link to YouTube video which is a little helpful but would be nice if included instructions and actual manual. Without Internet access impossible to set up"
"regular meant-to-be-used as webcams have become so over priced, and I also plan to take it with me on trips, etc to take pictures for my blog.First of all, lets review the packaging. I had read that there were mounts and accessories included but hadn't really paid attention to the amount of stuff that came with. I was pleasantly surprised by the selections of mounts and straps that came with! Everything works really well. However one out of two of the batteries sent doesn't charge or work at all, which is a bummer.Now I forgot to buy an SD card so I haven't been able to use the camera feature on it yet, however I've messed around with the phone app you can get for it and I get the feeling the pictures it takes are very nice.On to the main reason this was purchased; webcam-usage. The couple of times I've managed to get it to work the video quality was on point. It was easy to set up plug-and-play style and registered on my Messenger almost immediately. However now I can't quite see to get the usb cord plugged into the camera without some force (which I refuse to do.) I'm hoping the cord they sent me is just defunct, I really hate USB-A for this reason. I haven't gone out to buy another cord and see if that is in fact the issue or not.I'm really hoping I can get the technical bugs worked out because I don't have the time needed to return the camera and wait to replace a new one, as I'm using this for work and have meetings that I have to be present for."
"The camera does not have a functional clock.  I discovered this after 90 days and cannot return the camera.  I was offered a 10% discount on a new one.  I have no desire to spend more money with Akaso.  A clock (RTC) is a basic function on a digital camera for over 20 years.  Their email to me:Sophie (AKASO)Oct 31, 2024, 7:22 AM EDTDear customer,Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience regarding your camera model not having a built-in RTC (Real-Time Clock), which means it cannot retain timestamps. Unfortunately, this issue cannot be resolved through a firmware upgrade.However, we would like to inform you that our latest EK7000 model does support this feature. If you're interested in purchasing it, we would be happy to offer you a 10% discount.Please let us know if you have any further questions or if you would like to proceed with the purchase.Best regards,Sophie"
"Bought it for the time lapse option, but only goes up to 60 seconds between photos"
"After purchased reading all the good reviews I decided to purchased this one. First one came defective so I returned it and gave it another chance. Second one came, I tested it at my house, it looks Okay. Took it with me to Cancun, well  It didnt exactly ruined my trip but I wasn't satisfied at all.Here's my evaluation:Pros:-Small, cheap and exactly same size so can be used with gopro gears.-Easy to use: front button is on/off and to switch between modes (take pics, record, burst etc), side button is for up/down in settings. Down button is also to turn on your wifi when you connect with your phone. Top button is to take pic/record. Come with instructions and a lot of accessories but i dont need any of them execpt for the water proof housing.-Recording quality isn't too bad, you just have to stay very still and move really slow because it does take couple seconds to focus-Sound quality is very good even with the waterproof housing.Cons:-For pictures, you have to hold the camera REALLY REALLY still in order to get a decent pic. Scenery pics looks okay but pictures with people the skin tone came out really unreal. I also find that it takes better pic closeup (my drink) than scenery or people.-And at some point the water got into the housing and made a bubble there so we couldnt use it for awhile. (pic)-Does not deal well with low light such as in the shade or indoor.-Can only charge one battery at the time thru the camcorder so with 2 batteries maybe you need to buy the battery charger.-The app does not work very well with my S6 egde."
"The good:• Extremely low price• WiFi remote control works• Lots of accessories included• Excellent display• Options for timelapse photo 2-60 sec• Built-in playback on LCD screen: Push the up-arrow on the right side of the camera• Many video and still photo resolutions• Easy to adjust settings once you figure out how it works (poor manual)• Can charge the battery and record at the same time• Can use 64 GB class 10 cards despite the manual says 32 GB is maximumThe bad:• Poor camera quality, still photos are not even the same quality as the oldest GoPro with 5 MP images. Don't expect smartphone quality images.• Stills photos have too much electronic sharpening, i.e. too pronounced edges on objects. You are better off shooting 4K video and down-sample those images to 33%, i.e. photos are OK at 720x1280 pixels.• Poor low-light performance with lots of image noise• Very rudimentary instruction manual, you have to experiment to find out how it works• Outdated MJPEG-mov format for video (not modern MP4) means pronounced 8-pixel squares, and you cannot play the videos on iOS without conversion. Easy to do conversion on a Mac: Right-click on the file>Services>Encode Selected Video Files. This will not keep the 4K resolution, though, but convert the video to 1080x1920 pixels. If you want 4K you have to use iMovie.Just like on the GoPros, the pictures have a strong fisheye lens effect, which you can remove in Photoshop (though it takes quite some time to do the conversion if you want to do it for videos).Final verdict: Bang for the buck, but AKASO should consider raising the price to $100 and put a better camera in the next version."
"Still have not heard back from them - dropped to 2 stars...I'll be returning this camera to Amazon, so why did I give it 3 stars instead of 1?I guess that at the top of the list is the video quality; is it as good as the GoPro? I don't know, I don't own a GoPro yet, but I can say the video quality was quite good.  I tested both the 1080p and the 2.7k and based on the video quality - thumbs up!Sorry, I did not test the 4k.Packaging and the included accessories are more than one would expect in a budget camera, so again - thumbs up!2 batteries - thumbs up!Great photo quality as well and the ""fit and finish"" of the camera itself was great; did not look or feel ""cheap"". - thumbs up!Opening the battery cover required a small screw driver to pry it open - could be considered a good thing, but I'm going to deduct a bit for it.During my test, I was surprised to find that the camera created new video files every 2.32 GB.  Since this is my first ""Sports Action"" Camera, I'm not sure if that's normal or not, but I'm hoping it isn't - thumbs down.The clincher was the fact that the camera locked up just after the 4th clip which stopped by itself at 39.5 MB.The red light on top of the camera lit up and all buttons ceased to function - I couldn't turn it off, turn it on, switch modes, nothing, nada!Emailed the company and told them what happened - it's been a about 3hrs and I have not heard back from them.Some of you might feel I'm being impatient, but if a company is asking for my review and asking me to contact them if I'm not happy, I expect them to be monitoring that email address 24/7 and jumping on them instantly!I finally decided to remove the battery and the camera seems to be functioning again.Cool, it may never lock up again, but since I can afford to buy a better camera, I'm not interested in taking that chance.So as my title suggests;If you absolutely can't afford more, then go for it... the video quality is great and if it locks up, just pop out the battery to reset and keep going!Otherwise, pass."
"I have used this for a week now and noticed the batteries are quick to charge but last less than an hour at times.  The video captured is great but the app ( when connect to your cell via wifi) seems to disconnect and you loose your recordings or downloads.  And a 2 minute video can take up to 10 minutes to transfer to your cell but the camera disconnects at 9 mins and 50 seconds.  Terrible.  I even tried adjusting camera sleep and shut off settings to 0. And still  had the same outcome. It does come with alot of add ons in the box  and appears sturdy like its major competitor.  I will be returning this one because of the overheating issues, wifi downloading issues and low battery life."
"You get what you pay for in this case. I actually really like it. It takes really nice photos, and is waterproof (I tested it for an hour playing around in about 5 feet of water in a lake). I have two major complaints though.1.) The app is absolutely horrible. I had to google how to connect it to my internet, which may just be me honestly, but once I got it all set up with the app it only runs for about a couple minutes before it crashes and shuts the app down. You can’t save or delete more than one photo at a time or it crashes the app as well. It makes it kind of a huge pain.2.) The camera will just spontaneously shut down, but not off, and make a high pitch whistle. It does this often and the only remedy seems to be taking the battery out for a hard reset. This wouldn’t be that troublesome but it kept doing it while I was in the lake and required me to take the waterproof casing off. If I was doing something where I couldn’t stop and take the battery out and then missed capturing the moment I would be upset.For me it’s worth it. It’s a fun thing that I can take and try to get some photos in instances where I don’t want to risk the life of my smart phone. It’s something I wouldn’t be upset if I accidentally dropped it off a cliff.Again it definitely is waterproof with the case, and takes great wide angle photos."
"First of all, the camera quality is much lower than my expectations. And my expectations were low. I went into this just hoping to get decent quality to record videos. The battery life is decent. It doesn't last much more than an hour. Also it's very grainy it looks super low res on big screens, TVs etc.Here's a big issue. The camera only records for around 10 minutes. After that, it stops and starts recording again, likes it's a damn dash cam or something. But the problem is, it leaves like 4 second chunks out of the clips. So say im filming for action purposes. Well you could lose big moments in your footage because the camera isn't stopping and starting the recording seamlessly. Also for some reason, whenever it starts recording, the mic on the camera pops. So at the beginning of every clip, there a loud pop. So you have to cut that waveform out in post. It's ridiculous. This thing is practically a toy. Do not purchase this. This is my 2nd time trying to post this review and it being denied. IDK whats going on here."
"Bought this for my Mammoth trip this year and used it extensively for the long holiday weekend. This product delivered on the features and value, but not performance in comparison to a GoPro (which I also own). The best thing about the camera is the cost and that it comes with plenty of accessory mounts. Beyond that, The recording is decent to good, but not great. Slightly grainy images with mediocre low light performance. Without image stabilization, the video recordings need some amount of post production efforts to make it presentable. Finally, the biggest issue I have is the waterproof case. When fully closed, the camera's curved lens is pressed against the waterproof case, which causes a small blurred spot to appear on video recordings. The spot is not obvious unless you watch a moving video, and it disappears when you record without the case (and there are no visible spots or scratch on the case or lens).  This means the exact center of the image has a slight blurred spot and is not usable to record subjects with complex details (that's when the blurring becomes real obvious)--a real bummer. Upon closer examination, you can see that the blurring in the video corresponds to the place where the case and the curved lens make contact. Other than the disappointing case, at the $80 price range, this is a solid value for its performance. That said, since I did not see any other reviews complaining about the blurred spot in their videos, I think there is a chance that my particular case is defective and this is not a common issue. In any case, I took one star off because of the case issue. it is otherwise a solid product and value."
I bought this camara for my husband to put on his razor. The first trip out was going great until the battery ran dead after an hour & a half use. Luckily we had the second battery charged but it ran dead after only an hour use. We had charged the 1st battery and switched them but didn't make it an hour before going dead again. This camara is useless if the batteries don't hold charge. Very disappointed in this camara!
The description on this camera says 4x zoom but there is no setting on the camera to adjust the zoom.  After searching online and looking through the manual there is no zoom feature on this camera.  Very disappointed in the misleading description.
"It will record video, for a couple files then it just freezes up, don't know why. So you'll find out whether anything was recorded when you go to stop it and nothing happens, the screen is black. The battery is also unpredictable, maybe depending on how long it freezes up, but I've used it for about 30 minutes before and it is almost dead, and other times for 30 minutes and it's only 1/3 empty.The video does not look 4k, it says it is but it looks barely 1080p quality. The video is saved in a .mov container, as JPEG video, and AAC LC audio, so maybe it's the JPEG compression video making it look so bad.Also annoying is if you remove the battery, you have to set the date and time again.If it worked more consistently it might be worth it at $170 but not if it sort of works.Update: Getting a faster sdcard has stopped the crashes, was using a U1 before, and a U3 now. Battery seems to be better now that it isn't crashing. Up to 3 stars now."
"Image quality of videos is poor, so is the sound. I liked all accessories it came with but that's about it."
"Just tested this camera over the last weekend while riding ATV trails with my family.  What i've found so far does not impress me as much as the majority of the reviews seem to indicate.- Video quality is decent at 1080p 60.  I'm not convinced this is a 4k camera though. Video quality at 4k does not seem as good as it should be for that resolution (I have watched it on LG OLED65B6P 4K TV).  I have seen enough 4k content to know what 4k looks like and this does not meet those standards.- Battery life is atrocious, both of mine totaled to a cumulative 1 hour and 17 minutes recording at 1080p 60, on fresh charges.  (Note: When i changed batteries the time and date settings reset)- The remote is a nice touch and for the most part works well.  I had to vigilantly check that the camera was recording after having missed several great sections of trail because the camera never started to record.  I believe this was a user error though requiring two presses to wake it up and then start recording.- Sound from the mic is pretty much non existent, you will get muffled sound from the loudest noises while in the waterproof case.  While out of the case the sound is only little better.  Noises that should be easy to pick up sound distant and quiet.- The value this offers seems to be decent for what you get, but there are much better cameras out there and there are also a few cheaper ones offering the same features.I will keep using this one but, i will connect it to a large battery pack to be able to achieve continuous use while i record.  This is the only way I see to allow me to actually fill up my 64gb micro SD card i purchased specifically for this camera.  I will also look into getting an exterior mic that i can clip to my helmet, then maybe ill actually be able to hear the conversations i have with other riders.Hope this helped somebody!"
The only bad thing is when I went to use it underwater it freezes up
"Well, here it is...I bought this little camera with hopes that I might not have to spend four times what I paid for this one and get  a GoPro. At first glance, the camera, packaging, and all the components seemed on point and I was really excited to get started shooting video with this product. That's when the death spiral into buyers depression started to set in. From the moment I first put the battery in, I knew there was trouble on the horizon. At first, the camera didn't want to turn on, but after multiple frantic attempts, it magically powered up...whew!  The instructions were as vague at best. After about three brutal hours and using both batteries trying to figure things out, I decided to shoot that first ""all magical"" first video. I started up the camera, got into my car (for an over-the-road shot), and hit record. Everything seemed good, until about two and a half minutes in and the camera appeared to have shut off, which it did. I pulled off the road to investigate the issue, and reached for the camera and it was REALLY HOT!  The unit had most certainly shut itself down, and I removed the battery, and that was quite obviously the heat source since I could barely hold it upon removal. At this point, I wasn't sure if I should have had a frontal lobotomy or a bottle in front of me since I was soo pissed!Anyway, that's that. Lets talk about the app the suggest you download; once downloaded, you need to connect you phone to the camera via wifi and the app will control the cameras functions from there. This too had a bunch of issues: the wifi does not stay connected, and once that connection is closed, the camera stops, just freaking stops. Some of the videos pixelate during the recording, not sure if it's due to the camera heating up or what. And, the camera will heat up even quicker if it is inside the waterproof case since there is no way to ventilate that enclosure.Should have prolly spent the extra $$ on a GoPro."
"So I ordered this camera thinking it was basically the same as the go pro, as it states all the stats. Truth is, It is not very user friendly, It takes alright video in 1080p but every now and then it will slow down the fps and you can really tell in the video. It sais it has sound so that you know when its filming or not, but it's not loud enough, mounted on my head I could barely hear it and I end up taking super long videos when I don't want to or turning it off when I want to film, That's not my main concern tho, If that was I would still give it 4 or 5 stars, the reason Im giving it 2 is because It is very poorly designed, I don't know if I just got a bad one or something but when I put it in the case and latch it, It presses the camera to far forward making the end of the lens touch the plastic case, this creates a blurry circle right in the center of the image and makes the whole video look like crap, the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars and not 1 is because at first I thought it was a manufacturing defect and that the case had an air bubble right in the center, so I emailed them and showed them the pictures and they sent me a new case. So 2 stars for customer service. But my bad on not realizing that it was just poorly designed earlier, I got the case in the mail and took a video and realized it did the exact same thing, then I took a closer look when I put it in and realized it was the lens touching the plastic. Don't buy it, save up and get a go pro, don't settle for this piece of shi!. As you can see in the photo, (that I cropped, it doesn't actually take pictures like that.) if you look at his leg its all blurry and smudged, ruins the whole thing."
"The short version is that when you buy a sports camera that costs 1/4 or less of the price of competing brands, do not expect to get an equivalent product. For me this camera's shortcomings (see below) are a dealbreaker and I am returning it, but everyone's uses and preferences are different so it may do the job well enough for some.First the good: nice image quality, some people write that this camera does not provide ""true"" 4K video but this will be close enough for just about anyone; comes with a bunch of helpful (and some redundant) accessories; decent enough iPhone app.Now the bad: terrible battery life - I managed to record maybe 5 minutes of 1080 video before the camera became unresponsive. This was with both of the included batteries over multiple charges over multiple days. For me battery life this poor is a dealbreaker and the main reason for my return.Lack of image stabilization was also a problem. Most videos turned out shaky even when I was trying to hold the camera as still as possible. My understanding is that higher end cameras from more premium brands fix this via automatic stabilization.I also had a minor but frustrating issue where the camera became unresponsive and a solid red light would come on as soon as I turned it on. Akaso customer service eventually got back to me but I managed to figure out the issue first - I needed to reformat my SD memory card to fix it."
"If you are very savvy with action cams and all the nuances associated with them, then your experience may be different than mine.  Mine was not positive and I returned the item.  #1:  The directions say to scan a QR code on the side of the box to download the Ez Cam application.  No QR code on my box, so I spent way too much time inspecting the box, manual, etc., looking for it, then had to search You Tube videos for answers.  Low and behold, in small print, the box says to down load some other application Smart IVD or something like that.  So there goes 1.5 hours of my time.  Then I download the application and try to connect the camera to my mobile devices.  It takes 2-4 tries before it connects, then it asks for a password.  Again, NOTHING in the directions about this.  Back to You Tube for another 45 minutes until I find a video that  provides the password as 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0.  So 2+ hours to do what should have taken 15 minutes.Now to the operation.  I had a tough time turning the camera on in the case.  It would take pressing the button hard 4+ times before it would turn on and in some cases, I had to take it out of the case to turn it on.  The audio with the case on was bad and that is being kind.  Just not a good overall experience.  I would think these companies could hire someone to do a 5-minute You Tube tutorial, but I suspect these cameras are sold under 50 names and all have variables that would make any consistent directions impossible to provide.  After this experience, I purchased a GoPro and had it set up in 15 minutes.  If you have the time to research all the Bermuda Triangle stuff associated with these off brand action cameras, then purchase and save the money.  If your time and sanity are worth more than $100 in savings, then purchase a GoPro."
Took me a while to figure out how to use it. Finally figured out how to take pics but am unable to download them to my phone. It keeps saying no  internet connection. I do have internet and I downloaded the Akaso app. I have tried for days to transfer my pics but is still not working. None of the videos have helped or the written instructions. There is no where to call for help. Do not buy this camera. It is just too difficult to figure out. It's better to pay more and get a better one.
"After taking this camera all the way to Skjeryøy, Norway and being as cold as I have ever been in my entire life.... we saw orcas and humpback whales within 10 feet of our boat!! And guess what: the Akaso decided it didn't like the cold and died from low battery despite having full battery when we left the harbour. I only had it on for about 30 seconds total before it died.... not capturing ANY footage of that once in a lifetime experience.Others on the trip had actual go pros that lasted the whole 2+ hour trip."
It is difficult to figure out how all the part work. No good instruction.
"READ THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!!! there is a problem with this camera that has not been fixed.  Don't waste your time and money.  Its a lottery.  If you get one like I did it will ruin your trip.  Here are the problems that I had - and if you read the reviews you will see that these are common problems!!1. The camera will freeze randomly while recording.  The only way to restart is to open it up and take the battery out.  Well that sucks when you are snorkeling in the ocean.  It did this MANY times using different batteries - making sure they are fully charged, etc.2. The videos that it records - MOST of them come out as corrupted .MOV files.  Nothing can open them. They are lost.  I swam with a sea turtle today - one of the highlights of my trip.  I recorded 7 videos of it and only 1 of them would play back - all the rest were corrupted .mov files.  I have tried different SD cards.  I've tried formatting the cards.  I've tried a factory reset on my camera.  I've tried recording at different resolutions - 1080p and 4k.  All of them do this. So, basically of all my videos from my trip to hawaii I have about 1 out of 5 that are viewable.  On top of this many times i wanted to record something to notice my camera was frozen and unable to take videos.  Probably 1 of 10 videos that I would have taken were useable.  MOST OF THE POSITIVE REVIEWS WERE PAID FOR!!!!  This is a problem that Amazon needs to fix ASAP because it makes the rating system useless.One last note - I was swimming with my brother-in-law who has a gopro5.  The pictures he took were NIGHT AND DAY better than mine.  Not even close both going at 4k.  Any problems with water visibility or low light and mine looked grainy and his were beautiful.  I know that is a lot more $$ than this one - but when it doesnt even work and the quality when it does work is much less - I would say save your $$ for a GoPro."
"This camera has probably the worst audio I've ever heard, it's all garbled together and not understandable. The description states ""Built-in Electronic Image Stabilization"" but this is false as well, the camera can be as tight as can be and still video comes out looking like a blur fest."
"UPDATE: 202305- UPDATE:  I am updating this to any future people that might have this issue and stumble across this review.  This issue is solved but I want to make it clear NOT by Akaso they never responded to me.  Doing research, I found that a lot of these action cams use the same lens.  So I found one on amazon and ordered it.  Unfortunately it ships from overseas and estimated delivery was 3-4 months.  For me that was fine because the camera is unusable, but after 4 weeks it finally shipped.  When I got it, I unscrewed the original and replaced it.  I had to screw it snug using industrial type tweezers and then slowly back it out in small increments and at each increment take a picture/movie and see how blurry it was.  I used a sharpie (water based, not oil based- temp vs permanent) to make a witness mark on the metal portion of the lens (not the glass) and the rim portion of the camera body (think hour hand on a watch dial).  Using this I could determine which direction I was going and how much.  Eventually I got it to just the right amount and now everything works great (it took about minutes).  Playing around with the camera, what I found is that I didn't need to buy a new lens.  Using some industrial strength tweezers, I could have done the same thing to the original lens and gotten a workable resolution.  I am looking for another camera (gift) but it probably will not be AKASO.  Hope that helps someone.UPDATE: 202301 Camera now freezes on startup (about 1 out of 6 times), requires pulling the battery out to make it functional.  No communication from Akaso.  Bumping camera rating to 1 star.I don't usually do reviews, only if something is exceedingly good or just fails its specifications.  A little background, a few months ago I was looking for a budget action cam primarily for hiking and mountain biking.  I did my research and read a lot of reviews before I settled on this camera.  I've had this camera in use now for a couple months and I'll just give you my quick verdict (if you want more detail continue on):  VERDICT:  NOT recommended, however I think I may have gotten a lemon.The primary reason for the verdict: everything is just out of focus.  I've played with the camera settings including combinations of increasing/decreasing resolution, video quality, sharpness, angle, stabilization, and exposure but nothing seems to work.  There are some combinations that are better than others but none fix the focus.  I've even tried a factory reset option and that did not help.  The focus issue is noticeable on videos viewed on a monitor like a desktop or TV display.  The videos show sometimes grainy/artifacts but always out of focus videos.  To help explain the focus issue, if I video the room's carpet (the kind with small yarn like pieces sticking up).  It looks like one somewhat continuous smooth surface with color variations kinda like someone spilled a slushy.  If you didn't know the video was of carpet, I could see someone mistaking it for some kind of brown colored algae.  Adjusting the camera's menu sharpness from low to high (or in combination of the above params) just results in an almost cartoon like edges.  The best way I can describe it is if you've ever used one of those photo software to transform an image to something resembling a painting or watercolor look.I primarily needed a camera at the 1080p60 frames but I've tested this camera in the 2k, and 4k modes and the focus issue exists there too.  2k seems the best though.  4k you have very distinct stuttering points in the video when your moving.  Example you point it straight ahead and then turn to your left/right side.  When you view the video it looks like someone hits pause (the frame freezes briefly), and then restarts the video in the new position.  So unfortunately I cannot recommend this camera."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Even though I knew I wouldn't be able to do a SCUBA dive, there would be many snorkeling opps on our Galapagos trip: I'd better get something to capture the underwater experience for memories. Such a daunting task to make a decision in something about which I had no real experience. I immediately dismissed the idea of spending hundreds of dollars on a Go-Pro - was pleased to know that there are more budget-minded options. I thought I'd get get an Akaso, despite a few ""DON'T BUY"" warnings in Amazon. Of course, it wouldn't just be a low-cost risk if I'm not able to get any footage! The first ""problem"" was trying to get the camera off of the plastic to which it was fastened when I opened the pitifully small box (out of which poured a mind-boggling number of accessories, not of them screaming ""this is what I'm for""). YouTube didn't help, nor did a call to their ""Help"" line. Finally figured out on my own. The camera does not come with memory card, nor a half-way intelligible manual. The real test, still, is in how and whether it performs. Good news is, the camera does work, the controls (once you figure it out) are fairly simple, the quality is quite nice, and the housing did not leak. I was able to use the little tripod clip stub as a handle when I dived, and was at no time fearful that I'd drop it. First and foremost in complaints is the SIZE of the camera - it is TINY (and feels flimsy and cheap): no wonder they can sell such a high-tech gadgetry for such a low price. But the size also meant that the viewing screen is small, and coupled with the low light of the screen, it meant that you're pretty much filming ""in the dark"", sight-unseen, past a few feet of water, unless it's a bright sunny day. I also hate that you can't do playback on the camera itself (or at least it's so hidden and not intuitive that I haven't found it yet). All in all, I don't regret the purchase, but flawless it's not. Perhaps it's more suitable for non-underwater use?"
"I purchased this for last ski season but never got to use it. I finally used it for the first time this ski season this past week. All in all, it performed very well, albeit with a few notable problems.First, the good:- The video quality appears excellent. I did not record at full 4k yet, instead opting for slightly smaller files with 2560x1440 resolution. Nonetheless, the video footage captured looks very detailed and sharp, and the colors look very good; the wide dynamic range appears to work well, capturing detail in shadows as well as the bright areas on a sunny ski slope with hard shadows just as effectively as on overcast days with very little available dynamic contrast.- Wifi is a nice feature for dynamically viewing the camera's feed.- There is a very nice assortment of different mounts to help in achieving the right mounting configuration.- The files captured without any flaws that I've noticed so far; no dropped frames or other anomalies, and with no corruption of any kind preventing playback on either the camera or my computer.Now, the not-so-good:- The included pair of batteries don't last long. Additionally, one of the two batteries inflated its case on its first charge. The included charger also does not turn off the lights when the batteries have reached what I presume to be full charge. I had to simply time them, and upon jostling the charger or removal+reinsertion of the batteries, the light would then change from red to blue. The inflated battery is a safety risk, and barely fit in the camera, but since it was my only choice, I did go ahead and use it, and was able to at least get a bit more footage than if I only relied on the non-inflated battery pack.- It's a pain to start and stop the video with confidence. The included wrist strap controller has a strap that is too short to be worn over gloves or a coat, and the one that came with my set appears to be non-functional anyway. The battery was nearly dead the first time I used it, but even after swapping with a fresh, identical-type battery, the wrist strap didn't work for me at all once I was on the ski slopes; I simply left it at the hotel the remainder of my ski trip. This meant I had to remove my helmet (where I had mounted the camera) to view the screen and ensure I had successfully started the video for each run.- Photos had excessive compression or something; I only tried taking actual photographs with this camera a couple of times, but both images came out looking extremely pixelated and with visible artifacts. I would not rely on this for any sort of print-quality photos.- While I listed the wifi feature in the ""good"" list above, it was also bad, as it was a pain to use. I had hoped I'd be able to check via my phone quickly to ensure I had the camera angled correctly, but switching the wifi on to do so was so cumbersome that I didn't bother. Also, the wifi is extremely slow for transferring the video. Obviously not the ideal way to transfer the large files, but I had forgotten my card reader and figured I'd try doing it wirelessly. It took an hour to transfer about 3 GB. Obviously it's running with a pretty slow wifi protocol.- It was difficult to reliably stop and turn off the camera without looking at it. Hitting either the power or video start/stop button once only illuminates the screen. I found I had to hit the button once, then press and hold the power button again to actually succeed at turning the camera off to save battery during the ski lift rides where I didn't dare remove my helmet.- Some of the included mounts have insufficient-length screw handles, such that the screw handle itself impacted the bottom of the camera case while trying to tighten it. Also, the mount I decided to use with my helmet-mounted clip did not stay as snug in the clip as I would have expected, so there was some movement in it. Luckily it didn't cause too much jitter in my video as my helmet wasn't vibrating that much due to the shock absorption provided by my neck ;)- It would be nice if a curved mounting clip were included; I purchased one separately to affix to my helmet.- All the footage I took on my 3rd and 4th days of my trip had date modified stamps on the files for the year 2000; somehow, my settings on the camera had been lost. I don't know if it was because my batteries died too early in the day during day 2, or because perhaps I left the batteries out of the camera too long while charging both simultaneously that evening. Either way, it would be nice if the chosen date/time settings would not have been lost so easily. At least it didn't appear to lose my other settings.- The screen interface was a bit busy, and I had a little difficulty easily seeing that I'd successfully started the video recording on the first day; I mistakenly thought the constant ticking clock on the lower right was the indicator that the video was running, when it was actually another clock that is in the upper right corner. I'm not sure why the current time (what I realized was counting by, to the second, in the lower right corner) is even shown on the interface at all; it seems unnecessary and distracting.I know I have far more negatives than positives, but, other than the blown-up battery and the non-functional wrist remote, most everything is minor and, in my opinion, not a show-stopper when you're looking to buy a more budget-friendly camera such as this one. The overall price/performance is very good. Hopefully my experience with the blown up battery from the get-go and the dysfunctional remote is not common."
"I wanted to like this camera. And for somebody who isn't too particular about the video and image quality this might be fine... but I think I just expected too much at this price point... maybe. For just 50% or so more you can get a used GP5 elsewhere. It doesnt come with all the random (junk) attachments, or the remote (but the GP does feature fantastic app connectivity and virtually seamless remote shooting once it boots up and connects, whereas this camera's app is a joke).Anyway, I'll try to hit on as much as possible as quickly as possible in this review. Seems to be alot of positive reviews, but I dont understand why, because this camera is acceptable for some tasks... but I think I would have preferred fewer ""features"" with more quality in the few features left over. For someone that just wants a throwaway camera, this might suffice, but you can get something cheaper with similar features if you are going to throw your money away. This camera is at a price point where its basically more expensive than the ultra basic action cams, but it doesnt really have any increased quality. Supposedly it shoots in 4k and 1440p (no 2.7k). The only true slowmo is in 720p, which sucks all the quality out. Sadly, I'm not sure the HD is actually HD, and the 60 fps settings appear to be somewhat of a joke. While you get 60 fps technically, when you look at the frame by frame it looks more like the every other frame is sort of a copy of the previous frame, just slightly less focused (this was a consistent and strange thing throughout multiple videos in various situations, lighting, and environments). Not sure if it's some kind of cheating algorithm (resulting in poor 60 fps quality) that doubles 30 fps without actually shooting in 60, or if it's just really poor quality. You can get some okay stills, but that's not why you are buying an action cam, right? Also, not sure the 4k is really 4k. The color settings weren't very good (HDR way overcompensates the white balance (WB) which is pretty normal, but still frustrating because it ruins any chances for saturation balancing in post). The WB controls were fairly crappy. Multiple times I tried shooting inside with the different options ""fluorescent, tungsten"" (I believe they are called), but it seemed to overcompensate and ruined the quality of my videos. The auto worked okay outside, and the outdoor settings worked alright. The app barely (BARELY!) worked initially... then stopped working at all. I bought this specifically for the app connectivity and I was sorely disappointed. It's the biggest reason I chose this camera over the many, MANY other options there are available (models and manufacturers). Plus you cannot shoot in anything higher than 1080/60fps using the app. No 4k support even though the camera can supposedly shoot  in 4k. Connecting the app also burned up the battery and heated it up considerably. Battery life is decent overall when filming with just the camera (no remote or app). Sharpness adjustment is decent. Timelapse and motion detection worked properly. Really the only two features I can say met expectations. The remote did work, but theres no way to confirm it is shooting without checking the camera, which defeats the purpose of using the remote. Also at times I would get photos when I wanted video, however that could have been my own fault. Not sure. Also more than once I set the camera to shoot in 1440p, but when I went back to check on my footage, it had changed (at some point) to 1080/60fps. Very weird. The display looks fine. The camera itself is very light. The battery slot cover is absurdly cheap and is destined to break/become ineffective because of the poor design (in which it actually detaches from the camera when removed. No hinge or clip to keep it attached to the camera body). Its literally just a little sliver or plastic that clicks into place. There's no cover for the MicroSD card slot or the ports on the camera itself. I never tried it in water, but the case has a proper gasket and all, so I would expect it to be waterproof. Though the lens cover smudges and scratches extremely easily, so it might not hold up long enough to actually get the shots you want. For an action camera, that isn't a great thing. Otherwise, it functions okay... the software/chip that runs the camera is okay, but it does have a fair bit of lag between pressing buttons and completing the intended action. The menu is setup poorly and with seemingly little concern for order and/or necessities (things that need adjustment often like WB, Color, exposure, etc, should be easily accessible like resolution is at the top). Playback on the screen is actually pretty decent, and you can fast forward, rewind, go frame by frame, etc. But as a general rule, navigation is clunky and frustrating, even after learning where everything is located. I made the mistake of using an SD card not rated for 4k video at first... definitely get a 4k rated microSD card for the best possible operation (that goes for all 4k cameras). The specs info stated you could do minor editing on the camera, though I did not see any way to do so. Even deleting a video or picture was an exceedingly difficult proposition. Connecting the camera to my computer was met with a few issues including regular disconnections. After I swapped their micro USB cable out with one of my own, I had a better experience with transferring videos, etc... their cable was garbage. The attachments were fine mostly. There are alot of pieces that seem to have redundant purposes... no instructions as to how you should connect them. It's all just cheap plastic but they worked fine.I'm not sure if I missed anything, but hopefully that covers everything to some extent. Bottom line: I wouldn't buy again. I waited too long to return mine, so I'm stuck with it. But that being said, I decided to buy a used GoPro5 for not too much more than I paid for this Akaso Brave 4. I love the GP. It does everything I expected and then some. The app is amazing and works perfectly. Only downsides to it are I had to purchase a few more batteries and a charger for it, but ultimately, the extra cost is absolutely worth it. I would urge you to consider a GP or a Sony action cam if you have the means to do it. You'll be so glad you did. If you get this Akaso cam, theres definitely alot left to be desired, but it's probably fine for alot of kids or for folks who aren't totally sure they want or need an action cam. If you want quality and performance though, go for the top brands. And as for me, I guess I've got this Brave 4 as a backup/secondary if I need it for something I suppose. Good luck!"
"I purchased the camera as a helmet camera for when I ride my motorcycle. It does the job and has a pretty good picture. There are some downsides though.First, while the 4k is pretty good during the day, it's low light performance is not the greatest. Looks pretty blotchy. Also, the image stabilization leaves a lot to be desired when compared to something like a GoPro. Looks a bit choppy. And lastly, and my biggest gripe, the audio. It's honestly terrible. Whether internal microphone or an external, is tinny, and a lot of the time sounds like when someone has a microphone down their throat. Like the gain is way too high, but there's no way to adjust sound properties This is the biggest let down in my opinion. The audio controller is kinda garbage, even in a quiet, normal setting.Battery life is decent I suppose. Though a constant filming on 4k, a full charge may only last 1 1/2 hours.At the end of the day, you get what you pay for. I wasn't sure what I was expecting for what I payed for it, but am a little disappointed with it. I think the best option would be to save up some more money and buy a higher end version, or get a good, used GoPro.  I kinda wish I had.Am I happy with it? Eh. It's better than the 7 year old camera I was loaned. But only a little better. It's better than nothing especially if using just as a ""dashcam"", which is my primary purpose for having a camera while I ride."
"I have owned a GoPro and and loved it but was looking for an alternative with good reviews for just my underwater videos since I now use my iphone 15 pro max for everything else. The Akaso takes decent underwater pictures and videos and the included waterproof case worked well. It is a pain to go through all the button pushing to access the different menu settings and does takes some getting used to so you don't repeatedly back out of the setting you are trying to change. The wifi was easy to turn on by long pressing the top button after you power on the camera and connecting it to the app but it is basically useless as it constantly disconnects when you want to view your videos on the phone app vs viewing the sd card content on your computer. I have tried it close to my phone and with 4 bars on my phone and it still disconnects every time. Also, mine seems to have a defect in which it won't let me power the camera off as its supposed to when you long press the front on/off button. I end up having to remove the battery in order to turn off the camera. When it does this it is in a frozen state, the power is on but the screen is black and you can't operate any of the functions until you take the battery out to kill the power and then put it back in and start over. I purchased the warranty on the camera but if it does this so much that it becomes annoying within the first 30 days I guess I will assume its defective and return to Amazon. If not for this happening 3 to 4 times so far, I would've rated it 4 stars. The other feature that takes off a star is the stabilizer doesn't work that great and I wasn't even running or bike riding or anything. I was simply walking or moving it around under water."
"This camera is decent and can be used for many things. I love that it comes with so many different accessories.I bought this knowing it's on the low end of the camera spectrum, but it had good and bad reviews, so I thought I would give it a try.I just used the camera to ride in downtown Houston and get to get some good footage. I did get pretty good footage, I'll admit that. The sound is decent, but the camera has something that rattles inside. You can't hear it Riding or walking, but during playback it sounds bad and the knock or rattle sounds bad.I took out the battery thinking maybe it was loose, but that wasn't the noise. I found out that the rattle noise is from the top button labeled "" OK"" on top of the camera and also from the up and down buttons on the side. I put tape on all of these buttons and shook the camera a little and no more noise. I went for a ride and the noise was almost completely gone. I can handle that, I suppose.The battery life is not so great unless you shoot low quality video. I think I used 2k or 1080 60 fps and the battery lasted about 45-50 minutes. I haven't tried other image qualities to see what the battery life would be.You can't add an sd card over 64 gb. I wish they would allow for a bigger sd card. Order extra batteries and buy two 64 GB SD cards, so you'll have backups for both items.I was thinking about buying an upgraded Akaso camera, but I'm not sure that I want to take that plunge, in fear of it being like this camera. Overall, it's a good camera for the price. Maybe I just received a bad oneI tried to contact seller but email, but no response, so I messaged Amazon and they are shipping me a replacement camera. Thank you Amazon for helping me out. I'm sure the seller will reach out when they have time. I would purchase this, if your looking for a good first camera to get started in the filming world."
Screen keeps freezing and buttons will not work so keep having to remove battery to reset for it to freeze again a few minutes later.  When it does work….has great quality pictures and easy to use.  Lots of different accessory attachments available so you can film basically any activity you want.  Small and easy to travel with
"When I got the camera it was good for wide pics. But it did not have auto focus. Which means that it does not have good pics near. The pics were really blurry and not good. It is waterproof within a durable case. It is also really small. It comes with a lot of accessories.I would recommend for you to buy it if you make sports vids live surfing, biking and etc."
"I've had a chance to use this camera for a bit, and overall, it's okay for the money. Probably should have gone with Go Pro for better quality, but at this price it's not too terrible. The video quality is probably the worst of it. On the higher resolutions, the video is so grainy that it's almost unusable. It's better at the lower settings. I don't think the camera can really process the video at the various stated qualities. Photos seem okay, but that's not why I bought it. Overall, if you're looking for excellent video quality, you might want to pass this one by."
"We have only used the camera a few times so far, so we haven't fully gotten used to everything yet. Our opinion may change the more we use it.Overall, it is a nice camera and I would love to give it 4+ stars, but the user interface leaves a lot to be desired. It is difficult to use out of the box and takes effort to figure it all out. The app is also lacking in features I would like to see, but it's functional and adds some nice capabilities if you are using the camera and can have your phone connected wirelessly.I wish they would have an app for the PC so that we could connect and control it as well as run updates, change the default wireless password and more. Default passwords that can't be changed are bad and a security risk.The pictures and videos are wonderful though. Very clear and with beautiful detail. We did some test pics and vids drving around locally and on a road trip into the mountains and were amazed at how well it did when taking pics and the videos while in a moving car.My only complaint about the videos and pics, for us anyway, is that the postion the camera had to be in with the suction mount to the windshield, put the camera upside down. When you look at the display, it shows what you would expect if the camera detected the upside down postion and corrected so the video/pics would come out as if the camera was held normally. I was happy that it appeared that the camera was going to take them and not have them come out upside down. HOWEVER, that was not the case. Even though the images/video showing on the display was correct, the camera still recorded everything upside down. I was extremely disappointed when we finally viewed all of the pictures and videos we had taken and found that they all would have to be flipped so you didn't have to stand on your head to watch them normally. I was hoping the Gyroscope feature was going to be used to correct this, is it is done on my old Panasonic camera which automatically detected the camera position and corrected the orientatiton, but this also did not help. Upside down, no matter the view in the display, is still upside down.If someone knows how to correct this, we would love to hear. I sent a message today to ask the Manf. so they may have an answer for me. Rotating a picture to correct it's orientation is easy with pretty much any viewing program, but video is not so easy to do this with, from what I have seen.We didn't test the water resistant case so we couldn't rate that.We plan to use this on our mule ride in the Grand Canyon and when we hike the Narrows in Zion Nation Park in Utah. We also plan to use it while taking rides and trips on the motorcycle. From what we have seen so far, they should come out fantastic and I look forward to seeing them.Overall the camera does a wonderful job with the videos and pictures. When you consider how much cheaper it is than some of the very expensive ones, the are still on par with the quality at a fraction of the price."
"We haven't had this long, but immediately ran into problems with knowing when it is and isn't recording.The remote is potentially handy but without an indicator for when video is recording, it's not reliable. Too often we thought we'd turned it ON when we'd actually turned it OFF.Also, having to remove four screws to replace the remote battery is poor design, there's no reason there couldn't be a slide cover like most other such accessories.The camera itself seems to work well, stabilization is good, zoom seems OK, but the interface is not especially intuitive. ***Instructions are incorrect about how to leave playback mode!I made a cheat sheet to remember how it operates. Akaso should include one. It just needs to read:Akaso Cheat SheetTurn ON/OFF: press and hold front button 3 secTake Video/Photo: press TOP buttonPlayback [when ON]: Press side UP button to enter playback mode  Select video(photo) with up/down, top [OK] to play  EXIT playback: press front [MODE] button TWICEDelete [when ON in Playback]: Press and hold OK button  Select YES or NO with side [up/down] buttons  Press top [OK] to accept selectionChange Video/Photo modes: press front button to cycle through 5 modesOf course, the price is awesome so we'll see if we can live with these downsides, which seem no better on the GoPro."
"First of all I purposely selected a cheaper model because I really didn't need high performance.  My goal was to get a camera to mount on my bicycle for video evidence if/when I get hit by a car in my neighborhood.  Yes, folks in my area drive like bicycles are a nuisance.So with that in mind the camera does what I need it to do.  However, the image stabilization is very average and has constant jittering from my bicycle rides on asphalt.  It is smoother when on concrete but there isn't much of that on my rides.  One of my biggest complaints is the camera makes a constant buzzing/rattling sound like something is lose.  This drowns out the sound from any video.  I thought the camera was a little loose in the mount, so, I cut really small slivers of duct tape and put it inside the four sides of the mount.  This did tighten the mount and muted the buzzing sound a little.  But the source of the sound is the OK button on the top of the camera!  The button is loose and rattles when I ride my bicycle and with this so close to the microphone it is really loud.  I plan on putting a strip of tape over the button to hold it still to see if this solves the issue.  I will post at a later date when I test this.Over all I am happy with this purchase because it does what I want but if I would definitely buy an upgrade if you want a stable image with better quality.Update:  It wasn't the OK button that was causing the rattle, it was the up/down buttons on the side of the camera.  I placed a piece of tape over the buttons and it worked!  No more rattle!"
"I purchased this action camera based on numerous positive reviews and its comprehensive accessory package. My experience with it has been underwhelming, to say the least.The build quality of the camera itself is rather concerning. It feels flimsy and is predominantly made of plastic, which doesn't inspire confidence in its durability. Surprisingly, it has held up decently so far, but the overall feel is not reassuring.The video resolution, as advertised, is acceptable for its price range. It captures images reasonably well under good lighting conditions. However, the most significant flaw lies in its performance during video recording. The footage is consistently jerky and stutters frequently, rendering much of the recorded video unusable. This issue persists regardless of the settings or conditions, making the camera unreliable for capturing smooth, fluid motion."
Excellent video quality but the battery life is poor. Would suit our purposes if the camera record while it's charging. Akaso 's tech support is great. Very easy to contact and they're very knowledgeable of their products.
Buttons functions are hard to use. When active under waters
"As the title says, for the price point its a pretty impressive mini video camera. However, it's absolutely worthless in low light/indoor conditions. I have some fairly nice lights so I didn't have to send it back, but unless you do too, you wont want this camera. I don't know if the higher cost competition is any better though - This is my first action camera."
"I bought this camera because it states that the picture is better, BUT when comparing to two, I see NO difference in the quality of the picture -- Both are great.  Neither one is more clearer than the other.The difference, however, is the audio.  The audio on the EK7000 is so low that one can barely even hear sound at all.  This camera, the sound can be heard perfectly (unless its inside the case).UPDATE:  For what I want to use these cameras for, the EK7000 is a much better camera.  I deliver lumber and want a camera on the lift to get a unique view, along with a camera on my head to give an ""eye's"" view alongside the other video.  I used THIS camera on my head, but the audio was so distorted by the sound of the lift that not a word I said could be understood.Another ""bad"" for this camera is that this camera does not support any more than a 64gb sd card, while the EK7000 supports up to a 512gb card.  Because of that each video on the EK7000 comes out in ONE video, while this camera comes out with multiple videos which I would have to combine.In conclusion, for what I want it for, the EK7000 is a MUCH better camera than this one is.  I'm just going to save it for a back up, just in case something happens to the EK7000, to use it until I can get another EK7000."
"I bought this camera for two main things: mountain biking and snorkeling. It sucks at both.First the only decent thing about the camera is that for the price the photos and video are decent, but everything else sucks.For MTB there are several mount options that it comes with, but they all come loose with vibration.Also if you use a head mount, it's great that it comes with a remote, but the remote does not have any indication that the camera is on. Also the camera only makes a sound when it turns on, but not when it turns off or takes a picture or records video, so if you have the camera mounted on your helmet it's hard to tell if it's on or off or if you are taking pictures or video successfully.Also the microphone has no noise suppression so if you ride on a trail the audio is just horrible noise of the mount and helmet.Also the image stabilization is not very good.For snorkeling, the waterproof case will leak water in every time you press the buttons, so you absolutely cannot use it underwater. I noticed water going in once, do I stopped using it. Next time I double checked all the seals and everything was clean, there was no sand and again water leaked and killed the camera."
I bought this camera and the first time I went scuba diving with it the deepest I went was 47 ft and it leaked. After removing the battery and drying it off it's working.
"My third test in my attempt to find a reasonably-priced camera (min 1080p) for top-down review/software videos.  While it had a better image than the previous units I tried (more traditional ""video cam"" formats), I still found the image to be a bit grainy and blurry when there was motion.Video at more of a distance (past the 18""-24"" desk mount that I'm using) seemed to be a little better, but not outstanding.What really caught my eye was the fisheye distortion.  The image is ""rounded"" as if looking through a fishbowl or into a reflective ""ball"" (bulges in the middle, tapers at the edges).  Definitely not a look I want for what I'm doing.I personally found the until ""cheap-feeling"" - very lightweight plastic - almost like a toy.  Menus were pretty easy to navigate with the various buttons, but I couldn't find any combination of settings that would clear up the image issues I saw.The camera by itself I wouldn't pay more than $30-40 for, and it seems to me the price pushes the $80 mark to do all the accessories included - a mount for just about anything you'd want to mount it to:  helmet, tripod, handlebars, etc.  I *only* needed a tripod mount.So, in the end, I returned it due to the grainy image, but *mostly* due to the distortion.  I can't say it was *horrible*, but not very clear, either.  I will continue using my Samsung S7 phone which has given me the best, crisp, and clear video yet."
"I bought the camera thinking I got a good deal for 4K quality. Turned out it was very far away from 4K. I tried all settings and the video quality remained the same, the only difference was the frame rate. Video quality is about 720p and it doesn't matter which setting you use. The images are blurry, grainy, and the edges are not sharp at all. I have seen this before in lower grade cameras. The camera can only capture 720p videos but it uses software to add more pixels to the frame, artificially upgrade it to 1080p, 2K, or 4K. You can't really tell the difference if you view the videos on a small screen like phone screen, but if you view it on a computer or a TV screen, the quality is really horrible. I compared 4K videos from this camera with 1080p videos from my 8 years old Sony action camera and the Sony did much better. Check out the reviews with videos on a computer screen and you will see what I mean.Image stabilization is a bit weird. It doesn't have an internal stabilizer but rather uses software to blur the video motions. The images lag behind with blurred edges.Zooming is all digital zoom, just like how you would zoom in on an image on the computer, which makes the image blown out and pixilated.Not to mention the white balance is way off, everything looks as if it has a red/orange filter on it. Audio has a low humming noise when recording. I don't have an external mic to test but the built-in mic is low quality. The build quality is cheap too. Very light weight with cheap plastic housing. The battery cover is not attached so if you better be careful when opening the cover to change batteries or you might lose it. The waterproof case and mounts are good though.In summary, if you want an affordable, cheap, light weight, waterproof camera that can only capture 720p videos then this is a good buy. Otherwise save up for something that can do true 4K."
The recorded video would be blurred.
I bought this to use on a Manatee kayaking trip and the camera itself was great.  Underwater housing was great and didn't leak.  The only complaint I have it the place where my handheld tripod kept coming loose.  Also there are no instructions with the accessory kit.  I have all these pieces and really no knowledge on how they're suppose to be used.

"The hardware meets the expectation of a ~$100 budget camera. The software (firmware + phone app) is flawed.- difficult to operate when out of sight . The camera lacks ""one-press capture"" function as GoPro. When you mount it on helmet or chest and want to start/end recording, you will have to press buttons in a sequence (by memorizing it) and listen to the audio feedback. It can be error prone due to ambient noise and the insulation of the waterproof case. e.g. I found myself shooting 20 min of burst photos instead of a video as I intended. Too bad.- flawed remote control. The remote is a good idea poorly executed. When the ""screensaver"" is on (screen is dim), pressing remote buttons won't start/end recording but just light up the screen. You will have to manually swipe on the screen to unlock it! But isn't the remote supposed to free you from touching the camera? The lack of remote control exacerbates the out-of-sight operation described above.- volatile date/time. They reset whenever swapping batteries -- no matter how fast I tried to be. The only way to retain date/time is to use a USB cable powering the camera during the swap, which cannot be done in the field.- poor phone app. awkward connect and sync videos. You can check out the Play Store or App store reviews (2 star rating).CONCLUSION. The problem seems that AKASO spends too low budget on firmware and app. And I doubt if they will change the behavior. (despite their friendly and responsive customer service). As a result, although the hardware is OK for ~$100 price, the software weakness badly hurts the camera's usability for many outdoor and vlogging uses. Perhaps as a secondary, beater camera? But then why not a used GoPro."
Not sure if my unit is defective or if this was a common issue. I did Google it and found other people did say the battery case is very difficult to open. I could not get it open. I struggled for a while and was so worried that if I keep trying I might end updamaging the camera that I opted to return it.I have had 7 different GoPro and also purchase the akahso brave 7 solely because it can go deeper underwater than the GoPro and I freedive in Hawaii deeper than the GoPros can go. I wanted a second and cheap camera that can also go deep like the 7. But the battery compartment is just so difficult to open that even if I could figure it out it is not something I want to deal with on a regular basis.I did like the akahso 7 so I imagine this is an okay camera too. There is a noticeable difference in quality between the GoPro series and akahso series but the akahso series is still reasonable quality but does not have the vibration reduction that comes in GoPros these days.Anyhow the basic thing is that the battery case was too hard to open and that's why I returned  this.
"One of the chief reasons that I bought this particular item was the good number of included accessories. The cam itself is fine, but I haven't found the accessories very useful. For instance, all the clips are made of very hard plastic, which makes them difficult to mount and dismount. The included remote control is a very cool idea, except the supplied velcro strap is too short to go around the sleeve of a ski jacket. Also, the curvature of the helmet mounts is too flat to attach to a ski helmet. Since I bought the cam with a 30% off coupon, I spent some of the savings on an accessory kit from another manufacturer. Had I paid the full price, though, I would have returned this item for a refund."
"Update:A few hours after I posted this review, I received an email from someone else at AKASO who sent me a replacement camera for the defective item. Haven’t had the opportunity yet to try the new one yet, but will update when I get the chance to use the replacement camera.I used this camera with its waterproof case on a shallow reef dive and the case leaked the very first time I ever used it. Worse yet, the water got inside of the camera with visible condensation buildup where the flash is and water coming out of the battery compartment. None of my photos from that dive were saved and I was unable to take any other dive photos on this once in a lifetime trip. I reached out to the company to request an exchange for a non-defective unit and was instead sent email after email of unrelated troubleshooting tips and no response to my request for an exchange. Horrible customer service. Will never purchase anything from this manufacturer again."
"Pictures and video are great. Used it on my trip to Hawaii. The first time I took it snorkeling (no deeper than 5 ft) the water proof case cracked around the lens and started leaking. Sadly, after that I could not use it for the rest of my vacation. I specifically bought this for underwater use so it's going back."
"I bought this camera to replace my other one which we lost - they are small.Just so we are clear, I charged the batteries when I got it, used existing good SD cards, formatted and took some pictures. I removed the SD card and viewed them on my PC - perfect.On the day of our zipline trip, I again checked the camera and took some test photos - all good. Get to the zip line place, take a few posed pictures, looking good. Ask the wife to pose and get card error. With my previous same style camera I never had a card error, which means it needs to be reformatted, so everything is gone.OK I reformat, test it again it acts fine. I proceed to take a an hour of video checking it after every line. Looks fine. All Im doing is pressing the record button, not turning the camera off. Take multiple videos and literally on my last video it throws a card error - ALL GONE. I turn it off hoping to recover something on my PC but the directory has been corrupted so all gone. I test the card on my PC and it tests perfect. I test the other card and it tests perfect so I use the other card.Next day same drill, take some test pictures everything works. Now Im not trusting it so I take pictures with my cell phone and this camera. It acts fine. I take my final video by looking at it, placing it on a rock, picking it up when done, still recording and stop the video. Looks fine. I turn it off. At home I eject the memory card and its blank, corrupted file system. I put it in the camera and get card error. So after hours of multiple adventures I literally dont have a single picture from it.Just a question, if my cell phone with an SD card takes thousands of videos and hours of videos and it never corrupts itself, why cant these cameras do the same? Its not that hard... If I have to spend the money for  a GoPro in order to not lose videos I will go do it. The first little camera worked fine, so whats different with this one? I dont know, Im very frustrated with it. I tried multiple known good sd cards, tested them on my pc for hours without a hickup, yet this camera constantly loses its file system and the pictures. Dont tell me its my fault either, fix the code so you dont corrupt the file system.So this is going back, I want nothing to do with it. If memory cards are a problem then include one that you support, but I even put these in my cell phone and they worked fineSo its going back and I will think about what I do next. I really wanted to smash it with a hammer but I decided I would rather get my money back."
"This camera comes with a lot of attachments. But it doesn't come with any directions to describe what they all do. You're kinda on your own to figure them out. I was hoping for one that I could attach to my kid's head for jumping on the trampoline. This didn't really include that -- there were several attachments to put on a helmet.If you like to figure things out on your own, I think this is a good choice for you. If you need help with stuff, buy something else."
"I took up river kayaking this summer and have been terrified of destroying my phone. I wanted something waterproof but not willing to spend big bucks to record the 10 or so trips per year. I saw the Brave 4 at a good price and knew it has some mixed reviews. I just wanted something to capture some fun memories and I wasn’t looking for Hollywood quality footage. I chose the Brave 4 because it advertised a 5X digital zoom in video and photo modes. After unpacking, the first thing I tried was the zoom. It worked in photo mode but only by using the touchscreen buttons not the side buttons. This means you can’t zoom with the camera in the waterproof case which is my intended use. The zoom didn’t work at all in video mode. I sent an email to AKASO support and they responded within a couple of hours. They asked me to send it back to them and they would replace it immediately. I sent it back and they sent me a replacement. No complaints about the customer service! The replacement has the same problem in photo mode (can’t zoom with the side buttons). It will zoom in video mode in the waterproof case but not when using EIS. I’m not a photographer so I don’t know if there is a technical reason for this or if it is just a defect. I wasn’t expecting to get GoPro quality for less than $100, and I didn’t, but I think I’ll still have some fun using it."
"I really wish I'd set the camera to a higher resolution--- I followed a recommendation off one of these leading Amazon reviews, and when we got home from our trip the photos are all so grainy.  Pretty disappointing.The photos are okay.  The video is okay.  I'm glad I have them, but they don't capture the snorkeling experience very well.  On a previous trip I used a different underwater camera (no longer available) and the photos were much better.  I found it difficult to use the zoom feature at all because the screen and buttons are so tiny.  The buttons are also so limited that it's tricky to remember what to press in order to get the functions you need....kind of like a digital watch with 100 features but only four buttons.  You can do it, but it's frustrating at times.Photos were best when they were taken in shallow water, close to the subject.  The photos I shared above are straight off the camera.  When you zoom in on them at all, it's pixel city.  :/  I would suggest setting your resolution as high as it can go.Battery life was fine-- we didn't need the back up set of batteries we bought and brought along."
"Well, you get what you pay for. It does have image stabilization, but not with wide or super wide angles. Nor with upside down orientation. You can select these wide modes, but if you have image stabilization on, it'll just use the normal (110 degree) mode without telling you.The image quality for outdoor scenes isn't great. Image can get washed out and it doesn't autocorrect for high light scenes quickly.OTOH, these are inexpensive."
"I don't like this item.  I can't get the APP to work.  I don't like giving this device personal information like my email.  It doesn't come with a user manual, it's a download.  Camera is complicated to operate.  Spent 2 days working with it.  Lots of neat parts came with it.  Had to buy my own SD memory card.  I'll assume the camera works but the wifi does not.  I have experience working with WIFI but not this camera"
"The first one would not work with the remote control. Akaso promptly sent a replacement but that one didn't work either, so I assume it was a problem with the camera. Second camera would record video some random amount of time, then stop recording for no apparant reason. Had to return it too. Have purchased a different brand to replace it, and paid more. I think this one is just too much of a budget design."
"Quality of videos are great. It's been working well as a dumb camera.  Unfortunately, I can't connect to the app because the SSID is not recognized although I can can connect it to my phone. The firmware is from 2018. Yet purchased in mid 2020. But, Support can't help for some reason.So if you buy and see this version... IPS7789_V3 20180702Return it. Otherwise it's a good camera."
"My goal was simple: record 4K video of snow sports adventures with my family. I understand that at 1/5th the price of a GoPro, there would be tradeoffs. But even so, this is not working for me. Consistent with this goal, all of my use is referring to 4K video recording from a helmet camera.The battery is terrible. At temperatures of about 5º or below, I am getting about 5 minutes of use before the battery dies. In temps of 20-30º, I saw a battery life of about 15 minutes and in temps of 30-45º, about 40 minutes. Inside at 70º, the best I could do is one hour. You cannot plug the camera in directly, so you also are relying on the battery for transferring the video files via WiFi. A fully charged battery is not enough to transfer 30 minutes worth of files at the end of the day. So even here, you need to go through multiple batteries.The camera chops up files at the 3 minute mark. So if record 12 minutes of video, that is 4 separate files. In the app used to transfer the files, there is no way to do a mass transfer, so you must click download for each individual file. Files that are transferred have the timestamp of the time that the transfer was done--not the timestamp of when the video was recorded. So if you transfer the individual files in the wrong order, they will be in the wrong order on your device. Also, the app apparently doesn't understand the 4K setting on the camera. So every time you connect the app to the camera, it resets the camera to the 1080p setting. Then you have to change it back to 4K on the camera.Using this as a helmet mounted camera, there is no way for me to see what is happening on the screen. So I have to rely on the idea that it can work well remotely. Unfortunately, that is not the case. First, if the camera is off, the remote cannot turn it on. So you must turn off the auto-power off feature. The remote for the camera has one toggle button which is supposed to turn on/off video recording and another button to take a still picture. Second, if the screen saver (i.e., display is turned off) is activated, pressing the remote does not start recording, but instead turns off the screen saver. At which point you think you are recording but you are not. Then when you press the remote button again to stop recording you have actually starting recording. For me that meant lots of video of riding up the lift and no video skiing back down. So, I turned off the screen saver feature. Third, the remote still sometimes just doesn't work-no idea why. So I started reaching above my head and finding the button that should toggle it on and off--not always easy with gloves. So I'd still get out of sync. I started taking off my helmet every time I got on the lift to figure out it it was recording or not. Which seemed kind of ridiculous to have to do.After missing too many memories, I've decided to return it. It may work well for other sports, but if you are looking at this for snow sports, I suggest you really think about how you are going to use it."
"Update:  After zero help from Akaso, forums, and 5 hours just trying to make this thing work as described, I hit return, threw it all in a box and got rid of it.  No customer support, i had a nice chat with someone on the forum and agreed something was wrong with the wifi/the camera, but it should have been simpler.  Never got the thing to work right, and again, zero help.  So returned it.  Now only receiving a gift card vs a refund, super angry with this particular purchase all the way around:  DO NOT RECOMMEND.  I went to my local best buy, took a shot at the Brave 7 LE  (i'm in heaven) so maybe it is just the 4, maybe it is just this one, but overall one of the worse experiences I have ever had with any product.  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I haven't even turned it on yet, and am over an hour into the unpack, the battery door is broke so we already are going to need tape on it, fyi, the only tool used to open this door, which was not easy was a fingernail.  I have zero fingernails left and my fingers are bruised, just from trying to get this stupid thing off the box mount (was not successful, mount is still on the box, just took the case off the mount) .  Can't imagine just popping this off/on any of the mounts.  I had to watch a youtube video hosted by a 10yo (he did an exceptional job by the way), also, wasn't the only one.  The comment section was very long, and I felt a little better, because so far this camera has not only damaged me physicaly but my ego has taken a pretty hard hit too.  I have been working with camera equipment of various sizes / shapes and uses for a very long time, and I am absolutely stymied, and frustrated by this contraption and its bazillion pieces.  I will gladly update this review if I am ever able to get an actual video recorded.  first I have to figure out the best tape for keeping the battery door on!  so so far....not a fan."
I bought this to carry me over a few years until they make the batteries last longer on the Heroes.  The picture quality is not bad at all.  The battery life isn't great but it isn't great on any of these action cameras.  It cost considerably less than the Hero cameras.  Which has much better image stabilization and really is a much better camera.  If your doing anything professional you will want one of those GOpros.  My favorite feature thus far is the remote.  It beeps when you turn it on (it could be louder).  One thing that I don't like is you can't turn it on with the remote.  The camera must be on first.  Then the remote can do it's thing.  There are buttons for the video or a picture.  The pictures aren't that good.  They are just ok.  But just for a decent little vacation video this will serve you pretty well.
"I am using it attached to a motorcycle. Sometimes the device freezes. In that case, there is the inconvenience of having to disconnect the battery to restart it.Because the price is cheap, I can use it without problems."
"UPDATED: The newer version has a file naming/saving glitch.  When riding I record outbound, on the way to destination, turn off camera, turn back on and record inbound, on the way home.  I get home and go to download the files and every file seems to have two copies.  It reused the timestamps from the outbound recordings to name the inbound files.  Further investigation showed that the clock was actually reset to the time the outbound recordings started when I started the inbound recordings, so the time stamps on the inbound recordings is incorrect.I use the camera for my Motorcycle.  The AKASO BRAVE4  is soft mounted  using the handheld mount on the saddlebags.  it is not hard mounted to the frame, and gives a great, stable image, has multiple zoom and density, time duration, and control settings, including a remote.  (The Vivitar version of the camera is much lower quaility .  The Vivtar has an unstable image and does not have the same quality OS software.) The mounting kit has almost everythiing you need, including External/underwater, helmet, and handheld mounting accessories.  However,  the  external sealed case mount does not have a swivel.  If your mounting bar is not straight forward, or backward it requres creativity or the use of the older Vivtar's (78x) mounting kits."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                I took a flyer on this camera, curious how it would perform in comparison to other action cameras.  Other reviews spoke highly of the camera including it's image quality.  These are mine after a week or so of working with it.IMAGE QUALITY: Definitely a disappointment in terms of image quality--all around.  (NOTE: I have been using AUTO setting for ISO, WB, EV, ""Normal"" Sharpness setting, ""Natural"" Color setting, and had Anti-Shaking ON--All of which are default settings.VIDEO QUALITY: Video modes (1080p,60fps / 1080p,30fps / 2K,30fps / 4K,24fps) seem to make no difference in quality--4K looks just as bad, if not worse, and poorly detailed, as any other mode.  Interior shots are horrible (see video).  I can only imagine truly low light situations.  But even outside the image quality is pretty bad.  And on top of all that, there is artifacting all along the top few rows of pixels on every video--it's a bit hard to detect, but it's clearly there, and it's ugly.PHOTO: (*I have set photo image quality to FINE, the highest quality, and am capturing stills at 20MP*) Still are even worse than video.  It puts me in mind of taking a still picture on a camcorder from 20 years ago: pixelated, poorly exposed, slightly blurry.  The outside image I attached is one of the ""best"" images I captured.  Incidentally, there also a terrible lag between pushing the shutter button (video or still mode) and starting a recording / taking your photo.  So it's easy to end up with slightly blurry shots, again, even in full daylight.IMAGE STABILIZATION:  I haven't shot anything with anti-shaking turned OFF, so I can't compare.  I can't say I've been particularly impressed, but nor have I been horribly disappointed.WATERPROOF?: It comes with a ""waterproof"" case that appears to be somewhat waterproof--it's certainly not moisture/humidity resistant which is problematic.  Not only that, but a light rain of maybe an hour left not only the condensation inside the waterproof case, but the camera actually had a small amount of water on it (likely let in via the gasket by the lens, but hard to tell). Given my experiences so far, I would be very hesitant to actually immerse this in water.OTHER FEATURES: There are plenty of features of this camera that are decent or even impressive given it's price point.  Build quality is decent.  Navigation and menus are totally serviceable.  It connects easily to my computer and -- my favorite feature -- has very low latency live view connection, via the included USB cable.  Very impressive.  Battery life is good.  You can also operate the camera via USB power for extended shots, which is fantastic (can't use the waterproof case though).  Comes with a lot of attachments, as you would expect.IS IT WORTH IT?: At such a low price point, I suppose if there's NO WAY you would spring for a higher quality camera, this camera is certainly serviceable--particularly if you're just focused on capturing footage/images and not overly concerned about overall image quality.  A DJI OSMO is about 3x the cost and, while it's hard to compare image quality along those lines, captures SIGNIFICANTLY higher quality footage.  If you need image quality, you're gonna have to pay for it.  If you need something serviceable on a relative shoestring, I suppose this will do.I will provide an update if and when I discover additional info."
Does not come with the micro SD card. Important you know to buy one. Can’t review more until then. Good luck.
"I took this on vacation, assuming that everything that was needed to operate. It was in the box, only to open it and find out that it doesn’t work without purchasing an SID card. I’m sorry to say that where I was visiting that was not an option so I spent the money on this and couldn’t use it."
"Love the product, but I’m pretty techy and really struggle getting the connection right."
"With apologies, as a GoPro like camera, I guess the lesson is you get what you pay for. As a basic web-camera that plugs in via USB this product works fine (but for the price point exceeds what you'd pay for a web camera). The joy comes when you attempt to use an SD card. The locking mechanism is clunky, and freezes up the camera when plugged in. Apparently this is a common issue. It may have to do with the Wi-Fi settings on the camera, which on this version are terrible to try and set because it just has buttons. To connect to the app, you need to treat the Camera as a Wi-Fi device, and even then it doesn't seem to work.Future touch screen versions may fix this. The low rating for the App on the Apple store don't give me much faith. Cool looking camera, nice attachments to use it like a GoPro, but the fact that it freezes turning on and doesn't have a reasonable out of the box SD use or a half decent app means better to pass on this."
"First, the item is very difficult to remove from the box. That should have been a warning. The camera does not come with an SD card, not a big deal, but I had to buy a card--two actually. I followed the directions on how to format the new card and the camera would not respond in the settings mode, which is needed to reformat. I spent an hour pushing up and down buttons, the mode button and the ""OK"" button. Nothing worked. I called customer support and they asked me for an ID number on the camera. I supplied it to them and they told me I had the wrong SD card. I purchased the exact description of the SD card found on the documents inside the box. For info, the SD card that fits the camera has a ""U"" on it with a 3 in the center of the ""U.""I'm sending the camera back and will now have to eat the cost of the wrong SD card. In my view this is not a professional organization. I will bite the bullett and get a better quality unit from a different manufacturer or a Go-Pro. There is no reason for this type of screwup."
"So I've set it up, charged the battery, and got my systems locked in place for my video. We shoot the video, downloaded the app and the app would not work and we have not been able to get any kind of app to work with this camera; which means we have to take it down off of the tripods bring it over to the computer plug it in download and blah blah blah, in the description it specifically says that you can transfer the files via Wi-Fi and your phone I had no problem with that it's a little bit of an extra step but no big deal, having to take the camera down and bring it over to the computer every time we want to download video makes this camera pretty much useless for us. But I will admit this: it takes great pictures/video and it's a very simple unit to use if the app worked or if you could just hook the Wi-Fi up to your computer via some sort of app just an easy way to get the file off of the camera and onto a laptop/PC would be great."
The photos are extremely grainy. Video seems to be ok.
"At first I was happy it held the date through battery changes until I turn it on the the time was off.  Then I could not find out where to change it.  Turns out they want you to download an app to change the time.  Can you imagine the insensitive stard that came up with that one? That stuff just tee's me.  I had bought an AKASO EK7000 and it broke fast, but I was hoping this one would be a better experience.  The cam works fine so far you can't change the date unless you leave the battery out for ""AN EXTENDED AMOUNT OF TIME"".  They do tell you how long that time is.  So if want to make all your cams have the same date and time you better start days ahead I guess.  Anyway I will not buy their products again.  I don't downloads apps.  It's just a mean thing to do to your customers."
"I'm disappointed. Tomorrow, I start my vacation, and I was willing to use this camera, and I will, but not as intended. I got a lot of bike attachments, which is great for bikers, although I'm not interested in those.However, I'm missing the promised double charger for the batteries although I received the charger cord (thanks...). The ad is also misleading because it implies that I could see my selfie through the small frontal screen, which is absolutely false (see attached screenshot of the ad). True, I could have checked the official webpage, which states that the small screen is to read battery level and such, not selfies.AKASO is a great brand, and I loved it, but their store on Amazon made me change my mind."
"Saw this on sale, purchased right before an Alaska cruise. Only had time to verify camera worked indoors but did not have time to check quality of camera outdoors in real world use.  Which was very unfortunate as there was the loud rattle covering all the recorded audio other purchasers of this camera have reported.  By the time I came back from my extended vacation the return date had passed and I could not get my money back or a replacement for this piece of junk!Very poor engineering design if you cant make buttons that do not rattle. Freaking amateurs!The rest of the deal with this camera: The image stabilization is so-so, even for a cheap camera.The camera would automatically turn off on its own, even with fully charged batteries and empty SD card...I had it attached to the top of my helmet after starting recording,  went on a cruise shore excursion mountain bike ride but only had video of the first 10 minutes of the ride...great views of the parking lot but none of the wonderful Alaskan scenery I was hoping to capture.Use of the camera outside of the waterproof case was difficult...no way to mount it to any clip or mount without the case.Verdict: even though you can get this cheap it is not worth whatever you end up paying."
"The camer has good modes for video, photo, timelapse and others.  The main drawback is the quality.  Video and Photo is very grainy.  Could be the encoders used in the device.  Even with the highest quality settings, the videos are always grainy.  Even tried lower resolution settings, and the results are.the same.  My old Hero and Virb have much better quality eventhough they are only 1080 capable.  I would not recommend this device is looking for high quality recordings."
"My daughter wanted to get a camera that could go underwater for our trip to Aruba. After researching several, I found this camera that seemed to have great reviews. At first it worked well, although slightly difficult to figure out which buttons to press, especially underwater. The pictures were okay quality, although it was hard to see what we were looking at in the pictures even though the water was super clear. On our fourth day of using the camera, we went scuba diving. However, being that it was our first time we did not go deeper than 20 feet. The product claimed to be waterproof up to ""131 feet"" when using the waterproof case. When we got out of the water, we realized that the case had not been waterproof and and our camera had water in the screen. Thankfully, we were able to quickly take out the card with our photos on them, dry it off, and load them onto the computer when we returned home. However, the camera can no longer be used. For the price paid for this camera, I expected it to at least provide high quality pictures and be durable for our trip. It was disappointing that we could not use it for the rest of the trip and I would exercise extreme caution if purchasing this product for any underwater adventures."
Don’t get this if you’re looking for sound. It is not good.
"UPDATE: I formatted each micro SD card in the camera instructed. But, when I tried importing the pics/videos to my iPad none of the pics on the cards were recognized.  Finally (after 9 hr (literally) of trying everything I knew, I called Apple.Turns out, this camera does not create a DCIM root folder so my iPad could not find any of the pictures on the cards.This is a pretty major deal & should be fixed.My original post: I have 2 underwater cameras already. The first was a original GoPro and the 2nd is a SeaLife DC 1400.  The Sealife was easy to set up and easy to switch between video and stills but the shutter speed was SLOOOOWWW!  The GoPro never got too much water time because you could never tell whether it was on/off or which mode you were in - a general pain to use.  I have to say there is NO comparison to the setup process between the GP and the AKASO!  The AKASO  was SO EASY to set up. I downloaded the instructions (tiny print but legible) and the rest was amazingly simple. I also found out I can take a still pic while video taping something. Now (to me) that's a WOW!  We aren't leaving for our dive vacation for another couple of weeks but I'm excited about using this camera. (I'll update my ratings on stabilization and water resistance when we return). Friends that are already on a dive trip (they have this camera) have been sending pics back and each one has been sharp, clear images.  Can't wait to use it myself"
"I ordered this product for work hoping that I could save a few bucks and still get done what I needed - which was to document walkthroughs at customer sites for reference purposes.  I ran into multiple problems right out of the box.1.  The format feature didn't format the card - at least it didn't after the original format as I attempted to reformat the card after recording some videos and the videos were still there even after multiple iterations.  Seems to be a definite issue there... possibly indicating other underlying problems.2.  This is the main reason that I'm sending this camera back.  It came with 2 batteries.  I charged both up before playing with the camera.  The next morning one battery was completely dead.  I can't afford to have batteries that don't keep their charge, and I didn't have time to deal with support sending me new ones - so the whole thing got returned.3.  Image stabilization does not work in 4K.  Not sure if this is just an issue with the stabilization not being supported at the high resolution, or if it's a problem with the firmware, or what.  I didn't ding them for this issue, but it's something that everyone should be aware of.  I honestly didn't have time to play around with upgrading firmware or fiddling with settings or calling support.  I just needed a product that works right now.  I know that the GoPro Hero5 doesn't provide stabilization in 4K either so I might have just missed it on their spec sheet.4.  Battery door isn't hinged.  I'm noting dinging them for this as it's more of a design preference, but the door comes off completely when you are changing the battery - which means that changing batteries in unstable environments is a recipe for disaster.  At the very least it should have a tether to keep if from disappearing and resulting in the camera not being un-usable until you can find a piece of tape.Bottom line - if you are looking for a camera for your kid to play with on his bike - or something that could end up being destroyed - then this is the way to go.  The lower resolution settings seem to work well.  And I see reviews from people saying that they stand behind the batteries and will ship you new ones - I just didn't have time to wait around for replacmeents to arrive."
"I bought 2 cheap action cams.  ""I don't need a good one,"" I thought because I'm not doing anything ""action"".  It's just sitting on a tripod.But these cheap ones have poor software, poor everything.  They aren't bad to use.  But the mic went out on this one within a year.  My $40 lasted longer.Now that the Hero9 is finally down to $200, I grabbed one.  I expected it to be better of course.  But it's not just ""better"".  It's exponentially is every single way better.  It's ""free Android"" phone vs. iPhone 12 quality, weight, software, etc.I know you think you don't want to drop the money on a GoPro.  Neither did I.  But, after spending $120 on cheap action cams and finally getting a GoPro... I get it.  The GoPro is in a league of it's own.  Just suck it up and get it and don't fiddle around with this toy with OK image quality, horrible audio, poor construction, and limited use.Oh, and if you're actually looking to use it for action where you need stabilization, then you simply have no choice.  You need to upgrade to the GoPro."
"Pros:Comes with a wide variety of attachments; I used the helmet attachment and it worked great (was stable, took decent pics and videos).The only thing you need to buy is the microSD card (with caveat below)Very small and light.I wrapped the remote band around my bike handlebars and it worked well.For the price, it's a great product; I have a few more days to decide if I'll keep it or not, and I'll probably keep it despite the problems.Cons:The Android app doesn't work at all; seems to be a longstanding issue that has not been fixed by the company in a long time, according to the comments.  It works one time and then never again (unless you reinstall the app).  So depending on your computer inputs, it might be difficult to get your photos and videos off of the phone (I am removing the microsSD card from the camera and inserting it into an adapter that fits into my computer's SD slot).The attachment that is supposed to attach the phone to bicycle handlebars is simply too small to fit around my standard-sized handlebars. It's useless for that.I contacted the company to ask if there was another attachment, and it was obvious that there was a language issue and they just didn't understand what I had asked; they also gave that one (unhelpful) reply and I had no way to reply back to it to clarify.Documentation is incomplete and difficult; youtube video has no words and it took a few times to figure it out."
"Components to attach yo my ebike failed within 2 weeks, now I can't attach it to my bike for rides"
It was an OK camera to start with but the video quality and time before it dies wasn't really worth it. If you just want a camera super cheap then it's great but if you have the money then buy a real one.
"I bought it for my scuba diving/ snorkeling trip. Took some videos for couple snorkeling no problem, but it got flooded on my first scuba dive (max depth 89ft). Never came back to life."
"I purchased this specifically for a special trip for snorkeling only to discover that it was a complete waste of money. I cannot begin to say how utterly disappointed I was when I discovered it did not work in the water. It constantly shut off, the remote did not work at all, so it did nothing for me to attach the camera to my mask. I tried it by hand, but I'm not a strong swimmer that turned into great frustration. I ended up purchasing a $7.00 phone pouch at Target for my cell phone that worked better. Still not as good as having a remote for a camera I didn't have to hold onto, but it was better than nothing at all. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Not even my worst enemy."
"I like this camera, I'm a beginner so it's great for me, also the price is good. Im a seasonal film maker...so its not going to be used all year long..Great Value for your buck"
"This Camera has good resolution and Stabilization. I use it on my Polaris Rzr whild riding with a group in the desert, hunting, camping, and hiking. I purchased an hohem iSteady Pro 4 3-Axis Gimbal Stabilizer to use with it, but found it would not pair with the Gimbal because Akaso does not release the information needed to allow other devices to pair. I called Akaso and the agent I talked with said their cameras only pair with Akaso accessories. I asked if they have a 3 axis gimbal and they don’t. She told me there is no one else I could talk to regarding this issue. I told the agent that if there is not communication path to managers of executives that can make the decision to share information required to pair, they must not value their customers input. I have had this camera too long to send it back, but will send back a new Brave 8 and buy a GoPro. I wish I could express to someone at Akaso that lack of listening to customers and a lack of allow other products to pair will cost them sales, but I guess they do not care about that."
"I bought this camera to use mostly on my motorcycle rides. Straight out of the box, the camera wouldn't record video. It would have the video recording icon, show the counter, but when I would try to play it back, received an error message that said ""no data"". It would take pictures just fine. I formatted the card like your supposed to, even tried another new card, read the instructions to no avail. I really like the functions and options of this camera and hope I just got the rare bad camera and a bad product isn't the norm. I had to get a refund. When I buy a new one, I'm going to get the pro version. Hopefully it'll work better. Really liked all the accessories that it came with. Lost a lot of really good video footage over this."
"I mainly bought this so I could have a relatively cheap waterproof ""camera"" for when I'm paddling, being less interested in the action cam properties. And I was not expecting features and quality on par with the GoPros that cost 3-4X as much. So far, I've been pleasantly surprised with the quality. It takes great pictures and video, although the quality suffers a bit if it's overcast or low light. The waterproof case works really well, and some of the extras like the remote control wristband are a nice addition. Some other thoughts:Pros:- Fantastic price for what you get- Good to great quality photos and video- Comes with lots of accessories/attachment options- Did I mention the price? Really, that to me is the main selling point for this camCons:- Weak digital zoom, pictures can turn out grainy on zoom if camera not stabilized- Attachments are a bit clunky, for some applications you have to connect multiple pieces together- You can't transfer pics/videos directly to your computer via USB cable, you either have to take the Micro SD card out and use a card reader, or transfer via your phone (which I found the software to be lacking)Bottom line: a great entry level action cam if you're on a budget, or just want to test the waters before committing to a more expensive option."
"(newest, last review edit) After being replaced with a newer model (v50) for a chance at a new review (below), this camera still has problems. The pictures and video look good, but the camera randomly rejects the cards, even after taking multiple photos & videos. Two manufacturers, three sizes, card does not matter. The camera loses its mind and claims Card Error - even after factory reset and card format. Following a few rounds of resets, the camera will work again - just long enough to prove it can work but then chooses not to. Do not recommend.**********(old, second review) Akaso customer service reached out in response to the below review and offered a replacement camera (or refund) supposing that the Brave 4 was defective. I don't like fuss, but hey - I have the time, so I accepted their offer. Akaso sent a V50 pro as a replacement and it performed beautifully. The picture quality is better on this V50 than the Brave 4. Now I look forward to taking fun and pointless underwater photos. I have upgraded my review from one to four stars even though the replacement camera is a different model; the persistent customer service really saved this purchase for me. Also, only four stars because of the fuss and (sounds like, from my and other reviewers) possibility of a dud and the time to get it resolved - i.e. if you're hoping to use it right after you receive it, you risk a hassle, disappointment, or it might work fine straight off.**********(old: This is the worst digital camera I've ever had the misfortune to use. I have no idea why there are so many five star reviews for this thing. The picture quality is TERRIBLE, even in daylight, stabilized, highest settings, with or without the waterproof case. I am sorry I threw away the packaging, because this should have been returned immediately.Do yourself a favor and find another camera.)"
"I am the first time customer of Akaso. I regretted that I chose Akaso over Go Pro or DJI cameras. Firstly, When I open the package, the camera doesn't have manual. I have find a manual online to navigate it. This is annoying. Secondly, the camera has system errors such as no setting function (so I can't set the camera), no preview option for videos that I recorded, etc. I have to go through the whole process of contacting Akaso customer service. And after all, Akaso Cuatomer service rep asked me to return the product as they do not know what happened to it. I am very upset. I purchased this Camera for my upcoming trip in next few days but the camera is cheaply made and not function. And now I do not have Camera for my trip. And I have to wait for them to receive the product first before I can get refunded. Horrible. DO NOT BUY IT."
"We've had this camera for a couple months. I've got some great videos on it, and some not so great. Video quality is surprisingly nice for the camera itself, but it's not user friendly. the wifi is difficult to connect to, so i couldn't upload my videos and images to my mac. I have to actually take the SD card out and upload them to my MAC that way. While underwater it's nice, but unless you really make sure it's on record it won't catch anything. There's been multiple times i have hit start, i have hit the top button, the front button, i can physically see the red blinking light that signifies i'm recording, to come home to nothing as if they have all vanished in thin air. Full battery, SD cleared, there's just no explanation. It is discouraging to say the least as i've missed some great videos and 'once in a lifetime shots' because of this. very very frustrating. So far this is used for our kids, i let them have this and got a GoPro like i should have in the first place and the GoPro is much better. Spend the extra money and get a GoPro. There's no reason it should be a 'hit or miss' when recording after hitting the record button. Like ever."
The product works great at 1080p however the 4k video isn't great quality probably due to the lens they use. 4k seems to be very faded look slightly grainy look.  We took this with us to Hawaii and the underwater shots were great with the 1080p but when i switched to 4k those shots were just not good.  I ended up recordiing the rest of our trip in 1080p 60fps and they came out great.  So if your wanting a 1080p camera this does work great for that.  I would look elsewhere for 4k however.
"**Edit: Dropping to one star because the charger has now quit working, so this thing is useless.**This is a neat little camera. Takes pretty good pictures, the remote is handy. It comes with a lot of accessories that I don’t really need. I only got it to mount on my dash so I could take pictures without picking up my phone. I use the remote to snap the pic. With it being as small as it is, it’s tough to see the display while driving but for my purposes that’s ok. HOWEVER… the batteries are junk. I can have the screen on sleep mode, that way I just click the remote to wake it up and click again to snap the picture. That part works really well, there’s no delay so I can get it almost immediately. But power only lasts for a couple of hours, if that, while taking no pictures. But the more pictures taken, the faster it drains.Unfortunately for me I didn’t use it until past the return date so I’m stuck with it.Would have given it one star but the quality of the pics is worth something."
The night vision needs to be added on this camera
Just for the money u can use it. Not really good quality. When ur recording u will be hearing the low quality sound and u can also hear the camera button sound as well. Video quality it’s kind a low compared to others. I felt maybe they can add some guiding on moods changes. I spend long time to figuring out.
"My experience has been limited but good - easy set up, lots of ways to connect it to your bike, helmet, backpack or whatever.  I have no idea how this device compares to others but it seems to work well for me.  Now, I have never played anything back that I have recorded so I can not address the quality of the video!!! However, be aware that the battery only last about 30 minutes.  You have two batteries and its easy to switch out and recharge quickly. I also don't understand all the settings and they need work to simply the differences for guy's like me.  Hope this helps.  cheers"
"I was really disappointed that after taking some pictures, I removed the chip and tried to read the pictures into my phone, and then my computer as well.  In neither case could they read them.  The pictures are saved in some strange unheard of format.  I guess I should try the WIFI before just throwing it away, but I didn't want to hassle with it.  For now, it is just taking up space in my house.  I wanted something I could afford to loose to sink underwater to see what I could see, but no use if I can't get the pictures off the camera...."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                I had lost my Gopro about a year back and i wanted to buy a new one, and i was trying to debate whether i spend the full 400$ on a gopro or not, and i seen this camera with awesome reviews.Upon unboxing, the camera was pretty stout, the waterproof case seemed as strong as the gopro counterpart, i was surprised by the amount of accessories that was included with the camera. There are a few items that fall short of gopro, such as the non waterproof case which has a poor fit and finish.Video Quality - Video quality was grainy in all settings. The attached video was shot in 4K at 10AM, decent lighting. I expected with the good reviews that the camera would have shot a cleaner, crisper video, but unfortunately i was let down, substantially.Audio Quality: This is where i was disappointed the most. Audio quality is extremely poor. I wouldn't even expect this horrible sound quality with a 1990s Nokia Cell phone. it is alright less than 10', even though it sounds muffled even with the non waterproof case (see video), after 10' the audio barely picks up my voice and if it did, i sounded like a creeper with that voice changer making stalker phone calls. In my opinion, POOR quality is to say the least.So yea its cheap, easy to use, but if you're looking to start a project with any kind of quality, this is not the camera to use."
So far looking at pictures. Examining every single piece. Downloading manual. Everything we can think of but cannot figure out how this would mount to a car window or dash. Anyone done this? We’re on the road about to enter Mexico so no ability to get extra pieces and suspicious it’s missing something. Pretty complicated setting it up for our intended spot. Don’t even know if the camera works well because we were waiting to mount it to use it.
"Very harsh distortion when riding a motorcycle . I tried it inside and outside waterproof case , also with the optional external microphone.  Needs a way to turn down  the microphone gain."
"This camera seemed to have all the bells and whistles which is why I purchased it.  I have not used it for awhile since I bought it for a trip, which didn't happen.  However, I took it to our swimming pool several days ago and the first thing I noticed was that the rear screen is totally unusable in the bright sun.  Just can't see it.  Second, after getting home and uploading the picture memory card into my computer the card did not seem to want to go back into the camera.  It's a push to lock in, and then push again to have it pop out.  I finally got it in, but it wouldn't pop back out.  I had to take a straight pin to finally coax the card out and now when I try to reinsert it the card won't stay in.  It's a shame.  It takes decent pictures."
"The camera itself is good for the price and performs well.  Lots of the usual accessories for pretty cheap, no complaints there.However, the usability of this device is woefully inadequate.  Try to transfer pictures back to your computer, whats the first thing you thing would work?  Plug the camera in via the USB port to transfer files?  Nah, that just charges the camera and doesn't give you the option to transfer files for some reason?  My PC won't even recognize that a storage device has been connected when the camera is plugged in.So your other option is to hope your machine has a card reader or to buy an external one... only the SD card is a pain in the butt to insert and remove from the camera.Transfer via wi fi?  Well... you have to use a smartphone app, and you have to connect to the camera's own wifi connection, requiring you to switch your wifi connection on your phone back and forth.... and of course the apps that you use to connect to the camera are painfully bad.Make this camera easier to move files off of and you'll get more stars."
"Update: My warranty claim was proceed and they claim they are issuing a full refund for the camera once it has been inspected but I have to pay for shipping back which is silly because their product failed. They should pay to return it because their product failed.I purchased the camera in October 2023 for a Thanksgiving 2023 cruise to Mexico. The reviews look good so I gave it a shot.I had a scuba diving trip booked in Cabo. My first time using the camera and the camera leaked and the displays died.I was descending to look at a wreck when I noticed the first drops of water in the camera case at about 30 ft. Since I was on a paid dive tour, if I surfaced I lost my dive and could not descend again because it was a guided dive and they would leave without me. I was not sacrificing a $180 dive to maybe save a $70 camera.At about 60ft depth there was enough water in the camera for the camera to shut off. Since it was my first of 2 dives I lost the picture memories of this 2 dive experience.Unfortunately my return window closed and cannot return. I have filed a warranty claim.Be warned. The camera case leaks and will kill your camera if you try scuba diving with it."
"I've had this camera for more than a year and have played with it off and on. By ""played with it"" I mean trying to get it out of the package.The plastic outer part is screwed into a huge plastic case, and no matter how much you turn a screwdriver, it does not release. It only strips the screw more and more. Soon the screw will be completely smooth so there will be no hope of unscrewing it.Somebody in the Q&A section said to squeeze the tabs and pull it out instead of removing the screw. That doesn't work either.Next week I'm visiting family and the kids want to go swimming, so I'd like to use this to make underwater videos. I've been messing with this thing all day and it DOES NOT COME OFF OF THE PACKAGE!!!Also there's a cardboard box packed full of little accessories with no labels or instructions of any kind to explain what they are. The ""Quick Start Guide"" is useless, since you have to have the product off of the packaging before you can start step 1.I'm immensely frustrated with this thing. I should have returned it as soon as I bought it and couldn't get it off the package, but I didn't have much time to work on it and thought I'd figure it out later.Later never came.I wish I could give this camera zero stars. Haha, ""camera"". It's not a camera. It's a puzzle. It's not even the fun kind of puzzle. I hate this thing."
It says it can shoot in 4k but that’s not the results I got. You are getting what you pay for  I will try to upload some videos.
The camera got stuck on Russian and I couldn`t get it to English.  After several hours of searching for a solution I asked and got a refund.
"I bought the Akaso Brave 4 just before a snorkeling trip since the GoPro was out of my price range. It seemed to have a good deal of happy customers, so I went with it. I was extremely disappointed. I'm a professional photographer, so I know camera gear, though this is my first action camera and video is admittedly not my specialty. But this camera lacked any semblance of intuitiveness. The  menus were terrible to navigate which makes changing settings quickly virtually impossible. To me, being able to change settings to match the dynamic circumstances is an absolute must--and honestly was a deal-breaker for me. Perhaps it would've helped had Akaso included some instructions on navigating the menus and explaining settings. Also, the camera housing as well as the ""extras"" that were included seemed to be of very cheap quality. Even in my test run in a pristine pool on a bright sunny day, I was unable to see my subject on the screen.  Maybe I just got a bum product--though the water-proof housing did work. Then I downloaded the app to transfer videos via wifi. But after I read the terms of service and found that by using the app you give Akaso full rights to your videos, I bailed. No way I'm giving anyone rights to my work. Over all, I was very disappointed and should've ponied up the money for the big name camera."
"I was very confident purchasing this camera after reading some reviews. But the biggest issue is, you can’t view your videos on anything other than the actual camera’s tiny screen. I bought the exact SD card recommended by the company and it will not playback videos. The first frame of movement occurs, then nothing. I tried different video resolution, different exposures but nothing fixed the problem.I did a time-lapse video which looked great *on the camera* but once it was transferred to my computer ( and I tried MAC and PC, laptops and desktops) the video would only playback with partial frames and much of the video was filled with green pixelation even at the lowest resolution settings.I also made videos of various lengths and each time it played back ok on the camera but it was impossible to transfer a real video to a computer. There was always a playback issue.Another really important issue is battery life! The battery only lasted for about 30-40 minutes. So, I plugged the camera in while it was recording but when you do that, the camera makes a very loud and annoying ticking sound when recording - which gets recorded along with actual acoustic audio on the video!Customer service never responded to my inquiries. Don’t waste your time or money on this toy. It does. Not. Work. As. Advertised.It was a complete waste of time and complete waste of money.Spend a little more and get a GoPro."
Haven’t gotten to use it did come with a memory card which it did not clarify that it needed one.
I really wanted to like this camera. Small and light still photography and video waterproof to 130 feet. Unfortunately it leaked at about 50 feet.The warranty must be activated within one week of delivery. I didn’t even take it out of the box in that first week. The return window is 30 days which is before my return from the family vacation. Apparently Akaso does not have much faith in their product.
I took this camera on a dream 2 week trip to Raja ampat. It lasted less than 1 dive. I noticed water in the housing and soon after the camera died. Cannot power on to get my photos out. Air bubbles would come out in the water when buttons such as zoom were pressed. It's a piece of crap.  The photos I did take were ok on previous snorkels.
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Purchased this on a whim as it was a sale item. Camera is very typical of the variously branded Chinese manufactured action cams. Contrary to other's experience I found set up and use to be pretty straight forward. Manual is not great but not horrible either. It definitely helps to have some prior experience with action cameras.The remote button is very handy and seemed to work well. The camera functioned fine out of the box.Image quality is average at best. In comparison to my several year old GoPro Hero Session as well as my Garmin dash cam the video had a lot of artifacts and was just not crisp. You can especially notice this in the sky in the video I uploaded. (This video was shot in a 1080 / 60 fps configuration) I kind of expected this going in so I am not hugely disappointed. Note that the video I uploaded was recorded with the camera hanging upside down from my windshield which is why the text is upside down.I didn't notice a significant difference between video with image stabilization on or off.If image quality is very important to you I would look elsewhere. If you are looking for a cheap alternative to a GoPro that produces an ok video this will work. In my case I wanted something that I wouldn't be hugely upset over losing if it flies off my motorcycle and this fits that bill.Some other notes; 1) I never attempted to test water resistance 2) I haven't used it long enough to evaluate battery life
"for the price,  great pictures. Underwater visual clarity was great too. The user interface requires some practice before your event, so You are familiar with finding menus, etc.For underwater, when the camera is in its waterproof  box, you cannot hear anything from the mic (other reviews said this too but I still bought it).One big problem I really disliked, which caused me to miss some underwater snorkeling video, was that I couldn't tell when camera's video recording mode was turned on. There is only a tiny  flashing red light on display, to tell you that you have in fact pressed the tiny record button properly.  It is too difficult to see the flashing red light, when you are outside in bright light, and there is a couple seconds delay, making you think its not on, so you press it again, and now you have just turned it off. lastly, when recording in 4 k, the video files are huge. If you try to copy  a dozen or so of them to an iPhone, it takes forever, or times out. I gave up. I have an iPhone 7, but I had plenty of available memory.  I didn't try the remote control wrist band, perhaps that would've helped."
"This camera is a good value as far as the video is concerned. However, when used for motorcycle in motion video the audio is horrible. I've tried it in several positions and when compared to my GoPro Hero3+ in the same positions the Hero3+ audio is so much better. The Brave4 has too much wind noise in almost every position used regardless if I used a case with an open back or completely sealed.As much as I want to like this I'll stick with my Hero3+. Bummer."
"Some things to note:1. Product description says: ""Recommend to use max 64gb class 10 micro sd card."" Actually, any memory card greater that 64 GB WILL NOT WORK in this camera. Product listing should be updated to give ACCURATE information.2. You may want a U1 or U3 memory card—those are the classifications that are FASTER than Class 10.3. You need a mini screwdriver to open the battery cover, which is made from fairly flimsy plastic. BE CAREFUL!4. Some reviews said that there is no battery charger, so I bought one separately...only to find out that there IS a battery charger included.5. There is no manual included with the camera, not even to indicate what should be in the package and identify the various items. However, you can download a manual from the Akaso website. Expect to be mystified by how to use some of the accessories.6. ""Waterproof"" case sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. It leaked and the camera got wet. Removed battery immediately and the camera revived after it dried out...but I wouldn't count on the waterproof case for your scuba trip."
Make sure you aren't intending to use the internal microphone for anything important. The video quality is good and it comes with a lot of mounting options. It's great if you are planning to capture audio from a different source.
I've had this camera for only a few months. Went scuba diving one time. Waterproof after 8 pictures were taken case started leaking and camera stopped working. We were only in the water for 15 min  when it stoped working and did not go any deeper than 35 to 40 feet. Save your money and buy a gopro the first time
"I like the camera. But I did receive mine with an SD card that did not work. I was able to borrow one to make sure everything worked fine, but it is kind of a bummer that the one included was bad."
"I will give a five stars after they replace my camera or package.  No digital fonts on main menu,  manual doesn't match camera.  Been working with their tech support since I bought the package and return to them for the replacement.  Instructed not to go through Amazon.With that being said,  camera quality is excellent as well as video, once they told me how to get the pecs and videos.Jury still out on this camera functionality of its menus."
"I recently purchased this camera, and while I haven’t done extensive testing, my initial impressions are that the video and sound quality are quite decent for the price. However, the reason for my low rating is the packaging.I consider myself a strong person, but unboxing this product was incredibly frustrating. It felt like they used industrial-strength glue. After cutting the clear tape, I expected the lid to lift off, but no—it was glued shut, and I had to resort to using a knife. When I finally got to the camera, it was glued to a platform as well. It took me 10 minutes just to free the camera. Why make it this difficult?I always try to open packaging carefully in case I need to return the product, but with this one, it was impossible not to damage the box. This level of packaging is excessive and unnecessary."
Use this on my helmet for bicycling.  Have to continually restart the recording function as it keeps stopping while riding.  Video clarity is good.
"What can I say, this is definitely a solid budget camera option but, still leaves a few things to be desired. The menu and set up is a bit clunky and no matter what settings I've tried it's hard to get crisp smooth action videos from my mountain bike. Still when doing slower activities it works well. The internal microphone is awful though."
"I should’ve known right from the start… There were more straps and no kidding, Zip ties, included in the packaging - but not the essentials of a SIM card. The camera itself is very small, it literally fit inside my fist.I returned it almost immediately."
"I was so excited to get an action camera! This was a great price, but was quickly disappointed! After 2 minutes it would shut off, did not stabilize my video so it made it worthless for what I was using it for on my motorcycle! Had fun editing but you have to take your phone and put on its connection only, so you will not have any wifi or data during that."
"Bought to use on our first out of the country trip. I got it all set up, charged, and we took it out. Had a wonderful day of deep sea fishing and 45 minutes of snorkeling if that. In between uses it was off and stored in a bag out of the sun. When we returned to where we were staying, we powered it on. It showed a bit less than half a battery. A couple minutes of looking through photos it was turned back off for us to eat dinner. It would not power back on. We removed the battery and replaced it with a charged on. We tried again when the case showed blue. The camera still would not power on. The red light was on and blinked when the battery was removed but the camera was unable to be used. We had another day of cave tubing planned which would have been perfect to have the camera for. Very upset that it would not turn back on. Definitely put a bit of a damper on our trip not having a back up plan for taking pictures.Cannot recommend this camera without having a back up plan ready."
I got excited with the price and the raving reviews for the price. But the quality of the pictures and the videos were actually really bad even for the price in my opinion. I can just make better picture and videos with my smart phone instead of spending almost $100 and carrying around extra sets of tools.
It seems to be very difficult to set up to use  I still have a hard time to connect to my phone
"Spend the money and get a GoPro, this one looks slick and maybe good for some action functions. DO NOT TAKE IT UNDERWATER! Was using it on our vacation snorkeling, in three feet of water no less and the seals on the buttons failed, allowed water intrusion. This use only lasted about 30 mins, half of that time the camera was out of the water. Very disappointed in this products quality."
"The instructions said it would accept an external mic, but only the Brave 4 Pro and above does. This really sucks. Recording is raspy and low."
The picture isn't as clear as I had expected.  Easy to use with great customer service.
"Nice picture, but the sound ""quality"" makes making any decent content impossible. I have better sound on a cam that was half the price, and even that is bad quality, but better than this more expensive one. Guess I'll have to find a wireless mic with mini USB or just cough up the money for an actual GoPro."
"The 1st camera came with no batteries,  and the memory card would not seat properly.  I returned it. The 2nd came with all the parts, but the sound quality is horrible. It picks up every vibration the bike has. I have a loud motorcycle and I can barely hear it over the vibration sound."
It Stop working while doing WiFi setup never turn on again and have missing memory card
"Now...first the positives.It does the work, small in size, capture the video. I used it mostly during cycling. Image stabilization is not great, but I did not expect it be too good for this price point.Two big negatives -1) It doesn't store the date/time settings forever. That means, if you set it up and remove the battery to charge, it will lose date/time settings. You have to set the date/time again. I confirmed this with their product support too.2) Two batteries were provided. Within 3 months, the battery no longer lasts for more than 30 mins. It dies in midway. Not what I wanted for my cycling needs."
Disappointed with this camera. The batter will. Not take a charge or the unit will not stay on for some reason.. Buyer beware
"I purchased this prior to my bike trip to Scotland.  I wanted an action camera which I could use while riding slowly or use without having to dismount.  I stared at the camera for weeks after unpacking it and didn't know where to begin.  I couldn't find any helpful videos or instructions for use.  Granted, I am totally unfamiliar with how to connect video/camera units to bikes or helmets.  Maybe some people have the skill set for this.  I am particularly handy around the house but couldn't figure any of the parts out.  I returned it."
It was supposed to have the SIM card in it and was not there. So now I have to pay again for another one. Not happy
The so-called quick start guide is a joke.  It's just a teensy piece of paper with pictures and arrows.  The online manual is even worse.  The instructions are extremely vague and difficult to understand.  I am now trying to figure out how to get my camera to let me put the time and date stamp on it AND format the bloody micro sd card.  I think this will go back to Amazon if I can't get this working in the next couple of hours as I need this badly TOMORROW.  Tech support is non existent.  I'm tearing my hair out trying to get this thing to work.
No batteries. No usb cable. No remote. No battery charger.
We went to 30 feet for a 30 minute dive and water proof case started leaking at some point during the dive. There is water behind the screen and the SD card is fried. Very sad and disappointing especially since it was my first dive.
This thing is 200% junk. Sound is horrible. It may or may not link up to your phone so you can see your video. Spend the money for something better.
It should be no stars!Action Camera missing!!!!Extremely upsetting! I have a trip coming up and can’t believe the “new” package is missing the main component.I made sure it the action camera was supposed to be in the box
Bought the one with the micro SD card included for a trip and it came without it. Now.i have no memory for my trip so in the process of trying to return it
It actually says on my package SD card not included. That's not what it says in the description.
"I bought this camera based on the great reviews it has on here to use while snorkeling my first time ever on a once in a lifetime trip. Needless to say the quality of pictures and videos we got were highly disappointing. Splurge for the GoPro, don’t waste your money on this junk."
"Ok camera but sucks that it's not touchscreen. Mic sucks it's better to turn it off.  Update 2 month after purchased, camera fell off mount again for 2nd time.  It's lost.  Mounta are cheap and become weak after sux exposure.  Don't hold camera well and end up detaching and falling off."
"This is not an easy product to use. The camera saying no as card. Hard to do anything with it. Trying to return it now. But Amazon is having ups pick it up, which I have to return the rest of this bundle to an ups store but not this. Very aggravating and I think I will end up not being able to return it."
Ordered bundle one received the camera.
Spent hours attempting to connect the wifi via the Go app. Total waste of a Saturday afternoon. Super disappointed AVOID
"Went diving in hawaii and within minutes the case flooded. Had to fight with warranty as they wanted me to pay for shipping. Would not recommend, just get a go pro."
"Broke in less than 30 days, used it 4 times.  Some time after writing first review company contacted me and replaced the camera, replacement works great no complaints, company customer service slow but excellent!!!"
It does not stay connected to phone. Worst buy ever!!!!!!!
"Cheap, foreign made garbage.  Cant connect to camera since it doesnt emit a wifi signal as indicated by the instructions that were written in Chinese first and then translated to English.  How trash like this can be sold legally is baffling.  Keep this garbage out of America."
this camera CANNOT be used for scuba diving case leaks
"This had so much going for it.  It’s budget friendly.  Comes with ton of accessories including extra battery and memory card so you don’t have to spend extra money to get started but at the end of it all, it’s all about video quality and that leaves much to be desired.Camera comes with a diving case, bike mount, camera frame, straps, charger cable and a charging box, remote, manual and 128gb memory card.  This really has everything you need to film your next adventure.  However, you may want to learned to use the device before jumping into action.Some crucial pieces of information are hard to decipher as it took me a while to figure out how to turn on wifi, which is to press and told the button on the top for few seconds.  Another was to switch the front and rear screen which is done by pressing the up button for couple of seconds.  It doesn’t support simultaneous display so you’ll have to toggle between front and rear screens.  Screen on the back is not a touchscreen and you’ll have to use the power button in the front to cycle through the camera modes and to enter the menu system.Unit by itself is not weather-sealed so you’ll want to have the diving case on if you expect to play in the elements, problem is that you’ll lose audio as it won’t record sound properly.  If you mount the camera on the open frame, you get sound but your camera is exposed to the elements and your memory card can accidentally pop out as well.Video quality is ok.  4K30 isn’t too bad but with the provided video card, some scenes were jumpy/glitchy.  1080/60 was better but other modes were pretty bad.  And the EIS could definitely use some improvements in algorithm as it’d be difficult to shoot video handholding this camera.  I was surprised that built-in mics were pretty decent.Having used both DJI and GoPro, I wanted to see if budget device would work just as well.  I would’ve been happy with 80% of the performance but I may have been too greedy.  App integration as well as user interface alone makes it worth spending extra.  This may serve well for children’s activities but if you want quality footage, I think it’s better to save your money and get a DJI or GoPro."
"But it's close. Only because I'm old, and used things like the original Connectix QuickCam...It does technically produce video at 4k@30fps, but it's definitely upscaled from something else.I can't reliably get anything but VLC to play it back.It comes with a bunch of accessories, which is cool. One of those accessories is integrated into the package itself, and that's NOT cool, as it's glued onto it.For the money, it's probably fine."
"Bought this to use as a dash cam on bicycle trips, and it's not usable in the dashcam mode: the new movies don't overwrite the old movies from previous sessions, so you run out of space on the sd car very quickly. There is no sestting to overwrite _all_ old files.Any time there is sun in the frame, you pretty much can't see anything... other action cams are _much_ better at getting rid of the glare."
Picture quality sucks and battery life is very poor. Everything it comes with feels very cheap.
"3/10/24. Took this down 19 ft, to swim with hammerheads, on Bimini, for my birthday. It flooded in the first half hour. Terrible product"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I picked this up for use as a cheap camera to take with me to the range; Something I can toss in my range bag and use with my spotting scope to capture groups from a distance.Overall, it's.. Well, it's not great. It's about as good as a budget webcam, and the sensor is really rough, with lots of artifacting overall, even in bright outdoor light, as you can see from my video.Colors are fine outdoors; a bit saturated, but that's not uncommon with cheaper cameras.Indoors it is ROUGH; note the poor quality of the guitar photo in low-light situations, which.. Honestly, even in good lighting it is really sketchy.Image stabilization was surprisingly decent for light movement, but if you're running on a rough surface like gravel or a bumpy road (with something that has little shock absorption itself)? You're gonna get a lotta shake in what you shoot (I didn't have a good way to test this right now, and was outside my use case anyway).Batteries are fine, and based on my testing should be about what they plug here. One advantage is you do get 2 batteries with this thing, at least.Overall.. For the money, I'd say it's fine to play around with or use infrequently, but if you're looking to get some really good video quality in an action cam, get a GoPro or something else higher-end.Also: Packaging was interesting. It was mounted to part of the packaging, and gave you instructions to remove it (including ""Give the mount buckle a hard pull""). Inside the box with all the extras was a crap-ton of individually packaged mounts, straps, batteries, charger, and more just.. Stuffed in there, with no organization, period. Also, it relies on an online manual, so hopefully the company doesn't end up 404ing it down the road for someone who buys this after it's been out a good long while."
This camera is basically a piece of Chinese junk. Anything more than smooth walking or still shots gets the content shaky and choppy. I bought it to mount on my motorcycle helmet to take videos and it's a total waste after several attempts just choppy cutting out after 20 seconds.  Save your money and buy a go pro!
the 4k is a lie the video is very granny at best it's 1080 upscaled. The wide angle lens is decent. image stabilization is good! I would highly not recommend save your money and get something that doesn't lie
"This camera was unusable out of the box, until I placed its latest firmware on a micro SD card and manually updated the camera's firmware. I should not be forced to tinker with a brand new camera. Do better, GoPro."
Stop assuming everyone has a smartphone. If I owned a smartphone I wouldn't need this. This is the stupidest setup ever.
I have GoPro 12 I needed a second one so I bought the 13 unfortunately it’s not sinking very difficult to use batteries not the same. I’m unsatisfied with this product. I’m returning it. Big disappointment. I should’ve read the reviews first.
Go pro was on 70% battery life and within a hour was already dead. Go Pro got super hot that I had to put it in front of the Air Conditioner. Anyone else have this problem?
worked for a day and now is dead don't waste your time
"**I haven't used or own a GoPro product since 2013, so went into this with pretty fresh and naive eyes**Pretty minimum kit that it comes with for the price.  You really only get the GoPro Unit, Power Cord, Batteries, and minimal accessories.I was particularly annoyed that right out of the box it said before you could use it you have upgrade it, and upgrading it required phone access.  Fortunately the setup wasn't painful.  I didn't fully turn it on to see if it was mandatory or if you can bypass it, but it would suck if you couldn't use it after purchasing it because you were soft locked out of it.I noticed it got EXTREMELY warm to the touch while it was charging, but never super hot.  It charged fairly quick with USB-C.As mentioned above setup was pretty easy.  After setting up an account it jumped right in.  Navigating the app was pretty easy.  Remote view and shooting seemed to take some time to connect but when it did connect things worked fine with no lag and ease of use.  I'm connecting to it with a Samsung S24 Ultra and it doesn't seem to have any issues at all.  For some of the extra features, the app does want you to have a paid account for the auto-upload to cloud option.  You can also use it as a streaming device, but I think that's been available for a while now, or at least I remember it being a thing back when covid and at home work stuff was popular.The video and still quality isn't bad.  It's a smaller sensor so I wasn't expecting much as I shoot video work on larger sensor cameras, but the results weren't disappointing.  If definitely looks a LOT better than the footage I still have in my archive from the gopros 12 years ago.  With good light and unique angles this can easily be part of video projects shot with higher end cameras.The screen on both the front and back are very easy to see and look decent, though I found it hard to see in really bright sunlight.Checking on the other review for this product, it looks like that reviewer had a hell of a time at the start.  It sounds potentially to be a server issue on Gopro's side.  I will say that there was zero issues online with the setup and it went without a fluke over here.  There's so many quality competitors now I can't really say this is a value unless you are loyal to the brand.  After not using a GoPro in over a decade it did feel like a A LOT of thought and execution has went into both the hardware and software of the product and it was easy to use, but at $400 it's a really bitter pill to swallow to say it's a great value."
"Just purchased the GP 13 for an upcoming weekend outing. Spent over 2 hours trying to get past setup screen, searching up other problems, etc. Kept getting stuck on ""Must Upgrade to Use"" screen. The Android Quik app was required to activate the device, but not supported. Unable to connect or to bypass the setup screen to use without the app. Contacted Tech support and they finally were able to have me download a manual update zip file, extract that to SD Card, update device manually. Then had to walk through complicated process to bypass the Quik app connection. Device now operable after 2 1/2 hours of my time, but still unable to use the Android Quik app, and tech support was able to give no ETA on it's availability, a week, a month who knows? I was a previous GoPro owner, but will be sending this back. Was there no QA done on this device for android users? VERY Disappointed."
Won't take picture or video without an update and won't update.  Told me to buy an SD card reader to try that.  Useless and I'm leaving on a huge trip.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I used this indoors for my first time. In room temperature settings, and I ended up having a shut off at eight minutes due to overheating. very disappointed, as I was super excited reading all the latest improvements, which was supposed to include no more overheating.We're getting too cold. so in the middle of a recording, it shut down due to heat. otherwise, I love that the interface is still the same so very user-friendly if you are a prior go pro. User of any older models. as long as I updated the gopro quick app, it was able to pair up my phone as the newest app has the newest hero thirteen. the resolution was of high quality for the videos I did record. i was able to use it very Easily without much instruction, due to the user settings.Staying pretty much the same with a few extra additives like GPS. it feels heavy duty and therefore is a bit heavier than my older models. love the front camera. love the fact that it has options to add other lenses. love that it is waterproof. only disappointment so far is the overheating issue once again. i am using the battery, it came with. it paired with my phone wonderfully and uploaded videos with no issues. arrived wonderfully packaged. this model is supposed to have an improved heat sensor to help deal with the overheating troubles of go pro.And so disappointed that nothing has changed."
"This thing is like a tractor... It can do a lot of things, but nothing well.I think GoPro doesn't improve much between version.  I have a Hero10 and now this Hero13, and to me they feel identical.  The only difference is the lens and mount under the unit.  It also have terrible comptability between different GoPro accesories, especially the one that plug into the USB-C port ! I have 2 GoPro USB-C audio adaptor from different generation, and both won't work like it should, one of them doesn't work well with the hero 10 neither and only on the hero 9... There is no reason but they cripple their own hardware to force you to buy more.Also the software is buggy still, even my hero10 I have to take out the battery at time to get it to work again.  Also plugging in accessories, even the correct one on previous version would not work all the time.So my experience with gopro isn't great !  But it is used by a lot of people, and it does certain things very well, like the stabilization is pretty good with it during day time.The type of issues you might get, you start recording and you expect GPS info to be recorded, but it is not... Because if you start recording before GPS capture, you get no GPS for your whole recording... It the type of things that come over and over again with it software.I've only used 360 camera from other brand, and they do have their issue as well, but I feel they are moving along much faster than gopro, and they don't seem to try to cripple their product to force you to buy the exact same product over and over again.  I'm happy to have tried this new version out, but it just the same old for my use case."
"The price and reviews were attractive, so I thought this camera would be a good starter camera for making my YouTube videos, but it's way too small for what I'll need.  I took everything out of the box and that's as far as I got.  Little/no directions were included (even after downloading the manual), and a box full of accessories with no indication as to what they're used for make it unusable for my needs.  I need to shoot from several feet away, and the rear facing camera is way too small for me to see what the camera is capturing.Might be a great little camera for others who know what they're doing, but of no use to me."
This camera gives clean and crisp photos .worth the proce
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            **update 11/14/24**finally got to test recording/photos, first the front lcd screen did not work. took a couple of photos and the quality is not 30M, more like 8MP quality. their app was kinda finniky as well. once you leave the WIFI settings in the camera, it disconnects.  will be returning for refund.packaging was pretty good, except the accessories were all jammed in a box.Set up was pretty easy, touch screen is very responsive. Haven’t tried to connect it to their app. but the image/display from the rear screen is pretty good. Can’t really take a good video of it starting up I was just using my phone. Came with extended warranty (36months) you just have to sign up.some cons IMO, battery charger is kinda looks like a toy, cheap, light plastic, I hope it won’t melt while charging the batteries. Another one was the helmet mount, I was hoping they’ll be a little curve but they’re very flat and won’t be able to use it on my helmet. I might end up using the bike/motorcycle handlebar mount instead.Overall, not bad for the price, got it on sale with extra $10 off.it’s 5 stars for now, i’ll update once I actually use it."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            From the reviews and the listed features this sounded like a camera I could really like.  As soon as I got it out of the box I set it up to my liking, 1080P@60fps, and went outside to test it.  I was impressed by what I was seeing on the small back screen,  Image was clear and coloration seemed very good.  The image stabilization looked great.  I shot about 6 minutes and took it inside to view. the results  First, I hate USB-C on action cameras.  Things only work with a provided cable on my laptop mostly.  Then the video.  I thought I was watching an old 8mm film.  ""Scratch"" lines appeared.  Not consistently but enough to ruin the video.  Watch my included video to see.  This camera is being returned now."
"I read all the reviews,  this does not hang for any level of you tube.  Battery life is low.  It shuts off all the time and fish eyes real bad.  I'm getting a go pro tomorrow."
Poor video quality and sound. Not too friendly to manage.
Does not record video at quality described and front screen is not functional.
"I got a low end action camera a while back and was hoping that this would be an improvement over that one.While this one is supposed to be higher resolution, it definitely has some pitfalls. I did a side by side comparison with the two cameras, so I'll state how this Hiicam camera compares, in general terms.This camera lens is not nearly as wide - which isn't really a bad thing as the extra wide lenses have unwanted distortion.White balance is more on the cool side, and actually closer to natural color. It could stand to be a little warmer though.Noise - the video is noisier than expected and quite disappointing. Even greater than the other camera. With luck this will be improved with great light levels, but not every video situation can be outside on a sunny day.Low light performance is horrible. I took this into a darkened room and the Hiicam was a completely black image, compared to the other which was dark, but recognizable. This certainly has a bearing on the noise, or I would expect it to.Larger variety of resolution and frame rates to choose from.Easy to use menu, but really the same as the other camera, just newer and upgraded.It does come with a lot of mounting accessories and the underwater housing, which I suppose is more than the higher end action cameras include. I don't have any idea how to use most of the items, but it's still nice to have. Also a big plus is the two included batteries and charger.Also included is a remote that doubles as a wireless microphone. I typically use an external microphone, but I'm intrigued about using this. I have not yet tried it or checked the sound quality. The video quality is the more important factor for the camera.When I ordered this camera, the listing had it priced at $20. Now I see that it's at $110. At $20, it's actually quite a bargain, despite the flaws. At $110, or really anything over $50, it's absolutely overpriced and I would recommend a hard pass."
"This camera comes with all sort of accessories, but despite the listing headline the time of this review reading ""With 64 GB Card"", this does not include a card. (There is even an image of a 64GB card shown on the first listing photo.) Yes, the last sentence of the listing — 5 paragraphs down! — does state that no memory card is included, but to advertise the card in the headline, show it on the main listing photo, then bury the fact that none is included seems a bit misleading."
It is so small I thought I’d like it but the camera quality sucks and it’s definitely not worth the price ! Not to mention the battery dies fast
"One of the main reasons I ordered this camera was because it was described as supporting HDMI output.  I read that in the description, saw an HDMI port in the photos and Rufus noted that this Icefox camera supported HDMI out.  Guess what.  When I received the camera there was NO HDMI output. I went back and double checked to see if I had misread the description, saw the photos incorrectly, and misunderstood what Rufus had noted. To my surprise the description no longer mentioned HDMI.  The photos still showed an HDMI port. Rufus still said the camera has HDMI out.  Just checked again and got the same results.  Beware of this seller.UPDATE: 11/09/2024 - I contacted seller and got the run-around.  They told me I had ordered the ""new"" camera which des not support HDMI.  I sent them photos of their videos on Amazon that show the camera with HDMI and I just checked Rufus again and it says the camera supports HDMI.  All of their 5 stars reviews are for the ""old"" camera that the seller is reusing.  I have no idea about what else they may have changed but the reviews do not reflect the current camera,  I am notifying Amazon of the sellers deceptive practices. Icefox camera they no longer have in stockUPDATE:11/11/2024 - This listing DOES NOT accurately reflect the Icefox camera you will receive.  When I notified the seller that there was no HDMI as shown, and Rufus says the camera has, they responded that I had ordered the ""new"" camera and that the old camera(listed) is out of stock. They did offer a refund. The photos and video representations have not been changed.  The reviews still belong to the ""old"" out of stock camera.Update 11/13/2024:  To their credit the seller is updating the Amazon listing for this camera and have removed the photos that show the HDMI port although Rufus still says the camera supports HDMI and the reviews for the old version are still being used.  Also I have discovered that the Icefox has motion detection capabilities which I have not seen on any other budget action camera. That is a plus for me. I have upped my rating a bit."
"Prosgreat pricelooks just like top end action cams - dji, gopro2 batteriesfollow up by companyConsBattery heats up within minutesinstructions could be betterIf this was slightky better, i'll not hesitate to buy it"
"I really looked forward to getting this camera for an upcoming event. New camera , new technology, likely far superior to my older action camera's I have been using for years. I am sad to say I was very disappointed. The video is really bad. Unless you throw a lot of light at this thing the video is blurred and pixelated like an image that has been overly smoothed. It's bad, it's really bad. The audio is no better. Unless you are talking right into the microphone it sounds like you are talking into a paper cup. I tried probably 50 different settings in different lighting from 4K to 1080P at 30FPS and it just never got any better. I am not one to leave bad reviews. I tend to chalk these things up as learning experiences and move on. But in this case I had to. I can not find one thing about this camera that performs to even reasonable expectations. I have several action cams from Amazon that cost half as much and work twice as well. I would recommend a high degree of caution before you buy this camera. It is in my opinion, just a very bad action camera in all respects."
"Bought this ahead of an upcoming trip where I plan on snorkeling + wanting to take time-lapse videos from the car ... the photos I took are great, but the video setting is concerning. In the video modes, there are horizontal lines across the screen. Thought maybe it was the waterproof casing (which worked great in the few minutes I had it submerged), but after removing it from the casing, using a lens cleaning cloth on both the camera and casing, then using the camera again with & w/o the casing, it's clear the issue is the camera. It's visible on the preview screen (as pictured) and in the video I took). Will be contacting the company to see what recourse I have (aside from submitting a return request to Amazon) ... if they resolve it, I'll update my review."
"Pros:-It's $80, not $300 like a GoPro-It has a bunch of accessories that have horrible instructions for how to use each piece properly-That's about itCons:-I have used it to record baseball games, mounted on a fence, in good lighting, and the picture quality is abysmal. It glitches during the recording process leaving trails on the objects moving in the images. Even objects in frame that are within 20-30 feet of the camera are blurry and lack crisp color separation.-There is no zoom feature on the camera, so it is a fixed focal length-The battery didn't even last a full baseball game (1 hr. 30 min.)-After my first use, the audio playback stopped working properly, and it sounded like a colony of bumblebees when listening to the recordings.-The function to record audio through a high quality sound device doesn't work, or I am using it improperly, but there are no instructions for how to correctly use itLook elsewhere."
I wanted to really like this product. The camera is great quality and the device came with a ton of accessories! The major issue was that the sd card keeps popping out and won’t stay inside to record footage which is the main reason I have to return it.
"First off, the value for this purchase is pretty decent. However, you get what you pay for. This camera claims 4k but it is far from so. The video and picture quality is simply subpar and does not live up to the standards of having crisp, clear footage that you would expect from an action camera, but it is functional and it does the job."
"Company wants a review right away, but the camera doesn't come with the SD card , well we just got our SD card and the camera works excellent outside of water. Can't wait to see how it works under water.."
"Received the product the next day. I was eager to try it out. I charged both batteries using the provided charger and USB wire. When I started the camera, it began but got stuck on the ""select mode camera"" screen. Despite various attempts, I couldn't proceed past this point. The power button only worked the first time, requiring me to remove and reinsert the battery to turn it on again. I'm returning this item and will reorder. I'll update my rating based on my next experience."
"Changing my review as this camera looked promising but only worked for 3 days. In addition to this, it overheated and ruined my SD card with valuable media on it. Stay away from this brand."
"Bought this camera 2 months ago. it worked great 2 times, now when I turn it on it just turns right back off even if it's plugged into power."
"Product comes with a whole lot of optional equipment, very well equipped.However it is a $50 camera so it does not have the feature set or quality of more expensive brands. It works okay but the battery life is poor and the menus and instructions are not intuitive or very clear. I found it difficult to work with because the touchscreen was not responsive when you wanted it to be, but very when it did things or changed that you did not want. You get what you pay for in the final analysis. It does work, but not it might be better to invest in a more robust product."
"I've been a professional photographer and video producer for 15 years. I bought this camera as a quick/cheap replacement for my Insta360 OneR that got destroyed while windsurfing.The Image is way over saturated, over sharpened, and over-compressed. Broad daylight video looks like it was shot at ISO 32000 with how badly the image is compressed.Colors themselves are relatively accurate for an action camera, but it's incredibly over saturated.Rolling shutter is horrendous. Just pure Jello with any movement. Completely unusable.4k 60FPS is a lie. The video file is in a container that indicates it's in 60FPS, but when interpreting the video file in Premiere Pro to a 24p timeline the truth comes out. It's still 30 FPS video, it's just doubling the same frames to make 60 per second, so when you slow the video down you get horrendously choppy video (the same effect as trying to slow 30 FPS video to the same degree).absolutely sending this back. Complete garbage. If the video files were actually 60FPS I could basically forgive most of the other IQ issues considering its ridiculously low price, but since that's not even the case, this thing is worthless."
Let's start off with the fact I was going to test this this weekend so I charged the batteries last night and woke up seen the batteries were fully charged I unplugged the charger and went to work came home to find the batteries died and they were never even used yet. I just thought what the heck. I never had batteries drain down without being used. What a joke there were literally sitting on charger base when I went to work that's all. I definitely can recommend or review this disappointing purchase. Please look for better camera don't waste your time or money on this.
"Please note: edit:Below is my original review. Today, 8 August 2023 - I received an email from the manufacturer saying it had addressed the issues I brought up in my review. Since it did not send me a revised camera, I cannot verify or dispute the manufacturer's claim.*****************For most modes, this action camera worked as claimed but I wasn’t particularly taken with it. Unlike some others, it’s not weather sealed much less waterproof as the Web page claims. It did come with a waterproof housing that about doubles the bulk of the camera itself.Strangely, the buttons are membrane sealed so that part of the camera is waterproof for at least rain or splashing but the two hatches aren’t. Both hatches bind badly making opening them from difficult to a major undertaking. I can’t remember the last time I broke a nail but I sure did so opening one of these miserable, poorly made ‘doors’. I needed to get in both since one is for charging and one accesses the SD card and battery.The batteries (two are supplied) charge while in the camera via a USB-A port. We’re in 2023 now and I am staggered seeing one of these detestable ports instead of a USB-C.I thought the menu system well organized. It’s helped by (surprise!) a well written full size paper manual. It only took me 15 minutes with the manual to get a good start. From there, I had no issues finding whatever function I wished.Most of these functions worked as indicated except for time Lapse. The time lapse did not collate the 100 jpegs into a video so I decided to do it manually. However, the files weren’t sequentially numbered for some reason. Instead, most of them were incremented by four while some others were random. Please see the image of these files to note the out of consecutive numbers. This resulted in the video being a strange herky-jerky presentation. The collation is the flashy part at the end of the video.The stills are ok but not as good as the computational photos produced by today’s phones. Since there’s no stabilization at all, the videos are jumpy. If I had the software, I suppose I could stabilize them to some extent but if you’re looking for those super steady action vids, this won’t be a good choice.While most of the functions worked, the inexplicable failure of time lapse bothered me as well as the lack of stabilization. I’m openly hostile about the construction due to my struggles with the hatches. I also think that a device labeled as ‘waterproof’ should itself be waterproof rather than it’s only waterproof in a waterproof housing.In sum, this doesn’t match up favorably with my camera phone."
Useless app. Prepare to transfer SD card constantly.
The double battery charger shown in the pictures is not included as shown. You can only charge it by inserting a battery into the camera and plugging it in. This is extremely annoying for an action camera since it continually needs to be removed from the waterproof case. DO NOT BUY.
"The app that you are forced to use for this called ""DV king 4k"" on the playstore is the worst. it doesn't connect and you will have a hard time transferring videos. the interface looks straight from 2008. these other 5 star reviews dont mention that conveniently. hard pass for me"
Batteries came dead and do not hold a charge for more than 15 minutes
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            From my initial testing, this camera produces very good video. The internal mic, like on so many of the cheap action cams, has terrible audio. What makes this cam different is that it comes with an external lavalier microphone that attaches to the camera via a micro USB port. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from this microphone, but I was pleasantly surprised on how well it sounds.The microphone comes with a gigantic clip for some reason. Perhaps it's for attaching to a backpack strap or something, which might explain the size. Once clipped on, the mic has some additional articulation to help position the mic.The box is full of various accessories, which is a nice bonus. The included wrist strap allows for easy start and stop, as well as a photo button. It works well and is quite handy. I appreciate they included a waterproof housing for going deeper, up to 98 feet. The camera can be submerged without the waterproof housing up to 16 feet.The EIS (electronic image stabilization - not optical) does a good job, however I can't find a way to turn it off or make any adjustments, if any are available.The front display screen is great for framing selfies, but it took me a while to figure out how to switch from the main display to the front display and had to look at another similar camera to find out how to change the display. There is a button marked ""M"" on the top of the camera and if you hold that button for 3 seconds, it will switch to the front display. Do the same to switch back. There is no info regarding this in the manual or on their product description.The app for this camera is a generic app that many of the generic action cams use. I have a ""Peggy"" action cam that uses the same app. But unlike the Peggy, this Icefox cam doesn't play well with the app. I had to re-add the camera every time to have it function properly. But it needs to be added to the app each time, which is far from ideal and I deducted a star for this issue.I tested it in a semi-dark room and it did pretty well as you can see in my video. Overall, I like this camera. It's no GoPro, but for the money it isn't bad.I deducted another star due to the package only containing one battery instead of the two it's supposed to have. It looks to be a battery that is different than my other action cams, so no swapping. Big bummer."
"This does not record in 5k. Not even 4k. For me, it seems like it is recording in 720p or 1080p. I would recommend buying from a more reputable brand unless you want a toy"
Update: couldn't get it to record sound with the videos. Love that it comes with charged batteries ready to go. We’re enjoying it so far.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            These are a decent camera and similar in design to the Osmo Action 3 but they are not quite as good and the app for them is very limited. I tried again today to work with this camera and couldn't even get the app to connect anymore.I can get decent footage with it but nothing to write home about so I will probably only use it for ""B"" Roll footage. There are no controls on the camera that I could find for adjusting the ISO, etc so the footage is overblown."
The front screen doesn't work.
Product states 4k but not getting that resolution.
Well didn't get the whole package mic and wrist band for remote were missing
"Software will not allow change out of millitary time. When I try to change time format the page that opens is a date format page. So, the creators made some errors in software layout way off in China somewhere where this was made.. Kinda like the Chinglish instructions it comes with. This purchase is a mistake. I have had it in my hands for 15 minutes and immediately i have issues"
Looks like quite solid. It’s a little tiny (thus screen and the camera itself small as to be handled and watch what you’re recording). And the audio stays too too low.
"For the money it’s good, battery doesn’t last that long, maybe 30 minutes, but it does come with 2"
useless video qualitygrainy video even in broad daylightglue came off the first day of use
"This is something the bloggers who compare picture quality and video technology and number of pixels are not telling you: in order to use this camera you MUST register it via an app that you have to download on your phone with a Chinese-based company.Before I go any further, full disclosure: I am a television broadcast engineer and broadcast IT engineer, so the technical aspect shouldn’t be a problem to me, right?Wrong.The camera turns on with a QR code, you HAVE to register your product. You can skip the registration process only 5 times. So I got scared a didn’t even want to take my chances so I scanned the QR code with my camera and it opened a webpage with instructional videos. I thought great idea. In the video it tells you to download their app from the App Store. When you install the app you HAVE to give it a bunch of permissions, including Bluetooth access and others. Not great. I just wanted a small camera. Further we go: the camera is not recognized at all by my phone. It’s already 15 minutes into me having unpacked the camera, I just wanted to set it up and to go shooting videos and taking pictures.I head for the troubleshooting section of the app, which launches the web browser and the best advise is to uninstall and reinstall the app on my phone.Done, now I can see the camera. It pairs with my phone.Turn the camera off and one again (I am an engineer, ok) and the camera doesn’t pair with my phone. Again. Turn it off, turn it on, Bluetooth on my phone off, on, off. Nothing. It’s trying to connect to the camera but it can’t. 7 times through the same thing. Delete the app, download the app.Pair the camera again. Turn it off, turn it on. I want to update the firmware. The camera is not paired with my phone anymore.45 minutes later I still didn’t take my first picture with my camera. Not to mention video. Nothing. Nada.Folks! This is supposed to be an action camera. You can’t stop the action to pair the phone just in case.Again, I am a professional and still had issues.See the documenting pictures for yourselves.I would have accepted an exchange thinking it was a defective product, but again, I don’t like the fact that I  am FORCED to register a product a purchased in full (it’s not a subscription camera)"
"So I kept getting the notification for scanning a qr code to download an app. It's an app not available through the playstore (there are asked on there) but after skipping 4x it won't let me use the camera till app is downloaded on the phone. Looking further into it it seems like an app that might poke and take more data then it needs. Annoying the camera is unusable unless forced to install an app the register it. People have tried contacting the company and the response seems like a very uninformative one with no real explanation or other option.I'm not at home at the moment but this has such a red flag on it. Wish I had looked further into it. Of course all the youtubers posting product reviews failed to mention this. So much hype for this device yet failed to inform people of that. I would avoided this one for that.I have a back up phone with a vpn. It isnt connected to anything important. Will download it on that and see if I can get past this mess. I just don't feel the risk at the moment is worth doing on the phone I use.The camera looks like it's worth 5 stars from what I have seen so far with it. But being forced to download an app just to register it, and my phone giving me a warning for it that it have never had with any other apps is concerning enough for me to take 2 stars off"
"The camera is a very good one, mature feature set and very reasonable cost for accessories and a lot of value. The main issue I have with this and other cameras from DJI is that it requires the MIMO app for activation and initial firmware updates. The MIMO app is not on the Google Play store and needs to be side loaded as an APK file from their website. This opens up all sorts of issues regarding cybersecurity best practices and especially if your phone is used for business. At the very least it is a hassle to use a non-essential phone to activate and update. This is not a problem on Apple App Store as it is easily installed from there. I had purchased the Osmo 5 just after this one, but cancelled the order once I tried setting up the Osmo 4. It is odd that no one on YouTube other reviewers even mentioned this."
"The DJI Osmo Action 4 is a compact and powerful action camera that impresses with its image quality, size, and innovative dual screens, making it a great choice for both casual users and professionals looking for a versatile device.Pros:Exceptional Quality: The Osmo Action 4 delivers outstanding image quality. The 4K video capability, coupled with advanced stabilization, ensures smooth and vibrant footage even in fast-paced scenarios. Colors are rich, and details are sharp, making it perfect for a range of activities, from outdoor adventures to vlogging.Compact and Portable: This camera is small and lightweight, making it easy to carry and mount in virtually any setting. Whether you're biking, hiking, or engaging in extreme sports, the camera’s portability makes it a fantastic companion.Dual Screens: One of the standout features of the Osmo Action 4 is its front-facing screen, which makes it a great option for vlogging and self-shooting. The rear touchscreen is responsive and offers clear visibility, even under bright sunlight. These dual screens greatly enhance the user experience, particularly for those who like to frame shots easily.Cons:Complicated Activation Process: One major downside to the Osmo Action 4 is its cumbersome activation process. To get started, you need to install a specific app that requires access to your phone's location, files, and personal information. This is a significant privacy concern for some users, especially since the app is not available on the Google Play Store. Instead, it must be sideloaded from a different source, which is inconvenient and might raise security concerns.Short Battery Life: While the Osmo Action 4 offers impressive performance, its battery life leaves much to be desired. On average, the battery lasts no more than 30 minutes, which can be frustrating during longer shoots or outings. To address this, you’ll need to invest in additional batteries and accessories, which adds to the overall cost of ownership.Accessories Required for Extended Use: Given the short battery life, users will likely need to purchase extra batteries, chargers, and possibly other accessories to make the camera truly functional for extended periods of time. This can add up quickly, making it less ideal for those looking for a camera that's ready to go out of the box for long shoots.Final Thoughts:The DJI Osmo Action 4 is a fantastic action camera when it comes to performance and portability, delivering superb image quality and a well-designed user interface with dual screens. However, the activation process is a major hurdle due to the app’s privacy requirements and the lack of availability on the Play Store. Additionally, the short battery life and the need for extra accessories can be a drawback for users looking for a hassle-free experience. I am returning this item."
Recording a trail ride in my jeep. Camera is advertised to handle 4k at 120. No where does it say it will overheat and shut off after 20 minutes. It was so hot it was uncomfortable to hold. Maybe DJI should mention that the camera needs a constant airflow to record in its best resolution. I have researched this issue and found replies from DJI Techs that it's normal for the camera to do this if it does not have wind to cool it off. Guess I should have ordered another GoPro instead of trying something new.
"I came over to the Action 4 as someone who has used six generations of GoPro (and a couple other action cams). But who has come to hate GoPro more and more overtime due to their constant bugs, crashes, and over stated battery claims. And since I love my DJI drone the Action 4 seemed worth tryingHere's the great things about the Action 4- It's battery lasts about twice as long as a GoPro 11 on max recording setting- It doesn't shut off when it heats up even with constant recording at max settings (hero 10 and 11 shut off super quick)- The magnetic mount is super easy to use- It's battery does charge pretty quick if you have power delivery availableBut here's why I say it's not worth the $399 MSRP- The low light isn't that much better. I found myself with only about an extra 10 minutes during sunset that footage was still usable. Before it became the same mushy, high ISO, blurry unusable mess of the Hero 11- 4k is very limited. Since they use less but larger pixels, you can only do ultra wide or dewarp at 4k. Which is 15mm equivalent. The rest of the zoom is digital which is junk. There are many times where I may want a closer shot and don't need ultra wide. But for that you must go down to 2.7K. whereas on the hero 11/12 series ""zoom"" shots are available at high resolution due to higher overall pixel count. The 4K limitation leaves the Action 4 about equal to the now 3-year-old hero 9 for shots more ""zoomed"" than 15mm- The batteries and quick charger are OEM only and 2-3x the price. For 2 batteries and external charger it was $117. I can get 6x 3rd party ""Enduro"" batteries with 2 chargers for a hero 10/11/12 for ~$100. Yes, the hero batteries last half the time but I have three times as many batteries for the same price.And yes they charge slower, but most people don't have a high enough power delivery charger or battery bank to get the ""80% in 18 minutes"" and that seems to only apply when there is just one battery in the external charging case. With three batteries on my 20w PD power bank it was ~1 hour to charge 3 batteries from ~20% which is about the same as the Hero 3x charger.DJI really needs to allow third party batteries and chargers to compete on overall ownership cost- Remote cost. DJI decided that a dedicated remote control needed to also have GPS. Making it $80. And since they aren't great about third party support there are no cheaper third party remotes. Which means a remote ends up costing twice as much as one for the hero. Once again raising the overall cost of ownership.In summation the Action 4 isn't bad. But at best it should be priced a little bit above a Hero 10 considering it's features and performance (or lack thereof). And DJI really needs to support third party accessory makers. Because as of now the total cost of ownership for the Action 4 ends up being ~ 50% more than a Hero 11. But technically it's worse than the Hero 11. It's just a bit more reliable. Certainly not enough though to warrant the extreme initial overpriced MSRP."
"SO I ordered this and got it 2 days ago. I was super excited. I had a gopro 9 and loved it at first but it stated giving me strange audio pops and cracks..AND sometimes the image would vibrate when doing videos. SO I sold it and swore off gopro. SO wanting another action camera for my vlogging and general purpose I researched and found this camera. Has great reviews. OK so I get it and turn it on and get a pop up screen saying something about ""you get 5 times left before activation"" Or something to that affect. I thought maybe it meant I get that many times to ""activate"" as in register it for warranty or something. SO, I didnt pay much attention to it. I did make an account with DJI and downloaded the app..BUT nothing happened..So I go to use it again and that same pop up screen wont go away now. OK...SO after researching,I come to find out, I needed to download the app ""which I did"" and my camera was supposed to connect to it and activate it. Well that didnt happen. SO finally after I research more it seems many people had this issue. The fix ""i guess"" was to find another phone and try it. SO luckily I used my sons phone and it worked..I guess I would have had a worthless 300$ paperweight if it hadnt worked? DJI needs to address this and get rid of this feature. That makes the ratings go down a lot. Anyways, ive shot a couple quick test videos just to see the quality. AND snapped a couple photos..Everything as of now looks fine. Audio isnt bad either. You dont get a lot of extras in the box. What you see is pretty much what you get. There was something else that came with it that looked to go on the lens? OR ..something? Wasnt sure..AND the battery is in the camera thats why its not pictured. IF DJI fixes that activation mess im sure I would have given it a 5/5 on everything..."
"Bought the Osmo Action 4 specifically for underwater video. It is easy to use and there's plenty of information online how to optimize settings and capture video, but... Upon playback most of the video is choppy and it appears this is a known or widely reported issue in the DJI forums. The camera is picky about the cards it will save too, but despite my card meeting all the criteria, my vacation videos are basically ruined as it has problems saving in 4k. reportedly it saves fine in 1080 or other settings, but the highest quality it results in choppy videos and dropped frames. Hard to get support from DJI and they won't answer me back when posed questions about this issue."
"I did a lot if research prior to purchasing this camera and was really excited to use it on my upcoming vacation in Fiji. I am not a technology whiz, but usually able to navigate new devices without much difficulty. Since the app is no longer available in the Playstore, I went to dji's site to download the link for setting up the camera and was very confusing. The link I was attempting to download wasn't working. What really turned me off, and was the main factor in returning this camera, was the difficulty with customer support. They do not have a number for you to speak with someone, is by message. So after waiting a long time to connect with support in another country, the whole process took about two hours to download the link. Then as I went to set it up, no SD card since that doesn't come with the expensive camera package. I had already spent extra money buying accessories, such as the power charger which is not included either. It might be a great camera, however after the hassle of setting it up and concerns for future support needs I decided it was no longer fun and not worth the stress."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Before I say anything, Gopro 10 are able to produce a much stabler image, MUCH BETTER. OK saying that, this camera has as much stabilization as a Gopro7 or 8, if that. I video and produce cycling videos from rides that I recorded on previous Gopro 10 and now Im trying this simply because this camera does have a wider FOV and can handle going from shaded to bright sunshine better then GoPro 10 or 12, Much better BUT IT JUST CANT HANDLE THE STERILIZATION FACTOR.  I dont know whats worse. The great image quality of hero 10 but total ""bleach out"" when scenery has very high contrast area OR Great wide angle imagery but Shaking camera thru the entire freakin video. THIS CAMERA HAS TO LOSE THE CONTEST because, who the heck wants to see constant image shaking/vibration. I mean its ridiculous. And I have it on their best image sterilizing mode. I also have horizontal leveling off so the camera shouldn't be working too hard on the stability issues. IT JUST CANT HANDLE WHAT IS SO EASY FOR GOPRO TO ACHIEVE. I'm sorry but I must return this camera.  It already ruined a 5 hour video, I simply can't lose another irretrievable video like that one."
"After long looking forward to action cam fun, awesome steady shots and water shots, and having done my homework the DJI Action was the best, I finally got it, and wouldn't you know it requires to be activated by a 500MB app that won't run on my older phone, or the camera will not operate. Of course most people don't have an old phone and activate and use it just fine, but I say bunk. First the wisdom, what if it resets or something out in the field, and no internet means dead camera? Some people don't use smartphones, or live out in the wild, and they can't use a camera in that case? (And there is no PC activation alternative.) And sorry but that's just creepy, you have to log in and get their approval before you can use your camera? I'm sure it's just paranoia to have privacy concerns, even though the US banned an entire phone brand, Huawei, for national security concerns. I'm surprised I never heard or saw this once in any DJI Action review, but we can all trust YouTube.I got to use the camera five times before the permissions ran out and I returned it, and it's a lot heavier than it looks, prohibitively so, like you wouldn't clip it to your hat, and it gets hot, hotter than any camera I ever held, and that wasn't even shooting, plus I got a continual large error message saying my SD card was too slow. The Insta360 also has that creepy ""activate for your security"" can't use it otherwise bunk, and Gopro is mechanically lame and big, so currently my action cam dreams have blown away like the leaves of a Fall tree.UPDATE: I tried a GoPro 11 and give it my official thumbs up. Love it. None of that sign in  or can't use bunk, no worry about war with China, Oops! We deactivate all your devices you bought from us possible problem, AND the GoPro works great with awesome footage, and I have a pro camera experience base to compare. Also, though not as tight technically as the Osmo Action, I always thought the footage looked a bit better in YouTube comparisons, and I am glad I tried it. The original and still the best."
"I tried to install the Mimo app but my phone is not supported....Is there another way to make this camera work? It has to be....if not, i will return it. You guys should put in the description that this camera can't be used out of the box and it needs activation and it can only be activated with specific phones that are supported by DJI. The camera looks nice but i was able to turn it on 5 times and now is basically bricked waiting for activation..."
"My biggest problem is that functionality is highly dependent of the Mimo app available only as APK download which should tell you that it did not pass the Play store's security checks. Given that it is a Chinese product and app this becomes a red flag.Furthermore, in my opinion, all features on (any) device should be able to work without the need of my phone. The manufacturer states that firmware upgrades are possible only through Mimo.SD card is formatted in exfat. File transfer works also through the USB-C cable.The magnetic mounting system seem bulky to me. It does have the advantage of a quick release from a tripod."
"I bought this as a replacement for my GoPro Hero Black 8. I love the magnetic attachment mechanism, and the video quality is amazing. However, the camera works poorly for Moto Vlogging with a microphone in my helmet because of very poor audio while riding my motorcycle. The sound is fine off the motorcycle, but on the bike there is crackling, dropouts, and other artifacts that are unacceptable. The sound on my GoPro is much better with the same microphone setup. This is a well known problem with DJI cameras as a quick web search will reveal. Another issue is that when external power is supplied the camera is no longer protected from water as there is nothing similar to a GoPro media mod to handle this."
"I may be currently the only person on the planet to receive not just one, but two defective units.The first one was plagued with a ton of problems & obviously didn't receive proper QC. DJI did do a warranty replacement on it which took a total of about 2 weeks total.The replacement was working well, until I tried to use the DJI mic with it. Broken connection with the mic & messed up/no sound on most my footage. DJI had me do the normal silly stuff. Reset the unit, reinstall the battery, make sure firmware is current, etc.It's worth noting that these folks while very friendly, definitely do not speak English as their primary language, so every call I made was very difficult to even understand the reps & figure out what they are telling me to do. They also seemed to struggle understanding the most simple statements about the issues.Ultimately, they disregarded that I told them the problem happened with a USB cable hooked up as well as much worse with the DJI mic plugged in directly as intended - & instructed me to return the new DJI mic to Amazon. Amazon is taking care of that currently.Meanwhile, I did further testing with another mic all together with the same results. It's obvious the USB port failed on the 2nd camera.So I called DJI back to request ANOTHER replacement, which they refused. They told me since it had been 18 days, I'm no longer able to get it replaced but can send it in for repair. They did provide a ground shipping label that takes 8 days from California to Texas.Ultimately I'm still without a functioning camera I ordered on 8/16/23 & will be lucky if they even repair mine & have it back to me by the middle of October between the slow shipping method & extended repair time windows.To say I'm simply disappointed with this company & the product would be a massive understatement. I probably should have returned everything & went some other direction, but due to the 2 weeks they took to replace the first camera, I ran out of time by a couple of days on the Amazon return window as well. Live & learn. I'll never buy another DJI product after this nightmare."
I really like this camera but the low light really struggles..  it shows intermittent noise in the footage ..im not putting this camera in severe low light conditions.. just in moderate low light .. but im not impressed with the so called low light enhancement .. overall its a good camera .i just expected more on this camera .
"This camera refuses to work without installing their app on your phone to ""activate"" it. It is absolutely possible for it to function without a phone (it stores photos & videos on a microSD card), and it works fine the first five times you start it up. But after that, it will stop working completely (see picture).The app isn't in the Google Play store on Android, so it hasn't been vetted for any kind of safety, security, or privacy concerns you might have about DJI, the company. You have to download the app from their website and sideload it on your phone. And even if you do that, it won't activate the camera until you give it permission to access all media _on your phone_.I wasn't willing to give DJI full control of my personal photos and videos on my phone with their shady app, so I returned the camera instead. Never buying DJI again."
"This is a convienent and affordable action cam. It does its job for what it's supposed to do. As long as lighting is great the video will be decent.In low light this action cam is terrible. Lots of darkness and noise that cannot be fixed in post production on software like DaVinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere Pro or even Topaz AI."
"Whenever i shot video the edges got warpy and wiggly, and yes the settings were all correct.I returned it and went back to my gopro hero 8"
"Not a fan of the type C to type C plug that does not come with a charging block. Had to use a standard usb to type C plug since I had no way to plug in the type C cord into an outlet or computer.This part wasn't labeled anywhere that I saw, you need to have a $1000+ Samsung, iPhone, or Huawei phone to activate the camera using their geto af app that, apparently, was banned on Google play store due to security concerns (this is a Chinese brand) So you download it from their website and have to agree to a bunch of crap in order to use the $400 camera. If you don't have a way to activate it, you CAN NOT use this product at all. After you activate it, doesn't seem like you need the app. It does state you need the app for firmware updates.Recorded a video and after looking back at the files, it didn't record the first 20 minutes of what I was recording and picked up at a random point.It cuts files Down to 3 minute files rather than 1 main file. I noticed some of the files made the camera recording flow look jittery. $400 and it seems difficult to use, I shouldn't have to research for several hours how to get it to work properly.I'm not buying from this company ever again. I don't recommend this, not a great alternative to a go-pro, find some other brand.If they get rid of the stupid activation requirement, it would be a decent product and probs ly get 4 stars for not having charging block included or standard usb to type C plug."
"This is the third time I am writing this review. Amazon keeps deleting them.The DJI Osmo Action 4 is supposed to be a competitor to the GoPro. It is much more difficult to use, and does not have full functionality. For example, there is no way to turn off the front camera. There is an option to do so, but it doesn’t work. So it wastes a lot of battery. It also does not come with any instructions, and there is very little online support."
"Image quality is good in some scenes, not as good in others. Features are great like magnetic mount and fast charge but so what if video quality isn’t where it should be. Had issues transferring videos from camera to phone. App kept saying interface. I think the reviews on YouTube are paid. GoPro hero 11 is the clear winner for me for many reasons after intensive testing."
When I purchased this item on black Friday the add did not tell me I would need a third party device to install software that real camera companies like Canon do in manufacturing. For many reasons I don't have a cell phone but one is required to get this item to operate. I have purchased many Canon cameras over the years and all operated perfectly out of the box. This third party device requirement should be part of the advertisement to inform buyers of this requirement. For the record Amazon did a good job in the returning process. The problem as caused by DJI's extraordinary requirement.
"The DJI app was not compatible with my phone. I had to use a friends phone to download the app and update the software. Then I tried pairing the DJI Mic 2 (the reason why I bought this camera was because you could pair it with a mic) the mic never synced after following the instructions step by step then it finally connected only for me to receive a notification immediately afterwards saying the mic was disconnected then a new notification that said I was connected, and right away another notification saying the mic was disconnected and this will go on for as long as you allow it and they never pair for more than a split second. The DJI customer service has been unhelpful only providing the same 5 steps and they don't work. I've been trying to figure this out now for 3 days, and it's been nothing but a let down and huge waste of time. I am returning this POS and buying a go pro 12 as I should have done from the start."
"The price on these Action 4 cams have dropped significantly in price since the beginning of 2024.  I'm pretty sure I know the reason why.  The built in software for formatting SD cards is flaky at best.  No issues if your planning on downloading videos on a Mac.  But downloading to windows is another story. Half the time windows doesn't recognize the SD card format and therefore won't read the card. Something happens when a few clips are recorded rendering the card unreadable.  This happens on multiple Action 4 cams I tested, windows 10 or 11, and on multiple brands of SD cards.  Your only option is to reformat the card, thereby deleting all videos you just took. I have spent many hours with DJI on this issue, doing extensive testing, sending in SD cards and camera. Rather than fixing the issue,  they claim I must buy a specific SD card from a short list of cards shown on their website. Most are under 64Gig.  I have been using nothing but professional grade SD cards, like Sandisk Extreme Pro and Samsung Pro Plus. Yet, DJI tells me  the reason for this format issue is because I am using the 'wrong' type of SD card.  Again, no issues for mac users.  So for you windows users out there, look elsewhere if you need a sports action cam."
Disappointed to learn that there is no Android app. I'm not sure if firmware updates can be done from the company website. If not I may have to return the item. I will adjust my review as I learn more.
"Extremely Disappointed - No Facebook Live Support: IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVESTREAM ON FACEBOOK WITH DJI OSMO ACTION 4I purchased the DJI Osmo Action 4 primarily for live streaming to Facebook, but I've been utterly let down by the lack of this crucial feature. Despite DJI's claims that it would be supported, the inability to live stream to Facebook has persisted since the camera's release with no resolution in sight.I naively believed DJI when they said the lack of Facebook Live compatibility was just a temporary issue that would be addressed. However, months later, it remains completely impossible to live stream to Facebook using this camera - not even via RTMP. I've tried every suggested workaround to no avail.As an live streamer, this missing functionality is a dealbreaker. I ended up also purchasing a GoPro Hero 12 which has no problems streaming to Facebook Live out of the box. I cannot believe DJI continues to sell this camera while misrepresenting its live streaming capabilities.Save yourself the frustration and disappointment. If Facebook Live streaming is a priority for you, avoid the Osmo Action 4 and opt for another camera that properly supports the platform. I feel terribly misled by DJI over this and wish I had just gone with the GoPro from the start. Extremely poor showing from a company of DJI's caliber."
"I have an older Android phone.  To activate the camera, I need to download this 800M app outside of Google Play Store.  Worse, the installation keeps crashing even though my phone is supposed to exceed the Android OS version required.So I asked to borrow a friend's phone, but he said he wouldn't let me borrow his phone so that I could install some spyware on it.  So I have no phone but still have friends.I could buy a new Android phone, but I decided against it.  If the product is not customer friendly, I don't want it."
"After paying $300 for this camera, have to jump through hoops to activate it?Finally got the app for my phone on my own, after the QR code on the camera won't work.Now what do I do? The camera still says ACTVATE BEFORE USE.Seems like DJI wants to control everything about my use of this camera."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Unfortunately this product is not for me. This action cam needs to be edited to get the great quality that is promoted. Not really a point and shoot camera.
"Amazons' quick delivery of this dji Osmo 4 action camera was fantastic but this where the brick wall was starting to build. The instructions said to scan the QR code to activate the camera, or download the Dji mimo app. long story short, there's no way to get this app and does not work for android phones. Without activation this phone is not useful at all. Contacted DJI to no response, it seems that this is a real problem and not mentioned id their ads for their cameras. My problem now is with Amazon They took my money in a matter of seconds and now I have to wait 30 plus days for a refund. Deceitful practice, and makes it look like it's my fault the camera didn`t work! BUYER BEWHERE!!!"
Requires the DJI Mimo app to setup but it isn't available on the Google Play store for an unknown reason and DJI isn't saying.  One has to assume it's because it does things that aren't allowed by Google policies.  Since it's on the Apple App store it is obviously capable of being made compliant with similar policies so this is a choice by DJI rather than some technological limitation.  I returned it without sideloading the app since I don't trust it.
"The product requires use of an insecure DJI app that isn't certified or carried by any app store or third party. Without it the product is a useless brick. It's also a broken app that won't work on most android phones in the first place. Beware this is required for all DJI products, which I will absolutely never buy any of again.Everyone shilling DJI products online naturally avoids any mention of this, they are all paid off not too."
"Horrible relatability. Do not buy this. Every other video is corrupted. If it runs out of battery when its recording guess what you’ve just recorded, that’s right “‘invalid File”You recorded two videos guess what kind the second or third video file is, that’s right “‘invalid file”.Should be called DJI Action Invalid File 4"
"the app they want you to use does not even exist in android store..  im not sure what to do because it requires the app to use this, i am about to return it because this is pathetic and frustrating"
"It get very hot and shuts itself down. Unfortunately I didn’t get to really use it and find out till after the return window closed. I missed so many shots on my vacation because it over heated. I thought it was the weather so I was bummed but no big deal. Then I tried using it to just record things at home and it’s still doing it, so not the weather. It just way over heats very quickly."
Nowhere in the listing does it say that YOU need a very specific cell phone type to be able to use this camera. Had the listing stated that I would have never bought this camera. They also state when you go to return the camera that you MAY ONLY GET A PARTIAL REFUND OR NONE AT ALL even if you never used the camera at all. Big scam since they have known about and NOT fixed the code to allow other phones Such as most Galaxy phones from using the camera. Doen't waste your time on this camera unless you have the very few specific phones that can be used to active that camera. There IS NO OTHER WAY TO ACTIVATE IT EITHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Out for a ride in my wheelchair and I was in and out of air condition buildings and the camera overheated and shut down. The camera was in it's camera container with a adapter on the bottom and sitting on my chest. Then after I let it cool down it said it has 6% battery left and I started it and within a minute or two it stopped again. Do I have a bad camera or is this to be expected?
"DJI forces you to download an app that has been banned by the app store. You can go to DJI site and download it, but it is HUGE and requires an insane amount of access to your personal data. Camera will allow you to use it 5 times before it locks you out of all functions. You can not use the camera anymore unless you download the app. Absolutely ridiculous. I am returning it tomorrow for a full refund."
"I read so many good reviews about this camera but looks like I got a lemon. While I am on my second day of vacation camera stopped working. Water got into a camera, everything was wet inside including my mini USB card. I really hope that pictures and videos are still in the card and it would be possible to retrieve them. However, I don't have any other camera with me so no more v-logging and videos for the rest of my family vacation trip. Don't really on this camera to shoot something important. I wish I would just went with GoPro instead as now I gotta deal with DJI customer service."
"Used the action stick twice then it fell apart , the device itself is working. Poor build quality for DJI Action Stick"
Don't buy
"Absolutely furious at this product. After I set it all up and was ready to use it, it started prompting me to install an app every time I started up the device. It tells me I have to download an app. Well, the app won't install on my phone. I spent 3 hours trying to find a workaround for this mobile app!As it turns out a lot of articles warn that this App is hard to download because IT SPIES ON YOU and sends your data TO CHINA!!! WOW, thanks for wasting my entire day by not disclosing this AT ALL!I'm promptly returning it."
The camera had focusing issue. Imagine are blur. I tried it and returned it on day one. It take Amazon forever to refund my money. I been waiting for one month already and they keep postponing and still have not process my refund. I am still waiting! This is very discouraging my buying in future.
My son was excited to buy this camera but the excitement turned to disappointment once we realized we can not activate camera.  There is an app required to activate the camera but the app is no longer available on App store or Google Play.  Without activating camera is useless.
"It might be a nice camera with great functions and utility I would no however because DJI in their infinite wisdom took their app to make it usable on Android off the play store. Also I can't download it off their website either its been pending since May 30, it's June 7th today. Also you can use the camera until you activate it with the undownloadable app."
"Takes too long to get the camera started and ready to go when open it from box.  The camera overheated on its first use doing a youtube video.  Junk, will not buy anymore DJI action cameras."
Seemed like a really nice camera. Unfortunately you have to download an app that isn't available through the play store. It can only be downloaded onto certain models of phones. I gave up and returned it. I'm not comfortable giving all of my info and videos to a suspicious app that I have to go to a website to get. Not to mention my phone isn't even capable of downloading the app if I wanted to.
Great camera that refuses for years to update firmware to manually turn off WiFi/Bluetooth. For security reasons I occasionally need it to not emit RF signals at all. I will update this rating to a 5 if this feature is ever implemented.
"Bought Camera for a trip to the Bahamas.After less than 20 minutes of our very first underwater recordings, the camera got water inside. The battery got incredibly hot and begun releasing a terrible smell. Also our SD card full of memories got ruined. Have yet to contact support but now we have no SD card, deleted memories and no underwater camera for the rest of the trip."
"You can't use, activate or update this stupid camera unless you download the dji mimo app and guess what? It won't download on many galaxy phones among others. So basically it's a paperweight!!! DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!!"
"I did several test on this camera. No matter where I place the 2 opposing camera, Horizontally or vertical, the stitching is way off that straight lines would not meet, or part of my body is cut-off. I would even have 1.5 head on the video due to bad stitching. i also saw two sharp arrows on both sides of the lens due to bad stitching. I have to return the whole package and will reorder again once I get my refund."
I was unable to activate. Camera is useless. GoPro is a better choice.
I just purchased this camera only to find out that you cannot install the DJI app from the Google Play Store. You have to download a separate APK file from DJI website and install it on your Android phone. This is a huge security risk. Google around to find more details. Amazon won't let me post here.
"I was pretty stoked to get this based on the specs. What I DON'T like is that ,to use this camera, I have to do the activation process using my phone which means I would have to get a different phone since my phone is not in the approved list. I must have missed any YouTube reviews for the DJI Osmo Action 4 that mentioned this requirement. Unless there is a way around this, there's a good chance this will be sent back."
"Spent an entire day, read all the forum advice and manual instructions. Connects via Wi-Fi but not Bluetooth, so app will not launch correctly - go buy a GoPro (which has its own set of issues)"
"I broke down and bought an Osmo 4 after having a great season with the osmo 3. The last two times I tried using it outside, it overheated on me after 25 minutes while in 4k 60fps.I use these cams to record baseball games, and the Osmo 3 never overheated. These are 2-hour games straight that I record using 4k 60fps on the Osmo 3. Returning it and getting another Osmo Action 3."
If you're going in the water with this one make sure you buy the Amazon insurance. My unit flooded on my first surfing trip overseas.
"You only get a double-sided usbc cable that goes from battery pack to camera. They say only use included cable when charging.  But there is NO usb 2.0 to plug into wall charger or any other charge. NO MEMORY CAR EITHER FOR A 500 DOLLAR CAMERA. NO CHARGE AT HOME, NO CARD TO KEEP MEMORIES!"
DJI support couldn't change language to English. Returned
"The title of my review sounds like I'm exaggerating but I'm not. The required application is not compliant with the Android app store policies so you have to download a file from their website.Do yourself a favor and search ""DJI mimo security analysis"". The app that is required to even use this camera sends a ton of unnecessary data to Chinese big tech companies like weibo.This is extremely off-putting to me. I don't know how they get away with it and still have a very positive rating on Amazon. It is so distasteful to sell a hardware product that is effectively bricked unless a surveillance app is installed on my phone. Do yourself a favor and support an ethical business. Not DJI.Haven't even looked at the camera quality, value for money, accessories or ease of use. But let me just tank the ratings a little bit more:The camera quality is terrible, the value for money is absolutely abhorrent given that I am being coerced into spyware, the features are very bad, and the accessories included are truly insufficient - I am serious, you can't even work the thing without a microSD."
There shouldn't be a need to register a camera unless you want to. You shouldn't be forced to register it to use it. It literally will not work unless registered. I'll be returning it to Costco.
"Then thanks to the reviews here pointing out that ""forced activation/registration"" using Google Store banned apps.  No cam is so good that I can throw away internet security.  Please change the attitude to a customer-centered one, then I will reconsider."
"I heard good things about the DJI Osmo Action 4 cam, so I picked one up on sale. I quickly learned that you must install a DJI app on your phone to operate many features of the camera, and to download new firmware. I also quickly learned that the DJI app necessary to use the DJI Osmo Action 4 is BANNED by Google Play because it contains spyware/malware from China. The app is so questionable that the only place to get it is from DJIs site, and DJI is of course controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). I will be returning the DJI Osmo and I'll stick with my GoPro and Insta360."
Activation is pitiful.
"Only 12 meg photos??? WTF, no wonder they hide this horrible spec🫣 Gopro is up to 27 meg!"
"It arrived with a dead battery. I have tried many different cables, many adapters, AC power and a V-Mount battery pack... there's nothing that I can do to convince the camera to charge the battery. Google it. It's a COMMON problem. Apparently the Action 4 may need a firmware up to be able to charge the battery... but the MIMO app won't upgrade the firmware because the battery power is too low. Save your money, don't get frustrated... I'm assuming that if you buy the Adventure Pack that comes with a separate charger, this might work."
I cannot install this app in my vivo v21 mobile. Because this app is not available in the Play Store wrost. If I download it from chrome my device not allowing me to install it. Why dji not providing it in the Play Store this is really worst and frustrating. Today only I bought it and I think I made a very big mistake
"Here in UAE is not good, you can not use it during the day, 3 mins working then gets super hot and stops working"
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This was the first time after a month when I put it under water and yes, it was just about a feet or two under (fresh water).After sometime the screen started flickering and I (in a dry place with dry hands) opened up the battery compartment only to find water inside.Crashed my SD card and the data worth a lot of valued memories and some professional cost was completely lost as recovery wasn't possible.Don't purchase this without a 3rd party case. The camera is not waterproof out of the box.The service is a pain too as they are out on weekends and only available in Delhi as per official DJI support.Replacement should be given to me as my purchase is just one month old and the warranty is for a year since purchase.I have a travel plan for which I purchased this but now am regretting.DJI sucks... atleast mine does.40k worth of crap.The battery that was inside at the time drained and died completely and is refusing to charge.Moreover moisture was inside the lens despite the cover being tightly screwed in (as DJI recommends for the Osmo action 4)Whatever went wrong, @DJI needs to fix!I'd suggest don't buy if you're anywhere away from Noida. It's only one service center and they don't even respond despite business hours.Ideally DJI should offer a return/replacement via the seller but these 3rd party service centers are impossible to work with.It's a helpless situation I'm in and feels like my INR 40000 (adventure combo) has gone to waste because of a manufacturer's defect.An action camera that's not waterproof!"
"This is probably the best value action camera at the moment and after reading all the reviews I was looking forward to having one.  Unfortunately it won't work without the DJI app which has to be downloaded directly from the DJI website.  Google Play Store does not have this app to download and therefore your mobile phone will see it as a threat if you try to download it. There are ways around this, and eventually I did manage to download it, but I couldn't install it. After a very long time trying I gave up and took it to my mobile phone store for them to sort out.  After half an hour they gave up too, so I had no choice but to return the camera and ask for a refund. I would suggest anyone wanting to buy this camera to download the DJI app BEFORE you actually purchase the camera otherwise you might be in the same position I was and waste hours of your time and be disappointed like I was (am!).  I really would have liked this camera, but DJI need to sort their app out asap otherwise they will lose customers. I would also like to buy the DJI Neo drone but if I can't install the app there's no point in thinking out it!"
"I only just recieved my DJI osmo action 4 today, I WAS very excited for it given DJI's ability to make good cameras. However the nightmare started straight away, to start off with the camera even though you select English on the start up options stays in chinese and you have to figure your way to the settings menu in order to change this. Next complaint is the 5 skippable warnings to set up your camera before it locks you out from being able to use it. Thirdly there is no basic app support on the play store etc because they are too lazy to pay for the licensing meaning you have to figure your way out to their site and download their APK installer..... which does not work. Installed and uninstalled multiple times to make sure I was doing this right, ensured the app was up to date with current softwares. Still nothing a black screen or at best black screen with the white letters DJI and that is all it does. I now have spent £200 on a paperweight essentially. DJI if you do not fix this for me I will return your camera and go back to GOPRO who do have easily accessible apps and better support. I expect to hear from you soon, your AI also is trash at helping so remove your ""247 support"" because your staff only opperate during specified hours.Update: Issue came down to software support issue, if you have a cheap chinese phone its likely 32bit and the app requires a 64bit phone to function correctly. if you have a friend with a better phone you will have to borrow their phone to activate the camera on your account via the app. At which point it will function as normal."
Best action camera in the market
"I bought the DJI action 4 camera for a family vacation and was extremely disappointed. My iPhone 12 did a much better job of capturing quality photos and videos.**Cons**Not very good at taking photos/snaps unless you have *a lot* of sunlight. Even indoor pictures at noon, during peak sunlight were grainy.Too much warpingReviewing footage on the small LCD -- I never noticed that my fingers were almost always in the shot! Image my surprise when after our vacation I downloaded the footage to my mac only to find my thumb in the corner of most photos!Applications for editing and managing photos and videos only work on mobile phones. This is a pain because transferring 4k videos take too long, and take too much space on my mobile.Some of the applications' documentation is only in Chinese, and some of the features only have Chinese language available.**Pros**It small and portable.Image stabilization is good -- but I never needed it."
"First, the ""activation"" never happened.  It's telling me over and over to scan the QR and then download the app, and just select ""Activate"" when the app comes up... never works, just keeps sending me back to download the app over and over.The case is quality for the closures is of poor quality.  The USB door once open won't close without pounding it on a table.  Had it on a tripod with good airflow all around it on a day around 28C, and after 16 minutes of recording (with the screens off), it says ""Overheated, recording stopped"".  This happens every time I use it, within 15 - 25 minutes (longest record time without ""overheating"" is 27 minutes.  Huge disappointment.The interface as well is clunky.  But if I can't rely on it for simple video when I'm just trying to shoot some demo, or activity I'm doing (nothing extreme at all), then it's useless.  Battery life seems ok, around 2+ hours at 4k 25fps.  But since it's so horribly unrealizable, and trying to recharge the better with a door that won't close after, it's terribly underwhelming.  Expected more.  Didn't think it could be worse then the GoPro... Wow was I wrong, and disappointed.  I bought this because I thought the GoPro was bad... wow, this is worse."
"This is a solid unit and produces great images when the sensor has enough light. Due to the limited aperture, it isn't great if you stray from auto settings and use of ND filters to compensate for this is affected by stuttery images because of the image stabilisation. Returned in hopes the Action 5 is an improvement.Easy to use, easy to set up, just not great in that evening low light, which is one of the things I want it for."
Unfortunately the supporting app keeps crashing . It's only available from manufacturer and is quite time consuming and necessitates deleting any files associated with it .  Unlike gopro there is no direct facility to see preview on tv .
"So we received this camera just in time for our trip to Tahiti. Bora Bora was amazing and we used this camera primarily for underwater photography mostly video.Let me start with the pros,1. Great value for the money when you consider a GoPro for 3 to 6 times the price.2. The picture quality was excellent actually much better than I expected for such a small camera, both for stills and videos in and out of the water.3. The menus have quite a few settings including an underwater mode and are fairly intuitive to access as long as the camera isn't in the waterproof case.Now for the cons and there are quite a few,1. They claim the camera is waterproof without the case down to around 3 ft. We were snorkeling and didn't dive down so the camera never went below 3 ft yet when I opened the battery door after drying it off water had penetrated the battery compartment slightly and yes the door was completely closed before using it. After that we only used it underwater in the case which was waterproof.2. With the case on the camera for waterproofness the zoom cannot be used nor can most of the other menu items for the camera. You can switch between still picture and video mode and turn the camera on and off but not much more. The touch screen is non-op in the case and this may be normal for these little cameras which is why I was hoping to use it under water without the case.3. It was extremely hard to see the tiny flashing light on the screen indicating the video was running or not while underwater. Again this may be normal for these little cameras but we missed a lot of shots because we thought it was on or off and it was actually in the other mode.4. The battery compartment/SD card cover was extremely difficult to open. The first time we put a battery in it there was no problem opening the cover but after using it in the water for the first time we had trouble. Several people tried and no one could open it finally had to get a knife pry on it to get it to pop open. This is very frustrating when you're trying to change the battery in a hurry. Even after the trip when everything was thoroughly dry I can't open the battery cover without a screwdriver or knife to pry it open.5. The battery life is disappointing we got maybe 30 minutes on One battery. It's nice they give you a second battery but trying to change that while on a snorkeling expedition and everything is wet is easier said than done.6. Initially it looked like the build quality was pretty good until the bezel around the front edge of the camera cracked open. It must have bumped something in the bag but I expect more from a camera that's supposed to be used in action situations.7. This one is really a kicker, when the battery started getting low but wasn't quite empty the camera locked up, you can't shut it off none of the buttons will respond. Basically it just runs until it's flat dead and there's nothing you can do other than pulling the battery which wasn't an option because we were in a wet environment. This was extremely frustrating.Still trying to decide if the GoPro is worth the extra money I understand the new models are waterproof to a substantial depth without any case but they cost a pretty penny."
"A few months using this weekly in same conditions as my Brave 4.Good: I like the new placing of the sd card slot in the battery compartment. I like the battery compartment door which latches securely without separation. Batteries are longer lasting and the new charger is nice. Touch screen a big improvement over the Brave4 The whole camera feels way more solid.Bad: Having a really hard time getting the same wide angle on the Brave 7 as I get with the 4. I'm trying to cover a 90 degree angle in a hockey rink (mounted in corner have right angle lines on ice. My brave 4 has the full 90 degree angle. Brave 7 ends up with maybe 80. Thus, it clips a lot of the rink down one side out. Both are set for Super-wide which is supposed to be 170degrees. Also distortion is way worse. In order to get the 80 degrees on the Brave 7 you have to suffer some serious curvature of straight lines. If I turn distotion calibration on for the Brave 7, it reduces the angle even further (maybe another 10 degrees (from one corner at the goal line I can keep the near goal in the frame but lose the far side goal--so maybe its closer to 60 degrees.Image quality. I shoot video in fairly dark conditions--ice rinks--my subjective sense is that the Brave 4 is better when I push the exposure compensation higher. I get decently bright video on EV+1 with the Brave 7 I have to go to EV +2 at least and start to lose quality I think.So overall I'm pretty disappointed with the Brave 7 for my particular use-case. The Brave 4 is around half the price of the 7 and I'd return the 7 if I could for a Brave 4. Maybe there's some setting I haven't grokked yet, but head to head I think the Brave 4 produces better video though the Brave 7 has a nicer feel/user experience."
"I really wanted to like this camera. I mean come on. $140 for a 4K camera with great battery life and many competitive features. I use my action cams mostly for recording longer motocross races. So I need decent resolution and long battery life. I don’t really care that much about image stabilization since I think it makes a very rough track and riding experience look like you’re skiing thru fresh powder. Just my opinion.The camera feels well built and the buttons work reasonably well. They all take a hard press and it’s a little hard to tell if you’ve actuated them correctly. The touchscreen is not up to current GoPro/DJI standards but is plenty usable. These are issues I easily look past considering the price point.The huge assortment of extra accessories is really nice to have and the 2 batteries plus separate charger is how every manufacturer should do it. The remote works quite good although I didn’t use it for what I was doing since battery life was more than adequate and I could just start recording at my truck, ride to the start line, do the race, and have plenty of battery life.The battery life seems very good. The races I run are around 60 min long by the time I”m finished. The battery was only about half used by then. Way better than my Hero4 Black cams.I’ve used GP Hero 4 (my personal cams), Hero 5/6/7, and DJI Osmo Action 2. The DJI Osmo is by far the best camera of them all in terms of functionality and ease of use. Also a great battery. Unfortunately for me I like a really wide angle for the races. The DJI is not wide enough. I really like GoPro’s Superview.That’s probably the biggest reason I won’t be keeping the Asako cam. Even on the widest setting (both at 1080 & 2.7K) it is much narrower than I want. Pretty much a deal killer for me.Secondly the quality of the footage (resolution and clarity) just seems lower than even my nearly 10 old Hero4 Blacks at the same resolution. I’m no video expert and it’s hard to put my finger on it but the footage just looks softer, like it’s slightly out of focus. I only shot in 1080 and 2.7K but comparing it under the same kind of shooting conditions just doesn’t give a good result.I recorded footage with the image stabilization both on and off. I think with it on it pulled the FOV in even tighter and it seemed to give it kind of a swimmy look. With it off it was better but then it also seemed more bouncy than my typical GP footage. But that’s hard to quantify.Last little nitpicks. The full enclosure case works fine but is pretty bulky. A skeleton style case would be a nice option that I would gladly pay extra for, just to get the cam closer to my helmet.Lastly the camera exports the video files in MOV format (GoPro exports MP4s). I didn’t even realize this until my edit software OpenShot had issues importing MOV files where it cuts off the last bit of each file. Not the fault of the Asako cam but it seems from reading around that maybe MOV files are a little more difficult to deal with. Anyhow that was an issue as well. I would have had to buy an MOV to MP4 converter software since the free versions handle only 1-2 GB files which are much smaller than what these cams export. I didn’t see a place to change the export format but maybe I missed it.The Asako app is nothing to write home about but it does serve the basic function of getting the camera aimed and you can do rudimentary review of your footage. Again, just fine at this price point.So I sent this Asako action cam back for a refund. But for me; if they made a real “superview” wide angle and got the quality of the footage sharper I would buy this action cam again immediately. New GoPros for $400+ with all of their own crazy faults that they seem to cycle thru as they release new versions is just a ridiculous proposition.Thanks Asako for making this budget contender! Just a few improvements and I’ll be 1st in line to buy again."
"This is certainly no go-pro, but it does a decent job for its price point. Used for underwater snorkeling in the Caribbean, it recorded decent footage, but I would not qualify it as 4k by any stretch of the imagination. My critiques are as follows: 1) This is a fairly heavy unit and the head/body mounting options are not great 2) the field of view is quite small 3) The camera does not appear to have any balancing mechanism and the videos are a bit shaky, and 4) the advertised capabilities of the camera need to be toned down a bit (underperformance). That said, you oftentimes get what you pay for and this is no exception. If you are unable to spring for a top of the line camera, this one is decent and will allow you to get most of the coverage you desire for the price point."
"It’s a nice camera , doesn’t have the pull down tabs on the camera for mounting ( must use the big waterproof case. Also both screens do NOT  work at the same time and cannot swap between front/back camera when recording. This is where the lower price point comes in.  Over all it’s nice for $100"
"I bought this for a scuba trip based on the reviews. It is somewhat user friendly but since there are only a few buttons, it's easy to accidentally hit the wrong button which started recording video instead of taking photos. I found myself cycling through the menu too many times in inconvenience situations. I'm glad I had it but if I take it out again, I'll definitely be purchasing a light to go with. The photos had no color but blue to them without the light. When trying to remove the blue, all color was removed. The photos posted show what the images looked like pre editing and post. Not ideal."
"The qualityvfrom this camcorder is OK. However the camcorder formats the card in FAT32 format, a 20th century technology. Thus, this okd technology limits the camcorder to record video in segments of 5 minutes. Its very annoying when the action lasts longer."
"I purchased this mainly to do fishing videos and a few videos around the house.  It seems to do decent videos and snap shots.  Buttons are small and difficult to work with.  After a few minutes the recording just cuts off and I have to hit the record button again.  There is no external mic slot, so only the weak internal mic can be used.  But I could overlook those things IF the audio worked.  I took ONE short video where the audio worked.  After that, nothing.  I checked all of the settings and even went to You Tube to see if there was a work around.  One guy said to turn off the video settings, turn the camera off then back on, and turn on the shutter setting.  I tried it, and many other things, to no avail.  I even reformatted the SD card.  Nothing.  Maybe someone from Akaso will read this and reach out to me.  If not, this thing is going back and I'll buy something else.  This is not worth the trouble."
"The Akaso Go app is used to transfer photos and videos to phone, and transferring videos is very slow, even with the camera touching the phone.  The worst part is that the WiFi connection drops every couple minutes.  When the connection drops, go to your phone to reconnect, then back to the Akaso App and start the download over.  If you're using a VPN, this will need to be disconnected for the App to connect to the camera.For every minute of video it takes 3-5 minutes to download to Android phone..."
The audio is very low while it still picks up case noise. The video is grainy unless you are in very good lighting. There is NO option for a wireless mic. It's not what I was hoping for and I would not have ordered it if I knew what I know now . The battery is ok and i like the front screen.
"Update (08/11/2022)I was under the dilemma whether to return the camera to Amazon or keep, considering I have purchased many other accessories. The camera is very good under daylight conditions(including audio) Here is the work-around I have found for the battery cover design defect- Possibly, because of water resistance, the design has rubber strip underneath battery & (display, charging) port covers- Since I use water proof casing, I am ready to forgo camera water resistance. So I sliced the rubber sheet undernath the battery cover. That has reduced the pressure on the cover. Also I used gorrilla glue to fix the broken piece (although it doesn't look super good)Here is a tip if you are buying this camera - cut the rubber strip on the battery cover by 5mm near the hinge. That is the one that causes upward push leading to the locking grove to break. It should also maintain water resistance if you have cut correctly.======================Update (08/04/2022)The battery cover lock broke while opening. I have used the camera couple of times & it seemed to function well. But this seems to be like a defect reported by other reviewers as well. Now the cover stays open & I have contacted the seller for help.======================The camera is packaged well, comes with accessories & setup was simple. The app isnt great. Also when the camera is connected to the phone, there is no internet connection. So I dont know how ""live"" works. Also, camera had sound issues. Their support provided steps & factory reset seem to fix the issue for now. The accessories arent sufficient if you want to use it outdoors. I ordered their 7-in-1 accessories pack which has head, chest & hand mounts(for water sports)I took the camera for spin over the weekend. Here are my impressions1. Camera performed well when it comes to videos. However, the still images are having fish eye effect.2. The sound has hissing noise in quite environment. But it captures sound well in noisy environment. Also, there was sound captured inside their water proof case. That was something unexpected3. I recorded videos at 1080p@30fps and the battery came around one hour. I dont know 4k@30fps which is max resolution4. The drawback is side of microsd card supported. 64GB isnt enough to capture continuous videos over the action filled weekend.5. Another issue is, camera goes to standby to save power. If you are using eg: head mount, there is no way to know that in their wrist controller or wake it up. Ideally, I would like the camera to sleep when not used. But I want it to wake up & record when required. Also, something on wrist band to inform about low battery(may be a red led blinking?)Since I bought during prime day sale, I got good discount on this. So it seems to be a good alternative to expensive gopros. I would recommend to budget conscious & people who have burnt money(loosing, breaking) on gopros."
"It shouldn’t be confusing, annoying and challenging to operate a camera. I have a lot of footage of nonsense because I couldn’t tell when I was recording. If the sun is too bright you just have to wing it. All in all, my iPhone ended up being my camera of choice, did a better job and wasn’t annoying. The video quality is about the same but the iPhone has sound. And my iPhone battery lasted longer. The storage for this was better because of the SD card.If you don’t use the wrench that tightens the connector to things like a wearable device or selfie stick type it will not tighten fully and flop around. I had to remove the camera from my wearable device while we were at a big event and since I didn’t have the wrench I couldn’t use the camera for what I wanted.If you’re looking for a camera that’s small and you don’t need sound then this will work."
"Where do I begin?Let's start with opening the box. You're provided with a whole bunch of pieces in little clear plastic bags without any instructions on how to connect them and very little guidance on what they should be connected to. The camera case is strapped into a plastic piece at the top of the box that all of the pieces came in and there is no easy way to disconnect it (hopefully you don't break anything when trying to dislodge it, which thankfully I did not).After looking through the company's website that makes this product, Akaso, and not finding anything useful, I searched for any videos on the product and finally came across one that was semi-helpful, which helped me figure out how to secure the camera to my helmet.After this accomplishment, I charged the batteries and was excited to go riding the next morning. I get up the next day, start testing out the camera and realize that the camera has no internal storage and that a memory card was needed. It would have been nice if that was noted somewhere, but I get it, it's a cheap alternative to the GoPro, so you're only going to get so much.It's Christmas Day, so one of the only stores open is a Walgreens. $40 later and I have my 64gb memory card (that's apparently the most storage that can be used on this wonderfully awful device). I insert the card, format it, as noted in the instructions, and download the app onto my phone.The app is not intuitive in any way, shape, or form.  Just getting the app to connect the to my iphone was an extremely painful experience and it appears you can only connect the app to the phone through wifi. Using Bluetooth would have been way to easy. As the expression goes, ""you get what you pay for"".After multiple attempts, I was finally able to get the app and camera to connect, but I wasn't able to see the live preview in the app. The only reason I knew the app was even working was because I tried hitting the record icon (a little camera icon in the upper right hand corner, which almost no one would actually realize is what you need to press to get the camera to record) and I saw that there was an 11 second recording of me on the camera. Since it appeared to be working I headed to the mountain.When I arrived at the mountain, I got the camera connected again and was actually able to see the live preview, although connecting the app to the camera once again proved troublesome. I kept getting an error to restart the app and device.I managed to record a few videos my first day. But the battery didn't last long (thankfully I had the second one) and the image stabilization was decent, at best. Don't bother asking about the audio quality, as it was awful. The only positive thing was the video quality wasn't bad.While I was able to capture some decent videos the first day (and by decent I'm being generous) all of the videos from the next day were black. I also learned that at around 11:09, the device stops recording. This may be because I was recording at 4k.Overall, I do not recommend this product and my hope is Akaso will take it back, although i have my doubts.I haven't used the GoPro yet, but I know it has built-in storage and from what I've heard, it's a great product, although a bit on the pricey side.My recommendation is to take whatever money you would have spent on this cheap knock off and put it towards a GoPro.Cheers!DanPS, don't even try downloading one of the videos onto your phone. It'll take hours, if you're even succesful."
"OK, I was fooled by the low price and the overall positive reviews.  I haven't even had it more than a couple of weeks and I hate it.First, it seems to be packed in super glue.  Ok, so it's an ordinary cardboard box.  But you have to use tools to open it, or else you will get injured.  I probably wasted 10 minutes trying to open the box, as I was constantly thinking there must be something obvious I missed.  Nope, there were multiple over-lapping flaps strongly glued together.  Essentially, the box is one piece, nothing opens.  It has to be cut.  Not what's holding it closed.  I mean the box itself needs to be cut.Then you find the camera attached to a hard mount that is glued to another small box.  There is no way to remove the camera from the inside box.  And worse, there are no directions at all.  I had to go to youtube to find out how to get to the camera.  Note I already destroyed the outside box to get to the camera, but I still couldn't physically touch the camera.So the video shows you flip up a lid then open the back of the case.  Only, the case didn't want to open.  I thought I'd need a tool to pry it open.  I finally got it to open, but I had to put all my strength into it, and I almost lost my fingernails, as there's no real leverage point to grab onto.So I finally can actually touch the camera.  But the protective case is still glued to the smaller box.  Oh wait, there is a thumb screw.  So I'll just.....Nope, it doesn't turn.  I put as much strength on it as I could.  It would not budge.  I finally figured out I would need a pliers to even TRY to move it.So I made a mental note to dig tools out of my car (where I keep tools) later to try to free the protective case from the cardboard box.  Ridiculous that this should require a tool to operate a thumb screw.  Why is it that tight?  Just to annoy customers, apparently.Then I noticed my table was totally littered all over with dozens of accessories, most of which I had no clue what they were.  So much for being portable.  I need a notebook back to carry accessories if I cared to use them.But I figured I might find a use for some accessory someday.  So I grabbed a plastic bag and started tossing all the accessories in the bag.  Then I found it. There was a small wrench which matches the thumb screw.OK, so they were helpful enough to include the wrench.  But the thumb screw is short, which means the case itself blocks the use of the wrench!!!!I finally got a wrench on the thumb screw and had to apply enormous torque (with a wrench, remember) to get it to move.  So the thumb screw is way over-the-top ridiculously over-tightened.  You are not moving it with your fingers, and good luck using a wrench on it, even.I'm tempted to return it just because the manufacturer obviously hates their customers, deliberately making for such a frustrating OOB experience...."
"I am very very very disappointed with this product. First, it is basically impossible to mount to any tripod without having the waterproof case on it, and when it is in the case, you dont get any audio.I purchased this camera along with the official tripod and microphone from Akaso. The camera package is full of different mounts for various situations.  I bought this in hope of doing some walking Vlogs as well as using it on my show in a studio setting. I began to set it up on one of the tripods I have used for years for every other camera I have, and it was so loose it would not stay in place. Got another tripod, and the same thing happened. I eventually had to just set the camera on a stack of books to do a test recording.Once I started doing the test, I had to factory reset the camera twice in order for the video to not be grainy (and it is not a lighting issue, as where I shoot has bright lights pointed right at the desk) .The next day the “official”tripod from the company arrived and I thought great problem solved. Nope. The tripod only has the action sports bracket built right onto it with no way in any configuration to make it a ⅜ inch screw, meaning the only way to use the camera with the tripod is in the case, which means you can’t use the microphone.Extremely disappointed!! You have to the microphone with it because even after resetting the camera twice, the audio is still has an AM Radio quality to it.I will keep this around just to have in my bag in case for some type of quick footage, but will never buy a product from this company again."
"It works well enough. When comparing to the go pro, it's hard to hear if it is on and recording. Unfortunately I bought the one that isn't voice activated, but I was in a rush and didn't look carefully enough, so that's on me. But I wish the noise that signified turning it on and off was louder. (the go pros is extremely loud and I could hear from large distances).Front and rear camera only are on one at a time (go pro is both at same time from what I remember...)Included mounts suck, were not sticky enough to stick to my kayak for more than 15 minutes. I ended up using mounts that came with someone else's go pro, which fit the casing. and it was really difficult to get the mount to fit in the base. so save yourself aggrivation and buy new ones.somehow my date and time reset at one point and I was in a rush and didn't think of it, so the wrong date is timestamped on my videos, cuz I forgot to turn it off.Worked well and took good videos while in the Grand Canyon. used in the protective casing so it didn't get scratched and sand didn't get embedded. held up well.overall my biggest complaint is the mounts (just buy new ones) and I wish the sound was louder for turning on and off the video, sometimes I thought it was on and it wasn't...Next time I would probably buy a go pro, but it was a last minute purchase and the go pro didn't come in in time. but the asako is worth the price (if you buy new sticky mounts)."
Colors are washed out( overexposed?).  That can be corrected in most editors but it would be nice if the camera settings would allow users to adjust the camera settings more.Zoom is about useless in medium to low light.Waterproof case is too big so put a piece of cardboard inside with the camera to stop it from shaking and rattling.But ok for cheap camera since my GoPro failed in 2 feet of water.
The picture is not bad. The internal mic is terrible. External mic has to be plugged in and door has to be left open. Doesn’t make much sense. They need an outside port to plug an external mic or improve the internal mic tremendously. This is a good starter camera.
"I have a GoPro Hero8 that I use when fishing and doing outdoor activities. I've used my Hero8 for a couple years now. Its been a great camera overall. It has some weird software bugs that a reboot will fix. But the image quality is amazing, the image stabilization and audio quality are really good for a compact camera.On the other hand, I ordered the AKASO Brave 7 LE as a secondary camera to see if it would work to compliment my Hero for different shot angles while doing fishing videos.Initial impressions:1. The image quality is not as good as my Hero8. Especially in lower light, it is grainy. In full outdoor lightly, its better, but still below the quality of my Hero8.2. There is audio noise that is artifact of the image stabilization.  If you move the camera around when image stabilization activates, you will hear this buzzing annoying low level sound. Its the same sound that you if you push a button on the camera while recording. It appears to be a design defect in the circuity of the camera.3. Front view is cropped view of what you are actually recording. Not sure of the value of the front view screen is as it is cropped view of what you are actually recording.4. Audio quality is not the best with the built-in microphone - comparing this with my Hero8. For my use recording outdoor skiing and fishing...I'm not expecting awesome sound; but mostly speech. So my bar is not set very high here. The built-in mic and audio on the GoPro is significantly better.In the end, I'm sending this camera back. Maybe if I wanted to buy a camera for the kids to play with and not worry if they destroy it...I'd go with this camera. But for any quality videos, I was not recommend this camera, but rather spend a little more and get a GoPro.I'm bummed about this; as I wanted a lower cost alternative; but unfortunately, this camera is not going to cut it."
Straight to the point you can’t connect app no matter what method you use or try ofc they gonna blame the customer next audio will make your voice sound totally different plus you’ll need a mic hooked up if you want to be heard on the camera other then that it’s okay quality is okay for the price I guess mines didn’t include any SD card (not sure if it’s included) only good thing is it being touch screen.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I was looking for a small camera like GoPro but with more affordable prices. This camera had pretty good reviews, so I decided to give it a try.Since there are many reviews that mentions good things about it, let me just mention a few things that I found to be problems for me.The product description clearly says, ""support External Microphone"". I thought it meant it supports external microphones like wireless microphones that GoPro cameras work with. Apparently, this is not the case. Without external mic, you can't really record sound clearly unless the talking person is very close to the camera. I think this is a serious limitation for my needs.When I take a photo with this camera in a low light situation, I noticed the camera display goes darker after pushing the shutter button as my video shows. It becomes even darker in a situation where there is even less light. Not sure if this is a defect. The brightness of the screen never recovers unless you go into a mode like Playback first and exit. Then the display goes back to the brighter screen.The picture/video quality is very good, and it is great that the camera is small and came with many useful accessories. But because of these issues, I am seriously considering returning the camera."
"Well the features are veey welcome, like the writ remote control. Fornreckrd is brilliant.  Compact, low weight, many accessories, a complete win, buuuuuut, no audio recording or somewhat defective, and not juat me many people report the same thing, so is a issue. Also why i just will not use it, hoe do i get to record my helment audio, if could btooth pair it to my cardo it would be a blessing, it does not have btoot capaciry.  A BAD one toi do not see a red led on the cam, that show it is recording still."
The main problem is transferring the contents to a computer!
I bought this camera because my GoPro started locking up on me and although this camera is about a third the price of the GoPro I probably would not buy it again because the low light performance is not near as good as the GoPro and the recording is in MOV format. If it recorded in MP4 and had better low light performance I would rate this camera at 5 stars.
"Was planning on using this as a backup angle camera for vlogging. Does not fit the standards I was hoping for. The image clarity is VERY grainy on every setting regardless of ambient light. Seems like the ISO for these cameras are very poor. The idea behind this camera is great. It has amazing features like a front facing camera, 4k30fps (not any better than 1080p's quality with this camera), and size.If you are planning for crisp images, skip this product.From other sources it seems like Akaso pulled a bait and switch where they originally released the Brave 7 Le (distinguished by ""Brave 7 LE"" printed on the front facing screen.) It was better than all of its competitors. You will find other source reviews ranting and raving about how great it is. However it seems like this model was stipped of its glory and turned into something I wouldn't even use as a doorbell camera."
"I have been using this cam for a while now. It is packaged nicely with many accessories  and does shoot video and still pictures. The lack of ability to attach filter lenses, and the fact that Akaso does not even offer them, especially even a simple polarized filter lens is kinda strange for a ""camera company"". Cameras are a tool and filter lenses are essential for even adequate photography in many different situations. It's kind of like having a drill with only one drill bit, it can drill a hole but only one size...I find the image stabilization to be inadequate at even walking speeds, so anything more would not be advised.  I have tried it on trail walks, vehicle mounted for trail rides, and kayaking with poor end results or at least results to be expected from a camera priced in this range. It also makes the video ""glitchy"", even at the highest refresh rate while in 4k. Do you get what you pay for? Yes, and that is absolutely all you get. As far as still photographs go (@20mp) I find that my Sony experia XZ2 phone , rated (@12mp),  actually takes higher (real) resolution pictures when viewed side by side in any format. It was inexpensive as far as cameras go so I did not expect miracles but some of the hype surrounding this camera  would have been nice to experience, but alas, tis but a camera.....The absolute need for video processing and editing  software, not offered by Akaso for their products,  and the lack of useful image stabilization internal to the camera, limits the use for me to tripod work.This combined with the constant need to re-format, re-connect, and scary long wireless transfer times...well, Im not impressed. It's not like this is new ground breaking technology so costs for this stuff should be much lower anyway."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This camera is simply garbage, and you shouldn't waste your money on something of such deplorable quality when you can spend an extra $100 and get a GoPro or a DJI with much better features, image quality, and above all, durability.I bought this camera in November 2022 and had only used it twice during that time. A month ago, I started using it frequently for the project I bought it for, AND NOW IT DOESN'T WORK AT ALL!!!¡¡¡Yes, it sounds ridiculous, but it didn't even last two full months of use!!!!When you read this, you might think it suffered some kind of accident, impact, or that it wasn't taken care of while it was stored, but in the video of this review, you can see that the camera is practically new. It was always kept in its original box, in a place free from dust, humidity, or any other factors that could damage it.Even so, it stopped working for no reason, no impact or accident, and as you can see in the video, it now simply freezes on the brand logo when you turn it on, and that's it.I wrote to the brand's support, and they told me it has no solution, it can't be reset, the firmware can't be updated, and it's already out of warranty. So, they suggested I buy another one and expect my understanding for the garbage product they sell.Imagine how bad this camera must be that it didn't even last two months of continuous use. Seriously, don't waste your money on garbage and don't waste your money on AKASO. There are much better brands in the market that, for a little more money, offer you 1000 times better quality.Finally, regarding quality, I can tell you the following:Video quality: MEDIOCREStabilization: ALMOST NON-EXISTENTAudio quality: TERRIBLEFunctions: BASIC AND NOT USER-FRIENDLYDriving mode: WORKS TERRIBLY AND CAUSES FREQUENT FREEZES IN THE CAMERADurability: NON-EXISTENTTechnical support and brand quality: TERRIBLERepairability in case of damage: NON-EXISTENTI hope this helps you and prevents you from falling for this deplorable brand with no seriousness and no quality control for their products like I did."
Video quality is not particularly good. I expected a cheap knockoff of a GoPro and that is what I got. The motion stabilization is a joke. The ability to deal with mixed lighting is bad. The colors look washed out and often look overexposed. The attachments are cheap and break easily.
"I purchased this and did everything in my power to get it working. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. At about a third of the cost of the GoPro and DJI models, this looked like a gamble worth taking. Unfortunately, it didn't work out for me. I didn't need professional quality videos or photos. Just something that's worth looking at. You'd think that for the price you pay, you'd have some decent looking video. Alas, that is not the case. The videos are not great in bright light and just downright awful in somewhat dim conditions. To make matters worse, the audio level you get from recording from the internal mic is ridiculously low. I mean, it's almost inaudible. That's where I drew the line. I spent some money and purchased some external mics and accessories. This camera only supports micro USB input. So, it's not that easy finding adapters for it. I tried multiple different adapters and mics and could only record audio with one mic that was wired. Who wants a wire dangling when you're trying to record ""action?"" None of the wireless mics worked on this thing.. and I tried a lot. When I say I put a lot of effort into getting it working, I really mean it. After weeks of buying and returning mics and adapters, I finally called it quits. I returned it for a refund today. Serves me right for going cheap. Not sure how anyone can give this thing a positive review after playing back videos they've recorded. You can't hear a darn thing!"
"I bought this device planning to record action videos day and night, including audio/sound record. I tested it out tonight, had to download the manual since it only comes with a quick start one which isn't real helpful. The download manual is good, but not accurate where audio/sound quality is concerned, and yes I made sure the waterproof case was not on it when recording audio because the directions do state there is no sound recording with the water proof case. Initial impressions are it's decent for daylight action recordings but the touch screen is really sensitive and it stops recording intermittently. I've verified I have all the correct settings for recording but instead of one hour long video I have anywhere from 9 min to 19 minute recordings. The audio is clearer on a few, but messed up on others without any reason. The device has a ""shade"" setting for low light areas, but using the ""auto"" or ""shade"" setting at night doesn't help, and the video quality outside is poor without a flashlight or artificial lighting source. I checked out the app thinking it would be nice to use my phone to sync videos and such but the app contains some crazy agreement language stating you agree to give it access to private information including your e-mail and bank account...umm no thank you! I did not agree and removed it ASAP. Overall I had higher hopes based on other reviews for this device. It will work for daytime clips where audio is not critical, and might be decent to give your kids some exposure using the device before upgrading to one capable of recording decent sound quality and night vision."
"I had purchased a different brand camera prior to this one and had some problems with it,(i.e. no zoom while video, unable to operate from a distance without wifi) so I returned it, I EMAILED THIS MANUFACTURER with EXACTLY what I was looking for, how I was wanting to use it and what I required (I'm trying to video my son's baseball games to make highlights) they emailed me back and told me ""the bravo 7 was the one I needed"" .....WRONG.I was excited when I saw it had a wrist worn remote now I'm laughing as the camera has to be turned on physically (and if you thought you could keep it on standby and press record as needed, NOPE it shuts off so you have to get up to turn it on...why have a remote?? yes, I had a full charged battery) speaking of the laughable remote, you have to be within maybe 1.5feet of the camera in order to get it to record and there's no way of knowing that it is recording (learned the hard way as I found out after I had pressed it that it did not record) so if you want a camera that you have to get up to turn on to then use a remote and HOPE that it communicated to begin recording within that extremely short distance this would be the one for you...does it zoom while recording? well, yes but there's no way to control it unless you're standing at the backstop manually adjusting depending on what you are trying to record at the moment an actual remote that does all that, turns on camera, INDICATES it is recording and you could zoom with would be phenomenal...I guess that is not an option. Oh, let's not forget that it does not come with a memory card so you need to remember to get one of those BUT not bigger than 64gb or it ""won't be compatible"" (here's an idea, charge $10 more and include it with the camera so we can actually use the camera when it arrives!!)also battery is on bottom of the camera so if you have it mounted it is a pain to unmount, open and change out. Theres no manual so you have to download it. All around disappointment. going back to the old fashioned way of recording with my cell phone :( or maybe I'll buy a camcorder from the 90's..."
"So this camera was ok for the price. I should have known you get what you pay for. Although the camera did not outright suck for the price I did expect a little more out of it. If you are a picky person and pays attention to the little things then this camera is not for you. I would buy this for a teenager ir someone else but not for me.Pros:1 Rugged very well built and designed for the price Not cheap at all, 5 stars on that!2 All the accessories you could ever want! Almost. Including waterproof case! Although wish threaded fingers mount or tripod mount was in the center of camera.3 Super easy to use the text is big enough for people like me horrible eyesight to actually read.4 Daytime video quality even  at 1080 is pretty good out of the box5 Ready to go right out of box.6 Battery life is great! Got 1.5 hour’s continuous recording of softball games.7 Downloading files to phone using spp is actually pretty fast way better than GoPro, However see con #3.Now for the cons1 Nighttime recording not good at all. Even recording games with fields lit up. Has a weird greenish tone to picture even after trying to pro-tune it. Just not good at sll.2 The APP Is HORRIBLE not even customer support knew how to use it. Apparently developed by 3rd party and AKASO does not really know anything about it. I use the app most of the time in order to control the camera. Using the app you cannot control zoom in or out, cannot flip phone horizontally to het better view of what you are recording. Making clips of videos using app is almost impossible no instructions anywhere and user interface is confusing at best.3 App downloading to your phone sometimes it works sometimes it doesn’t. At one point I managed to get 4 files on my phone but have no idea how. Tried repeating same steps and it says complete but when you go to your gallery nothing there snd have to start over again.4 When downloading files DO NOT exit the app at sll. Your files will stop and you will have to start all over.5 Remote wristband to stop and start recording. Horrible absolute zero range. I was 6 feet directly behind the camera and it had difficulty picking up signal and thats because I had to turn my wrist and point directly at camera.Overall as I said its ok for a kid or someone you really don’t care how they like it. If it was a little cheaper or if the app worked better had zoom in and out and able to orient as I turn my phone I could have lived with it. In the end went back to the Gopro 7 black.Hope this helps."
"Up front, it’s an ok camera, as of May 2023 don’t buy it if you want to use your own external mic or don’t want other people erasing your videos for you.I picked this camera based on reviews to be a starter action camera with support for external mics. I eventually figured out that many USB mics only, which I considered a plus since it could power the mic. It don’t. I’ve since found on them page for their mic that no other mic will work but the sole mic they offer, which is corded. For an action camera, that didn’t make sense.When I first powered it on, all me use were in German. I’m in the US, so why did I get a German language phone? Had to Google search to figure out how to change it. Bad first experience.The picture quality is ok and it accepted the 256G high speed card I had. The white balance seems off though; recording inside makes me look yellowish with a yellowish background.While accessories that came with it work well enough, third party accessories only look compatible—the bolt that goes through the rings is larger than the nut. Plan to use this with the traditional camera mount screw adapter, like for a tripod. I had to use the clamp connector to make it stay on a selfie stick because the mount didn’t fit. The AKASO mount is sturdier, but not compatible.WiFi connecting is a pain and very insecure. Why do I have to direct connect to it? Plus, the passcode is hard coded and universal !! I can take over any AKASO camera in range and change the settings, erase videos, etc.The front facing screen and price are the only redeeming qualities of this camera."
"Decent quality video, easy to operate, but not as durable as what an action camera should be. I ride motorcycles and film trying different things and just kind of documenting progress and different things. Had an accident was definitely a decent hit the camera was jarred the least of everything involved. Externally it was fine with a superficial crack to the screen but the three prong connector that transfers power from the battery to the board dislodged. This is the second one I’ve seen this happen with that points to shoddy manufacturing in my opinion and I don’t think you should make cameras for action sports and market them as action cameras if the first time they are bumped or dropped internal components take more damage than the external components. This has to be a known issue or I would not be 2 for 2 luckily one was a gift and I only pissed away the cost of one. But I would definitely recommend a camera with a better durability for at risk applications. If you aren’t worried about potentially dropping or jarring it great cost effective budget recorder but there are several options that fill that gap possibly cheaper. If you want an action camera research and find one that can withstand action."
"Some poor software decisions have turned this good product into... a lousy product. Why, you may ask? The most crucial reason is that this camera purposely blocks non-Akaso-branded external mics, even Akaso-branded external mics if said mic is USB-C rather than Micro USB, or vice versa (can not even use an adapter to overcome this).Example: I bought a USB-C and Micro USB Akaso external mic to test the theory on whether Akaso purposely blocks external mics or not. The conclusion was that if the mic was not branded by Akaso and listed as supported **BY AKASO**, external mics would NOT work. The test I did used the USB-C Akaso branded mic with an adapter, along with the Micro USB mic without an adapter (on an Akaso Brave 7 LE); the USB-C mic had been overlayed with static noise (no voice recordings)... but the same mic, with the Micro USB port; it had conveniently worked. This leads to only one conclusion: they purposely block mics from working because they want you to buy specific equipment for the particular camera you own.Why I think they do this:Money... it all comes to money. If they make a camera with a Micro USB port and later release a USB-C ported camera, they block the USB-C mic from working on the Micro USB camera, and vice versa; now you need a USB-C and Micro USB mic... from the same company for your USB-C-equipped and Micro USB-equipped cameras to work as they should, instead of just simply allowing the user to get an adapter for the mic you had owned previously to work on the new USB ported camera.This leads me to review this product as a 1-star rather than a 4-star."
"Immediately returned it for the fact that it's not USB-C in 2020, 2021 , 2022, 2023 and now 2024 your product not having USB-C  is Unexcusable! ,  especially when  the only place to get those cables is on Amazon and I'm not waiting 2 or 3 days for a replacement , if my cable just happens to break or I end up losing it somehow for me to be able to use your product again.(I'm not going to treasure hunting for cable) I like carrying 1 cable for my electronics no matter where I go, convenience is King."
"Was really hoping to give this camera a 5 star rating. But also want to be clear this rating is not about camera quality, rather about the poor mounting capability. So everyone is aware, I am posting this review about the camera not having a very secure mounting system. Lost the camera from its supposedly secure mount in the ocean and it sank - it was in the protective housing, which apparently does not help it float. The straps stayed connected to me, but the camera popped out of its bracket and sank immediately. it was ""securely and properly connected"". Was trying to capture surfing. I have had a Go Pro in the past and never had this issue. Really bummed as I did not even get a single video. If you plan to do underwater action, I would strongly suggest finding a better mounting system then what the camera comes with and using a floating strap of some sort (which did not come with the camera)."
"Great quality, but battery only lasted two short runs on the mountain at a mid/level quality. This would be my only complaint so far. Not sure if the company sells higher quality batteries as an upgrade but it’s something I will definitely look into so I don’t have to switch out batteries in the middle of runs."
"So this is 1 of 5 Action Cameras I have decided to try. While this is a mid Priced Camera.Lets start with the Durability and Quality. The design is poorly thought out, & starts with being built with lower quality parts, that fail after several years of ""Normal Use"".In fact,,I only use this inside the Plastic WaterProof Case, and the fact it still has issues is puzzling???What the Brave 7 has done is....started with a great Aluminum case and a Cool forward facing Mini screen.But it ends there!The Brave 7 settled for below Avg Lens quality, A Terrible Zoom Feature??? And Horrable App features that leaves 1... to simply removing the Micro SD Card, to Move Content from it to your Editing Device.So to summarize it, its about 75 over priced, cheap quality, un-user friendly featured and Horrible Software!I have compared this to the DragonTouch Camera for 49.00, and several GoPros with various models.And,,my verdict is.... buy the Dragon Touch over this!"
"Update 1 4/5/24:Had given 5 stars on initial review, but just after few weeks of owning it, I have all sort of problems.Bought it for a trip to Mexico and could not capture anything worth as the camera kept freezing randomly.It would just show white vertical lines and the only option was to pull the battery out and put it back in. Very hard to do when in water snorkeling, was using a Samsung Pro SD card, changed to Sandisk and another Samsung one to see if it was the card. Same behavior with all cards. Now coming back from the trip tried some tips that Akaso website recommends, but still no good.****Do not buy this camera if you have once in a lifetime moment to be captured, dont do the same mistake like me. ****I had a great Gopro for a long time and then one fine day did not close seal the water tight case properly. Sea water came in and before I came out of the water damaged the camera. Did not want to spend so much right away on the upcoming trip and decided to give this one Brave 7 LE a try for the price it was. I am not missing lot of features from the GoPro and the picture quality is so far good. Dont try the wind cancellation mode for the mic, it didnt work for me very well. It did come with all the accessories and the water tight case for diving with the camera, a good thing for me as you dont have to go and buy them separately. Overall good lightweight camera for your adventures without having to shell out a lot of money. Big question is how long will it last? time will tell. Will update as we go along."
"This was a Christmas gift for my son in 2021. I was lured by the good reviews and the great sale price, and the fact that my son was then 7 so I didn’t want to spend a ton.  Not long after he had it the entire camera would freeze occasionally, the touch screens wouldn’t respond and the power button wouldn’t work. The only way to “reset” it was to remove the battery and reinsert it. I was disappointed that my son was needing to do that so often but he didn’t complain.  He did constantly tell me that he thought the sound in his videos was very low though.  By the following August, after 8 months of use, the port inside the camera that connects to the battery broke off so the battery had no way to power the camera.  I submitted a warranty claim and returned the broken camera. The company was great and sent a brand new camera. The new camera also freezes and the battery has to be removed and reinserted. My son says it sometimes freezes while he’s making videos. He’s also received error messages when uploading videos that the videos can’t be read as well as experienced the camera dropping the connection to our new computer despite being connected via a cord. The computer doesn’t see the camera is connected anymore.  This is the same computer he was using with the other camera and the same high end memory card so I have to believe the fault lies with the camera itself as we didn’t have these upload problems with the other camera.  There have just been too many issues with the original and now replacement camera that we have had.  He’s not rough on the camera. He holds it in his hand when he’s moving or props it on boxes while he films.  I finally gave up and bought him a GoPro HERO9 on sale for this Christmas.  Hope you have better luck than we did. All the great reviews would lead one to believe this is a great camera but after 2 duds we’re done."
"This camera can’t be used for what I wanted it for. I wanted to film my work and I thought I could use the software on my phone to see and control what the camera was seeing. The problem is the WiFi connection from the camera to the phone keeps dropping for no apparent reason in the middle of filming and you can’t see what’s on the camera to reconnect if its on your head, chest, etc. Really bad and frustrating design.Then I couldn’t get the camera to stay straight when attached to the head band so I must have overtightened it. Then I couldn’t get the attachment off. Wouldn’t have been a problem except with the threaded attachment on, you can’t get to the battery to charge or change it. I literally had to take a hacksaw to the connector to cut it off the camera so I could change the battery. Again, really bad design. As a small business owner struggling to make a profit, I really can’t afford to waste this much time and money. And I dont understand how there are other positive reviews. The only way I can see using this is by holding it in your hands, otherwise you can’t see what you’re filming until it’s too late to know you’re not on screen. And if you have to hold it in your hands, you might as well just use your phone."
"Reading the other reviews everyone seemed impressed with this camera. Unfortunately that was the exact opposite of my experience. The camera performs terribly underwater - the ""diving"" mode that supposedly color corrects images doesn't. Despite shooting at what Akaso says is full 20 MP, all of the images came out looking like I'd taken a photo of a tile mosaic then asked a child to render it in crayon. The fisheye effect is so pronounced that no amount of post-processing could generate a usable image anyway. Even at relatively shallow depths the images suffered from EQ imbalance.On top of all that, the software experience leaves much to be desired. I have little/no interest in shooting video and there was no way to default to photo mode. Many times I woke it up to take a pic only to realize I'd accidentally made a terrible 2 second video. The app required to transfer images also requests more access than would reasonably be needed to complete the functions. I couldn't use the editing tools because ALL of them giving your personal information before you can access them.If you're thinking you found a great deal on a scuba camera, think again."
"Although this camera does work, the video quality is not good, even in 4K 60fps. If you are not in exterior fill sun, the image is VERY dark.The audio is non existent if not DIRECTLY in front of the camera within 5 feet.I trusted the reviews that this is a capable entry/ mid level action camera. Plain and simple, save your money on this, and get something else.I was hoping to be able to record some hiking activity. Some tinkering in my shop and maybe my kids playing. The video is... okay-ish, but the real let down is the audio. The video still shakes during normal walking, even with stabilization turned on.I thought about using a mic, but would not be avow to use the case.Disappointed in my purchase.Update - contacted Akaso customer service. I was told that by the actual human being that I would be contacted via email to arrange replacement or refund...Nothing! No contact at all!Akaso, do better."
"The camera feels sturdy, not cheap. On a tripod in a well lit area the video is fine. On a mountain bike on flat Florida trails the image stabilization leaves something to be desired. Used as a dash cam in a moving vehicle it works well. The accessories are abundant in the kit and useful. Battery life is pretty good. I used it in Timelapse mode to record some plants growing. The camera was in the direct sun for over an hour recording and never overheated. As long as you aren’t expecting the results you’d get from a $300-$400 camera and know what you’re getting you should be pleased."
Not as good as GoPro. It is a budget friendly camera. Battery life is short
"This is our first camera of this kind.Had to do a lot of looking up on YouTube for how to use the mounts, etc and haven’t really gotten started with it yet. Waiting for a secure helmet mount for a horseback riding helmet. But overall the camera seems simple to use and comes with a nice waterproof case and many kinds of mounts"
"Before ordering I watched some reviews comparing Akaso's products next to Gopro and as a result I didn't expect a perfect product. I expected something to do a halfway decent job of recording my bike rides around town. Boy was I in for a let down.First things first, I will give the semi-pros first. Does the camera work, yes, it records video and takes pictures. Does the image stabilization work, kind of. Does the provided helmet mount work, in a janky way yes.Now to clarify: The camera does record video but it is incredibly grainy like white noise covering your video and I doubt the 4k resolution is truly 4k. The onboard microphone is completely useless unless you're yelling at the device and there is always a layer of ""tape hiss"".The image stabilization works but is not good by any means. You can still tell the camera is shaking and if you, like me, are cycling and go off a curb or something similar the image stabilization completely fails.I have a Lazer Anverz e-bike helmet that has a mount to fit a GoPro on the top. The provided helmet mount works fine with Akaso's base but using it with my helmet was incredibly unstable (shook back and for a good 3/4 of an inch). I had to strap down the back of the mount with the wrist band strap for the remote. It works but it's not the best.My biggest complaint though is that the glass for the lens cover is EXTREMELY soft. I used a glass cleaning cloth to clean the lens cover since I noticed my recording of my ride to work was blurry. I was gentle with the device but after just a couple circles I noticed that the glass was scratched.I plan on using the camera for the rest of the week to see if it's still something I can get some utility out of and give an update with what I find."
"I wanted to use this camera to record video while cycling. It is not suitable for that. Many people will like this camera. I am not one of them.Pros:Large selection of low quality mounts.Good user interface - easy to configureUseful remote controlNice waterproof caseGood build qualityGood image stabilizationCons:Constantly incorrect exposurePoor low-light performanceScreen switches off after 60 seconds and unable to tell if it's still recording or even on.Mounts will not hold the camera in place while cyclingThe deal breaker for me was that to mount it on the handlebar requires the handlebar mount, a 90 degree adapter, and the camera in the waterproof case. This is heavy and the slightest bump had the camera pointing up at the sky. I tightened the mounts as much as I dared (it's all plastic) but could not fix the problem. I tried using the screw mount but that was even worse and the camera quickly swung to the side no matter how hard I tightened the locking nut.The attached photos were taken with the waterproof case on. You can see the external photo is overexposed and the internal one is grainy."
"It has great video but the audio is terrible.  I bought the external mic and it was better, but still not great.  Then I bought a wireless mic only to find out AKASO has their own platform and so the mic does not work with it.  Imagine not having a great audio system and then making it so you can't buy better mic's elsewhere.  Every time I make a video there are audio problems. (Jim's Morro bay fishing at YouTube) The video is great, but if you want good audio this is not the product.  Very frustrating!!"
"Not the greatest video quality, but a lot of great features.  If you want good video quality I would recommend buying an older used GoPro.  Even a Hero5 has better video quality than this camera does."
"I originally left a great review for this camera, but within days of submitting that review the camera started malfunctioning. When I would attempt to use the camera the touch screen would freeze and the camera would become inoperable. Sometimes I could get it to work again by turning it off and back on, but most of the time I had to remove the battery to let it reset. But once it was working again, it would only work for a few minutes before freezing again.I called the Akaso customer support number twice and left messages, but never received a return call. The instructions say this number is 24 hours. Evidently it isn’t. I sent emails and after a couple of days would receive a “canned” response. The responses made it obvious that the support person did not read my entire email, because they were telling me to try things I already had tried. Eventually I stopped receiving responses and was left with a camera that doesn’t work and accessories that I purchased that are no good to me without the camera. The finale email response I received from customer support was over a month after I sent my last reply!I purchased this camera a few weeks before my wedding and honeymoon (hoping to learn to use it) to capture video of those events, unfortunately I only have a short video of part of the wedding ceremony and no video of my honeymoon because of this garbage camera. These are memories that I will never be able to recreate and don’t have any video to enjoy from them.I am unable to return the camera and accessories because the return window has expired.If you want to have a reliable video camera, this isn’t it. If you need customer support, you won’t find it with this company. Spend a little extra and get a quality camera that works."
"I kind of know what I was getting into with a cheaper ""action"" cam. I just wanted to try it out as you never know if you will find a diamond in the rough as I have in the past. The diamond in the rough is not the case here. My ""thing"" is mountain biking and there can be a lot of wind. The mic completely failed in this regard. There was not only the wind sound but there was a high pitch squeal when the speed increased. This is not something I want to deal with.As for the picture, it seemed pretty good but the EIS (image stabilization) needs a little work.I did not test the waterproof portion of the camera since we are in fall going into winter.It should be a 2 star instead of a 3 but I am going up to a 3 due to the image quality."
"I bought this item because of positive reviews comparing it to GoPro for a fraction of the price.  However the Akaso has a hard time connecting to my phone for remote recording and seems to shut off automatically after 30 minutes of recording.  I bought it to record full games, so it is not useful to me. For shorter clips it’s easier to use my phone.  I am using it for baseball/softball and there is a great GameChanger integration but it only works with GoPro and Mevo, I should have bought GoPro.  I also brought this to an amusement park for helmet action shots and found the remote did not connect consistently when trying to record.  Unfortunately I cannot return this anymore so it was a waste of money."
"Having only operated the unit a few times the plastic of the latch for the case has cracked apart and no longer able to maintain the seal and also the camera within the case.I bought a V50 Elite at the same time and exactly the same thing with the latch plastic.The units were operated on a boat above the se level and subjected to splashing no reason for the housing to fail.I am happy with the camera side for the price, fortunately a second battery was included as it quickly goes through them."
"Seemed to be good quality for my first ride and I was excited. Unfortunately, I dropped in on a dirt driveway from a height of about 3 feet and the back screen shattered completely. I definitely should have been more careful, but I expected an “action” camera to be a little more durable. Now I’m out that money, but I guess that’s on me. Just a warning to the other folks out there - treat it gently!"
"I already had an older Akaso video camera and it worked well. I thought, go for the update and get even better quality videos. NO! The new one that I got does not give as good of a video quality. I'm trying different setting, but so far the oldie is the better quality camera."
"I did get this cam to record live music performances as I was interested in the small factor as well as the ruggedness. The picture is serviceable although it easily gets dark in pubs.On the audio side - the mic is not sensitive enough or the input volume cannot be attenuated enough to get sound without clipping, either with the built-in cam or the Akaso Brave 7LE external mic that they sell.It is a serviceable still cam and video camera in bright light conditions, maybe even bargain for the price.It did not work out for me. I am returning it and the external mic and will buy a Zoom Q series cam as that's what I've seen some other musicians record with and they get exceptional sound."
"This camera has great picture and video quality, but the microphone SUCKS. The only way I’ve been able to get sound to playback on a video is if I put my mouth right up to the mic and talk directly into it. If I step 5-10 feet away and speak(loudly), there is no sound on playback. I purchased the Bravo 7 LE to record softball games. The Bravo 7 has an external mic you can purchase, but the 7 LE does not.  Note: I did not record any video with the waterproof case on the camera, and the mic was ON during recording. The window to return this camera has closed, so I’m stuck with it. I’ve sent an email to AKASO and so far have received a canned email with a few linked articles that were of no help."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                BUYER BEWARE...Honestly had high hopes for this camera. It comes with a ton of mounting accessories, a waterproof case, and two batteries. The build quality seems up to par too but it just isn't it...The accessory ports including the battery/SD slot and HDMI/USB are extremely hard to open easily, It almost hurts to get it open. If this is going to be a heavy use camera or you don't have great finger strength it will become a pain to you.The SD slot is not in the best position, in order to remove it requires you to remove the battery. It is possible to get it in and out with the battery still in but it is not easy.The image quality is okay, but just that. I have an old Iphone 6 that takes better pictures unfortunately. Everything seems to come out just grainy.I primarily got this to do youtube videos and occasionally some sporting activities. This is where honestly its worth the great price. It cannot even a simple stationary home video, let alone a video in motion. It is so grainy, again I pitted it against a old iphone camera and the iphone destroyed in in regards to video quality. I enabled video stabilizing and it made in incrementally worse.Overall I have high hopes but that was quickly killed. It is just not worth the money at all... I am hoping that It was just a defective camera but I am not sure. I will continue to test and may update this post but I am not happy. I dont review much but this has to be said because I don't want people wasting their time on this camera."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            This is an action camera fail.1. The white balance adjustment causes a flickering effect on timelapses such as sunset2. There are pink flower pedals around the sun (see video) - not even the AKASO Brave 4 had this problem3. The the camera was engineered is bad - if you screw in a tripod adapter you cannot open the battery or external power doors causing you to have to in mount the camera and remove any attachments to get to the battery or power4. The low light quality is the worst most grainy looking images.5. The optics / lenses smudge way to easy compared to every other action cam own.  Can’t keep it clean.If you need basic quality video during a bright day or a bright night scene then this may be for you but it’s not for me due to the problems listed above and the lack of low light quality.Try a Brave 4 or just get a real GoPro Hero 8,9 or 10 for a few dollars more.  Returning this camera"
"Purchased in May 2024 to mount on ATV to video offroading trips. Tried to turn it on 12/12/2024 and it turns on for a few seconds then goes to a blue screen. Have attempted to get answers from Akaso tech support website but no luck.12/13/2024: received response from Akaso.... for $22 and I pay to ship back the old camera they will send me another camera. No thanks, I'll try another brand..."
"Bought this as my backup action cam, that's about it. Shot some videos underwater and low light, only mediocre quality."
"Build quality is good. Only problem is the small sliding cover to the ports has gotten hard to open by hand, so I use a little rod to push on the button and slide it open. With that said, the construction is robust, this thing is not going to fall apart. The camera quality is alright, not great, if you stick to 30fps from 1080 to 4K you’ll be fine, and you don’t want to use this in anything other than good lighting. The interface is good; once you learn the gestures and where things are, things are easy to change. The front screen is really useful for positioning the camera quickly. Image stabilization does not work well, don’t use it. Right now I use this camera as a webcam and to record myself driving. You get two batteries with this, and also a remote that you put on your wrist which is pretty sweet, among other attachments. This camera isn’t going to compete with a GoPro, the quality on those beats this, but using it as a documentation device is good. If you need an inexpensive camera to knock around this is a good choice."
Picture quality is great but audio isnt good at all.
"Build quality=5; Video quality=1; Photo quality=2; Ease of Use=1I was hoping to get a better action camera and saw this camera with good specs and great price offer, only to find out after I pressed order that they charged $24 for out-of-the country shipping and another $24 for local tax (its only $10 here). So I felt cheated, but still hoping that camera would be great anyway.I give them 5 stars for build quality but the price, they sacrificed the ease of use for non-diving users. Theywant to make it waterproof, so they made every port and door so tight that you can barely open them without at tool. To use the buttons, you need to have strong finger pressure. Otherwise, you will really be irritated with this camera that the only place to put it is the bin.And the video is worse. Even in clear daylight, the quality is smoggy at best."
"This camera has a nice build quality, feels sturdy, looks well built. The interface is easy to figure out, and it comes with a lot of accessories. It comes in great looking packaging. On paper it looks like a great value. However that’s where it ends. The audio for this camera is practically nonexistent, you have to practically shout in order to pick up anything your recording, and I did not have the waterproof housing on. Then picture quality is ok depending on what resolution you pick, 1080p 60fps was my sweet spot. I couldn’t hear any sounds from the videos I recorded. It is possible I got a defective unit and when I contacted Amazon they agreed to send me a replacement unit, so I will hopefully have a camera that records decent sound. I don’t expect miracles or GoPro like sound quality but something better than what I have now which is barely no sound at all. If it turns out I get a better unit I will add an update to this review. I checked on Akaso’s website for support on this issue to see if there are any software fixes for this but couldn’t find anything for them. For now this camera has been a disappointment. But I will keep my fingers crossed in hopes that the replacement will be better."
Long times to download and always fails when its attempting to download after a few minutes.
"Yea, they say to buy U3 SD card. I looked in the quick start three times. No further details. Waited four days and now the wrong size is in my hand. Looks like a decent product with super poor documentation.  Company can't afford anything but small tiny print. Sell quality you won't be disappointed."
"I really liked this camera at first. I didn't try to connect the app, so I can't review that aspect of it, but I did loved using it. I actually only used it once, on a three day trip to Philadelphia, where I took a lot of really nice videos. After I returned, I didn't use it again at all for about two weeks. I just tried to turn it on and it's not turning on. I tried to take out the battery and charge it, I tried to plug it in without the battery like the website says to do-- it's just black screen. Which sucks because I liked it.But I will do a YouTube review of the camera and include that information, like I have with all my other cameras.Update: contacting customer service with the issue of it not turning on only yields an automated message which repeats the website troubleshooting method, which I've already don't and doesn't work. Don't waste your time."
