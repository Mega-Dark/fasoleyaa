Comparing to my Fire7. Some of the apps I used on 7 are not available on 8. The size difference isn’t a problem. I liked size of 7 but wanted newer model.Disappointed that I couldn’t just use some apps.
"Two of the three main applications I wanted to use this device for (cookmate, and Ancestry)... are not compatible with this device! Which means my 6 year old (8th gen), water damaged fire 8 is more useful to me than my brand new Fire HD Plus....I've already opened the dumb thing, and that means its unreturnable."
Returned in three days.  Tablet kept freezing or stop working all together.
"Three weeks old and started getting ""moisture detected in charge port"" warning. It has not been near any liquid since I received it Oct. 6, 2024 and I had it in a case protector . However I followed suggested fixes and still it gives me the warning. Have been unable to charge and/or use it due to it being disabled because of ""issue"".  I bought this to replace my Fire HD 8 10th gen  that got destroyed.  That was way better than this 8 plus model. I'm gonna try to return it for a replacement but not sure how to get my info out of it since it can't be charged. Not a happy customer right now."
"It's a nice tablet but it lacks biometrics so logging into many websites and apps is tedious.  I purchased this to view all of my Ring cameras.  The first thing that I noticed is that the Ring app cannot be viewed in landscape mode.  However, for this to work as an Echo Show, it needs to be viewed via the Alexa app which does display in landscape.  Coordinating all my security cams to show events via the Alexa app is a nightmare.  I am spoiled by apps that are intuitive and automatic.  That is not the case with connecting Alexa to my cams.  I should be able to link up and activate all my cams simultaneously as a group.  Can't be done!  Each cam needed to be set up individually with routines which necessitates about five-plus clicks per cam.  Ugh!!  Finally, this device was not very responsive.  Sometimes a motion event would be quickly displayed, but most frequently an out-of-focus image would appear.  The tablet would struggle trying to resolve the image and then blank off.  Yeah, so even if this advertises as sporting an Echo Show mode, good luck getting it set up and working as you might hope for."
"Do you need ANOTHER way to buy from the smile?  Well, this is for you because the only thing its good for is buying more items from them directly or signing up for a monthly subscription.  There are at least three apps that ask you to sign up for a monthly subscription to use.  Probably more but I can barely get past all the marketing and that's not including the $15 you have to pay to remove ads!  You can't remove Amazon installed apps.  You can't hide them or put them in a folder.  There is always an advertising banner along the top.  It doesn't allow much customization and isn't very intuitive.  Also, you can't return it.  I thought this was going to be what I needed to read, maybe play a game, browse the web but no.  If you already have all those subscriptions, maybe this is for you but I'm not giving them $50 a month for the privilege of constant data collection and a couple ""free"" books.  Get a tablet with more flexibility."
I bought 8hd plus. Surprised to find warranty is only 90 days. HD 10 plus has one year. Why the difference? If I had realized I would have purchased insurance. My new fire started having problems after 2 months! They replaced after much agro but I'm wondering if replacement is reconditioned not new. Never had a problem with older fire tablets. Not a happy purchase.
I wanted to like it but didn't work with the games I have on my other fire tablets so I returned it
"This tablet is so much smaller than my old 8 in fire.  It has the same feel and look as the 7 in fire tablet. It's tiny. It came loose in a box with a little booklet, no plastic screen protector. I bought this tablet thinking it was  new this seems to be a used tablet"
Super disappointed that it won't run Roblox for my kids when a previous version did. It's most of the reason I bought it in the first place.
"I used to love my Kindle. I think this is my 5th or 6th I've owned but I won't be buying another one. If you want a device simply to access Amazon content, it's fine I guess, but they have made it so difficult to upload anything not purchased from Amazon that it's made it such a frustrating device to interact with. Even Amazon content doesn't always work. It's like they are trying to copy Apple's Walled Garden experience but they aren't good at it, so when things don't work, they don't let you access any controls to fix it. I tried to download a movie from Prime, it kept trying to load it on an external storage disc, which I didn't have and there was no setting to tell it where to download it to. I've been trying to load an e-book I bought seperate from Amazon for an hour and it's still fighting me. This thing is mediocre at best and maddeningly frustrating far too often. I'm done with Kindle's."
I was shocked  by the sizes  im looking  at all the purchases I purchases  I think  y'all  should  send me something  for  my decation  dag amazon.  Thanks  any wa
"I don't like the earphone jack and the power cord on the left side because I plug in on the right side of the bed.  The light does not reduce enough for nighttime (even when nightshade is on).  The inability to dim the screen more was the reason for the 3/5 on screen quality.  The cover I bought does fold but its only position is too far back for my taste.I do like the fact that it processes faster, I like that the battery charges fast and lasts much longer than my previous Kindle.  I haven't activated Alexa because I find I don't use it but if I did, it would be easy to activate and ask my question."
"I bought the new Fire HD 8 (2022) to replace my 10 year old Fire HD 7, which still works. Mainly it was because my old Fire no longer supported downloading apps or purchasing anything through the Amazon digital store. When my new Fire arrived, I was completely happy with it. It already had quite a few apps installed on it, library shows read & unread books, has free Alexa, & cordless charging, just to name a few of the things I liked. My new Fire HD 8 arrived on Nov 30, 2022, with a 3 month limited warranty. On Mar 6, 2023, after having used it while at an appointment that afternoon, & 6 days beyond the warranty, I came home & placed it on the charger. A while later, I went to use it, & it wouldn't turn on. I tried everything I could think of, before calling Amazon customer service for help. The lady I talked to had me trying everything to try a hard restart, but nothing helped. It was dead!! Because it was 6 days beyond the 90 day warranty, they offered me a 25% discount to order a new one. Since this particular tablet was currently on sale at $79.99, I went ahead & ordered one. Needless to say, I'm completely disappointed that this new tablet only lasted a little over 3 months, while my 10-year old Fire (which cost $200 when purchased) is still going strong. It almost seems, since they're being sold for a lot less, that they aren't being built to last. I'm just hoping the Fire HD8 Plus that died was a fluke, & it isn't what I'm going to experience going forward with the new one!"
This is a new feature of the7/3/2024 update.  You now have to go through the kindle app.  Your recommendations are on the first page scroll over to find your library.  Poof just gone.  My oldest devices have it.  Resetting factory settings does not help.  Amazon customer service said that's just the way they are now.  In other words a new kindle will not help.
"The magnet on the pen is not strong enough to hold it on the tablet when moving the tablet through the day. I have now lost two pens since August 25th. These pens are too expensive to have to keep replacing them. They should come with a find my pen and also there should be a slot in the tablet for the pen to go in. Other than the pen drama and that unlike a chromebook where Canva works like on desktop, on this tablet even if you go through the browser it acts like the app, otherwise I love this tablet."
I was coming from the Apple ecosystem and trying something new but tbh once you had a taste of Apple you simply just dont want to go to anything else!!! I ended up giving it to my friend and getting an Apple Pro iPad
"i use this mainly to play small games on and they suck the life out of the battery bad. The graphics work great on it and it is very helpful when not at home for emails and such. but, better take a backup battery if you are not going to be able to plug in."
"I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ with the AMOLED screen and it makes the display on this unit look washed out and dull. I had to double check that Amazon shipped me the right model. Also, for a $1K tablet to not even come with a charger is pretty bad. All in all a big disappointment in Samsung, I really wanted to like this tablet."
"Hello, thank you. The product has arrived in good condition. It is under testing. Note that only the Wi-Fi version is the sixth version, not the seventh version, as stated in the description."
"This is a wonderful tablet and I've already been using it for all sorts of things over the week I've had it.  The screen size and clarity is great and the battery life isn't that bad in my book.  However, because it doesn't have an actual wall charger with it, I have had a really hard time charging mine.  Even though it supports fast charging, my device says it is charging but actually loses charge when using that.  Maybe it's the different chargers I have at home that it doesn't like but they work with my samsung phone for fast charging."
Unfortunately with all the promises from Amazon.. they NEVER followed thru on anything.$700.00 down the tube... no resolution from seller or Amazon.People just don't care anymoreUPDATEI have continued my dilemma with vendor and Amazon which seems like months.Although amazon has written to vendor concerning a trade/reimbursement (no response) and then a citation (no response) and then a request for warranty info since it wasn't sent in the box (no response)I'm still out a brand new tablet and approx $800.00.  This tablet was suppose to be the most water and dust proof and yet that was the first thing that went wrong (within 2 weeks after return window).  Then shortly after it would not charge at all.Since this has gone on and on....you would think Amazon would offer to take up the mantel.  AMAZON should offer me a refund or trade. .... and then they can deal with this seller.  But no....AMAZON has not.I did buy another tablet here and noticed that it has a 3 month return policy....this one did not (only a 30 day!)I do no recommend this seller at all for anything.  Also I am trying to wean myself from Amazon because they have changed drastically over the las year or 2.I'm always getting the moisture detected alarm which also affects the charging.  It's very frustrating and annoying.  Usually takes about a day or two to reset itself.This is only after having it 2 months.  Now it just sits at 1% charged.Vendor will not do anything and Amazon has not offered help either.Speaking of Amazon............what has happened with this company??????  Totally disappointed and out $800My only alternative is to spend more money to install a new battery...to a 2-3 month old tablet.Thanks (haha) VEDOR....AMAZON...SAMSUNGAnyone else have this problem?
"So this is my second tablet first one had dead pixel while gaming and this one, yes you guess it dead pixel. I’m trying to love it, productivity, school work, browsing, YouTube, Netflix is great, but when it comes to google cast to tv is lacking. I’m on a fiber connection. WiFi on this tablet is great stay on wifi 6E every in the house. Gaming button get stuck, pixel goes missing, it just doesn’t handle games like Roblox very well, so forget trying to play something like apex legends. For the price is just not worth it. Unfortunately I will be returning for the second and last time. :( Samsung you didn’t understand the assignment."
"I started with the Galaxy Tab S2 and have upgraded to others as needed.The S Pen is not something I really needed or wanted, but came as standard with the S9. The case I got for it kept having the pen fall off so I have place it in a drawer so it does not get lost now.The ever increasing size and weight  of the top Tab S model is also getting a bit unwieldy.I use a tablet to play silly android games and stream movies. and the S9 seems to be trying to be more of a keyboardless notebook."
I love Samsung products but didn't expect the displayed images to be so large.Videos played on YouTube are fuzzy/not crisp.I believe I shouldn't have paid so much but it has other great features.
"I bought this to replace my Amazon 11, which is a terrible tablet.  They are much better, and have features that the Amazon 11 doesn't.  It is not worth 800 bucks, but they sure out shine the Amazon tablet.  I think I could've gone with a less expensive Samsung tablet and been just as well off."
No instructions included. Connector not standard and no converter included. Not warned of this so you can buy one. Setup demands you use Google. Setup refuses to accept google password. Chat help is 45 minute wait. this is not a plug and play unit.
I barely use it. Battery is draining so fast.
"I was so excited to use my new tablet for Christmas, but once it arrived, I noticed the packaging wasn't really secure. You can hear the tablet moving inside the parcel. When I opened to see the tablet, I saw the screen was already scratched and cracked. I was so disappointed! Now, I have to go through the trouble of returning it."
"The tablet is very slippery, so you will probably need to get a cover to prevent it falling out of your hands and breaking. The screen brightness is bright enough for outdoor use on a sunny day in the shade, but the glare/reflections will limit it use outdoor very much. The DeX mode is great if like I, you actually got the slim keyboard case as promised. Too many little things are disturbing for a tablet at this price point to rate higher than 3 stars."
"Three weeks later (and 40-50 hours later) I'm still trying to get back to where I was on my old Samsung tablet. The so-called automatic transfer is a colossal waste of time. Also, you should know that there are no real navigation buttons on the screen anymore, there are only 'virtual' software buttons. Several times I have almost taken a hammer to the screen out of frustration. Even writing this review is painful and difficult. I'm visiting relatives for the holidays. I'll buy an Apple when I get home. Samsung is the best advertising for Apple products.Ever notice how our latest tech is far worse than it was before? Thanks to Google for taking the simple straightforward and obfucating it for profit. Now all companies are doing the same"
"Great hardware, terrible software, pen is useless.  Samsung has loaded this tablet with a toxic amount of junk, much that can not be uninstalled.  For example Microsoft One Drive cannot be removed.  Samsung's take on the UI is also awkward.  The Samsung assistant is unusable, requires yet another account and has onerous terms and conditions with complete disregard to user privacy.The pen was ditched in the first 5 minutes.  It sticks to the back with a magnet, making the tablet uncomfortable to hold and doesn't lay flat.Battery life is very good.  Build quality is solid.  Display is also very good."
"Recently bought the new Tab S9 and while it works great and looks great the battery is awful.  I've changed all the settings i can that help with battery and it drains way too fast to the point where my old Tab S6 has better battery life still.  i can have it full charge and nothing running and over night it will lose close to 20% battery and when in use is losing % every couple minutes (ex: another 15% draining after watching youtube for 30min) i may have gotten a bad battery but im considering returning or trying to exchange which is disappointing as i shouldnt have to charge multiple times a dayOther than the battery, it is nice.  Very fast and snappy and no hiccups with anything."
"Dislike ....constsnt beeping, says charger and input wet....NOT...Will be trading in...dissatisfied..."
"Great tablet. Never buying one from Amazon again as they sell it with a $100 gift card and free storage upgrade, but never give you the card. Beyond frustrated."
Not really happy. I'm finding slow response. Battery doesn't last like I hoped. Not sure I'll keeit
"This review is for the Tab S9+.It does not work with USB-connected devices.  This is not the case on my prior tablet (Tab S4), nor is it the case on my phone (Galaxy S23), which the devices I'm trying to connect work fine on.  This eliminates about a third of the functionality for me.The touchscreen is not very sensitive, either, even if you turn up sensitivity.  If you use anything other than the s-pen (such as a soft stylus or finger), it has trouble registering touches, often missing them."
Returned the item just for it to be lost in transit. Meanwhile I am still being charged for the item.
"Past the return window, have to contact Samsung now..."
"This is not a useable 'computer' as implied in marketing. Probably good for video, screen is great. Terrible interface compared to a Samsung Note or a chromebook. Not fond of the magnetic attach S-pen. Sync hung, app migration was not acceptable. Will be replaced by a non-Samsung chromebook as Samsug doesn't have internal S-pens on the better chromebooks anymore."
"Why would Samsung sell me an $850 tablet and not include the power adapter? I'm told I have to buy it separately. I have several Samsung phones and an old tablet, but none of the adapters I have are compatible."
This tablet has had touch screen errors and misinterpreted gestures since Day # 1. Something wrong with the touchscreen.
"This tablet is slower than a smartphone from 10 years ago. I first tried purchasing a refurbished Galaxy Tab S7+ but it was too slow. I then tried a brand-new Galaxy Tab S9+ and it is EVEN MORE SLOW. It's mind-bogglingly slow. It's slow to open apps. It's slow on the internet, regardless of how fast the available Wi-Fi is. (It never went above 1 mbps internet speeds on my 100 mbps Wi-FI).This tablet is literal garbage - truly one of the worst pieces of hardware I've ever held in my hands. It's mind-bogglingly worthless, a genuine insult from Samsung to anyone who thinks their money is worth anything."
Slower loading and a lot of sticking pages. Not sure the screen is as crisp as my s6 which I really miss!! What happened here samsung?
"I have purchased like 7 Samsung tablets on Amazon in the past year... only 1 did not have dead pixels right in the middle of the screen. Be aware that your device will almost certainly have dead pixels when you order it. Now I have to return it, wait 30 days for a refund before I can place another order and hope it doesn't have dead pixels."
"This tablet is probably fine for someone who is up on the know about tablets, but our old one was not even close to what this one can do!  We had no luck getting it set up and getting it to go.  Also, it did not come with the SIMS card needed to work.  Like selling you a car with no keys?  New policy, they now sell you a tool, cheap, but no battery."
"I have owned this tablet for about 4 months. How many Android monthly security updates has it gotten since purchase? 0. There is a reason why iPads dominate the tablet market. If this what a premium Android tablet experience is like, you are better off just passing."
"Constantly crashes, don’t try to do any actual work on it, can hardly run excel. Also don’t use it for entertainment… can’t even run Netflix without crashing.  Tried a factory reset as a last resort, didn’t work. I must have a terrible tablet, otherwise there is no way any company would consider this a feasible product. Buy anything else besides this tablet. A 1st gen iPad has a better user experience."
Add said came with free upgraded storage but mine didn't come with any extra memory. I wonder if I will get the $100 GIFT CARD PROMISED.
I am disappointed that it did not come with a charger and sd card..  when I purchased it there wasn't even a recommendation to purchase those. Now I have to wait a few more days for those items to arrive. For what I paid for the S9 those should have been included.
"Spending a $1,000 for a Tablet of this size it should do at least 16+ Hours, and that's with watching Video the entire time.Instead, simply using the ""Browser"" and Typing for FAR under 8 Hours, that is ALL it lasts.This isn't a ""Laptop"", I do not understand why the battery life is so weak?  Not acceptable in my view."
"I purchased a new tablet, but it's been used; the box is open, and it even has a password. Now I can't even use it."
Item was not as it was displayedKeyboard was missingCover was missing
This product was advertised to come with a free Samsung memory upgrade and $100 Amazon gift card.Neither were provided.  The Samsung S9 is a great product but I suggest you buy it elsewhere.
The HDR makes every modern show/movie way too dark and there is no way of disabling it.
These are worse than Amazon fire tablet and that’s saying something. Don’t waste your time if you expect something comparable to a iPad. I returned this and got any other iPad lol
Purchased the first one and the pen would not work on certain parts of the screen so I purchased a second and the exact same thing happened except in 2 different spots..DO NOT BUY
It is ridiculous this tablet comes without a charger and you have to buy it separately…
Great tablet but never got my 100.00 gift card that amazom prommised.
Complete cheap garbage.  No charger included.  $800 and they cannot even give you a charger?  Seriously?
"very glitchy, very slow, but good battery life big pretty screen and good UI, less features than the ipad.if they made it less glitchy and made it a little faster id enjoy it.glitchs ive encountered, screen times out and shuts off every 30 seconds even if i adjust settingswhen i string a movie or show and i tap to see time bar, the UI wont go away, thats on any show, so im constantly refreshing the page just to watch something.internet pages get hung up, tablet shuts off,playing games on the tablet i get very low frames and the game stutters even with very simple games."
"I bought this to replace my samsung galaxy s7 tablet, thinking it would be faster. Unfortunately it is not, my s7 was faster, very disappointed and wasted alot of money!"
"this thing is unblelievably awful. i wish i could share videos of my frustrating experiences trying to do normal things. microsoft is a nightmare and so is outlook. its so glitchy, often it doesnt register touch or when it dies it does the wrong thing. i'm so angry that i was fooled into thinking this was a good device."
"Received my package after the promised date. Everything works tablet is awesome. Only issue is that it is false advertising, I did not receive the gift card or a storage upgrade. I contacted customer service they offered a refund? Why not just give me the gift card like you said you would when I bought it?"
can not be activated by verizon
"I purchased one of these on Aug. 30. Six weeks later and it is dead. I've owned a ton of Samsung products and never had an issue with them. Disappointing to have a brand new tablet die. I've tried all of the trouble shooting measures without any luck. It's a nice looking tablet but as nice as it is, it's an expensive paper weight. I'd think twice about purchasing this product."
Stuck on this stupid screw for 10 minutes on startup.  Responds slowly.  Save yourself and buy an sole device.  I had enough time to get mad and then write this review while waiting for the device to start.
"Okay so to be fair, for a $70-80 tablet maybe my expectations were too high, and I did read concerning reviews but thought “how bad can it really be?” My mistake!!I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my nephew. It arrived 2 days ago and I haven’t even gifted it to him yet, but that’s probably a blessing because at this point I’m leaning towards returning it. He has been playing on an old iPhone of mine (super restricted and only used for games/YT kids), but the phone is on its last leg so I thought a cheap tablet would be a good replacement for him.Apparently I shot too low though because this thing is hardly functional at all. It was easy to set up out of the box, but as soon as setup was complete I had that “uh-oh” moment that I made a mistake. It runs soooooo slow, and there’s nothing even on it yet! Not to mention, I even deleted some of the basic apps it came with when I was setting it up.Not tablet related, but I did super love the Google kids account option.  I’ve got restrictions based on his age and everything gets managed from an app on my phone, so that is great. But that’s a Google thing, not a tablet thing.The touch screen on this tablet is not very responsive and the tablet itself is super laggy. I downloaded three games so I could test the control settings I had set up, and now the tablet can hardly move from screen to screen. You’d think I had 100 apps downloaded and all running in the background. It also keeps signing out of Google play for some reason so none of the games work until it gets reconnected each time and that’s a huge pain.Im definitely not going to give it to him yet, and I will reach out to see if the manufacturer can troubleshoot and get this thing working before I go straight to returning it, but I would be absolutely shocked if the ultimate outcome is anything other than this going right back to the Amazon warehouse it came from.Spend a little extra on a better model - this thing is more trouble than it’s worth!!!"
"I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt. I did not want to order an Amazon fire tablet eight. But after trying the Lenovo for just three weeks, I was very very disappointed on how slow it is.Pros. Huge props on the screen quality as it’s very clear and looks like 1080 P even a close because it’s hard to tell a difference on an 8 inch tablet.The battery life is insanely long! You can easily go all day into the nextHowever the ConsConsIt is insanely slow after you load about three additional applications that you normally use. At times it takes up to four seconds to load an app. Once the app is loaded, it’s fine,. But going in between apps, and how slow the screen rotates from any given angle is 100% frustrating and will drive you nuts!I purchased the fire tab 8+2022 to see if I was imagining things. The fire tab 8+ is at least six times faster and everything and I mean everything and even the screen quality is better although I think the mono speaker of the Lenovo is better than the two speakers on the tab fire 8+2022. So regrettably I had to send this one back and I’m actually getting a renewed fire tablet 10+ for only $109. You can get the 10 renewed for only $79 and I guarantee you you’ll have a much better experience in this Lenovo, unfortunatelyYou can watch how to load google apps on the fire tablet switch is very easy and you’ll have a tremendous lightning fast budget machine regardless if you choose the Amazon 8+2022 or the Amazon fire 10+2021. But do yourself a favor and pass on this one the reviews you were seeing are very old and this does not work with new technology applications."
"I've had the M8 now for a couple of days and am happy overall with the purchase.I use it primarily for light weight tasks like reading the news, checking email, texting, and shopping.  It's OK when I use it for Youtube and will report back after trying it for Netflix.  My guess it'll be OK given the wifi speed tops out at about 40 mb/sec.Likes  ***************-Sharp display-Micro SD expandability (I've added a 32gb micro sd; 32gb was not enough!)-Battery lifeDislikes  ***************-** Slow ** wifi even though it's AC.  I stood right next to my router and it topped out at 40 mb/sec while my cell phone topped out at over 220 mb/sec.  In areas where the wifi signal strength is medium, the M8 is sluggish.  (side note - the ethernet speed also topped out at 40 mb/sec; I have a USB-to-ethernet adapter).-Can't set which screen as the Home Screen default.-No upgrade path to Android 11-Big trouble with transferring files from Win 10 PC to the tablet via USB cable.  The problem was that the USB preferences was defaulted to ""No data transfer"" and changing it to ""File Transfer"" manually still wouldn't let me transfer files from my PC to the tablet!  The solution was to put the tablet into ""Developer Options"" mode and then change the default to ""File Transfer"" from there - from that point on, no problem with transferring files to/from the devices.  (""Developer Options"" mode is for advanced users so I will not give instruction here on how to implement it)"
"Early March 2021, edited again to add: Upgrading to 2 stars. We found a workaround for the connectivity problem. We changed our modem settings to WPA + WPA2, and this helped quite a bit. The tablet still drops connection, and there is occasional lag when loading pages, but nowhere near as bad as it was. I'm limiting the rating to 2 stars because if we're ever able to travel again, who knows if I'll be able to use the tablet anywhere else? I can't control the modem settings everywhere I go. Lenovo should build a device that's not so dependent on quirky modem settings.Late February 2021, edited to add: I'm downgrading this review to 1 star. This tablet is now constantly dropping internet connection. When it is connected, pages take way too long to load. No other devices in the house have this problem. This is intolerable. If I could I would return it. Buyer beware with this product.Original review: I got this tablet mainly for surfing and reading online. Setup was was fairly straightforward, but took longer than I would have liked (this might be due to my lack of tech savvy). I didn't like the preloaded news-y feature on the home page; removing it required some detective work, as did getting rid of unneeded icons (again, not very tech savvy here).Once up and running, the tablet worked fairly well, although it does seem to drop signal regularly, especially in the evening. Sometimes when I have several tabs open there is a discernible lag (up to 5 seconds long) when switching between them; the address bar will show the address of the new tab, but the screen will still display the page I just switched from. Pages are often very slow to load.The tablet itself is very slippery and smooth; I highly recommend getting a cover for it. (I got the Fintie cover here on Amazon and it's working well.) The power button is on the side, which means it's easy to inadvertently power down when holding the tablet. The camera functions well for its power level.Battery life has been fantastic so far. I use the tablet several hours a day but don't need to charge it every day.For the money, and if your needs are limited, this tablet is a decent deal. If Amazon allowed half-stars I'd rate it three and a half due to the frequent slow loading and dropping of signal. It's nowhere near as slick and quick as my husband's Ipad, but also nowhere near as expensive. It does the job for me, but I feel it's a case of getting what you pay for."
Tried to download one game and the tablet couldn't even handle that. Tried loading and would almost instantly crash and not work.
"Perhaps I expected too much from a $100 tablet...  First the tablet does not come with user instructions, rather a 2"" X 2"" startup guide written in micro mm font that I could only be read under a microscope. So I turned to the trust old internet and downloaded the Lenovo ""user guide"", which while visible to the human eye, was also quite brief, and still nothing more than a snapshot of features. From there it went downhill. For example, after I downloaded the user file, I could not find it on the device!  There seemed to be a download manager indicated, but it was nowhere to be found on any of the screen pages. So I looked in Google Files, and could not find it there either, until about the 89th time I checked and then it finally popped up, BUT then the tablet said it could not open a GIF file!  You cant make this stuff up.  Finally, it felt to me like the included software was nothing more than a portal to Googles servers, since everything I did went to their cloud even though I disabled that feature.  So, I ended up returning it, and realized if want something beyond a toy I will need to shell out $400ish, and that's OK if that's what it costs. I just wish these poor performers were described as what they are."
"I was originally looking for a Samsung 8 tablet and after reading a lot of reviews about people running out of storage in no time at all, I checked out the Lenovo Tab M8.  I'm very pleased with the Lenovo so far after learning that some of the installed apps needed to be upgraded before they would work.  At first I was ready to send it back. Now I wish I had sent it back. The battery lasts 3 days and that's because I'm not on it all the time.  One thing that you will notice is that the metal case is VERY SLICK, slicker that snot on a marble.  I was afraid that I would drop it.  I immediately ordered a ""Fintie Case for Lenovo Tab M8/M8 HD"" after reading a ton of reviews.  WOW.  The Fintie case was the only good thing about this deal.  This is a perfect fit for the tab. This case provides excellent protection, although it may be too bulky for some.  Again, I will take a bulky case over a cracked screen.  Check it out.  The Lenovo has lots of room left after loading lots of apps and pictures from my phone.  The first problem was videos on Rumble stop for no reason, and if only for a few seconds, it's annoying.  Rumble does not do this on any of my other devices.  So, out of the box, it's fantastic.  Now for the long term.  After 6 Months, the honeymoon is long over. The Levono is constantly locking up while scrolling.  Even when typing it is prone to stopping.  I've had Virtual Shield since day one and now it's acting up. Most annoying is the sound it makes while on, but not in use.  It's hard to describe, but at times it's like a grinding noise out of the speaker.  For no reason.  I'm looking for another tablet, but there doesn't seem to be a good one out there for under $250.  Maybe an Exorcist can fix what's wrong with this Lenovo that's used for light duty and it can't even handle that very well."
"I give this tablet a check under the ""pros"" because the battery lasts all day, though that could be because it's so slow that I get frustrated, put it down and just use my cell. Also though it doesn't have a USBC quick charger, it still charges in a few hours.I really, really wanted to love this tablet. Yet I quickly learned that, though it's android, it's nothing like a galaxy android. If that's what you're used to, and want, this isn't it. The lack of a ""back button"" or ""close all open apps button"" is quite frustrating to me. Also the fact that every time the screen times out, I have to reload the entire app I had open seems that I spend more time waiting.... and waiting... for the app to load than actually using it. My son in law has an android I phone, and says this screen is more like using his. He says when he picks up my daughters galaxy android, he doesn't have a clue how to use it. That in itself could be your selling point, or deal breaker in deciding on this tablet. For me, it was just too much headache, so I'll be returning it. Experiencing a regular (wifi only) tablet, after getting used to a galaxy Note for everything from games to communicating E signed documents to my CPA, I just can't enjoy the long wait between screens at 50mbps. I've decided on the A7 with data, simply for speed and familiarity of the screen and apps . I hope this helps if you're looking for specific android options."
"7/8 inch tablets are somewhat of a rarity these days but I’d figure that there would be something that could contend by today’s standards. Not this one.Even with expectations really low, the performance of this tablet is quite sorrily garbage. Slow processing power means that responsive touches are all out of the question. Too much input lag with even the most basic tasks. Screen resolution is okay, but that’s not saying much.The bad:- Despite having decent build quality, it’s far to heavy to be used in hand. It’s metallic finish makes it slippery too.- Abysmally slow. What a horrid excuse for a processor, even for sub 100 dollars. Tasks freeze, or take ages to respond. The user experiences are very much frustrating and lackluster.-Bloatware. Lenovo garbage software has to nag you on getting setup without options to remove, unless you root the device. Why is it so hard to have a clean barebones Android device?Because it’s already a lackluster device, I’m doubtful I’ll touch the camera or any other features. I’m not optimistic for those aspects either.Besides maybe expandable storage, I’m not really sure what is a positive of this device. It’s price point should allow it leeway for compromises, but even with these compromises it’s very much quite garbage for even the most basics of task. The fact that nothing has progressed in the sphere of tablets this size 10 years later is rather disappointing even if there isn’t much of a market for it. Consider a higher price point tablet and skip this, you’ll save yourself the headache."
"These were sold as new. However, every one of these Lenovo packages had been previously opened, then re-sealed with a V logo sticker."
"This was probably the 6th or 7th tablet that I've tried. Every one has been a complete and utter disaster including the horrific Amazon Fire tablets.The tablet cannot figure out how to connect to my office 365 email account, so during the middle of setup there is no escape option and I have to restart the device to get out of this horrible tailspin.Then I thought, who cares, I bought this to watch YouTube TV so I'll go to the Google Play store. But the Google Play store crashes about 5 seconds after you open it. Over and over.Done. Returning this useless paperweight. Horrible device."
"The battery is excellent, lasting several days with the screen brightness at %50 or less. It has decent storage for those who do not require storing a ton of files or pictures. It is also decently snappy in response time.My biggest two complaints are the screen and the lack of USB type-C charging. The screen at full black is more of a milky black. Those familiar with Samsung panels will know of the deep, rich black that the user with greeted with along with samsung's ""SUN IN YOUR F*ING FACE"" bright white logo at the Samsung splash screen on Boot up.This is NOT that. This is like taking a black piece of paper that has been continuously exposed to months of direct sunlight, and looking at that piece of paper WHILE in direct sunlight.It is fine for those who do not need anything too demanding from a tablet. The sound is pretty good, but requires you to increase the volume from zero every time you plug in headphones.  If you can live with that, it is a respectable offering. But to be honest, for a few extra bucks, the Tab A offers a much better experience."
"I had gotten this hoping to use it as a tertiary device that I can also let my kids use and at the $100 price point not be upset if it broke. I’m a HUGE Lenovo fan and feel they always deliver more than what you pay. The device has an extremely mediocre screen, the device runs slow even with a single app open, BUT the battery life is more than adequate. At the end of the day this tablet will be for the kids and that’s fine. But this isn’t an iPad and it was never sold to be as such, I just wish I had paid more and got a more hardware robust tablet and that isn’t Lenovo’s fault."
It is slow to play video and is not able to run Zwift in a manner that is usable.
"The only reason I purchased this tablet was to use it to display the output from my Yi Camera. It does this very well. However I have a major complaint. The response to input is extremely SLOW. When you select a function, it seems to takes forever to respond. You touch and then you wait for it to comply. I'll need to give this some time to better comment on it. It is fine for the purpose I bought it, but I wouldn't recommend it for general usage."
"Not sure if it is software or processor, this little tablet is for my 8+ to play with his friends on the weekends. They get ones semper video and ay Ro lox together, and it started glitching 1+ month ago. The it starts to turn off by itself. Today I turn on the screen, and it turns off immediately. Tried a few times, same problem. So I called azon Prime and requested an exchange.I have never had any problems with Lenovos in general, I hope this is just a lemon and I will get a replacement."
I am not great with co puters but this tablet took me two days and three rests to set it up. I had to charge it beforw i could do that. After that the tablets battery us not so great. I just wanted something to read with and this tablet is not that great. I would not but it again. I will go back to the Samsung tablet that I replaced this one with . Savi g this one for my grandkids to use.
I tried to save money so I bought this because of the name brand. From the time I had it I knew it was a mistake not enough ram.  I didn’t put many apps on it but it got to were it wouldn’t even bring kindle up without crashing. I can’t believe it is still being sold and people are still buying it.
"For most people, this will be fine. Browse online, stream vids, send emails, the mundane daily things most people use tablets for.More than that will stress the CPU. For example, I loaded up a minimalist music program called Sunvox and half the example tracks redline the processor to a continuous 100% mark. Not too surprising since that's asking a lot for a budget tablet, but it still annoys me that my 4 year old Honor 6x running Android 7 out-performs it by miles (vs this being recent and on v9).Tip: Comes with typical bloatware pre-installed, so there's a noticeable performance gain for even normal app use when disabling background google/lenovo apps.Going to return it for the M10 since it doubles the CPU core count from 4 to 8 and doubles the RAM from 2gb to 4gb. Android 9 eats almost an entire gb of RAM right out of the box, so 2gb is considered bare minimum at best."
- The google search widget it has does not work very well.- Message every time you free up memory or space is irritating.-Does not have an easy return to the last item.-Does not allow multiple items to be open so you can switch between them easily.- Seems to lock up on a screen at times.- Returning and getting the Samsung 8 inch mini tablet. which is about $25 more but has one more gig of RAM.
"Okay, I know that you get what you pay for but this was not a good purchase.  I wanted a form factor that was comfortable in hand when using the Kindle app but that was on true Android.  Lenovo has long been my friend ever since the early ThinkPad days when they acquired the PC line from Big Blue to newer ThinkPads to the Tab 4-8 that has moved on to my housemate.  I had reasonably high expectation but this device is slow, not responsive, and the Kindle app just doesn't play nice with it.  It looks good, feels good to hand but I find myself wanting to hurl it out the window because it's so darn slow.The Kindle app works a treat on my entry level iPad but I wanted something easier to hold when exploring my Kindle library so I thought I would give the tab M8 a whirl.  I should have purchased the iPad Mini."
"At first it seemed too good to be true: a solidly-built tablet from a major manufacturer for less than $100! To my delight, the device updated itself to Android 10 right away, so it was even running a current version of Android.Some reviewers said it was slow but I really just want it for testing my mobile apps (I'm a programmer) so I thought I'd give it a try. It was slow, that's for sure! But it felt like kind of an odd ""slow"" ... some things were fast, but anything having to do with the network seemed really slow. Yet Speedtest was fine - maybe making new network connections is slow? Very strange. I switched networks and it didn't help. I was unable to log into several apps (nothing obscure - apps from major companies in the Google app store that I've used with no problems on other devices) - it just spun forever, or I had to try several times. It's like something was gumming up the network, especially on those login screens. I decided for $20 more to go with a Samsung Tab A that I know will work because I already have one that I use for casual gaming.It's too bad - I always loved Lenovo laptop computers - but something isn't right with this tablet."
"This tablet does do quite a bit for the price point, but the resolution is dated and it is pretty slow."
"Touch screen is so bad it barely worked after having for just few months. Don't waste money on this crappie, I wish I can return and get refund. Wasted that money for no reason.."
"My friend recommended this tablet for my son, since her son has the same one and works great. So I bought it. Well, I should've read the reviews a little more. The tablet is slow. Shortly after I bought it, it's been really slow and lagging. It also charges REALLY slow. I brought an old tablet we had from 2020 and plugged it in to charge. The old tablet was charging A LOT faster then this new Lenevo tablet. It's unbelievable. I'm really disappointed in this. I only bought because I couldn't afford a Samsung tablet, and our last tablet won't charge anymore. Thinking of just switching back to our first tablet since it still works, and it works FASTER then this."
"I bought 2 tablets for my toddler twins. I've never bought Lenovo before, usually a Samsung girlie. However, neither tablet fully worked. I was able to set them up, but then I decided I wanted to change some of the settings on the device...that's when the problems started. The settings tab simply did not work on either device, it kept crashing every time I pressed it, and I needed it for several different things. I spent the next couple HOURS looking up workarounds on Google and YouTube, nothing worked. I even did a factory reset and redownload everything...still didn't work. Imagine that with 1 year old twins climbing all over you. I was soooo irritated. It was also painfully slow. I've just never had such a bad experience from the start from an electronic. I will never buy Lenovo again."
"I bought this tablet to replace my older Asus tablet that was starting to have battery health issues. This is a well made tablet, with a beautiful display, and fast processor, and works well. However, battery life is terrible; what's worse is the power settings are minimal, less even than stock Android power settings. The tablet loses much of its power when sleeping, and there is no way to insure wifi is off while it is sleeping, nor any way to easily monitor or control background usage of apps. My old Asus tablet has better battery life than the tablet I bought to replace it!"
"Tablets arrived in questionable packaging, the stickers that seal the box were already removed... The tablets work and will be used for simple time clocks but very disappointed in the seller and would not buy from again. Buyer Beware, they are also out of warranty."
"It is truly unfortunate that I am writing this negative review. This tablet was a complete waste of my hard earned money. It freezes all the time and kicks me out of the apps I am in. So then I have to start over.  The screen is sensitive when you don't want to touch it but when you do want to click on it, you have to click several times. Also there is no border, all screen. When it freezes and you want to restart, you hold down the power button and nothign.....it just stays on frozen. Many times it just goes to a blank screen."
"I ordered my first M8 a week ago. After setting up the tablet everything worked fine except for my ability to open the settings app. I restarted the tablet and factory reset it but the issue continued. I could not connect to any other wifi network apart from the one during setup.I ordered a replacement. But the same problem happened again. I could not open the settings app, even when I logged in with my account vs my son's account (in case it was a parental controls thing)Every time I coi ked on settings the app would crash and a pop up would come up to say settings crashed and I could either click force stop or app info. App info was cyclical since it required opening settings.I tried contacting Lenovo support on the day I received the tablet and the automated system told me my device was outside of warranty.I will not be ordering a Lenovo tablet moving forward. I will choose a different manufacturer."
I purchased my Lenovo 8 inch tablet last September. I was very pleased (why I gave it 3 stars) with it but over the months it's gotten slower. I took a lot of the apps off thinking that was the problem. But it didn't help will not be getting another one.
I hope the actual product works alright because the charger is not for this. It’s for a newer iPhone with rounded edges (oblong oval) rather than the trapezoid shape the tablet requires. If it doesn’t work right I’ll update this product with the correct stars but as is I’ll leave it as a neutral 3.
"I am able to use it for email, sometimes, and uber & lyft. also have decided to use it for scheduling and notes. My main squeeze will always be my baby but this is a great addition for productivity. Oh, and I took a picture of a flower in my yard and sent it to my mother. That was cool!Update 043021:It looks like I am going to have to reset it or send it back IF I can't switch the camera easily from front to back. There is not a way to do this and I have searched the web and some had unresolved issues of this sort from 2014. However, I can't find a resolution or whether they got the issue resolved. I will have to send the unit back as being able to take pictures NOT OF MYSELF is very important to having a tablet."
"Good screen. Battery life is fine. But touch screen seemed finicky at times, however that might have been affected by sometimes a glitchy, slow response - even with a good connection in a strong wifi environment. Even my cheap, out-of-date 3G cell phone had better response, side-by-side with the same wifi connection. I wanted a device that would be more than a phone but handier than a notebook; unfortunately this isn't it. The good news is that the return to Amazon was smooth and easy."
"This is the second time I bought this Lenovo Tablet. I was hoping that the first one I bought was just a fluke with how bad the speed is on it, but nope, its just a TERRIBLY SLOW tablet. The processor speed can take upwards of 15 minutes to let you use your email....that's just plain gross. Not even worth the price paid."
"Internet is super slow on this device....I get 400mb/s wireless on my phone but only 90 mb/s on this tablet standing the same place, using the exact same wireless connection.  It makes apps noticably slower, esp updating apps.  Also, super annoying there is no auto brightness feature so you have to adjust the brightness when you go outside/inside every time.  A few other annoying things are that the screen auto rotates as soon as you put it down...no matter how careful you try not to tilt it.  Lastly, the camera is super low resolution.  I have a hard time doing my banking online (taking pictures of checks to deposit)...the app keeps saying that it can't read the numbers on the check until I take a pic in very bright light...would not buy again.  Super disappointing."
"This is a powerful device filled with technology and a beautiful build quality at an unbelievably low cost. I love the 8 inch screen size. I have two complaints: the screen quality is mediocre. Viewing is not terrible but it just isn't as nice as the image on my cell phone. Sure the cell phone has a smaller screen but I don't think that is the whole story. And, the Android doesn't seem to function as well as my cell phone. I would pay more for a device that didn't have these limitations. The FHD full high def version didn't get great reviews so I opted for this version. I now wonder if I should have purchased the FHD unit."
very disappointed when i first got this tablet  i turn it on and set it but i didn't use it. i went to play a game on it keep malfunctioning. The Wi-Fi is hard to connect also screen keep going black i have to restart for it to come back on. it do not work i wasted my money because i can't return it. i shouldnt have to call tech company to fix an item i never really used  in 1 month and was supposed to be tested and in very good condition.
Less than a year old and won't charge. Will check to see if the warranty is actually a year.  Guess we'll go back to Samsung...
"For anyone looking to have a tablet for reading , checking emails , watching videos as well. I wouldn’t really suggest this tablet. It’s not a bad tablet by any means , but as a student I’m used to snappy motions and quick load times and overall heavy multitasking. That being said this tablet is great if you don’t care about all the things I listed and just need something for your child or yourself as long you are aware of this tablet and it’s limitations. I ended up returning it and getting a used iPad Air 2 and to be honest , very surprised that a tablet with 5 year old technology handles quite better than this supposed “new tablet”"
"I purchased this tablet about 4 months ago, as I wanted something small and really portable for everyday use and travel. However, I have been nothing but frustrated with this product. First, it is very slow, even when running only a single app. You have to restart it every other day or so to clear enough memory for it to be able to open a book in libby or kindle app and turn the pages without delay. That's without anything else running on the device (I am very particular about closing apps and minimizing what can run in the background). Today, the wifi quit working - it's connected but says no internet, while other devices in the house are running on our internet just fine. I have tried multiple troubleshooting websites, resetting, restarting, to no avail. It's looking like I will have to do a factory reset and/or send in for repairs. Very irritating! My kids tablets - refurbished Samsung Galaxy Tab As - are in the same price range and size but are 100% more functional. If I could return this and buy something else, I would."
"Its ok, but you can definitely tell its a <$99 tablet.I only run one app on it for my business and it lags all the time or doesnt connect to bluetooth promptly.Will probably change it out in a few months"
If you're using them for maybe watching YouTube or basic functions like reading it's good. It is not fit for playing games or anything else on though. The processing power is on the weak side so it can't handle much without stuttering.
"Everything about this tab is great except the speed, it's unbelievably slow using the internet. All other devices including three Kindle fires are at least 2x faster on our network. Our Samsung phones are on page three while this one is still loading.  Apps load fast and work well if on line is not required. Should have sent it back while the return window was still open."
"I got this tablet because I had a really bad experience recently with Amazon because my Kindle Fire got some water in it somehow and Amazon wouldn't fix it because it was off warranty. I needed a replacement but was trying to avoid another Kindle product. But, joke's on me, because this thing is so uselessly terrible that I am now going to buy another Kindle Fire. This time with the extended warranty. Now, to this Lenovo tablet. 'It doesn't work. It's ridiculously slow. The only app I can get to work the way it's supposed to is an e-book app to read a book. One, and only one book, because I can't add anything to the memory. I have tried 5 different SD memory cards. 2 are Lenovo and the rest are Sandisk. None worked. I thought I bricked it but it was just the tablet stuttering and restarting because of the memory card. I expected a lot more from a Lenovo product. I use their computers a lot at home and work. I am shocked at how bad this tablet is. Do not buy."
"I've had this for a year now. I knew it was a budget option going in and was fine with that since I just wanted a tablet I could use to read kindle books on and watch youtube on the go. It's incredibly slow and often glitches; pulling up youtube is a coin toss on whether or not the sound will work, or the videos will play properly after ads, even after making sure all apps are updated. I spend a lot of time fiddling with it and restarting the tablet to try to get it to work."
"Bought two of these in December 2020. After an update in 2021, a Lenovo app was forced onto the tablets that crashed at least 3 times daily (couldn't remove the app, either). First one screen completely died in mid-2022. Second one, the battery failed in mid-2023. Both tablets were only used lightly to moderately and suffered no physical extremes. While they worked, they were decent, but I had two Google Nexus 7 tablets prior to these that lasted twice as long."
I purchased this about a year ago. The sound went out within a couple of days. The sent me another and now not even a year later all videos are black screen. Don't waste your money. I'll never buy another Lenovo again.
Exceptionally slow. Could not connect to hotel wifi when all of our other devices did easily. I have retired it after a couple months and replaced it with a new Samsung. It will be collecting dust for years to come.
"This tablet is very very slow. Almost useless. My Wi-Fi connection is fast enough, my other devices are full speed on the same connection, so it's not a bandwidth issue.  Very frustrating to use.This is a Lenovo product, so I thought it would be a good tablet. I have a Lenovo PC which is excellent. The only good thing about this tablet is that it is cheap, so it's no big loss. When will I ever learn? You get what you pay for."
"I purchased this tablet in October 2020, so it has almost 2 years of use on it.  I wanted to try a Lenovo tablet because my 14 inch Lenovo laptop has been so great.  Well, this tablet fails to impress to put it mildly.  It is slow and crashes or freezes up frequently.  Things take forever to load and the touchscreen is not very responsive.  I really like playing the ""type a letter and wait"" game, and boy howdy how fun it is to constantly reboot or force stop apps to get out of a frozen screen. I am not going to use the Lenovo any longer as it is just too frustrating.  I am typing this review on a much faster ASUS 380 ZenPad.  I have the Google Nexus 2nd gen 7 inch, that snappy little guy is a classic.  Also own a Galaxy tab.  Heck even the Kindle my sister gave me outperformed the Lenovo.  Yes it is  a cheap tablet, but don't waste your money.  Spend a little more for performance."
Good tablet but it is rather slow. Stuff takes a little bit to load and the touch lags a couple seconds. Good for kids though.
"This tablet takes forever to boot up.  It pauses a while, then shows a jerky Lenovo start up animation that serves no useful purpose.  Then pauses a bit.  Then you log in.  Then it shows the Lenovo start up animation again.  Then it pauses.  Then it complains because I refuse to set up some Google thing it ""requires"" me to set up.  Finally I can open an app.  I bought it so I could have it out when using my telescope to quickly check some video feeds from inside my observatory.  I thought that would be faster and more convenient than having to pull out my iPhone every time.  It would be but the iPhone is an order of magnitude faster so I quit using the Lenovo."
"Codec issues in this day and age and to this degree is unacceptable. 1 star. I bought it primarily because it is a larger screen than a phone so as to read comics and or watch videos and due to it having 1tb of portable micro sd storage expansion capacity potentially. I have a 1tb card in it, Windows can read from it fine and yet... why did I bother getting this if the many tv shows I have cannot all play? The screen is nice so in portrait reading graphic novels is great so I'm only keeping it for that. It's a nice ebook reader in other words.  I regret buying it and might send it back because it's just sad that it can't play normal video files like a modern device should. A normal computer from circa 2009ish could run circles around it in regards to videos. If not for the 1tb for vids I would not have even bought it. Androids are in decline. apparently as is Lenovo."
"I purchased this lenovo tab and had the first one crash on me within a matter of days. I ordered the same one again, because I know any technology has things like this that can happen. I just wanted something low in price and decent enough to search the web but to use for kindle and meditation apps... FIRST, i couldnt believe how slow this thing runs. i know i wasnt expecting laptop speeds, but this lenovo is beyond slow. The quality overall is definitely not worth the money. The battery life is horrible. It dies fairly quickly, but the worst is that is takes hours upon hours to charge, only for the battery to die out pretty fast again. There's that old saying you get what you pay for, but this quality is worth less than what i even paid for it because the battery life is so bad and the speed of it is extremely slow, and i have very fast wifi speed in my house. i would not recommend this. There is really nothing good i can say about this lenovo tab honestly."
"My previous tablet was an NVIDIA K1 SHIELD; so my performance expectations may be a bit biased but using this lenovo certainly brings to life the truth that ""you get what you pay for.""  And being that this name-brand tablet is extremely affordable is no wonder why.I would not recommend...I would gladly pay more for something that performs better.It takes quite a while to open apps and it crashes often enough that I question the design; it performs like a device that has memory problems with the frequency of app stalling/crashing.I wanted to like it and hoped that it was just a bargain for ""yesteryear's model,"" but my hopes were quickly dashed on the rocks.  Sorry, Lenovo, but this was a swing and a miss, if you ask me.Otherwise, the material construction seems sturdy...if that's more important than performance."
"The response time from this tablet is abysmal.  I am not attempting to play games on it, or do anything else that would tax its capabilities; and I have tried it on a variety of WiFi sources, all with the same results.  I strongly urge you to purchase some other device if you need something the is actually USEFUL; this isn't it."
"I bought this to stream music on our patio.  The unit itself seems fine, but when using BT speakers the volume is either too loud or too quite there is no in-between.  I sold this and replaced with a Samsung Tab A7, much happier for my needs."
"All n' all this is a good product however, does not meet my needs. I wanted a tablet for digital amateur radio comms. It will be air gapped consequently, I need to download an app (FLdigi) to the tablet. I was under the impression based on the product description I could do that.The directions were very basic so I contacted Lenovo to find out how to do this. The agent told me that it was not possible to air gap the tablet and download a app without going through the internet. Actually, the agent I chatted with had a hard time understanding why I would not want to go through the internet.Oh well. I want to write, I love dealing with Amazon. Ordering of course is easy, however, where they shine is doing returns. Never an issue. Thank you Amazon.73 & God BlessJohnymac"
"I find it very slow. Whenever I try to open any app, it took few seconds. The screen quality is okay."
"I'm pretty disappointed in the device. It is extremely laggy. When used as an e-reader it is perfectly fine. But when doing web surfing that's when the leg appears.Maybe it's my pudgy fingers, but I have trouble with the touch screen.I suppose I got what I paid for. The format is perfect but the tablet itself leaves a lot to be desired."
"I love lenovo computers,  but I do not like the M8 tablet. Granted, reviews did warn of the inability to run certain apps and as I was only going to use for kindle, I did not think it would matter. I also added some games and as an example,  candy crush will crash the pad.  I recommend spending a bit more money and get something other than the M8.  I wish I did."
This pad is slow. On the internet there is s delay that's aggravating. I don't think I'd buy this again. I like giving 4 and 5 stars. Can't do it this time.
Not good for gaming extremely slow.
It’s good for kids to use. But it is really slow. Battery last for long time
"So-called ""battery protection mode"" can be turned off, but automatically engages again after charging for 7 days."
"I bought this for my aunt to play games, simple games. I'm playing the games to get familiar with them so I can let her know how to play them and various games keep crashing for no reason no. Why did they put such incredible technology in the small phones and large tablets but these medium sized easy to hold tablets end up being crap?"
"I bought this as an extra tablet for work. The supplied charger never fit right and the port was damaged after only a few uses. I sent it in for repair and they said it wasn't covered. There is no other way to charge the device since it is not compatible with charging pads. The screen is small, but battery life is good, if only it could be charged."
"I keep a tablet around for looking things up while my phone is engaged on lessons, videos, Wordle. I've had a series of low-end Samsung tablets. Slow, but good enough. This one as I have it now, is too slow for ordinary light use."
"absolutely the slowest piece of tech i have ever operated, apps stop, and never recover, input response's are just as slow as start up , i have nothing good to say about it at all"
"When I purchased this I was buying it for my kid so I could set it up for him similarly to how I set up the M7 and M10 but no, it's not the same. Does not default to a kids mode when setting up the tablet. You have to go into a kids mode app after you set up the tablet. I don't want to share this tablet, I want my kid to have it as his. Hopefully I can return it and just get another M7"
"Use this tablet mostly to surf the Web and read ebooks. Screen is decent, although it lacks an adaptive brightness setting, which is annoying. Cost was just under $100, but I honestly regret the purchase now. This tablet is considerably heavier than my old Samsung of a similar size and the performance is AWFUL. The lag and freezes are nearly continuous and for the price, I'd suggest buying a Fire tablet instead."
Terrible product. Bought this for my son to play games and after about a week it will not connect to wifi and cannot access setting to fix anything. Everytime i try to access settins i get a message saying app closed. So i cant connect to internet to update software to potentially help and wifi menu does the same so i cant delete and redo wifi connection. Complete POS!
"Frustrating and annoying to use.  Everything moves at a snails pace...opening an email, loading a website, everything.I have used Lenovo laptops for home and work for years but the tablet seems like it was made by another company.  Screen, graphics, and sound are all fine but the simplest tasks move in slow motion.I'll stick with Lenovo laptops but will avoid their tablets in the future."
"Product reliability is very poor. Unit dead after 18 months, 6 months after warranty runs out and 1 month after a new app appears from a Lenovo update called Tab Center. Unit gives blue screen of death saying Android OS is corrupted. Works sometimes for a couple of days, or a couple of weeks after resetting and restoring all the apps & preferences. Unit never dropped, never really used heavily, always use at home basically to occasionally to check e-mail, quick web search, or use for home automation apps such as Kasa, Caseta, and Alexa. Seems very odd problem appears after a new app from manufacturer saying my product is out of warranty and to consider signing up for an extended warranty. Will stay away from Lenovo products in the future. No way to contact customer service at Lenovo other than to schedule service for a $100 tablet. More e-scrap."
It is a reasonable low price tablet.  Don't expect to get the speed and reaction of a 500.00 unit. You get what you pay for.  We are using it to collect data in marketing events. It works just fine.
I bought this for my mother as a mother's day gift. She really only wanted it to play one game. (June's journey) the game took forever to load. Her phone that is 7 years old processes the game better. Setting it up took over 2 hours when it should have taken only 20 minutes. Do not buy!
"I was looking for an affordable 8"" tablet that supports Google Play, good battery, Android 10, and a brand I actually heard of. I found all of that in the Lenovo Tab M8 HD.My criticisms: Incredibly slippery (fix with a case), such a slim bezel that it's too easy to make unwanted gestures, the launcher is garbage (easy fix with Microsoft Launcher), it unexpectedly reboot on me once so far, the speakers are tinny... but worst of all is when using Bluetooth the sound gets out of sync with the video, or the video stutters a little. I've seen the issue with two different Bluetooth headphones with both Hulu & Disney Plus. The lackluster Bluetooth performance on video playback is the reason I'm only giving this tablet 3 stars. If it wasn't so affordable for what it offers, I might have returned it.Update - this device is incredibly unstable, I cannot recommend it, wish I could get my money back"
Bought this as a gift. Nice little tablet that is easy to setup. Great for beginners and newbies due to lack of bloatware like samsung and other tablets. Only big downside was the forward facing camera. Very grainy when using it for video calls which was the driving factor for my purchase.
"This thing is an absolute piece of Junk, better used as a paperweight.immediately slow and laggard out of the box, skipping, crashing right off the bat.DONT BUY THIS - SPEND THE EXTRA AND GET A QUALITY PRODUCT - THIS IS JUNK"
I bought this for streaming Netflix and YouTube TV.  The whole tablet is clunky and slow.  Takes forever to bring up an app.  Netflix runs sound only and no picture sometimes. And then it jumps back to the home page.  I think the problem is that the Ram is really not enough to run streaming platforms.  In the reviews it kept saying the Apple mini tablets were better in every category.  I bought this trying to save money.  It was a dumb choice.
First beware of the one month warranty. My charging input malfunctioned after 9 months and Amazon won't replace it. I've used this mostly to play one particular game. It works fine but switching between apps or Home Screen is very clunky. Battery is surprisingly decent as long as you can charge it.
"I bought this to play games, mainly. I love my Lenovo laptop, so I thought this tablet would be great. Wrong. It's a piece of garbage. It is slow on a good day and continually freezes up. I have never been so disgusted with a product. My phone and laptop are fast and in great working order on my WiFi, so it's this tablet that's the problem."
The tablet came in nice looking but it’s very slow in downloading apps and the you’re Chanel is not working on the table for the past 30mn I’m here trying to play something on YouTube no resultAnd the screen freezes already  it’s already giving me headaches I won’t recommend it to anyone
"Everything great, but a bit too slow. I hope will have a same size product with 4GB ram. Update 9/10/21: after about 6 Mo, the camera's shutter sound stop working event the setting is still on. Contact support, not solve the problem because no tech come to help."
"Within 8 months it started making this weird, almost static noise. Very loud. Only does it when screen is off. 2 months later, screen is out. Waste of money. My kids fire tablets are better made."
"I don't know about any of the features of this tablet because I sent it right back. It is so small! I have had 8 inch tablets before and this was not. Maybe 4x6, not much bigger than my cell phone. No way this is an 8 inch tablet."
"UPDATE: This tablet is terrible, super slow, crashes repeatedly every day, can't even do apps like Marvel comics.  This tablet has been a headache.  It somehow got in SAFE MODE and I have no way of turning it off.  I hate this tablet and wish I spent more on a better brand.I bought these to replace my former Samsung Galaxy tabs.  This is not as good, its heavier and it doesn't have the home screen buttons, so its difficult to go back, forward or back to the home screeen.  Thats the biggest difference, is moving back and forth and to home screen, which is essential."
"I bought this tablet a little over a year ago when I was leaving the country. I wanted an e-reader and thought a tablet would be a better deal, because I could also watch movies, listen to music, and do other tasks.I have barely used this tablet the entire year because it *barely* has ever worked,.straight out of the box. It is suuuuuuper slow at everything -- startup, running. Apps crash all the time. The battery drains remarkably fast. In short, it completely sucks and I'm sorry I wasted the money on it. If I hadn't traveled shortly after I bought it I most definitely would have returned it. I'm not sure why it is so bad -- I've had other tablets and devices and never encountered one this useless. :(  I definitely don't recommend this."
"Wow, what a piece of junk. I'm so disappointed. First off, the sound and on/ off buttons are on the side, not the top, right where you invariably put your fingers. I accidentally turn it off all the time. Second, open windows aren't displayed on top for easy switching. There's a square box where there's residing.  It's so inconvenient. There's no button for going forward (to where you'd been, only a button to go back. It all makes absolutely no sense from a design perspective. The sound unless you're using headphones, is AWFUL. You can barely hear what you're playing. I previously had the Lenovo Tab 8, which I loved using, but then it inexplicably said it was charging, as you watched the battery discharge and then die. You can't buy it new anymore, thank goodness. I used to love Lenovo, but based on my recent experiences, I see it's time to start looking around."
"I got this tablet for my son, mostly for games and it’s pretty good. It can run Minecraft and some Roblox games…I feel like the Roblox games are harder for the tablet overall, kind of a glitchy experience.The tablet also keeps disconnecting itself from our wifi, I have no idea why, it’s pretty annoying.It’s hit and miss."
"I purchased this tablet to replace another Lenovo (Tab 4 8).  I could never get that one to stream music reliably - would always get dropouts.  I blamed it on interference in the bluetooth connection to my receiver or on my wi-fi network in general.  But then I began to experience random shutdowns shortly after I connected the battery charger.  One day I was fortunate to catch the error message before it shutdown.  It said that the temperature was too high.  So I replaced it with a new Lenovo Tab M8.  To my surprise, I was getting the same random music dropouts as on the Tab 4 8 and the last straw came when after using it for about an hour I plugged in the charger and half an hour later I found that it had shutdown on its own.  I replaced it with a Samsung tablet and have no more dropouts or shutdowns due to overheating."
Suffice it to say that I can usually count to at least ten before an app opens after tapping an icon.
The touch screen is not very good. Sometimes it won't do anything and other times you press on something and it starts opening and closing other things.
"If you need a tablet for virtual calls, Zoom or MS TEAMS and you want to have a decent video, this is not the tablet. Both cameras has poor performance. Old tablets having also a 2 MP has better performance than this one."
"I loved this tablet. It was everything I wanted just the way I wanted it.But it crashes. It crashes all the time for no apparent reason.It's at its worst streaming Twitch. Next to impossible to watch something due to the frequent interruptions. If it was only streaming Twitch, I could work around it, but it's not.It will crash reading a story in a news app, changing volume in music or videos, when typing & at all other times.Since I really like this tablet, I just got a replacement. Sorry to say the replacement is exactly the same.This comes with Android 9. Both times I got a notification to upgrade to Android 10 & did so. Since this is so highly rated, perhaps the problem has something to do with incompatibility with Android 10, but that's only a guess.Really a shame that an otherwise fine product is unuseable."
I bought this for my son and he can charge it to 100% and only lasts a few hours before having to charge again.  He is always complaining about his games lagging so the speed isn't good either.
Not sure if it was just the one I received but the game I would normally play on this (Langrisser M) I would always get random disconnects.  My experience with this tablet is not that great.
"I bought this tablet because I have the first gen Lenovo M10 Plus and I wanted an upgrade. As you can tell in the picture it wouldn't complete the system update. It was trying to update for 40 minutes. I figured to turn off the tablet and turn it back on. I turned it off and now it won't turn back on. So I figured to do a soft/hard reset. It wouldn't do that either. I even had the tablet on charge and the battery was 80% so you can't tell me the battery was dead. It won't power on, and now won't finish charging. The screen is just dark and doesn't show the battery charging. Another thing to mention is I set up the homescreen the way I want it and it goes back to the way it was. I get rid of the entertainment space and that shows back up even when I went to home screen settings and turn it off. This was before the screen wouldn't turn back on. I'm sending it back for a replacement and if that tablet does the same thing I'm going to send it back and ask for a refund. I'll update when I get a replacement. ****UPDATE June 18th 2023****It's been a couple months and I never got a replacement because I didn't want to get the same tablet and expect to go through the same hassle setting it up and freezing. My M10 Plus still works fine but it is laggy due to its 2GB ram and small storage. The reason I wanted a tablet with more ram and storage. I'll just get me a different brand tablet because I'm done with Lenovo."
"Yes, the battery life is good.  The performance and responsiveness is poor for 3gb of memory.  I primarily use it for reading news and checking emails.  If often freezes on both, of the app will crash.My luck with Lenovo has not been good."
"I wish I'd bought something else.....You'd think it was good, and often it is.But every few days it stops reading my SD card and demands that I format it...with no other option. It takes days to copy things back onto the tablet, because I can't use a card reader in my laptop to copy things onto the card because the tablet will just demand the card be formatted again. It's not even the end of February, and I've had to format the card at least four times, if not more than five times this year.Also, and perhaps even more annoying, the screen likes to click when I'm trying to scroll, or double and triple clicks when I'm trying to type. I ended up with several items in my Amazon Cart before I realized the tablet had been reading ""Add to Cart"" when I was trying to scroll. Since I wasn't planning to buy anything at that moment, it didn't matter, but if I was actually shopping, I might not have noticed the extra items being put into my cart. That might have actually happened to me in December on Temu, ended up with a few things I didn't expect... YouTube constantly clicks videos that I'm trying to scroll past, which is extremely frustrating given how YouTube Mobile functions with the ""Back"" button (and then I have to go into my History, and remove the video that I didn't intend to click). There's no way to adjust the click sensitivity...I have posted about these issues in the Lenovo support forums, and they've basically told me ""That's the way it is,"" with no solution or recommendation for fixing the problems. ""It's not possible."" I can't fathom these kind of problems being allowed off the development floor.But then again, they've also pushed spamware as part of a required update, and decided that the quick launch navigation bar at the bottom will ALWAYS be visible with no ability to hide it in a setting. Several apps which utilize the entire screen, have buttons covered by the quick launch bar, making the apps unusable, at least in part.Battery life is terrible, even being plugged in, the wall can barely provide enough power to keep it from going down. I can get it charged up to 100%, and then start watching YouTube, and after a few videos, find myself at 97%, with it still plugged in. Screen at less than half brightness.The volume controls are bad, too. The lowest volume above mute is still quite loud. Use of a Bluetooth SPEAKER limits the output volume to less than what the tablet speakers produce. I have a Tribit BTS31, which is capable of very high volumes paired with my phone, but the tablet has an ear protection mode that can't be turned off....it assumes headphones rather than a speaker, and limits the volume. The tablet speakers end up being vastly better than the BT speaker, making the speaker pointless.I probably could go on with a few more problems, but you get the idea....This tablet has had problems that have killed productivity, and been the source of a lot of frustration.I really wish I'd gone for the Samsung."
"When I bought my son a Lenovo laptop about 8 years ago, Lenovo was considered a quality brand. His laptop lasted for YEARS. This tablet has good reviews when I bought it. I've had it for 2 1/2 years, and it was great until about 6 months ago when it started freezing up frequently, and I have not been able to get any help from customer support. Computers don't last forever, but when I can't get support for a malfunctioning product, I will not buy that brand again."
"Just got this and was quite pleased until I realized I had a total of 5GB of free space once I set it up.  I have bought a Samsung MicroSD card for it but it won't arrive for several days; so I used a SanDisk 64GB MicroSD card from my old tablet.Come to find out that even after multiple efforts of resetting and reformatting and restarting the tablet the very best it will do is allow me to use the chip as portable storage and won't allow it to be used for active storage, meaning I have the built in  64GB but no ability to extend it. I found numerous reports on websites about this being a problem and many work arounds that don't seem to apply.Fortunately I had a Samsung 64GB uSD available and have been able to use it to move music files to. But if I can't effectively extend the memory as advertised once the larger chip gets here this thing will have to be returned. It's useless if it's limited to 64GB, that's not enough for minimal use and I'd never be able to add more apps and the like.Update: I was able to free up about 30GB on the tablet itself and installed a new Samsung 256GB uSD which it did immediately recognize; I still don't know if it will put apps on it and use it as live memory but I will update the review when I know for sure."
"So back in November I bout 2 of these devices, the 32 Gb 3Gb ram as a replacement for my daughter's Fire 8HD and 64GB 4GB ram for myself. By February the 64GB 4GB variant had stop working but Lenovo replaced it hassle free as I was told by the service center this was very uncommon. As for the 32GB 3GB model it was ideal to watch Netflix and YouTube with that beautiful display and amazing sound quality but where it begins to fall down is whilst playing more RAM demanding games such as fortnight and call of duty. Be sure to assess all your needs in a tablet before purchasing this one. All in all I am pleased and impressed for the most part with this tablet"
"For a tablet under $200, it's not a bad deal but don't expect the clearest picture when streaming live TV, especially live sports. Streaming platforms look good, live TV, very AVG."
I haven’t had it long enough  to rate it.
Tablet would consistently lose connection with its touchscreen. Researching the Lenovo forms revealed this as a common problem with no established solution. I returned it and bought another brand.
"Neither of my TV sets that I've used for other tablets were even recognized. Researching this I found lots of supporting evidence for this problem in the Lenovo help site. And several sites showed a specification for an accelerometer and magnetic field (compass) detection, neither of which were found on my unit. The one good thing is when set up you can kill a lot of the bloatware. In all other respects this was a pretty good tablet......but cannot explain why a box stock android system that has casting built in would fail like that.08/22/23 Update.....I may have been wrong and I'll explain why. Every other tablet I've had casting just worked. No real setup required. Well, after returning this and getting another brand with Android 12 the same issue arose with one of the sets, a Samsung, but the Visio was picked up right away. If you go to settings for cast in the upper right are three vertical dots that brings up a check box Enable Wireless Display. Well, I'll be damned. Check the box and both TVs now appear. If they're greyed out just means they're not powered on. The Samsung is a smart TV but not too smart and doesn't have an inbuilt Chromecast as the Visio does. The Samsung must also be either WIFI or Ethernet connected to your home internet in order to cast without resorting to a Chromecast adapter on the TV. I suspect what you're really doing is using WIFI Direct without being explicitly told you are.I can't find a good reason why Android 12 is designed this way, security perhaps, but I'll wager a lot of others have been frustrated by this one change. Upping rating to 5 as this was the only thing I found objectionable about this unit and it was just my stupidity that earned it a lower rating."
"I love tablets, am 75 and have had many in my lifetime.  This is by far the worst ever.  Constant getting messages, interruptions saying not responding, wait or cancel, hard for me to go from page to page as my other devices.  Will never buy this brand again and since the only way one can get a complete retund, it has to be defective, broken or not used - what kind of deal is that?  Will have to watch from whom I buy anything.  Not happy with this purchase from this seller.  Not happy at all.  What happened to if it doesn't meet your needs, return.  Even many stores provide that.  Satisfaction definitely is not a guarantee.  Just stating my opinion, nothing more."
"I like this tablet, unfortunately its very very slow, if you are buying this for games forget it, even for easy & light games... this is a great value, it looks great, at only $130, you cant expect much but this is very good looking unit, its  modern, it has good speakers, sounds good & loud but its one of those devices where you got to have patience, you got to let it think, if you click the screen too many times while its processing something, it will freeze on you everytime"
"Based on reviews I thought this would be a great little tablet for travel and occasional home use. I'm so disappointed. It's so slow, even after I removed unnecessary apps it came with. Unfortunately it's too late to return it, that window has closed 😔"
"This tablet comes pre-installed with the ""Lenovo User Experience"" which is spyware that is used by the Lenovo corporation to track and log how you use your tablet. They sell your usage data to other companies so that those companies can attempt to sell you products and services you ""may"" be interested in. The Lenovo User Experience app cannot be uninstalled or disabled. If you do not wish to participate in being a targeted consumer, you must decline the Lenovo User Experience EVERY TIME your device starts or restarts.In addition, Lenovo sneaks in user approval for this ""service"" by adding an optional checkbox to the tablet setup. The optional checkbox (which is pre-checkmarked) is BETWEEN the required checkboxes for acceptance of the License Agreement and the Privacy Statement. This is done so that the user presumes all the checkboxes are required. There is even ANOTHER checkbox on the bottom of that setup screen that reads ""I have read and agreed to the service agreements above"" and that checkbox (also pre-checkmarked) will checkmark all three checkboxes above it, leading the user once again to accidentally opt-in to the Lenovo spyware program.Lastly, the first update for this device loads 18 new bloatware apps onto the device without any user permission. These apps include wood puzzle, water puzzle, snake game, fish solitaire, and other junk like that. Most of these can be uninstalled but a few can only be disabled.While it is possible (with technical know-how) to disable the spyware, it is not feasible for the everyday user; it requires rooting the device and removing the spyware with console commands.Given the above, I do not recommend this tablet (or any new Lenovo android device, to be honest)."
"A little background. Prior to this experience, I have set up five different Android tablets and countless Android phones without any major issues. Lately, most of my phones have been Moto G series and Lenovo seemed like a logical choice for me because of the brand umbrella and I like Motorola products.I purchased and set up the first Lenovo M10 tablet, and all went smoothly, I was excited and pleased with the tablet, but sadly the Bluetooth kept dropping the multiple brands of different earbuds every few minutes, so I arranged an Amazon exchange for another M10. These things happen.🤔Second Lenovo M10, problems immediately after selecting English and connecting to WiFi. I could not get past the ""finish setup"" window, screen would show a working circle and then go to a white screen everytime after clicking ""start"".  Eventually, I back arrowed and bypassed the Lenovo ""get your tablet ready"" screen and chose ""setup without internet"".  I was able to manually connect to WiFi and setup the tablet up with my Google account, but the tablet relentlessly kept reminding me to ""finish setup"" even after I created a Lenovo account hoping that would help.  After numerous failed attempts and getting the same white screen and days of frustration, I decided to reset to factory settings. After factory resetting, I had the same issues as before, I called Lenovo tech support and they had no solutions and recommend returning it as defective.😞3rd M10, same issues immediately, returned.😠4th and last M10, same issues immediately, returned. Very disappointed! 🤬Replaced the Lenovo M10 with a Doogee T20 tablet. Happy so far and would give the Doogee T20 (5 stars).🙂Unfortunately, when I purchased the first Lenovo M10, I also purchased a ZtopCases M10 leather case that is no longer returnable. Love the case (5 stars), but it doesn't fit the Doogee T20, out $20.🤕"
Constantly crashing and freezing. There are better options in the market.
"The tablet froze on me a couple of times in the first two days I had it. Had difficulty turning it off and restarting it also. Was glad to be able to return it, still unsure what I'm going to get to replace it."
"I was extremely let down by this tablet. It had bold claims and I have trouble believing it. Extremely slow, glitchy, poor battery life etc. it’s like using a 10 year old tablet. I left it on standby and it died within 48 hours. Crashed constantly. Only good for kids."
"Definitely do not recommend for anything but streaming. This model/current software has a really annoying, PERMANENT, task bar below. It also kind of lags/has low FPS when maneuvering, even just pulling down the notification bar or opening an app feels really....bad quality. I will say, the screen looks really clear and when watching things there is no lag or FPS issues. The sound from the speakers is also pretty alright. ***Again, ONLY RECOMMEND THIS TABLET FOR STREMING ONLY--NOTHING ELSE.***"
"If all you need it for is streaming the tablet is fine. But because of the limited storage, it cannot do much other than that. If you buy an SD card, great but it won't let you transfer app files to it only docs and pictures/video. Since the tablet (at least the one I purchased) only has 32gig of storage, 12 of that is taken up by the UI and another 8-10 by apps that come pre downloaded, most of which you cannot take off.. so in actuality you have about 10gig left over after that. Download your streaming apps now you have 5-8gigs available. See what I am getting at? Apps are too large now days for such a small base storage.The battery life is great, 10+ hours easily.Now, my biggest issue is that everytime I wake up the tablet, the UI crashes. It takes about 2-5 minutes for it to crash but then it will function normally.Would I buy again? No. I would get a more modern tablet."
"I bought this tablet about a year ago. The WiFi often fails to connect, even though all of my other devices connect easily and consistently. Sometimes I have to restart it a dozen times to get it to connect. And it tends to be slow even though I have a very fast internet connection which works very well on other devices. I don't know if more expensive Lenovo tablets have better WiFi, but if I ever buy another Lenovo I'll immediately check how good the WiFi is. If I have the same problem, I'll return it to Amazon and get another brand. I don't recommend this tablet because most people need good WiFi when they use a tablet."
"Disappointing. The tablet is underpowered, frequently freezes, and has apps crash. After the first android upgrade, there is no upgrade roadmap. Battery life isn't good unless you constantly keep in battery saver mode. Support isn't the greatest and reported problems / requests languish for years. Wouldn't purchase Lenovo again."
"Fine little tablet.  Great screen quality and decent speed.  But 40 days after purchase it stopped charging entirely.  No longer turns on.  I'll update this review after the Lenovo warranty process.  I'm not going to be happy if they want me to pay to fix this.[Update:  They don't say that they're doing this, but after getting the RMA authorized they sent me some nice packaging to ship the tablet to them, and turnaround time on the fix was very fast.  Outlook: cautiously optimistic?]"
"I bought this as a gift, and upon delivery opened the package just to have it not work. Reached out to amazon for a return and was refunded (after sending it back I believe); however, my account was closed due to returning it. After multiple calls to support, and YEARS worth of using amazon I have not been able to regain my account, all because of this defective product. DO NOT BUY, OR RETURN!"
"the dolby atmos quad speakers are terrific. the screen resolution is terrific. the tablets streaming capabilities are terrific. browsing is pretty snappy as well. if u stay within that bracket, this is an excellent budget tablet. but if you are someone looking for a little more, you might wanna look elsewhere. for starters, don't be fooled by the pictures. the color display is not as vibrant as the pics suggest. nor does it fully support hdr. it's a hit or miss. therefore, your video playbck will tend to look 2010-ish. if you're ok with that, it's a pretty good budget tablet. also, this doesn't have a silky smooth UI interface. but the cpu moves things along steady & snappy enough not to ruin the experience. occasional stutters here & there where the cpu struggles to keep up, if you're trying to operate at a quick pace. no video game review, sorry! just don't expect no nintendo switch experience. the cpu keeps the tablet honest about it's limits."
The screen Freezes quite often. I have done a factory reset and it still happens. I looked online and see that others are having this issue too. Might want to think about something else instead of the chance that you'll have the same frustration as me.
I was trying to get off the IPad ecosystem but this tablet made me want to go back because it was lagging
"I ordered this tablet on the first Prime Day which was yesterday. It came today. That was the only positive thing I can say.I started to set it up and at the point where I says it has added my accounts, I press the next button and it buffers a couple of seconds and goes back to the same page, over and over.So I called Amazon support. I told the woman the problem I was having and she asked question after question leading me to believe that she had no idea what setting up a device entailed. She called Lenovo because she had no idea what to do and transferred me to them.After about 10 to 15 minutes of going through the same thing with him he finally figured out that I was talking about something that wasn't hardware. Hardware  is all they do. No software.Once again I called Amazon. Once again I talked to a person who had no clue. Finally he said he could not find anything pertaining to my problem and he would send the information via email on how to return the tablet.I should mention at this point that this is the second Lenovo tablet I've purchased from Amazon. I also had to return the first one. As I mentioned above, I really didn't need a tablet anyway. Right?"
nice if I was to see my e-mails full screen
"The screen is quality, speakers are great, batter to life is amazing, it's a nice tablet. However, it runs like complete crap. Freezes constantly, every few minutes apps will hang and it will go to the home screen. Full of bloatware and adds. SD Drive cannot act as the main hard drive they can't be merged, you can't default the SD as the main HD AND you cannot default download path to the SD hard drive. Lenovo support is horrible their forms I swear is a bot answering questions. I wouldn't waste my money on this you will end up more frustrated and upset you bought it just like myself."
I've tested cheaper our friend tablets at the same size and specifications that's so better and work better than this it's not a good bang for your buck
"What don't I like? Let me count the ways. After all updates, system and apps. The UI stops responding, the system launcher stops responding, it locks up has to be restarted, you can't close running apps intuitively, it's difficult to use, there's no window controls on the bottom of the screen, the hard drive shows 23 GB and 20 of it is used I haven't even put any apps on it! One night with this tablet, that I bought for my wife to play games on and watch YouTube videos that's frustrated me to the point that I'm going to return it!"
"I bought this tablet to replace my aging LG tablet. Little did I know that the same issue that I had with my Moto Z3 would rear its ugly head again. After 6 months of normal use, the tablet began telling me that it couldn’t read the sd card, that it had been corrupted. Keep in mind that I had not moved or interfered with any file transfers of any kind while using the tablet. Now I can’t even format the card in windows, nor can I permanently delete files from the card. If you have a large media library, STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!"
"Horrible tablet! 50% of the available memory is pre-loaded with Google apps and Lenovo bloatware. After installing a FEW of my favorite non-Google, nonlenova apps, the tablet starting acting quirky. After numerous restarts, app-offloading, the tablet settled temporarily. However, upon downloading PDFs for review, it resorted to its usual funkiness. I have yet to figure how to get this waste-of-money app to stabilize, other than a total reset. I am a retired technician. DO NOT BUY THIS HORRIFIC PIECE OF JUNK!"
"... but now, not so much. I loved this tablet for the first few months. Best performance I've seen in an affordable Android tablet (I have owned Fire, Samsung and generic tablets). Then came the Android 13 update. Now my tablet locks up several times a day, requi. Thousands of people are on the Lenovo support to forums complaining and the best answer they can give us is ""do a factory reset"". Did that, doesn't work.Stay away from this Lenovo tablet."
"Very,very unhappy with both tablet and android.Very intrusive injects its sites into my searches,cannot auto to Duck,duck go.Constant updates prevents fast opening.Impossible to get rid of Google and their searches on opening. Much prefer the ease of Fire tablets even with their glitches and preloads. Get one and pay a little extr AA to cut down on ads,not stop them but reduce the number. Google has become an uncontrolled monster."
Worked for almost two month and now it has trouble connecting to internet and more. Trash it is … sad to waist your money and disappointment.
not as good as my old one . to hard for set up
Purchased based on good reviews. I cannot leave such a review.  Been using for several months now. This thing is slow and freezes up all the time. Will probably throw away and buy something else.
"I don't know what to think about this tablet.  It works. But quality of UX and software integration seem poorly integrated.  There is a cleaner app and a weather app that are on auto start after you turn of the tablet. If you are in a different app, those two will pop open.  It gets annoying.  I uninstalled both but now I can't scroll down to view my notifications.  Its like the questionable disk clean app and weather app are required for the tablet to function.  I'm half tempted to see if I can root this tablet and install a better experience"
For whatever reason Lenovo decides to not allow external memory cards to be used/formatted as internal memory.
"I purchased the Lenovo Tab M10 Plus 3rd Gen Tablet around six months ago for light use, such as reading books, PDFs, and occasionally watching videos on YouTube. However, my experience with this tablet has been extremely unsatisfactory.From the start, the tablet was unbearably slow. Despite reformatting and reconfiguring it, the performance did not improve. The tablet remains frustratingly slow, making even simple tasks a hassle.Furthermore, the keyboard functionality is unreliable, often not working at all. On top of that, apps frequently crash, likely due to memory issues, significantly disrupting the user experience and rendering the tablet unreliable for any purpose.Overall, I am thoroughly disappointed with this purchase."
"Tablet constantly locks up with black screen. So far multiple sessions of pressing restart buttons have awakened it. But now dead again. Bought it for a trip, so total use less than ten hours."
"Absolutely terrible. The tablet initially runs fine. Until updates and typical game downloads, the tablet is very very very sluggish. Also you cant change the language on this tablet.. What kind of tablet doesn't let you change the language..????? Some might fine this okay.. but for those that plan to buy this for an elderly that doesnt read English.. this is a hard NO"
"Locks up, freezes, 3 factory resets & still the same thing!!  Smashed it over my knee 2 days before I had it 1 yearIn My Opinion - AVOID THIS JUNK"
Nice tablet but it continues to lock up and has to be restarted. It has hardly anything on it. After looking up the issue online I find it is a very common problem that the company has been made aware of and has yet to come out with a fix. It's unlikely I will buy another Lenovo product. $150 wasted.
Seemed good at first but the processing power is sub par feels like I’m using an off brand android tablet from 2015
Decent performance for one app a time.
"It's a good tablet, but it only has 64 Gb of storage. You can install up to 128 Gb in an SD card, but the device iitself is only 64 Gb. It's been a common form of false advertisement here on Amazon lately."
Easily the slowest tablet I've ever purchased.
"About less than a month and it's all ready lagging and glitching, it also keeps freezing while using it, bought it for my son's for. Read trip and worked for like 2 weeks. Also you need to use Hotspot to make it work so it's sucks done waste your money!!"
The quality of this tablet is good. However the operating system isn't.I tried to learn it but it was completely different then my android phone. I ended up sending it back and got an iPad.
"The tablet worked great up until the android 13 update, after the update total garbage. It freezes, crashes and acts like it can't run a single app properly. The update auto installs and once it does you can't regress to the previous working software. If you contact customer support they tell you to just give the update time and it ""should"" work. I have factory reset and everything trying to get the tablet to work properly again but it's not so if you buy this be warned that this company will ruin your device and leave you flapping in the wind. If you rely on your device for work or other important things then stay well and far from any Lenovo products."
"vendor specifies this is a 10.6"" tablet but its actually a 10.3"", i bought a $35 case for the 10.6"" i was suposed to get and now is useless"
After about an hour of loading things and customizing it to my needs I noticed it only had 64gb storage instead of the advertised 128gb.  Ripped off!
"Aesthetically, it's great. Definition is wonderful. But it simply doesn't have enough storage space nor does it have a strong enough processor. It is easily overencumbered with simple processes like notifications and will easily fill up should you decide to use spotify or any streaming service. Save up and buy a hi performance tablet. Not what I expected from Lenovo."
"I gave it one star because I like Lenovo, and this tablet looks nice, but the performance is just terrible. I wanted to upgrade from my little Fire HD but overall the Fire was 100 times better. This thing is soooo slow, and I only downloaded ONE game on it! It's only a match 3 game so why is this thing so slow? Also, if I leave the game running and then come back in 5 minutes, it freezes up so bad that the game has to restart and I lose all my progress! The Fire didn't have any of those problems. If I could I would return this thing. I'm not happy with this tablet at all, and I definitely would not recommend it to anyone."
This is 2022 isn't it?  Last time I looked it was.  The latest version of Android is 12 isn't it (8/28/2022)?  I know this is a budget tablet but for $200 you'd at least expect it to run the latest games like Diablo Immortal but when I tried to install it it said DEVICE INCOMPATIBLE!  I tried loading an app called Sky Map that shows the locations of planets and stars when holding it up to the sky but this devise lacks the sensors ( the app reported this to me) and it will not work.  I've had this for about two hours and it's already factory reset and in the box to return. I can't take the chance that I may want to load an app in the future and it will not work.This is 2022 and there is NO EXCUSE that a brand new tablet can't run an app (Sky Map) that has ran on every other Android device I've owned.
"This, unfortunately, is NOT it. When you go cheap, you get what you pay for. LENOVO is about as cheap as it gets, and it shows!I've had this tablet less than a year and it's already degrading. The screen isn't as responsive and the updates are absurdly horrible. There is limited space and no way to uninstall the crappy preinstalled apps that you'll never use - leaving you with less space for what you love. There is some semblance of Android but the LENOVO skin leaves you with no kind of personalization options.I'm really bummed because I returned an Amazon fire tablet to take a chance with this one. I recommend ANYTHING else than the LENOVO brand. Absolutely ridiculous."
Bought this to use for music and running basic fitness apps for a home gym. The Bluetooth regularly just quits entirely. For seemingly no reason it disconnects from the speaker. It can be pretty frustrating during a workout. You have to go back and reconnect manually. (This issue is not seen on any other device that I've used). I would not recommend this for a home gym application and going forward I will go for a more reputable company's product.
The tablet is advertised as 128gb but it's only 64gb. Be careful.
"This tablet is a great tablet. There's nothing functionally wrong with it as far as I have found. Plays video, surfs web, responds quickly, battery is as you'd expect. It's light weight. The cover I bought is a tight secure fit.BUT THE MEMORY IS ONLY 64 GB. THE PRODUCT IS LISTED AS HAVING 128 GB MEMORY. THIS IS WRONG. LENOVO DOES NOT OFFER THIS TABLET IN A 128 GB CONFIGURATION. I CONFIRMED THIS WITH LENOVO.The tablet is compatible with microSD cards up to 1 TB, claims Lenovo Help. I have not yet added a card to this because I was hoping it would have 128 gb storage and I would not need to futz with multiple storage locations.Buyer beware. The tablet is great but this listing is wrong."
"Out of the box, this tablet lagged while swiping, opening apps, etc. I purchased for note-taking, which was terrible at handwriting-to-text conversion as all my words came back with no spaces (e.g. howisyourdaygoing). I didn’t try watching videos but I imagine it would have also been incredibly laggy. I have high speed WiFi and it’s possible that it was being slower, and the tablet was significantly affected. Either way I am returning this and trying out a Kindle Scribe for note-taking"
"It's slow, apps crash, the pen feature isn't worth it. It's been garbage since day one and I've pre-ordered it. So I've been using it since launch. Gamble on something else."
"I bought this tablet as a replacement for a very old Samsung tab S2.  I thought that the memory would not be an issue since I am not a heavy app user and use online Google storage, however, after setting up the apps that I do use, the Lenovo immediately slowed down and gave out of memory warnings.  I found it to be very slow.  I also found the OS system settings to be a little clunky and less organized than my old Samsung.  I returned this and am going with another Samsung."
"Lenovo in their infinite wisdom decided to ""UPGRADE"" our software without telling us and added a permanent task bar at the bottom of the screen like it's MAC OS or Windows.It can't be turned off.It's buggy, so it overlaps the native Android Back / Home buttons. Literally (see pic).Tap to wake is broken now.Keyboard doesn't work because their taskbar takes up the bottom 10% of the screen.Lenovo won't respond on their forums. Support is a joke.Run, don't walk, far away from this awful piece of junk."
"The product is so slow, if you open 3 apps the tablet crash."
"This is probably the worst tablet i have ever used. Seems extreme but i literally bought this to read downloaded PDF's of obscure literature and it can't even do that. For some reason this tablet is constantly lagging and on the verge of melting itself down no matter what im doing. Its constantly updating, or downloading, or spamming me with BS. Even the base level UI is constantly lagging. The gentures are impossible to use and i still can't figure half of them out.. Skip this thing and get anything else."
"After doing a bunch of research on lower tier tablets, this one got great reviews. Upon purchase, it froze straight out of the box. Thought that the update would fix it. It did not. It freezes constantly and sometimes I have to leave it alone for an hour before it will allow me to restart it. Buy a better tablet."
"Lenovo thinks I need an always-present bar at the bottom containing Google services. FYI I never use any Google Services besides the playstore. I can't remove the bar, can't edit it, can't hide it. An ever present annoyance. Should have just bought a Samsung tablet. What a crappy company Lenovo is turning out to be! Stay away!!!"
This tablet is terrible!  I bought it to just use for Amazon shopping. Etc.  It is so slow!  I've already forgot what I was doing by the time the page comes up. This is a hunk of junk that I sit on my desk. Wish I could return it.
Programs and system continually crash. No viruses. Bought as cheaper alternative to Samsung! Just ordered new Samsung but stuck with this sine return date passed.
"Tablet never turned on and they did not want to reimburse me for its cost, I do not recommend it."
"Nothing works without an internet connection.  So it's worthless on long flights which is why I got it.  I can't even watch my downloaded shows that I paid for.Now it is a very expensive paperweight, very frustrating."
First problem: Tablet's MAC address can not be seen until after it connects to wifi network so I was unable to connect it to my network because I have to enter the WiFi Mac address into my router for connection to be allowed by my network.2nd and final nail in coffin: tablet sold as having 128gb storage in fact has only 64gb. See photo of screen stating storage. Box is also incorrectly marked as it states tablet has 128gb when it does not.Returned this amateur hour product as maker lacks quality control at the very least! AVOID.
"I have never used such slow tablets. On fresh install, the interface lag was 10+ seconds for most actions. Even after being patient and waiting 2 hours for Android to update, and uninstalling or disabling 30+ Lenovo and Google apps, the speed was not improved. Today I watched it spend 3 minutes on the boot logo screen then another two minutes on a separate boot screen. Returned. Totally unusable."
Great build quality. Nice screen. Thats about it. Starts to hesitate with simple mobile games. Seems like anything with more than a few graphics and it falls flat on its face. Visible hesitation when swiping between screens. Kick rocks. Returned.
The swipe action required to close apps is hit or miss.  Sometimes 4 or 5 apps will be open without knowing it. Then there is the constant adds showing up to extend the warranty.
There is alot to get use to when coming from a samsung tablet. It is slow and laggy when playing Movies/videos using the MX player. Its bulky and heavy.
"First off, the biggest issue, it randomly says there is an issue with your sd card. Even if you format it. It said that, then randomly started working, then says that again.Also they keep spamming you with notification to join their customer improvement problem.Trash. Buy a Samsung."
Tablet will not charge. Nicely packaged looks new no scratches nothing but will not turn on. Been charging two hrs and not even a blip. I need u guys to reach out to me. I don't see how to message you only Amazon and I am returning it.
Not impressed as in packing the pen was missing.  A prime object for the tablet.  Won't reorder
You'll want to throw it in the trash.
After a week of use this tablet started to freeze. Kids added about 20 game and cause the tablet to become slow and unresponsive. Only way to get the tablet back up and running is to do a hard reboot on the device.
"Gotta be better ones even for the money. This junk is so slow and cumbersome I barely even use it for any more that youtube and some tv. I was hoping for a write-on tablet and replacing a laptop, but this thing is practically useless."
Had to return because the OS/UI kept crashing. I need to know what is happening with my refund.
"First of all, don't get this tablet for anything other than media consumption. It's too slow and too janky for any productivity uses, including simple tasks we take for granted on a decent phone.Secondly, and more importantly, this is falsely advertised as having 128GB of storage. It actually comes with 64GB. I've brought this to Amazon's attention, but they seemed disinclined to fix the product page. 64GB is a paltry amount of storage at the time of writing (almost 2023), even for a low-range tablet only suitable for media consumption... and the lack of a correction by Amazon is extremely concerning."
"Big Lenovo fan here, but this tablet ain't it. Quite slow and clunky moving between apps.Plays YouTube and Netflix well, but what device doesn't in 2023?Spend the extra money and get something a bit more powerful.Edit: Was 3 stars, but this thing has only gotten worse. Very slow, battery is dying quickly. Pass on this one."
"I love my Lenovo Laptop so, I thought I'd try the tablet and take it with me.  I totally HATE it.  It crashes all the time and turns off constantly eventhough I have it set to stay on all the time.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
"purchased a 128 gb - received a 64 gb.  no user manual (looked on website no user manual -- just an illustration of tablet openings etc.  garbage  about adding card (no info on what type of card etc.) most of google apps will not run on a card -- wanted l18 gb for dowing loading videos, music, books, etc.  google video apps will not use card."
Very slow and clunky.
touchscreen response randomly double-taps for desired single-tap. Renders it useless!
"Worked great for 5 months, then would not power up.  Have sent back to Lenovo for repair.  I've had 3 Samsung tablets and all have worked without problems for years (over 10 years).  Have also used Lenovo desktop and laptop PCs for decades without any issues.  Disapointed this tablet is poor quality."
"The performance on this tablet is horrible. Navigating the pages and switching between apps is slow. It frequently becomes unresponsive. The only thing this is good for is browsing the web, but even that can be sluggish."
paid for 128 gb but got 64gbno video on netflix out of the box/ you must update the system all the way(like 4 or so updates) which took 3 hours.lenovo saved money by adding a 10w charger but you can use a pd charger with 20w so it will charge half the time :-)then it worked.
The color went gray and pink and never could get it back.
"I bought this tablet for my 2-year-old who is transitioning into a toddler bed. My 6-year-old lays down with her tablet an hour before bedtime and I thought it would make it fair for the toddler to have one.From the start, i had difficulty getting it to come on and booting up properly. Then I had a hard time just swiping the screen on. My toddler can almost never get the screen on which results in meltdowns. It's extremely delayed when you tap on the screen icons or select videos which results in more meltdowns from the toddler. Multiple times I've tried to log in for parental controls and it won't accept my password. (I will type in the exact password four or five times before it finally accepts it.) I have the parental control to lock the tablet up between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. but at 8:00 in the morning it won't let me turn it on because it says it's still bedtime. Random times throughout the day it will lock up and I will have to fight with my password to unlock this stupid device. I wish I had not wasted the money. It's much more hassle than it's worth for me.Update: we've had this tablet for about 6 months now. A couple of months ago began rebooting on its own throughout the day. It's become progressively more difficult to get off of the lock screen and now you can't get it off at all. If you do manage to somehow get it off lock screen you can't click on anything on the home screen. The touch screen is basically shot. I would blame it on the kid but I have been having problems with it since we opened it out of the box.A few months ago it started losing battery power. A battery used to last about a day and a half from a full charge to dead. For about the last month, it'll last about 6 hours from a full charge. But now it don't matter cuz it just don't work. I will never buy this brand again.  My friend who also watches my kid got an identical one for over at her house and within a month was having the same issues."
Great kids tablet but doesn’t last long. Battery started loosing life after about 3 months and charging was a challenge from the beginning. Had to wiggle the cord just right to get it to charge. After 6 months it won’t charge at all no matter how much I wiggle the cord. Very disappointing. Will have to spend more for better.
"The battery blew up like a balloon and cracked the tablet open.So we bought this for our toddler around a year ago. It stopped holding a charge a month and a half ago.We had lot going on, so I shelfed it and told my son I'd get around to looking at it later. So here I am, getting around to it.I picked it up and realized it the protective rubber case wasn't on properly. So I looked at and realized the the whole tablet was cracked open and that's why the case wouldn't fit.I was like, wtf happened?? I took the case off and, low and behold, the white package thing inside the tablet had expanded and cracked the side of the tablet open.I googled it, it's the battery.The reason it stopped turning on and wouldn't hold a charge was because of the battery, and then it blew up like a balloon and exploded.After only one year.I know it's a cheap tablet, but come on. That's wild."
"I didn't mind the price but something should have told me that at that price something was wrong. The picture, video and overall quality was extremely poor and it only lasted for 4 weeks before we started experiencing issues. Take my foolish advise and just save your money and buy a known brand tablet"
The audio jacks on both sets I have for my twins are messed up. It’s like the audio jack piece gets messed up where you insert the headphone piece and then you can’t insert the headphones anymore
I bought two of these one for my son and another for my daughter. It’s difficult to connect and stay connected to WiFi in certain areas. Also the battery dies quickly.
"Had this for less then 2 months. Don't use often, the entire top half of the screen stopped responding to touch so I can't pull down the top menu or do anything that involves the top half of the tablet"
"My 2yo needed something for car rides so I could have my phone back. I'll tell ya, it's not worth even the $50 it is. I would spend a little extra and get a tablet. It doesn't hold a charge, no wifi and no option to add Youtube."
Did not work the first day I received it. It will not connect to wifi. Charging is menum. Doesn't keep a charge for very long. It's a wast of time and money. My great grandson Could only use it to draw in the one app But the other apps wasn't excess able Because it kept saying connect to wifi. But as soon as i connected it to wifi it would say no wifi connected. 😢
Don’t waste your money. This didn’t last with my toddler for a month
This tablet was working well for 7 months and one day just stopped working. Seemed to be an issue with the charging. Will not charge or turn on only got a battery with a warning symbol in the middle. Bought it for my kid and she’s disappointed she can’t use her tablet.
"Screen & battery life are horrible if you plan to get this for a child, worked well the first month sort of but it has no purpose just a few months later."
"This is the second tablet we have ordered for our 2 year old daughter. The first one was a gift. It stopped working. So we bought her the same one. Now, part of the screen has quit working. She gets frustrated with trying to navigate it. We have tried turning it different ways and it still makes it difficult for her to navigate it. I tried looking on Amazon to contact the seller about it but there are no click links to contact the seller about it."
This tablet kinda really isn’t great. I wouldn’t recommend it. It crashes all of the time and then won’t turn back on. My husband has to reset it. It’s very very slow.
"I bought this for my daughter over other tablets with same specs and similar cost because of the case. Sadly, within 2 weeks, the case handle was ripped off(not pulled out) and now the handle is not usable. Also within the 2 weeks, the slidable stand in the back of the case broke.As far as the tablet itself goes, options and settings are good and easy to use, quality seems to be good, battery life is not as long as I was expecting though."
Purchased this tablet for my 2 year old because she was going to work with my wife and needed something for watching shows and such. It's nice that it comes with a silicone case. The downside is that it's very slow to do just about anything. I also left it in the charger for about a week and it only went as high as 87% for dinner reason. When she gets older I'll just get her the fire tablet for little more money.
"I had to give this product 3 stars. I had purchased 2 a blue and pink one about 5 months ago I’d say. The blue one is still hanging in there, however the pink one does not power on or work properly, it only power on and work while it’s on the charger :( , I’m not sure if it’s because we had it for a while or the product doesn’t last long. Great for toddlers though"
It's okay for a first tablet for a toddler. Wouldn't recommend as it's very slow at times and crashes quite often.
"My daughter's got this tablet for Christmas last year, so it was only right my son got 1 for Christmas this year. Within a week, the LCD screen cracked. (Not the actual screen, but the screen underneath.) I've emailed the company TWICE trying to see if there was a warranty or anything that could be done. They'd respond with ""provide them the order number"". After I inquired where the order number is, I wouldn't get a response. This happened BOTH times.Overall, I do love their product. Just not pleased with customer service. Hope this helps."
"When we first received this tablet,  we ended up having to send it back for a replacement immediately due to sound issues. Well, the new one worked OK til last night,  not even a whole year later. All a sudden when you turn it on it goes to a fuzzy screen and shuts back off. On top of this, you also can not find a new case for this, and when you reach out to company for some guidance on finding one, you don't get a reply, we just needed one because the kick stand broke on ours and our toddler loved the kick stand. I will never buy another, nor suggest to anyone to purchase this item."
This was purchased as a gift.  It was difficult to download educational programs.......
This tablet this foreign tablet will not connect to our internet and I've Googled it and unfortunately a lot of people have this problem. I'm returning it it has ruined my twins birthday this was supposed to be their birthday presents!!
Well what can I say I bought this for my great granddaughter she loves it her mother said that it has to be left on the charger overnight because it takes so long to charge up my great granddaughter pays with it all day long her mother has to pry it out of her hands to charge it up it’s the first thing she looks for when she wakes up her mother has to charge it up while she uses it most days it doesn’t hold a charge for longer than 4hours (she’s not on it that long) I would send it back but my great granddaughter would be crushed I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TABLET 😤😤
"Bought this tablet for my son, every time he tries to use an app or go online the Wi-Fi disconnects consistently and apps freeze and/or close on their own and multiple times will not reopen"
The handle broke the second day she had it.  And the screen cracked even with the pink protector around it.
I purchased this tablet for my 3 yr old grandson for Christmas and it was working fine until it came time to charge it and the port to plug the charger into did not work. We tried other usb cords but the tablet would only charge for about 10 minutes and then it would stop charging. I called  Amazon and they said due to it was past the time limit to return it I was SOL pretty much. They offered a refund of half the purchase price but no other help with fixing the problem. The phone rep wouldn't even give me a manufacturers phone # so I could maybe contact them for help. Now I have to take the tablet to someone who could possibly repair it.  The tablet itself is good but there is no manufacturers warrenty if you purchase this from Amazon. Not happy at all.
I kind of expected a little bit more but I guess you get what you pay for it’s definitely programs slower touch screens take minute too . I got this for my son as his first tablet with games . I guess we will wear it out until upgrade time lol
"Handle broke already after having it for 2 months and now that I’ve had it for almost a year, it doesn’t hold a charge. Great for a cheap tablet but won’t last"
"After 3 months it doesn’t stay charged long at all, and takes a long time to charge. It all of a sudden stopped connecting to our WiFi. Wish I could return."
I would never get anything like this again.Resolution is extremely poor 1000x sometimes.  Blurry screen.Colors are poor. This is for my grandson.  After turning it one I can see how much damage this screen quality will do to my grandsons vision.DONT GET IT...
"bought this for my 1.5 year old to watch youtube videos on a flightgiven the price, I guess you can't expect much - it gets the job done but it is slow and the screen doesn't often react properlyI guess next time I will invest more to buy a better product"
"It functions fine for the price I guess. I’m just pretty disappointed that it loads so slowly and takes so long to charge. My daughter gets frustrated with it and so do I. The battery life when fully charged is pretty decent, but good to ALWAYS have the charger just in case. Came pre installed with a lot of apps so I guess going through and deleting the unused ones may help the speed and battery life but that’s a pain in the rear. The case has proven to be very sturdy though, and I’m glad to have it. The adjustable stand on the back is super handy, but handle was really annoying and my 2 year old kept pulling it off so it is just floating around my house somewhere now, that’s okay we don’t miss it."
"When we got this (in Dec) for our middle daughter, the battery didn't last as long as the other one we bought (same one different outer cover). And now it's May and it won't charge, due to the USB-C port no longer getting connection."
"Great case. Good quality. This tablet is nice if you want to only allow your kid to use the set child's program. But for anything else, it will keep closing out the apps."
"Got this for my seven year old twins.  The battery life is terrible. You must recharge at least once an hour. Downloading apps is a pain.  The handle is flimsy and won't withstand kid use. Putting on parental controls is a pain  Switching between kid/parent mode is a pain.  Basically, the whole thing is a pain.  Pay a little more to get a higher quality tablet and save yourself a headache."
"Charging port is horrible.  Bought two of these now, and both times, the charging port malfunctioned and therefore, would not take a charge.  The kid loved it but would not buy another one.  And of course, it quit charging 3 days after we could return it."
"This tablet worked great for a few months. The battery life dwindled down to where it needed 2 hours to charge, after1 hour of use ( youtube videos). At random times, it would power off. I powered it back on to see the battery was about 40% remaining. The first one lasted about 2 years but the second one didn’t make it to its year mark. Now we have a Fires HD8 Kids Edition."
I will never buy another childrens tablet from Amazon again. While my son was playing on his tablet it completely shut down and we have not been able to get it to turn on. He's only had the tablet 8 months and doesn't use it that often
"I bought this tablet through Amazon, it will not charge. It is DEFECTIVE. And Amazon will not refund my money immediately. Do not buy from amazon!!!"
I purchased tablet for grandson in July 2024 and by August 2024 it no longer held a full charge. He can not enjoy the tablet. I have tried reaching out to the seller/company and so far no reply. Money wasted.
The stand on the case broke and the handle broke off as well and I haven’t been able to find a case for this tablet to replace it. The stand and handle come in handy but now they are both broken and makes it a little difficult wish I could find a case to replace it
Stopped charging after 4 months . Bought in July and it’s thanksgiving and won’t charge . Used 4 different charges and nothing
"The tablet is good for on the road trips and to get the kids something to do on appointments. But this tablet did not have all the part that stands it up so that the kid does not have to hold it. the charger was missing, and the case was old looking."
Ads alway pop up and it reboots itself for some odd reason
Had the tablet not even 24 hours it’s super laggy freezes can’t really do anything on it kids can’t play game
"So I read the reviews before purchasing and thought great let me buy this. Came the next day I made sure I charged it up my 2 yr old was happy...great.Next day she goes for the it turns it on does her thing. Literally about 2 hrs later it’s dead! How and I charged it all night? Thought maybe it wasn’t plugged all the way in. Ok charged it again still dies  within a couple hrs. Ugh now I’m mad. My daughter  wasn’t using it, it was turned OFF she goes to use it turns it on it’s dead!! Had this problem since I purchased it! Definitely wish I never wasted my money."
"The kids love these tablets, but they are very fitting and slow. I bought 2 for Christmas and within a month the power button on one of them broke and the screen would not turn on, luckily I bought a warranty and had it replaced, but yet again the power button broke on the new one. After a few months the power button broke on the other tablet but we are still able to get the screen to turn on."
Seemed used when we got them and it’s probably because they can stay in charge for hours and never get a full charge and they might last a half hour when they play with them! Very disappointed! Won’t buy again!
The tablet is Decent for the price. The interface is kinda wonky but gets the job done. At times it can be slow.
"It is a toddler item, the case pieces never stayed on (handle and stand both fell off immediately and will not stay on case). The tablet freezes and has to be rebooted with a pin at least 3 times a day, and the screen didn't break when dropped or thrown, but did break when the corner was pressed slightly (leaned on when the 2 year old was standing up)"
Was a good working tablet but now the screen is unresponsive I have tried everything to repair this issue. Kind of disappointing
"The girls got them Saturday.... Saturday the pink one wasn't charging right. There was a floating battery in the screen. By Sunday the blue one was saying it was charging and not even being connected. Both are now replaced and they still die quickly but not as bad as the first set of two.A bit difficult for set up for child through adult mode, having to toggle back and forth is a definite no for me. But I like the math problem set up to get to adult mode is crafty. But it is helpful once it's set up. The kick stand is very cheaply made."
Only issue so far is battery life. Full charge last  about 4 hours or less.
The tablet won’t connect to my houses wifi but will connect to everywhere but my house. We moved from Florida up to Maryland and his tablet is useless at our house which we are at 98% of the time.
"We loved this tablet for about 6 months. It worked well and we were able to use our hotspot for it when on the go. She uses one at her grandpa's house 2x a week and it still works but ours she uses more regularly now only works when plugged in. If we unplug it, it turns off automatically even though it says it has 80% battery. Can't find anything online for fixing it. That's my main reason for the low review score. Nothing to help troubleshoot or fix it."
"I bought this for my 2 year old son, to help at softball games and long car rides. This device does not hold a charge. I charged it to 100%, traveled an 1 hour 10 min to game (device turned off), watched the game, and on the way home tried to offer tablet to my son, but battery dead. Would not charge in car, either.  It doesn't connect or stay connected to wifi. We've only used it 3 or 4 times, each time struggling to keep it connected....most recently last evening. I logged into Amazon this morning to start and exchange / return and im 3 days past the return window. Super disappointing, as he would enjoy this if it worked properly."
Bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift and here it is Feb 7 and the screen stopped working. Called for replacement and they said it’s nothing they can do about it which is strange because you typically get 2-3 month factory warranty.
"Tablet was working good and had apps on there, but now the tablet isn't even letting me get to the home screen at all and it makes to go to ""kid"" setting and only do some ABC learning games. We have no idea what happened to it and why we can't get back to the actual tablet with everything on it."
"I ordered this on 2/7 for my 4 year old son. He absolutely loved it and understood how to use it better than the normal android kids tablets. However, within 2 to 3 weeks it wasn't holding a charge for more than 45 minutes to an hour and by the end of February it died completely and no longer turns on. I've reached out to the company via Amazon and was told to email them so I did. The first email contact was on 3/7 and they replied saying they could send another or I could send it back for repair at cost to me but also said it wasn't within the same month purchased so it wasn't under warranty. Their information states 30 day warranty so I contacted them on the 28th day.  I asked for another. No response. I emailed again 2 more times and still haven't heard anything back. I would not recommend buying this if this is how the company handles an issue with their products."
I do freezes up my baby only had it two weeks and we started having problems. More than that everything else was fine.
The tablet barely touch. Moves way too slow. Poor quality and cheap
"The touch screen on the top of the tablet stopped working within a month. The battery lasts maybe 2 consecutive hours. It can only be charged with the provided charger. The screen is easily scratched. Can literally be scratched with a fingernail. And lastly the case handle fell off easily. And the return window is only a month, which is, ironically, how long the tablet will hold out for. Just buy a Kindle fire tablet. At least you'll get a year of Amazon kids."
It sucks a waste of money. Don’t buy this B.S
You get what you pay for? My 3 yr old loved it and was able to watch videos without stealing our phone. Problem is that 7 months in or so it wont charge at all. She doesnt use it 24/7 either since she goes to daycare she might use it a total of 30 min to an hour a day. Very disappointing that the battery will no longer charge at all.
"Bought this for my kiddo for his birthday. Was surprised how many great reviews it had, because it was pretty cheaply made. The power button stuck in the first week and we returned."
Only worked for 3 days
Great to carry and transport! Kiddo approved for look and feel. Good size for a little one.
"For a lesser expensive tablet, it is suitable. The biggest issue is that the carry strap comes off easily and is w quite difficult to reconnect. The protective case does function well, but it's cheaply made."
Worked great for 3-4 month. Now charging port is collapsed in and does not charge. Very disappointedEdit: they reached out to me and said they did not want me to have a bad experience. Said they would make this right. ( THEY reached out to ME) So I did everything they told me to do to get this tablet fixed. Nothing. No reply. No email. Nothing. Definitely do NOT recommend this product. Would not recommend.
"I’ve had a lot of problems with this tablet. The first one had glitches and wouldn’t store my downloaded videos, despite saying the storage was being used there was nothing. I got a replacement and now this one has issues and when I updated it won’t let me log out of the parent account to switch to the kids account. I’ve spent an hour trying to find some hidden switch or trick to log out and have come to the conclusion it’s a bug in the program. I could’ve easily spend the money on a Walmart tablet and wouldn’t have had to deal with all the issues this one has. Also the handle on the cover keeps coming off and the stand on the back broke off on the first day of the first one as well as the replacement!!"
You get what you pay for very cheap cheaply made
I purchased two of these tablets and both of them stopped working within 6 months.....don't buy these
"We bought 2 for our kids and 1 for our niece. First the handle of the case breaks off, Within the first couple weeks. Next will be the kickstand part breaking off. Then Within 3‐4 months, the tablet stops charging. Was okay while it lasted I guess."
A full charge doesn’t last two hours.
"Order for my 3 year old grandson.  The first one didn't have picture but rather color lines on the screen.  Requested a replacement and this one you can barely hear the sound!!  Good theory but bad product..  My grandson loves it, so its going to break his heart to send this one back as well.  They say the third time is a charm!"
"Bought this August 20th, received the product the 23rd. Plugged it in to charge last night and it no longer charges. Don’t waste your money."
Batter dies too fast did not come with cable
I did not last long and I am in the Caribbean and unable to return the product.
It kept shutting off with no warning with full battery.  I just got it September 21st.  I will be returning
Mine has a defective battery.  It won't charge past a certain percentage.  It's ok for a tablet but the games on it are terrible.. it's says it's for a younger crowd but doesn't have a screen lock which is a big issue for me.  I got it for my 18 month old.
"As far as durability - it's awful. The power button broke within a week, I have to use a Bobby-pin to turn it on cos the button collapsed into the frame.  I would love to return it and get my 80 some odd dollars back but it's not worth the hassle of returning.Also - it won't always connect to wifi either so it's pretty much useless.I will say that before the power button issue it was a decent tablet, I like the layout and the fact that it came with a case but that's about it.Do yourself a favor and just get an Amazon Fire Tablet for cheaper,  they last forever."
"This tablet was bought for my 6yr old granddaughter for school and we love the pre-installed apps and the ability to download our own learning apps. Good space as well as the option to hold a memory card. The camera however does not work well. when using whats app the camera is permanently sideways and that can't be fixed; when using zoom it also has to be placed at least 4 feet away from her in order for her to be viewed properly otherwise she appears so close you can only see her nose and eyes, which now makes speaking a problem as the mic is so far away and we can't get a headset long enough to allow for comfortable usage so she has to shout in class. but other than that it's good. Update: The handle broke a couple of weeks ago, it fell out of her hand and the screen broke. I contacted Amazon about a replacement under warranty and they said they couldn't but to contact the seller. I did and to this day there has been no response. Changing my review to 1 star."
"I dont like it. I ordered it on April 21 I received it; it was for my daughter second birthday  on 22nd of June so it never used because i work on the ship. We opened it on her birthday she used it that day next morning we turn it on trying to scroll we couldn't,  only  to realize that the touchscreen is not working.What can be done about it, this is the second one I bought and it's the same thing"
Charge doesn't last very long and the handles could use a more sturdy design
The charge port is loose and doesn't charge well. We've have had this less than one month. It is faster than the last one we got but had the exact same software.
The tablet camera is scratched up. The photos are blurry. The volume is low. Not the best quality tablet.
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                The tablet was for my daughter, was ok for awhile & then started dying rather quickly. Then today she was laying in bed watching paw patrol & got up out the bed & the tablet fell onto her bedroom floor, a maybe 6 inch drop & now it's broke!?!?! In the so called ""child safe case"" the scree itself is not cracked, only when we try to turn it on, it's a black screen & it lights up & shows like it's cracked on the inside I guess??? I'm not sure, I am posting a video to show turning it off & on. The bed she was on was a air mattress & on a carpeted floor! I have dropped my iPad & Phone on our wood floors & this has never happened. Now I have to order another tablet, I guess the saying ""you get what you pay for"" refers to situations such as this."
"I like this tablet, it does what I need it to. But I’ve only had it a few weeks and the handle on the case broke! I bought it because it was made for toddlers, and have barely had it two weeks and it broke!!! Not cool, disappointed. Not toddler proof."
Waist of money it's not in English and could nor unlock it was never able to use it
It's slow and has a short battery life. My cell phone and other devices in our house uses the some type of charger but it only charges with the charger it came with. I took it off child mode so I could download apps and I couldn't figure out how to put it back on child mode. No where in the instructions says how to get back to child mode. Very frustrating and very disappointing
"(Buyer and returner of 3 tablets)I wouldn't suggest this tablet for any person. Great idea but the execution was not good. The screen is so horrible ,I worry for not only my own eyes but the kids too. This tablet won't support any game other than the ones preloaded and crashes all the time."
Doesn't charge AT ALL. No other chargers work for this device. It's very slow and the settings are annoying.
Tablet always force stops and shuts down. Lasted just long enough to not be able to return.
The handles popped off too easily and then cannot be put back on.  The handles were the a top reason that I bought 2 of these.
"Screen is very low quality display and very fragile, broke even with a screen protector and case. The case it came in was very flimsy with the handle on the case coming off as i removed the tablet from the packaging, and the tablet constantly just falling out of the case that was provided with it. I do not recommend this tablet. The only pro of this tablet is battery life but honestly the quality of the display screen is not even worth it."
This tablet takes a very long time to turn on or load anything. It freezes and after 6 weeks has frozen and cannot be used.
The case is to easy to remove. A small child can easily remove it
"This is a very nice tablet, however after repeated tries with web sites and phone calls to customer service it appears that it is not possible to link this tablet to my OnePlus N30 5G phone - one of my primary objectives in purchasing this tablet. Because of this the value is just not there. Also, I am sorry but I also cannot rate their customer service highly."
"LIke I said. A good tablet, but with random shutdowns, a hassle to use. OnePlus does not respond to my attempts to get support. I have been using OnePlus phones for a while, and have had no problems. Apparently, that's a good thing, since their support is a sham."
"Tried this as a daily driver and can only recommend if you are most interested in a 'stock' Android OS feel and the Google Pixel Tablet is not a good fit due to some if the limitations it brings.The Dimensity 9000 and/or the tablet optimization feels like the key drawback here. Compared to a Samsung S8 Plus, and Apple iPad Air M1 it feels slow. Especially with basic web rendering. Where the Air M1 is amazing fast, and the S8 Plus isn't far behind the OnePlus Pad is noticeable with slower page rendering. Looking forward to some fine wine updates as the chipset in theory should be up there with the Samsung.The build quality is nice, it's a bit 'heavy' feeling in not the best way and with the OnePlus book cover case it's as heavy feeling as the Samsung, with a larger screen which may or may not be your cup of tea. Where I feel that the Samsung has the screen and speaker win, the iPad Air continues to be what I reach for when I need a 'handheld tablet' while the Oneplus has found it's way into the bag as a travel companion when needing to get into email while on the go.And of course all three tablets still fail in landscape mode in their own ways. I prefer OnePlus and the look and feel of their stock launcher where the more iPad OS experience feels more intuitive. Comparing to Samsung and DeX yes, it can be cool to have a desktop available to use but it's still clunky how you move in and out of DeX. If Samsung could make it, for example, trigger DeX when moving into landscape or connecting a keyboard and ALSO be able to move out of DeX near-seamlessly it'd be pretty sweet, but it's not like that. Also when keyboards are connected things like autofill applications are more difficult to use than necessary.If you like OnePlus and want that more 'serious' tablet experience and don't want the Pixel Tablet, it's not bad. If you're not 100% into what OnePlus is doing take another look at Samsung and Apple. If you really want a tablet that can run Office it's still the Surface Pro even with all of the drawbacks it brings."
"Physically the device is impressive and very pleasing.The latest version of the OS that it can run though at the moment (OxygenOS 13.1, Android 13) contains an annoying bug which causes the screen brightness to automatically dim after a certain time — even when explicitly configured not to and with power plugged in.Bugs would not normally be a reason for a lower rating, but in this case the support has been very unhelpful. At first, I got a useless, likely AI-generated response. Then, when a human being started answering, they requested that I provide a video recording of the bug. Usually this is of course a reasonable request (where there are UI glitches which videos help to grasp), but in this case the problem was that the screen brightness was automatically tuned down. A screencast would obviously be no good in this case, and the support person had troubles getting it and repeatedly requested videos. Lastly, they suggested that I tweak some settings which I had already told them that I tweaked that way — in my original request. To this date, they have not even acknowledged that this is a bug to be passed to their dev team."
"In the description for the tablet it states ""Wi-Fi with Cellular Data Sharing Tablet"" which looks like it may have cellular capabilities. It does not, it does not have a space for a SIM card nor does it support an ESIM. What this is actually referring to is if you have your phone setup as a hotspot, it can connect to the Wifi and use data. OR, if you have the OnePlus phone, it'll do it automatically.At this price point, there are better tablets out there that are just wifi capable."
"Had to return because AT&T. said they could not apply cellular to the device. It wouldn’t accept Sims card ..Even though I have two other devices that are Wi-Fi cellular.. Save yourself some trouble don’t get the OnePlus Pad.. Beautiful picture nice screen Wi-Fi is fine, but no cellular! Such an inconvenience to have to return it to Amazon"
"I agree with the others on most of the points already brought up: the screen is large and gorgeous, the tablet is (fairly) light and the battery life is great, etc.However, I mainly use the tablet for mobile gaming, and for that, the touch screen is awful. It is not nearly sensitive enough for quick taps, and anything requiring quick finger skills is simply not doable on this tablet.  The screen does work fine for web browsing and such, but anything more complicated can't be reliably done.  As a result, I've gone back to my $100 Kindle Fire: it's an inferior tablet in every way compared to this one, except for the sensitivity of the touch screen. And that really is the crucial part for my usage."
"While setting up, told to reboot, but tablet would not let me. I held the off and on button but it would not display the appropriate menu. Never had a problem with Samsung tablets, should have stuck with them."
When I receive the box there were no seals on it witch seems odd and when I turned it on there was no setup process it was already done. This sure seems like bit of a severity issue. I factory reset it and works just fine.
"this is a great tablet, however I found too late that it does not support DP Alt mode, which really stinks because I need it. And I can't return it. damn!!! $450 down the drain."
"I had ordered this tablet before and accidently broke the glasse even with a screen protector. Heartbroken i sold that one on eBay and rebought it. Thinking sure my bad, my fault. However i got this secondary tablet in less then 2 months there is a hairline fracture. I was careful with this one . The unit works fine. However i guess because the tablet is large,its more fragile.It is very disappointing."
It was fine while it worked.  I let it sit for a couple of months and then went to turn it back on.  It's stuck in a boot loop where the oneplus logo appears for a few seconds before it reboots.  I can't get it to even enter fastboot.oneplus support is a joke.  I can't even create an account with them to get it serviced.
Don't buy this from Amazon. Go to oneplus store and get the latest with a stylus. Great tablet but no stylo except thiers will work. Even tge oneplus stylo 2 will jot work for this
"This is the third OnePlus product I’ve bought. Two phones and then this. I bought it as a gift for a family member who is an android person and wanted away from their older iPad. Nice quality feel, bright screen and good battery life — but glitchy OS, weird screen locks and having to listen to almost daily complaints about a premium tablet is unacceptable. There are even features which OnePlus’ website described as “upcoming” that we are still waiting for.I won’t buy OnePlus again."
Purchased tablet and needed assistance with product and OnePlus customer service is useless.
I am a Sound Engineer and I purchased this tablet for doing remote mixing as well as for watching videos. I found out it didn't have a headphone jack until after I bought it. This is a big issue for me because Bluetooth audio is low quality and doesn't operate in real-time. So that immediately cut out my plans for watching videos on it. It's strange that a tablet this expensive could be missing such a cheap and basic feature.
"Although I don't own the one plus pad, I think there's something worth noting, a pad or tablet should always have as much or more power than a phone and unfortunately the one plus pad fails to meet that. My one plus 11 phone has 16GB of ram, 256GB of storage and is powered by Qualcomm 8 gen 2. By contrast the one plus pad has 8 GB of ram, 128GB of storage and is powered by media tek dimensity 9000. With that said, it's unfortunate that the one plus pad is limited to that and is not configurable where it can be upgraded with more ram, storage and with a more powerful SoC. While such an upgrade would increase the price, it should've at least been offered."
"My charging cable arrived damaged in the package. The box was not damaged, so it was packed that way. I reached out to One Plus about getting a replacement. After receiving a canned email promising me a resolution in 48 hours, the company never followed up. I have sent 6 emails and all of them have been ignored. If you buy this, you better pray you don't have any problems, because there is no customer service."
"Excellent APU and panel, but in the world of tablets, the OnePlus Pad weights too much, esp., with the keyboard case, to be convenient away from home or office."
"I really love this tablet, it's solid in every respect but one...memory.  128 GB is just too little in this day and age and without and SD card slot there is no remedy to this problem.  I really hope the produce and updated version with either more memory or an option to add a SD."
I was pretty harsh on this before actually using it for being a mediatek cpu this thing does have good performance it's smooth I do have crashes with certain browsers when entering full screen mode not sure if it's the app or a firmware issue but everything works good even gaming I usually try asphalt 9 and there's no lag what so ever u even see dirt and stuff hit your screen I have a so called gaming Chromebook that couldn't even run that game . Overall it's a nice tablet it's big the charging speed is awesome 👍 I just wish we could get updates I like the tweaks that they added to the operating system. I got a one plus phone so on my first review it looked like just a copy and paste of the os but it does work very well probably the best under 450$
"Great tablet for reading and a good price to power rario, but you must sideload Google Play and that is a big minus.  Also somewhat glichy w/ certain apps  (If Amazon want to produce a top tablet they must have Google Play or a similar store with all apps. Who wants a tablet that can't access your bank or medical apps.)  But it can be worked around if you have the skills."
Selling or buying a tablet that does not have Google play is  a waste of money.
"Biggest disappointment is it will not work with any other charger but the one it came with so you better make sure you keep it close. But I bought this for my daughter less than two months ago and today, I placed the tablet on the charger it came with and the screen notified me it was charging. I went back to it hours later and nothing. No power, not charging, nothing on the screen, just dead. I've tried it all. Since it is only a $40 tablet, I did not purchase the $17 a month insurance. It's now outside the return window of 30 days. Just find something else."
"I bought this for my daughter in September (13th). It officially died today (December 3rd). It does not charge up. The plug does not fit, it stopped fitting a few weeks ago...I will not buy it again."
"At first it was all good and affordable for a toddler. But now I’m starting to have issues with it, the wifi or personal connection from phone don’t work correctly (and mind you, I’m literally at home with a wifi box) I would have returned it if my close window did not expire."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            It’s not very big but i have twins 4 years and I ordered one to see if they liked it(they did ) so I got a second one .Unfortunately  the second one (see video) often blocked just stopped working /my child getting very frustrated.its getting worse everyday.Really not happy
The.tablet is beautiful but not durable. The screen freezes we can't turn.on and off.Some functions didn't work.My dota is so upset about the tablet because she loves it.What can be done.about it?
Wouldn’t recommend for small children
Instructions were in a foreign language and I have no idea how to work it but my toddler likes to chew on it so it was worth the price for that
I have only had it for about 10 days and I charged it lastnight and this morning it was only charged 25%.😞
These are perfect for toddlers but I was a little disappointed in the battery life. It dies very quickly even when it’s fully charged.
It’s ok for a toddler I guess. Battery doesn’t last long though so I can imagine the fits that are coming.
I bought this for a birthday present. He has only had it 18 days. Battery needs charged constantly. The screen freezes. Now it’s past the return date.Save your money or buy the protection.
I bought this tablet for my grandbaby it stopped working. I sent it back with the insurance and then the second one broke. I would like to return this item.
My 3 yr old grandson loves his tablet good for a couple of hours and the battery goes dead. Stay charge for maybe 2 hours. Great buy for the price.
"As we all know kids love screen time, but even an jour this tablet doesn’t last. It’s cute and fun but kids don’t want to be stuck by a charger and they should not have to be plugged in to use, that’s dangerous."
"The tablet it's self was great, volume should go higher...Rubber cover mutes volume, we had to cut a piece out of cover, no vent for sound to come out.Volume is low to begin with, so rubber cover blocking the speaker, was like having the volume off."
very slow and fragile
"Bought this for my granddaughter.  Worked well for 5 month, now it won't charge or reset."
Tablet once turned on asked for a password.  If its brand new why asked for a password when it has not been set up yet Waste of moneyChild was very disappointed 😞If i could give it no stars I would
My daughter got one for Christmas and within 2 weeks it shut off and wouldn’t come back on. The battery in it was bad from the jump.
"At first I thought “well, the built in stuff is pretty lame but it’s indestructible so let’s see how she likes it.” My 2 year old loved the tv shows but after it died the first time it wouldn’t charge so I am returning. Just glad it crapped out while I was still in the return window but I can TOTALLY see how this thing could work for 30 days and then break!! Beware!"
I bought a tablet from you for my daughter and it’s not working as it should we can’t get in to programs or app it is sticking
Only work for one day put it on the charger and never turn back on 🙄
"It worked perfectly fine the first day. After that it takes forever to connect. Just spins and loads and then get error , whine device is connected to wifi"
I bought this for my grandson and it has hardly been used! Now it will not charge and it looks like a large burnt spot on the screen!
Stopped working after a month
Just a little shy of 2 months and it won't charge or turn on. Don't waste your money.
"I read the previous reviews and it is unfortunate that I've also had the same issue with the tablet not working after 2 months. I'm not sure what is causing the issue, but it needs to be resolved. I got this as a Christmas gift for my toddler and he wasn't able to fully enjoy his gift, before it stopped working."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I purchase this for my toddler barely 2weeks and for days  now it frozed, can't turn it off nor restart, been swapping  the screen without success,the restart button will not work either."
My 4 year old grandson had it two months dropped it once and half the screen went blank.
Wouldn’t recommend kids only had it for a week at the most and they broke
Do not buy it’s a waste of money!!!!!! Doesn’t work past 2 months!!!!
"Arrived in a bag, no accessories no box. Wouldn't turn on after charging for hours. This was clearly used in fairness I can't speak to new product."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The tablet stop working 30 days after having it. The touch is not working and it kept freezing before it stop working. One day after the return window closed.
I’m pissed because it didn’t have YouTube on it for my one year old
tablet stopped working in 2 months? got it for christmas and stopped charging today… won’t even turn on no more even if it’s on the charger it’ll take all day to charge.
Quality of screen was not good. However the case was really good
poor battery quality.  Battery wil not stay charged for more than 1 hr.
Doesn't charge or turn on
This tablet overheats and breaks sooooooo easily. My other kids’ tablets lasted way longer.
Screen Stopped working the second day after getting it.
"the true concept, cheap is expensive It broke after two months of use terrible product"
"Liked the tablet, but not with a cracked screen."
"I'm glad that only my toddler is going to be using this tablet because it would drive me insane if I had to use it all the time.  As a parent, I am always looking for ways to keep my child entertained while also providing educational value. And while this tablet offers that, it runs very very slow!  I'm sure it is because it only has 2GB of RAM.The 32GB storage capacity was just enough space to download a few educational apps and games for my child to enjoy. The dual camera feature is also a plus since my son loves taking taking pictures and videos - though, I have a feeling that I'll soon having to delete a TON of random pictures in order to save space.But that said, the best part of this tablet is the parental controls. I can easily set limits on screen time and restrict access to certain apps and websites. This gives me the ability to monitor my son's usage and ensure that he is only accessing age-appropriate content.It also comes pre-loaded with popular apps so that made the setup process a bit easier."
"The tablet is okay for the price. It comes preloaded with some games & you’ll have to log into or create an account to download anything else from the play store. It charges quickly & the stand/case is helpful with making sure it stands on a flat surface. Did notice the quality of the picture isn’t the best, but young kids won’t really care. The case is easily removable if adults or older kids wanted to make it not so kiddy looking. It did come with a charger & charges pretty fast. It’s very slow with loading things which is kind of a bummer. As far as sound goes, it’s very muffled but you can hear it. There as a headphone plug on the side which may be better quality (haven’t tried it yet). Overall it’s just okay. Would not be a good substitute for a higher price tablet if you’re wanting something to actually do work on but decent enough to be a young kids first tablet without spending a ton of money."
"This is a very basic tablet. It runs on the trimmed down Android Go platform. Android Go has significant built-in performance, network, and battery limitations. This should not be a major issue for who this tablet is marketed towards.Knowing the target audience for this tablet, the following are some observations noticed so far:- extremely laggy. Everything from touch sensitivity to app transitions, there is a lag, significant in some apps opening.- the colors on the screen are really washed out. The viewing angle is very narrow.- speakers are located only on one side. The sound quality and volume is acceptable for this type of tablet.- charges extremely slow. From a 10% charge, it takes over 5 hours to charge to full.- structure of the tablet is very flimsy. It is highly advised not to use this without the bumper case.- it randomly shuts off and has to be powered back on. I exchanged the first one thinking it was defective but this second one does the exact same thing.- some apps have to be loaded multiple time. For example, when trying to open Netflix app, the first time the icon is tapped, the screen will go black and looks like it is about to transition but stays black. Then I have to press the ""back"" button then try to tap the icon again. Sometimes it takes about 2-3 re-tries.This tablet is acceptable for what it is and who it's marketed for."
"There are some really good things about this tablet. The design is child friendly and already comes child proof with a silicone protector. The cover allows for the tablet to stand and has an easy carrying handle. The picture quality is really crisp as well. The tablet can also be used by an adult or child- you can add apps as you want and still use the parent control options.Unfortunately, this tablet is super difficult to setup.  After a month or so I still don’t know how to use it. It’s also extremely slow- like exaggerated sloth slow lol it takes forever to load and start. Once the app starts it’s fine. Also, the battery will die quickly.For the price it’s a good deal. But you certainly need patience to get it going. For me, under no circumstances will my toddler be allowed to play with my very expensive IPad. So, this works out just fine!"
"This is the kind of tablet that you put YouTube on for a kid to occupy themselves with when you are busy, and that's about it. It does have a camera, but you can probably draw better pictures. Streaming maybe possible, but only at the lowest resolutions and likely with buffering, no matter how good your internet is. It is also a very small screen, compared to the majority of tablets these days. All that said, if you know what to expect from it, it will serve a specific purpose plenty well enough, and it's pretty cheap."
Stopped working after 4 months but decent if it was working. All apps ran and connects to Wi-Fi.
"My toddler really likes this tablet and it’s easy for her to hold and swipe the screen. However, even after completely charging, this tablet battery runs out super quickly."
"The set up was easy, pre-loaded games are okay, silicone case is cute, but the battery life and picture quality is terrible. When a notification appears, we try to swipe down, but it doesn't stay down. So, the top of the screen has notifications that can't be cleared. Suggest spending a little more to get better quality in all aspects. In the long run, it'll last longer and be worth it."
"Unfortunately this tablet fell short of my expectations. I got this hopes to provide my child with an educational and entertaining device. The tablet's performance was extremely disappointing, as it was unbearably slow. Whether it was opening apps, browsing the web, or using the touch screen, everything seemed to lag behind. Tasks that should have been quick and smooth became frustrating and time-consuming. It's especially disheartening when a device marketed for toddlers fails to deliver on its basic functions. I regretfully cannot recommend this tablet due to its frustratingly slow speed."
It’s very slow only good thing on it was YouTube and the drawing app it stopped working after less than one week of my kid using it the screen won’t work
"The watch generally does not work as described (heart rate monitor and step counter is very far off). It also does not have all the features advertised (i.e. workouts, etc.)"
"The watch was packed nicely. When I plugged the charger, it still had 84 percent of power. The manual is brief but in multiple languages and colors. I found the app in the manual. That’s about the only useful information from the manual. The connection is very easy. I ware it for 24 hours with the other arm wares a Fitbit.Pro: 1. It looks good. Good size with bright colors, easy to read. 2. Easy to use. After fully charged and connected to the cellphone, it is straightforward. 3. It tells time and date nicely.Con: mostly I don’t think it’s smart. For today, it tells me I have taken 4637 steps, but my Fitbit tells me I have taken 5718 steps.So my conclusion is it’s a nice digital watch but not necessary smart. For the price of $30, I will keep it."
"I really wanted to love this watch. All of the features seemed to be exactly what I wanted and needed. It's very lightweight, and was easy to set up with my phone and the Gloryfit app. The step count seemed on par with other smart watches I've had, and there were lots of options to personalize the phone (watch faces, types of workouts, etc). My issue is the notifications. I use Android, my kids and most of my extended family use iPhones. Any time I get a  text from an iPhone user, there's no notification to the watch. Any and all other notifications come through without issue, but I need to be able to get ALL of my notifications. I'm sadly returning it."
"I got this watch to help with work. See my texts and record steps.First few hours using it, it doesn’t have a code system/lock which is weird to me. Everything else is connected to my IPhone (music, Bluetooth calling, steps ect.) but not my texts which is strange to me.I will review again after a few days of use."
"I mean you get what you pay for. Big face. It's very light weight. The band isn't going to last long. I'm always on the go and working on things at work. This isn't going to cut it. One snag and it's going to break. You drop the watch itself and its going to bust. Very cheaply made. Honestly, it's a good starter watch for teens maybe. I will say tho the speaker is loud. I will find out later this week if the blood oxygen and heart rate is correct or not. I just have a feeling it's going to get returned. I'm just not inlove with it like I thought I was going to be. I was very excited from all the reviews.  I'm kind of disappointed.  This thing shouldn't be more than $20 at most. It was advertised as $99 on sale for $35....feel like I got scammed honestly. If you like it great but it's not for me."
"I have a Samsung phone with Android. I use Google Messages for text messages. It seems that the Gloryfit app that this watch uses to sync with your phone doesn't support Google Messages. Other than that, it seems like it's worth the $30 price I paid for it. Oh, and the band is super cheap."
"You can't use the general function of the watch unless you have exact location on, and the app on your phone runs full time in the background, and search nearby devices."
"Watch face doesn't turn on all the time, have to hit the screen and button multiple times, and the pedometer is inaccurate. It fails to log 1000s of steps throughout the day."
I had 3 people try and could not get to sinc to WiFi so  time nor nothing would work. Would not rebuy
Refuses to sign into app until you enable high power consumption in background on your phone. I'd rather have a phone than a watch.
"i needed a watch for notifications mainly,no matter what I tried I was not able to get it to receive notification, sending it back."
"I was hoping to find the android equivalent to apple watches with app capabilities to access Facebook, Snapchat, youtube etc... and this simple isnt capable."
I specifically bought this as a sleep tracker but it’s pretty useless and doesn’t log sleep at all. I tried it everything and customer service wouldn’t reply. In other way it’s a decent smart phone watch for the price. The blood pressure and oxygen sensors work intermittently also.
"The watch doesn't monitor calories burnt other than when I am walking. Apparently, I don't use any calories when I sleep or sit down? This wasn't the case with my previous smart watches."
"Aside from the delivery delay, this product has been of absolutely no use to me. The app is just useless and this isn't my first Smart watch! I've never had any issues setting up an app for a fitness tracker before and I've tried numerous times to get the app to work for about a week now and it's just not doing anything, just keeps asking me to adjust the settings on my phone. Total waste of money, would not recommend. I have to order another one now and definitely not this brand!"
"Straight out the box everything was working for about 2 minutes now heart rate, oxygen levels and step count stopped working. Was not expecting much for the price but at least for it to work long enough to try it out. Will be returning."
"Arrived very poorly packed once outer box opened, watch must have been squashed did not switch on had 2 green lights on on rear also usb end squashed had to open it wider with screw driver to charge ,only fit for bin, I have ordered other watch from other seller that's £25 lost."
Cheap and flimsy!! Some apps don't work
"Working good but only for short time, loosing connection with mobile phone a few times a day."
"Keep in mind that I MAY have a defective phone not representative of the majority of those sold. Certainly there are anomalies with at least one screen on mine. That being said here we go.Battery life is spectacular compared to my current smartwatch. However, my iPhone now runs down in about eight hours.  It is now at 55% capacity four hours after being fully charged. I suspect the smart watch app on my phone is responsible.I have an iPhone XR with a companion Series 4 Apple Watch which I plan to replace. I am in relatively poor health and was attracted to this smartwatch because of the oxygen monitor capability. Oxi-pulse meters  are a mature technology and my night oxygen monitor is a hospital grade $2500 machine that is very accurate. I also have a $35 finger O2 machine and the two are always in close agreement. The watch O2 meter stays at 97-98% at rest when my other two meters are usually in agreement at about 94-95. This is not sufficient for my needs.The heart rate monitor is usually in good agreement with my other two meters and you can set upper and lower limits on it. The watch will notify you if limits are exceeded. The function actually works but in the two incidents for me it detected very high rates that were bogus.At age 85 I am no longer a gym rat and can not offer insight into the training value of this watch.  Nor it’s waterproof worthiness. The number of steps taken seems about right.Calls can be answered and made with the watch and you can upload 100 contacts. Receipt of texts, emails etc are announced by watch vibration and can be viewed but I found no way to respond to them on the watch.I was disappointed by the weather app which is very accurate when it finds my town but is way off when not. It can be activated by finger on the home screen which is nice.The watch app and its companion iPhone app allow each to find the other which is handy for an 85 year old. A couple of clicks turn the watch into a flashlight as needed. There are many watch faces for those interested in such.The screen time is a frustrating four seconds and cannot be adjusted. If you are more nimble than an 85 year old you should have no problem.Instructions are Spartan but unless you are less tech savvy than me you should have little trouble.I recommend you give this watch a try before diving into a$600 model.  Where else are you going to find one for $29? I still have the watch and am still learning. I will update this review if Amazon allows it to be posted."
"Overall good watch. I wanted a smart watch but basic. Idon't care to use the watch to make or receive calls,  but it supposed to work, id like to see my texts come through on the watch..Haven't been able to make it work to receive calls and texts,  although I could make calls from the watch, I'll randomly get a text message notification come through on the watch but most don't come through.. also, it's cool to can use the watch to use your phones camera through the app, but no idea where those pictures go,  that don't go into the gallery on my phone.  I took lots of pictures using the control on the watch but don't see the pictures that were taken anywhere"
"Most of the features were cool, but there were 3 areas which were lacking. 1. The heart rate monitor was highly inaccurate. It was stating my resting heart rate was hovering around 110. But when I checked using my fingers in my jugular and counting the beats for 1 full minute, my rate was 65 and 68 respectively for the two times I counted. 2. It cannot play music through the watch. It let's you pause and skip songs that are playing and projecting on your phone, but it does not sync with any music and play it directly. 3. There was a really cool preset face the watch came with, but messing around with the app, I was checking out the other faces, but then the preset one disappeared and was not in the list of available options. Just got it an hour ago, and will unfortunately be sending it back since the main feature I wanted it for doesnt work properly."
So the watch looks sleek and is pretty comfortable. The amount of steps seems accurate the majority of the time and I don't expect perfection. But the heart rate monitoring is garbage. If you're getting this to monitor your heart rate and amount of calories burned while exercising move on to something else.I'm only on day one but it staying steady in the 60s to 70s while I'm doing a mile jog on full incline literally dripping sweat is hilariously inaccurate. There were times where it just stopped getting a reading altogether. Idk maybe I just got a bad watch or something but either way it's cheap for a reason and that's why I assume.
"as for me working in construction and having a cheaper alternative this is a great watch. It connects easily and hows exception sound quality.I do however wish it would play music for a longer period from the watch but as an alternative to view your notifications without having to take your phone out was a buying point for me and the price. It feels a little light, but read out is clear and bright. Also the read outs look more like an old school computer rather than exactly what shows on iPhone with regards to the texting notifications but not a deal breaker over all its what I needed"
"Really wanted to like it but after 2 hours of trying to pair/set up unsuccessfully, gave up.  Am an old lady and don't want to spend my golden years fighting with technology.  Intended to use this instead of Charge 5 which has been giving me some problems but at least it's set up (& was simple to do) and works most of the time.  Am returning."
"The watch does not work with any RSC texts on the newest app for Androids/Samsung/Google, it only works on SMS text messages aka it only gives text message notifications if you receive a message from an iPhone. The accuracy of the fitness tracking is significantly under recorded. Other than that it does what it says and fits nicely."
Overall I like the watch. The battery life could be better. Sometimes it takes several attempts when pushing the button for the screen to light up. Also it’s not the most user friendly.
The wrist bad is of very poor quality and the clasp is made of cheap plastic. The actual watch is pretty good.
Everything works good on the watch. It was just my personal preference on the face size is all.I just purchased a smaller watch and it is perfect.
Worked well. Easy to set up. Way too big for my wrist.
"I like the size and the screen, but the various sports modes pause on their own and then no steps are recorded at all.  I haven't figured out how to start a sports mode except from my phone.  So I'm not getting the functionality that I was hoping for."
Everything worked except GPS. It said I walked 16 minutes which I did but said I only went .01 miles.
"Why does nobody send out charging ports these days! I can’t really give a review of something I haven’t been able to even try!! Ugh!  Once again, no charging port and the cable doesn’t fit my iPhone charger! Really irritating, they could at LEAST have sent something that fits both iPhone and android! Grrrr"
"Save the hassle and don't get lured in by the price. The watch doesn't stay connected well. Notifications often arrived late. The battery life is bad, especially since the screen isn't lit up all the time and when you try and get it to come on, it won't half the time. Inaccurate sleep readings too."
"If you’re looking to track your fitness goals this doesn’t work well at all!I’ve been tracking my workout and the heartbeat measurements, steps and calories are very inaccurate. That was my goal, but can only be used as a watch.When doing a high intense training it tells my heartbeat is about 90~100 bpm, and after an hour training calories go to about 100 calories. Very different from the watch I used to have before, doing the same training. Same thing with the steps, sometimes I am sitting in the same place, and it changes as I was walking..def don’t recommend it!"
"a person suffering from dyslexia with M.S. this watch was very difficult to sync my vitals when I will check. would takes minutes before reading a BPM. and all the other feature lack just the same. takes time to check or it is not reading at all. sleep monitor is terrible, I know I had a bad night but I kept falling asleep 2 hours wake up and it would read 0. had a bad night obvious but it only read 4 hours of sleep last night...def had more than 6 hours.  Oxygen is cool, it ticks every 10min to check. Don't know if this is a keeper..."
This product is super inaccurate. Said yesterday I hit over 10k steps checked the app it only registed 20. Also it will tell you you ran .01 miles for 45 minutes nearly everyday. Not to mention it said my heart rate was 89 when I was at the drs when my actual heart rate was over 130
Apparently people rate on the appearance of watches more than accuracy and whether or not they work.I'll tell you the basic line. This watch may look great for appearance and size but it sure does not work. It is not accurate at all. Gave me 20 steps for sitting in bed watching TV. Then it either didn't count on steps or gave me more steps than I took.
I’ve had this watch for about a week now. The battery does not last. It barely stays charged for 5 hours. The watch band is also a weird fit. Can’t seem to find different watch band replacement either. I would not recommend.
No instructions included. Can't use. Very disappointed
Out if box failure. Wouldn't charge. Instructions are really hard to read.
I have emailed 3x.No response.I cannot get the sleep function to work.
i purchased this smart watch in March if this year.  Now it will not keep the face no the watch i choose.  The sleep function and there are a few other functions that are not work. i am looking at other watches
I can't respond to any text messages I can't see anything else on the screen letters are super small not made well either I'm not happy with the purchase at all of yeah came in a box fifty times the size nessesary
"Here is my honest opinion as I always have used quality products before and wanted to give this cheap smartwatch a try if it does what it's intended to do.First of all it was really difficult to setup to pair with phones and I tested 3 of different brands. Before you actually can pair you have to enable all the permissions on the phone and some more and also before pairing you must enable all the options in settings of the APP itself to pair properly.Second of all I like the speed and quality so far, it's not laggy but does not allow to add any additional applications to it. Very similar to apple watch but there you have appstore.It needs a warming up to work properly on the hand to measure heart beats, blood oxygen and steps. I have to constantly move it around the arm to warm up the sensors to work. Otherwise it doesn't and it's been tightly and loosely fixed on my hand, both same issue which I'm disappointed with.What I mean is that I need to constantly move the watch up and down against my skin on arm to sensors to work.Some days are better than others.Sleep tracking is working well but if it's not properly working then you won't get recording on the sleep."
"Every so often I go through a phase of wanting a smart watch but I'm always disappointed when I get one, this time was no different, I never learn.The dials are mostly awful. You can download more from the GloryFit app but 99% of them are just ugly or not my thing at all. I'd love the option to have a simple analog display without rainbows and unicorns jumping out at me.Step counting is inaccurate, which I always expect as they always are for me. I get up during the night quite a few times, but my step count is always 0 when I get up in the morning. Maybe I float and don't realise it.Calls can be made from the phone, which is handy but would be good if I could text from it too.I have ""raise hand to activate display"" turned on but this doesnt always work which can be annoying.Would be nice if I could choose how long to have the display of the watch on as it isnt on long enough when I'm swiping through the phone and being a bit slow. If there is an option I must have missed it.All in all, its just an average smart watch, same as any other out there that are similar prices. Some things work, some things dont."
"I wanted something to replace a Fitbit (because the strap was snapping) which gave me the time, my steps, calories burned and sleep patterns.  At the price offered here it was a no-brainer and I was very smug on day 2 of the purchase as everything worked perfectly.I didn't need it for emails or phone calls etc as I'm working outdoors most of the time.Since then it hasn't recorded any nights sleep, asking if I wore it at night and inexplicably stops recording my steps during the day. Fortunately my Fitbit on the other wrist has survived so far. If I notice it's ceased up and take it off and tap the back it's starts recording again. This isn't helpful. It may be something to do with rubbing again thick sleeves. Who knows!"
"Bought this primarily as a step counter, and for that purpose it's not useable. I'd walk to the kitchen, approx. 30 steps from the living room and it would jump up 100s of steps. It would count steps during sleep...If you want a cheap smart watch for calls/notifications it would be fine for this. If you're looking for a sports tracker, this isn't it."
The battery life lasts for only two days! I have had to charge consistently and I have had the watch for only 2 weeks. Other functions are great but I might have to return this.
"The connection to other devices is very unstable and the instructions are not very clear.For the value is not bad, however, if you're looking for a device that is useful as a smartwatch and if you will use it a lot, it's worth to invest some more money and buy something better."
Not all the app on my watch work. It don’t track my sleeping or my steps so not that happy with it
"Good watch, shame about the battery life. 4 days.Not 5/7 as advertised."
"This is a good looking watch. But this oftens fails to register steps. One day I walked for 12000 steps which is corectly registered by google fit. But this only registered 350 steps. Now I can see this happens almost everyday. There is no problem connecting this with app but this simply fails to register all activities without any reason. This happened when I was running.I am looking for any solution to fix the above problem. Any tips would be greatly appreaciated.I contacted the manufacturer few days ago. So far, there is no reply. It seems this smart watch is getting ready for its suitable location in the dust bin."
Tried everything I know but can't get the app working will get my lad to have a look. Watch is nice though. Once I get it working I will add more comments thanks
"Cassan Smart WatchI kept wearing this watch and periodically checked the sleep monitor, it always said Zero hours slept.then after wearing it all day and staying up late till 5am, i checked the sleep monitor againit said i had been asleep since 10pm........and was even saying i was asleep while i was looking at it.It said i had been asleep for 6 hours while working at my pc till the early hours............Im sending this gimmick back... and it doesnt monitor Blood Pressure as some people say"
"Well it's the first time I've written a review and unfortunately it's a negative one. This watch is poor it's actually worked correctly maybe one day in four. The battery is awful I'm now recharging it every two days, once I've finished writing this I'm going to throw it in the rubbish bin."
"I bought this as I was fed up with my Fitbit developing problems after the warranty had expired.Initially I thought it was a good purchase. However, I have found the data recording is inaccurate and often fails to record either the sleep or heart monitoring. The steps recording is way off the mark.I have compared it with Strava which has recorded my walks in excess of 8 miles yet this device barely recorded 8000 steps.Very disappointing 😞"
"What an absolute waste of money and my income is only £314 a month.  After charging it the face is black.  Pressed numerous times but the face remains dark.  Holding the button down, same thing.  The instructions are so miniscule it's impossible to read without a magnifying glass and even then that hardly helped.  Straight in the bin one hour after opening the box, downloading the app, connecting it to Bluetooth etc. Can't return it as I am housebound."
"Absolutely do not buy. The QR code on the instructions took me to a site that I had to put my bank details in, they insisted on not taking money, but then have taken over 40 pounds out, I've had to report and block my card and get a new one. Fraud team are now investigating. Total scam"
You get what you pay for. This doesn't track HR accurately.
I bought 2 and had to return them straight away because the app needed to configure them didn't work in 2 different Android phones that appeared as supported. Frustrating!!!
"TOTAL RUBBISH, YOU WOULD EXPECT A WATCH TO SHOW THE TIME, WHEN SWITCHED ON."
"Keeps freezing and you have to take it off and put it on again, in order for it to start counting steps."
"Spent hours trying to get it to work , just would not link to my phone, The instructions were that small you need telescopic vision to read them . The app refused to open regardless of my many tries. just gave up in the end."
"I have used two fitness trackers in the past: the Fitbit Charge 2 and the Fitbit Versa 2. I will compare the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 to the Fitbit Versa 2, since it's the only other smartwatch I have used. I tried the watch with two different Samsung Galaxy smartphones: the S22 Ultra and the Z Flip 5.Pros:- Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 has a beautiful, wide-enough display. It was the biggest reason I could never go for a Watch 4 or 5.- 2 side buttons with different customizable shortcut options.- It has both a microphone to dictate text messages, e-mails, commands, etc. AND a loud speaker. You can play back YouTube Music, for example, without bluetooth earbuds.- It has Wi-Fi, so it can connect to your network instead of just your smartphone, which helps with downloading / streaming.- Temperature sensors which can aid better cycle tracking (ovulation timing, etc.)- The watch can consistently charge up an extra 55% in 30 minutes. Great for quick morning or evening routines.- If you have a Samsung Galaxy smartphone with wireless power sharing features, you can place this watch on the back of your smartphone to charge up if you don't have the watch charger with you and need a top up. If you do have the watch charger, you can plug it into any USB-C smartphone or tablet and pull charge there.- Unlike Fitbit Pay, there are more banking and credit card partners that work in both Google Wallet and Samsung Pay.- You can control playback on your smartphone with the watch.- GPS tracking for long walks and hiking provides a map, similar to Fitbit.Cons:Unfortunately, every Pro also has a con with this watch!- While there is fast charging, the battery life is 24 hours at best. Fitbit Versa or Sense users--be prepared! I turned on the Sleep tracking feature and lost 15% overnight! I charged the watch up to 100% at 6:30 am and by 9:00 pm I was at 34% (Wi-Fi, Location, Bluetooth and NFC were turned on, and I used NFC to set up several credit cards in Samsung Pay). If I turned most of these off, where's the appeal in a smartwatch?- I initially set up the Galaxy Watch 6 on the S22 Ultra, and it was so confusing. First, I needed to set up the watch in an app called Galaxy Wearable, then I needed to install Samsung Health to get fitness and wellness tracking, but finally I needed Samsung Health Monitor to use the ECG feature of the watch! Of course, each of these apps has its own T&C, privacy policy and profile set ups required!- Samsung Health is presumably made by a Korean company which uses the metric measuring system, but  I can only enter in glasses of water in U.S. 8 fluid ounce increments. I understand I purchased the watch in the U.S., but it's poorly thought out. They should turn on the ability to track food and water intake in metric units, like Fitbit.- The first time I did the ECG test, I had to place 2 fingers on the two different buttons. Three days later, I went to the ECG test again, and had to go through another policy agreement screen and then was told to only use 1 finger. No idea why this has changed. Some information about how it works vs. before would be interesting.- The watch cannot sync your sound settings with your Galaxy smartphone. If I am in a quiet space and put my phone on Silent, the watch cannot sync that setting. I have to manually go into the watch's control panel and put it on silent. If you use the Modes and Routines function of Samsung's One UI 5, you'll know how convenient it is to use Location or Wi-Fi connections to stipulate if your phone should be on silent! Connected to library wi-fi? = phone silent. At home = phone vibrate+sound.  If this watch could sync with the smartphone, it'd be truly ""smart.""- I feel that the Galaxy Watch 6 overstates my level of activity. It feels like I get a trophy just for puttering about. I walk around the office here and there for 2 minutes and by the time I get back to my desk to leave at the end of the day, it says I've reached my level of activity for the day?? Fitbit is more drill sergeant in that regard--I need to actually be moving for a consecutive amount of time and energy level for it to register as ""exercise/workout."" No freeby trophies.- I had to figure out through complex swipes how to stop my walking workout--it was not intuitive. The Fitbit uses a simple Flag as the goal icon to end the workout.- Although not fitness related, one of the big draws for this watch was the ability to use Google Wallet since some of my banks do not allow Fitbit Pay. Although Google Wallet works with manager major U.S. credit card issuers, and although one credit card in particular (Discover) could show up in my smartphone's Google Wallet, it just will NOT allow itself to be sent to the watch's Google Wallet app.This isn't Samsung's fault, I thought. So I decided to try out Samsung Pay. First, the app has to be installed and set up on the phone, which defaults to an annoying Quick Access gesture which is nearly identical to the swipe up to show all apps gesture. I tried multiple times to add the Discover card and several other credit cards, and finally was successful the 3rd time I tried to add. This is after getting multiple frozen screen prompts to Add to Samsung Pay.- The apps that are on the Watch and accompany it on the Samsung Galaxy smartphones, as ever, have English spelling mistakes littered throughout that I have never seen in my Apple Wallet or with Apple Pay. Language Localization should not be so poorly done.- Since I started with the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra but was transferring over to a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5, I decided to use the Watch > Settings > Transfer to New Phone. This app did not work. It would find the watch 6 when I had the Galaxy Wearable app open on the new Flip 5, then ask if I would agree to automatic updates (optional) - I selected NO - then next. Nothing happened. Blank white screen, and a failure notice on the watch. After 4 attempts and seeing 2 different Galaxy Watch 6 options appear in the new Flip 5's Galaxy Wearable app for syncing, I finally decided OK FINE I WILL DO THE OPTIONAL AUTOMATIC UPDATES -- still a blank white screen. I didn't want to erase and set up all over again, so I am still on the S22 Ultra. I do not know if this is a Google WearOS issue or a Samsung issue, but it was a sour experience.- Another USB-C to USB-C device with no charger brick or USB-A adapter. At the very least, a C to A adapter would have been nice and of very little weight to help bridge the hurdle to an all USB-C world.Beautiful, stylish smartwatch with a gorgeous screen is ruined by software quirks of Google WearOS and Samsung's fragmented health-related apps. Maybe progressive updates will fix this. Do you want to gamble $299 on a maybe?"
"I have had this watch for almost a month. The screen is gigantic! It definitely is better suited for a man than a woman's wrist if you think about the screen wrist ratio. I don't love that you have to activate waterlock and deactivate it manually if you're planning on getting your watch wet. The other thing i dislike is that I can't tap the screen to change/ control music from my watch if is in waterlock! All you can do is rotate through the tiles in your home screen but not access them.The battery lasts about 2.5 days with my frequency of use. I do have the screen set to only turn on when I am messing with my watch rather than ""display always on"" I usually charge it everyday while showering except the two days I traveled and forgot the charger. The battery was good until I came back but it took almost an hour to charge.I have used some of the stretches that are given through the fitness app and find it nice. Other than that I am amused by the watch telling me to get active and saying great you're moving again when I do. It is a good feature if you're trying to keep yourself from being to sedentary.The watch doesn't have it's own internet so you are dependent on using your phone. You can add wifi connection to it but I'm not sure it is super necessary.I'm sure there are better watches out there and this is a step up from the basic $50 watch that just tracks your steps."
"I bought this kind of on a whim. I'm usually an analog guy, but I was keen to use the fitness capabilities of a smart watch and this popped up on pre-order special. So, with that being said, my review is tailored toward the fitness aspect.TLDR: The watch is fine, but in the future I would simply get a heartrate monitor or a fitness-centric watch. Or, on the other end, I would get a top-of-the line smartwatch.1 - Samsung Health works well and provides a lot of data to your phone. It tracks your heart rate over the course of your workout and has a nice display of where your beats are in regards to various ""zones"" of cardiovascular exercise. At the end of your workout you can view your results and analyze a fair amount of data. That gets a plus from me.2 - Does not do well tracking ""active time"" when in the gym. On the watch there are three measurements taken throughout the day. They are steps, active time, and calories burned. If I spend 90 minutes lifting weights the watch does not track this as active time because ( I assume) of the rest periods in between sets.3 - Body fat analysis and tracking is hit and miss. I measure myself every day right after my morning pee and in 3 days I have gone from 13% - 7% - 14%. Obviously, it's best to track this stat over a longer period of time, but when the results vary so wildly from day to day I begin to question the reliability of the measurement. This is a neutral or neutral + for me. It's good to track over the long run, but I'm not sure the complete accuracy.3 - The standard issue strap, when worn how I normally wear a watch, comes unclipped way too often.  The release button sits right on my wrist bone which cause the thing to come unclipped. Instructions included say to wear it higher on your wrist/forearm, but the position to look at the watch becomes uncomfortable the higher up your wrist it goes not to mention how...uncool that looks. I would not take this in the ocean, a pool, or any sort of extreme sport. Even running results in an unclipped watch. FYI: Literally as I type this paragraph I tried adjusting its position on my wrist as I write this and it came unclipped. Big Negative.4 - Sleep tracking appears to work fine, but I'm not really sure. Neutral.5 - Watch face is customizable. I like to add pictures of my loved ones/pets on the home screen. That gets a plus.6 - Battery lasts probably 2 days? I usually charge it for an hour or two in the morning and it works fine. If you're on the go a lot or perhaps a little more hectic I can see battery life being an issue, but for me it's not really a big deal. Neutral.7 - Using apps on the watch itself is a little tricky because of the limited User Interface and the small screen. I usually start an app on my phone and let the watch record the data. Texting is pretty hard on the small screen, but it does come with a bunch of pre-loaded responses and the ability to send a voice note. If you plan on using this watch as a substitute for you phone I generally recommend against it.8 - Banking/tap-to-pay works fine, but I don't really use it that much.9 - Golfing apps like the Grint or 18 Birdies take too long to refresh on the watch. If you want to stand over your shot for 2+ minutes ever shot, then go for it. But I've given up on using this thing as a range-finder.Anyway, I would probably not buy this again. I would look for a highly tailored fitness watch."
"I just received my Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 and I'm already pretty annoyed and irritated. Nowhere on the product description page does it mention that the watch doesn't ship with a wall adapter for the USB-C charging cable. So out of the box, I can't charge my watch. Had I known the watch wouldn't come with a specialized adapter for charging, I would have ordered one when I ordered the watch. Now, I will have to wait 2 more days for the wall adapter to arrive before I can successfully charge the watch. I haven't evaluated any other features of the watch yet and I will update this review with more or less stars once I figure out how the watch functions. But out of the box, I'm annoyed I don't have all the gear I need to be successful. For a $250 product it feels lazy and cheap that Samsung is nickel and diming customers by neglecting to provide a wall adapter to charge the device AND omitting the fact the device doesn't ship with all necessary components, so you are surprised when you open the box and cannot charge your device. Unfortunate and honestly, unacceptable. It should be clear that the consumer needs to purchase additional components in order for the device to function. Most consumers are not clairvoyant, so I'm not sure how or why I was expected to know this information without it being clearly communicated on the item's description."
"I wanted to track my exercise, heart rate and O2 saturation. I chose this watch because it also gives an approximation of your EKG and estimates your BMI. And I still like the way it gives me a snapshot of my steps, exercise time, and calorie expenditure throughout the day. The readings seem to be fairly accurate. Mileage on the walks matches the AllTrails app within 0.05 mile. pO2 matches the fingertip oximeter at the doctor's office. I like being able to track my activity level through the day.But the negatives just about cancel out the positives. After 6 weeks, I'm still using the watch, but mostly so I won't feel like I'm throwing away the money I spent on it.When I'm taking a walk, a synthetic voice periodically interrupts my thoughts with statistics. I've tried various suggestions to silence this intrusive behavior, but no luck so far.When the watch was new, I tracked my water and food intake for a couple of weeks, and found that both seem to be within acceptable ranges. I stopped tracking them, and now the watch repeatedly urges me to continue this unnecessary tracking.I always feel rested in the morning, so I would have thought I was sleeping well. But I was curious about the sleep monitoring, so I tried wearing it to bed.  Not so, apparently. I should be consuming Samsung's free and paid pre-sleep materials to improve my sleep. If Samsung could provide a new bladder to replace the 74-year-old one that gets me up twice a night, I might try that, but since I always fall back to sleep right away, I really don't see it as a problem. At least that annoyance has an easy solution--just take off the watch at bedtime, and after a few mornings of ignored suggestions, it seems to decide you're in a dead sleep while it sits on your dresser.The most troublesome thing is that I have tried to disable calls, texts, emails, and music on the watch, but when I bump my arm against things, it seems to be activating my phone, even while the phone is locked and put away. I find apps open that I haven't used in months. Unwanted music blares out at inopportune times. Yesterday the phone called a family member I often text but rarely call. When I didn't respond to her ""hello,"" she was concerned that her 74-year-old loved one was having an emergency. I have tried multiple solutions, but without success.When this watch bites the dust, I think I'll be fine without it."
"I replaced my Fitbit with this Samsung watch.  It connects smoothly with my Samsung Untra 24 phone  and was easy to set up.  I like the graphics and most of the features.  Big draw back is the short life of the battery.  It needs to be charged every day which can be a pain.  I also have issues with the sleep monitoring, which is an important feature for me.  If you sleep more than 9 hours, even if it is 9 hours 1 minute, the sleep score goes down and I don't understand why.  Sometimes a person needs an extra long night of sleep.  Otherwise, it is a nice watch!"
"Like the watch and the features but band that comes with it is just long enough to go around my wrist.  Looking for a longer band but no luck so far.  (Bands on MANY of the smart watches tend to run short and almost like they are made for kids or women with small wrists.  Many of the replacement bands have the part with the holes made longer but the side with the buckle is still short.  This causes the watch to not stay centered on one's wrist.  Making longer bands requires BOTH parts of the band to be longer, not just the piece with the holes. )  (Customer support from company is poor.  Guessing it is from another country and support reps not familiar with English so cannot  understand questions."
"I wanted to love this watch, but it was just too large for my wrist. On the tightest setting it still moved around. I wanted the bigger one to use easier and I read the battery life is better, but it just didn't work for me. I highly suggest printing out the wrist measure tool because it was accurate & I ended up returning this one & getting the 40 mm. Hopefully I fall in love with that one."
"The watch itself is great but it kept falling off, with the strap disconnecting from the watch.  Turns out this is a known problem and is caused by a feature of the strap having a disconnect button on it that is meant to allow you to change straps easily.  Works too easily, and with just normal wearing will let the band detach from the watch.  If you search for posts about this, there's a lot out there talking about how people's watches were damaged by falling onto a hard surface and having a scratched watch face.  Mine has fallen off multiple times but no damage that I could see but it was probably a matter of time before I either scratched it or didn't notice it falling off and lost the watch, which would be an expensive problem.  I just ordered a wrist strap that uses the normal spring pins to hold it in place.  Samsung probably will fix this in the future but for now just be aware that it is an issue."
Does not connect with any use with I-phones.  Will only transfer data using the Samsung Health app with a Samsung phone.  The app does not work with other Android phones.  Pain in the posterior to pair and transfer data with Samsung phones.  The look and feel of the phone is great.  Rotating bezel is great for scrolling through menus.
"Bought this to replace a galaxy watch 3. First thing first, looks incredibly sleek & fits well. Notification alerts are just as good as they were on the watch 3. The main reason for the upgrade was to be able to use Google pay with my watch since the watch 3 is limited to just Samsung pay. While it worked well for a few days, I kept finding myself scrolling too far or not scrolling far enough using the bezel. It's touch now so there's no haptic feedback to let you know how far you're going. I tried to see if there was a setting to maybe have the watch vibrate when I scrolled, but nothing. I missed having a physical bezel. To me, losing the bezel wasn't worth having Google pay accessibility. Ended up returning."
"I really like my watch and all of the uses compared to my old fitbit. However, the battery life is terrible.  You're lucky if you get a day and a half out of the battery.  My fitbit would last me a week sometimes.  It's not convenient when this needs to be charged constantly."
"My FitBit Versa 3 died after 2 years so I was torn between the 4 or Samsung Watch. Ultimately i went with the watch. The watch has a nice screen and shows picture text messages. I like how I can reply to a text right from the face of the watch and read the entire message. It is also waterproof and can autotrack workouts. I went swimming on vacation and it picked up my swim exercise. The waterlock feature is nice because it keeps from accidental touches on the screen (on my fitbit i used to change so many things without knowing do to water touches). It also autotracked when I was walking on vacation. But . . .Man oh man is the battery life horrible. You can get about 36 hours out of a full charge and it takes almost 2 hours to charge, so it is not a rapid charge at all. Also, the charger is a USB-C end and doesn't come with a converter plug or anything. Super annoying because it limits charging capabilities on the run. Although you can plug into your phone and charge that way.I will use it until it dies and hopefully learn more features, but I don't know if I would purchase another one unless they manage to address the battery life/charging time."
"No Review, yet. Purchased 10/30/23. Was quite ill(Leukenia complications) so Watch6 Classic sat a while. Too long, turns out.Charged, set up late Nov. Had to use a bit before noticed screen went black in under 7seconds. In settings I have ""Always On"" checked. Tap to Wake Screen, Turn Bezel to Wake, and Shake Wrist to Wake ALL selected, NONE work? I have S23+, long time Samsung Customer. I DO KNOW how Settings work. Reset, Reset Settings, tried it all. Other thing I had to disable Screen Lock. Otherwise when I pressed Home Button(only way to Wake Screen and see Time Of Day) I had to enter PIN EVERY TIME for ScreenLock. Yes, did the whole Google Home reset. Tried adjusting Settings in Samsung Wearable App on 23+, in Watch, and on Lenove ideaPad, which paired easily. Nothing worked. Set screen timeout to 1min, show last App 30min, screen black under 7sec`s.Too late for Amazon return, have 3yr Device protect, not too worried. Then came Samsung Care+. Hours with Tech`s redoing things I had done. Trip, required by Samsung Care+Tech to VERIFY Defective after HOURS with them, to Geek Squad at Best Buy. Samsung Tech ASSURED me they(Geek`s) would have ""All information"" before I arrived. Kid was FANTASTIC, but had NO IDEA who, what, why I was there??? He looked, fiddled, tried it on. Screen black under 7sec`s. Its defective he said. Back to Samsung Care+. Best Buy NOT AUTHORIZED Samsung Tech`s? K, off to UBreakIFix some 38mile, 54mins one way. They have no idea who, what, why im there. I contact Samsung from their store, FINALLY get squared away. Two Tech`s test, fiddle, try on. Its Defective they said TO SAMSUNG. .Gona stop. Im getting pi$$ed just reviewing. Watch sent, came`back, same issue, sent back. Just Spoke with BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE Person to date. First told not being repaired. Im mad. He says it will be replaced. Then, seconds later,  ""Our Tech found NOTHING WRONG with your Watch6 Classic. However you can receive Refund, or a Replacement. Its your choice"".... So, Samsung comes through? I mean, IF I, Geek, 2 Tech`s UBreakIfixIt, Samsung Care+ Tech`s ALL say Defective, what gives?Ok, anyone else have this issue? I know how Always On isnt Always. But, turn Bezel, Tap Screen SHOULD Wake Watch, right?Looking for others similar issue? Anyone? Please? Do I risk Replacement and have same issue?Not too upset with Samsung. Unless their Tech is right and Watch6 Classic DOES FUNCTION like this?Thanks in Advance,Jim"
"After using Apple watch, wanted to go back to Android, but after using this watch for a few days, I regret my decision. The watch is quite laggy and missing several features compared to Apple watch."
"Cons:- Right off the bat, I realize I can't charge it without buying a new type of outlet.- Setup was so tedious. Needed to download more than one app and had to skip a step bc it wouldn't recognize my Chrome browser even though Chrome was on their list of compatible browsers.- Can't access one of the features due to the type of phone I have.- I charged it all night and after only 5 hours of use, it's not working properly. It vibrates once in a awhile, but the screen is completely black and won't come back on."
"Poor battery life, last about a day if I get message or play music for a hour, my girl has a fit bit and I hardly ever see her need to charge it, it like I need to plug it in over night to be ready for next day, then I don't have my sleep monitor. Poor samsung product doesn't make sense of short battery better off with a standard watch and a ring or bracelet just for sleep monitoring, highly disappointed after waiting years to finally get one. It's going to the kids"
"I wore a Gear3 for 5 years, now this Watch6 since it's release in August. There are MANY things to like!I am reviewing what I don't like, or maybe what I don't understand.*Sleep: One can NOT edit the amount of your sleep time, except to add to it?? I want to remove time watching tv or reading while sitting in bed prior to sleep. Instead, this time is grouped into your sleep record, likely misjudging your sleep quality or score. In their sleep settings you choose a sleep target amount of time, so if ""sleep"" is detected (by being in bed or sitting still) before or after this time to read or watch tv, it is not adjustable, not subtractable. One can ADD a sleep amount of time, but not subtract.  Instead, I have learned not to wear my Watch6 until my head is about to be on the pillow for sleep, and upon waking in the morning, I take it off immediately. Used to be able do edits on my Gear3 watch, but that still allows some editing.*A score is given to your sleep each day. If everything is within their prescribed ""normal"", my sleep score is only judged good or fair by their program. How they score your sleep is not transparent. Their algorithym needs help, or a more detailed explanation is needed.*At least one category was improved since the release: Deep sleep - recording it seems to have been fixed or improved within the first couple of weeks after release.*Stress: I don't find their ""stress"" measuring has any value. It seems I am stressful when standing or moving, but not stressed when sitting or still.*ECG Atrial Fib: Watch6 takes 1 hr of potential afib before warning you???requires you to perform manual ECG scans rather than running checks in the background. ??? Not clear.* No printing option for the day's record and graphs. I found an option that allows ""export"" in .csv format that seemed useless.*Oximeter records 70-100%.  A normal reading is above 90%. Mine seems to go low to 70%, implying sleep apnea, but I feel rested upon waking and all is good. I do not snore according to the watch and never have. Wearers were able to add a note to this record, but that option disappeared.Here’s hoping the company continues to fine-tune its accuracy, consider what wearers want. I stopped wearing the watch for a few weeks because the sleep  option seemed useless in too may ways. Last eve I wore it. Slept perfectly in all categories, but received a 66 out of 100. Fair score. Do all watches record Sleep so poorly???"
"This watch is nice, but coming from the Fitbit versa , I'm kind of disappointed. The battery life is not great, I do have to charge it every day, compared to the versa that I only had to charge once a week . I don't like that I have to use my phone to switch watch faces, and I'm not a huge fan of the app store for it. But the screen is big, so you can see everything, and it does have some nice features ."
This watch would be great but I can't use half the features because it won't register that I'm wearing it through my tattoos.
"I thought it would have a longer battery life. I have charge it everyday single day, not fond of doing that."
"First off, battery life on this watch is terrible. I mainly use it only for notifications and check the time. Battery barely last more than a day. I looked for solutions and turned off everything I could. I love the watch features and functions but the Battery is garbage. Idk if I'll even upgrade to a newer galaxy watch unless I know for certain the Battery will last atleast 2 days with standard use."
"Appear to only have a two-day battery charge.  If the battery can be extended, please let me know."
Would not stay connected. Texts didn't come thru half the time.Battery lasted less than 32hrs.
This watch is so light and laggy especially with its OS that constantly misses touches and unreliable.
"Pros:- Was very comfortable to wearCons:- The heart rate monitor was all over the place with readings. I was wearing the watch snug and it still wouldn't give readings that made sense and would regularly show a heart rate 20 beats per minute too high and would slowly go down to a number that made sense. Sometimes when in the gym it would say my heart rate was 130bpm while I was clearly no where near that. I put on my friend's apple watch when it was doing this one time and it gave me a reading of 90bpm which made way more sense and is consistent with readings I would take on my s10+ while at the gym.- The sleep tracking feature is garbage. The first night I tried using it, it refused to track my sleep because my phone was unlocked and the screen on. So this thing doesn't actually have any idea when you're sleeping, it just guesses based on your phone usage. The second night I made sure to lock my phone, and it recorded my sleep for two hours and then stopped when I got up to use the bathroom. The third night it started recording my sleep 2 hours after I actually fell asleep, and then once again stopped recording when I got up to use the bathroom and never started recording again after going back to sleep. I realized that even if I could get the tracking to work, I can't trust the charts it gives since it's so finicky and clearly the tech for sleep tracking just isn't there yet. It's basically just a gimmick as far as I can tell.- There's a setting on the watch that let's you turn off wrist detection, which theoretically should let you remove the watch without it affecting the functioning of the watch. Basically, it should work like a normal watch does, it just continues what it's doing when you take it off your wrist. However, that doesn't work. If you take your watch off your wrist while exercising with a workout active, it will immediately pause your timers and lock down the watch. So if you're someone that sometimes likes to take your watch off while exercising and still keep your timers going, this isn't going to work with this watch. Why put a setting in the watch and then override it.- If you add samsung pay details to the watch, you're forced to add a lock to the watch, which is incredibly finicky to use on the small screen. I mean, it makes sense why the added this, but it's something to consider; you will have to deal with the hassle of a tiny unlock pin pad or pattern if you want to use this with samsung pay.Overall, I just couldn't get this thing to do what I wanted it to do so I returned it. It's way too finicky."
Love the watch except for i have to charge it almost every day
"I got used to having to change it one a day. I take and off when I get home from work, to charge it. Then I put it back on before bed. The main reason I bought this was to track my sleep cycles.However, The battery drain is inconsistent. Some days it'll still have around 30 40% left when I get home from work.But there's been many many occasions where it's dead before noon. So it's barely lasting 15 hours.There's absolutely no reason for the watch to be dying this fast.  It doesn't get a lot of movement activity to wear out the battery, because I'm a truck driver. I'm sitting for 10 hours a day.Lately I've just been leaving at home and only using it to track my sleep cycles.Disappointing."
Battery don't last.  You have to recharge often.
"I've used the Samsung Galaxy Watch6 for about 21 days and am disappointed. Have you ever heard the expression ""garbage in-garbage-out""? The Samsung Galaxy Watch6 epitomizes the expression.  A lot of the advertised features would be great if they actually worked. But they don't.EKG: I bought this watch specifically to help me monitor my recently diagnosed AFib.  The EKG on this watch has never once given me an indication of AFib despite using it specifically when I'm having an episode.  Even when I know for certain I am having an AFib episode the EKG tells me ""poor reading"" or ""inconclusive"".  I found that the EKG will only give you a reading report if your heart is functioning perfectly.  That's useless information for a watch that claims to detect AFib.Body Composition: Good luck with this! First off, the reading from day-to-day vary so widely that one can only conclude the reading is ""garbage"".  One day my skeletal muscle is 78 lbs, the next day it's 70 lbs?  So I dropped 7 pounds of muscle in one day?  I don't think so.  All of this assumes you can even get a successful reading, which is not easy considering you have to raise your arms and touch two tiny buttons with two fingers while holding completely still. The device reads up to 70% complete then stops and tells you to remain still.  I AM STILL!  Okay, try again. The next try it fails at 70% complete, it tells you to move watch higher up on wrist. IT IS HIGHER UP ON WRIST!  This feature sounds great but in reality, it's stressful just trying to get a reading, and once you do, the reading is often ""garbage"".Sleep Score:  You know how health experts tell you to ""listen to your body"". Don't even think about listening to your body with this thing. If I decide to sleep 9 hours because my body tells me I need to, your ""sleep score"" will be reduced because you slept longer than the sleep coach recommends. If you're a detailed person, and you pay close attention to the algorithm they use to calculate your 'score"", you'll see it ""garbage"".Out of the Box:  The first instruction: CHARGE YOUR DEVICE. But get this...it does not come with a Type-C USB charging adapter, so the consumer (me) can't even begin setup.  Now I have to shop for a Type-C charging adapter.  How many watts should I get...what specs are required for the adapter?  I have no idea.  Furthermore, now I need to wait another three or four days to begin using as that's how long it will take for me to buy and receive the adapter. And if that's not ridiculous enough for you, the charging pad includes a whopping 32 inch cord...so don't plan on any flexibility on where you want to place the charger because your pretty much relegated to use a kitchen counter or bedside nightstand.  A consumer-friendly company would understand to provide everything necessary to use the product.  Charge $5 more and include the adapter!If you want to wear a toy on your wrist this product is for you.  I'll be returning mine."
"The battery life on this watch is shockingly short for a watch you rely on all the time. Very annoying that I have to charge the watch daily - and worse, it gives no indication that it is running low  and suddenly, I look at my watch and it is dead. Means you pretty much have to just charge it  whenever you are able to be near the charger, even if it is an inconvenient time to have to take your watch off. This is WITHOUT having the phone calls, texts or other phone related processes being used on the watch.My old smart watch (which I also don't use for calls or texts) can go 3-5  days on a single charge."
"The rotating bezel skips clicks and upon arrival the device had a bad battery, I was told that battery life varies with use until I insisted that it was inspected where the battery was tested, brand new it had a bad battery that only lasted a few hours"
"It has some nice bells and whistles, but even on battery saver mode it won't last a full 15 hours. Ultimately this watch can't do what I want, which is to track my activity levels to make sure I'm burning enough calories."
"After about 2 weeks, developed itchy rash on my wrist where the watch sensors were and couldn't wear it anymore. The wrist band is for smaller people and does not allow you to move the watch up your arm for two tests.  Did not know until I purchased it that to do the ecg test you have to put the watch several inches up your arm for best results. Not possible with the tiny watchband provided. Also, you have to hold your finger against 1 button to get the reading and most days it would take 6 or more tries to get a reading as it kept saying don't move. I never moved but watch thought I did.  It would have been nice to know ahead of time how this test is done rather than having the watch tell me. One day I bumped my hand against the desk and the watch told me it detected a fall and it was going to call 911.  I kept pushing the screen where it said ""Its not a fall"" but nothing  happened. Finally, about 5 seconds from the watch calling 911, it cancelled the call. That's when I decided I need to return the watch."
It's a fine basic smart watch - surely just as good as the last 3 I've owned. Disappointed in the cost cutting resulting in a silicone band and needing to buy yet another charging block. (who has an extra USB-c block sitting around?)
Great watch... I feel it is pretty accurate on stats.  The biggest down side is battery life. It last maybe 3 days. Other then battery I would give a 4.5 Star.
"The band releaee on this is a terrible design. The release mechanism is a push button and if I tighten the watch to the third notch (comfortable), it pops the latch out when I turn my wrist. I have to wear it in the second hole and it is too loose.Otherwise the watch is working fine. I like the larger face of the watch as was the case with my gear 3 that I had to upgrade because my new phone didn't support that watch. Battery life is good. I only have to charge it every 3 or 4 days."
The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I love the watch the way it looks and everything it does it goes with my Samsung phone perfectly but the battery is trash it sucks because it's an awesome awesome watch it's just I wish they would have figured out something with the battery life other than that I have no complaints I was going to upgrade it and get the seven cuz I spent a lot of money on this watch but I don't want to buy another one with the battery on this I don't think that you should have to charge your watch every single day it's very agitating
I absolutely love the functions. The battery life is terrible. It has to be charged every other day. My fitbit went 6 days. Really wish they had a better battery.
"I'd give it 5 stars if the battery life was better along with the heart rate sensor, and stress sensor."
"I am all in favor of this wrist watch however my wrist is not very happy about the watchband.  Why do I have to immediately go out and try to purchase a third party XL band that don't exist.  Majority of the 3rd party vendors have been ""Out of Stock"" or ""Unavailable"" or ""Discontinued.""  The stock watch band is in hole number one and is still tight on my wrist.  I see pictures of men's wrists everywhere on the web but when clicking through to the product I find that these are very tiny men who might be Oompa Loompas.  Samsung allow us to select longer wristbands!!03/06/24 Follow up:  I downgraded to a 2-star because now I am trying to resolve an issue with Samsung because the watch has now twice created a burn spot on my wrist.  The first time I experienced a lump on my wrist under the watch area.  The lump looked like a mosquito bite and I shrugged it off as so.  It disappeared in about 2 days.  The second time the lump was more distinct and there were 4-5 small heat blisters on top of the lump.  I applied Neosporin and over a week the area healed up but now left a brown mole sized mark.  I will be visiting my skin doctor to see if it is cancerous.  I also have a ticket in with Samsung repair in order to see if the watch is faulty.  My online research has pointed to various Community Boards discussing this issue including Samsung Community UK which is hosted by Samsung.  This is where I began my research.  I am now connected with Samsung technical support USA and will be shipping my watch back to them for a check up.  More to come."
I bought this but there is no number to use to connect to a phone service.  Only reason for return
"steps and stress seem inaccurate. battery less than 30 hours, disappointed and will return.."
"This is a great watch format with plenty of potential, but it is just challenging at best to utilize well. the menu on the watch is challenging to navigate. For example, if you are tracking a workout, and pull up the watch face to see the time, there isn't an easy way to navigate back to the workout; you have to go in and basically restart the workout, to view your progress.The biggest disappointment is the fact that the GPS function has a difficult time to sync up an exercise EVERY TIME! I had noticed that my track usually started quite a ways from my actual starting point, so I decided to test this out. I took my Samsung watch and my Garmin watch out on the same run, starting them both from the house, and confirmed that the Samsung watch did not begin tracking for an entire half a mile of the run, or a third of the entire distance covered (see photo). This is definitely a deal breaker for me."
Laggs a bit and sometimes dies for no reason but gets the job done.
"I like the watch, but I have charge every 3 days."
This watch runs out of battery after 3 days.  My old Samsung watch battery lasted more than a week.  This new Samsung Smart watch6 needs to be charged so often that I need my charger with me all the time.Not too happy.
"Bought the Active Watch 6 to replace my Active Watch 2 that totally died after 4 years and 6 months. Samsung couldn't fix. Bought the Active Watch 6 and it has been a total nightmare. Before I got it, I watched several videos to make sure I would set it up correctly and be familiar with all of the features. Turns out, I think it would take a Phd in computer science to get to work as needed. I'm not a tech expert, but I was able to set up the Active 2 quickly and customize it. The 6 is beyond difficult and totally frustrating.The Wearable app is just as bad and confusing.  If you need a complicated, feature loaded, challenge get this Active Watch 6. If just a basic smartwatch with easy set up that doesn't cause frustration is all you need, move on to another brand. For now I have been able to get most of what I need on the watch but it is far from what I had on the Active Watch 2. I could send it back but hopefully it will last at least as long as the first one which is probably longer than most of the cheaper brands.UPDATE:  Dec. 11, 2024. I still miss my old Active Watch 2. What I did figure out was that after I received this Active Watch 6, I should have let it set itself up then go back 24 hours later and customize the settings.  Trying to set it up and customizing it right then was a major headache and a waste of my time. So finally I just reset the watch back to factory and started over again and just let it go and agreed to all the settings. Next day, I went in and started slowly changing or turning off what I needed to. Not wanting to stress the watch out, I did do all of this in two sessions one day apart. The watch is a battery hog even with most of the features turned off. After a lot of work and frustration, it is finally set up to my preferences...mostly. If this watch lasts as long as my Active 2 did...fine...but no matter when it bites the dust, this is the last Samsung Galaxy Active watch I will ever own."
"I replaced a iWatch with this smart watch.  I like the look and have mastered the gadgetry.  However, the sleep is inaccurate.  The swim is not as detailed as the iWatch and I miss not knowing the individual lap time."
"This review will eventually need to be updated, but as of 1/4/24, the Galaxy Wear app on my Pixel 7 is unable to pair with my Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, which means the watch is unusable. Would nit recommend buying until Samsung unforks their software so that you can use their hardware. I'm beyond the return window, so I will have to ride it out.Update in case anyone stumbles across this. To fix Samsung's problem, you need to unpair your watch, uninstall every Galaxy Watch related app on your phone, factory reset the watch and then pair it back to your phone. Of special note is you won't find every app that needs to be uninstalled in your app drawer. You have to go into Settings and look for the Galaxy Watch Plugin to uninstall that, as well. Then, once you've connected everything back up, reboot your phone one more time and it should be working, again.Hopefully, this is a one off problem, but it really soured me on what I thought was a pretty solid device. The fact that this kicked off on Jan 1, 2024 and Samsung hadn't officially acknowledged it by Jan 4th, even, was frustrating. I had to dig through reddit posts and user forums to figure it out."
"Let me introduce you to the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 (44mm), the overpriced, overhyped, and utterly useless chunk of tech that’s currently holding the record for “fastest route to buyer’s remorse.” I was an early adopter, which means I paid a premium to be Samsung’s guinea pig. And boy, did I get roasted.First, the blood pressure sensor. It’s like trying to get a cat to walk on a leash—stubborn, unpredictable, and absolutely infuriating. After wasting two days of my life scouring the depths of the internet, I finally got it to work. Victory, right? Wrong. Because next came the battery life—lasting about as long as a New Year’s resolution. But I swallowed that bitter pill and convinced myself that daily charging was a small price to pay for “cutting-edge” tech. Silly me.I babied this watch. I bought it cases, dressed it up in different wristbands like it was a damn runway model, and kept it pristine. Not a scratch, not a scuff. And then, just a month before the warranty was up, this piece of junk DIES. Completely. I figured, “Hey, maybe it didn’t like the occasional shower I took with it. But it’s water-resistant, right?” WRONG AGAIN.After jumping through hoops to get an appointment at a Samsung store (which, by the way, is harder to get into than Fort Knox), I waited two weeks only to be told it was water damage and—SURPRISE!—the warranty wouldn’t cover it. They actually had the nerve to hand me back my $350 hunk of garbage with a straight face.This isn’t the first time Samsung has screwed me over. My Samsung Fold 3? Yeah, the inside screen cracked like a fortune cookie after just a few months, and guess what? The warranty didn’t cover that either. I should’ve learned my lesson, but no, I had to go and trust Samsung one more time. Like a fool.Well, no more. I’ve officially broken up with Samsung, and it feels so damn good. I’ve moved on to a Garmin Instinct Solar 2—no fancy, gimmicky nonsense, just a reliable watch that actually works. It’s not trying to be the life of the party; it’s just there when you need it. Imagine that!So, if you’re considering buying the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6, let me save you the trouble: Don’t. Unless you enjoy burning money and smashing your head against a wall, in which case, this watch is perfect for you. Good riddance, Samsung. It’s been real, but I’m out."
"The battery life on this watch sucks. I charge it overnight, and it needs to be charged again by the end of the day. I sleep with it on and it needs to be charged midday. I don't get it. The worst watch battery life ever! I bought it to replace my Huawei watch because it's not the best at keeping up with my step count. It's not terrible, but since I owned a Samsung watch 2 previously, and it was pretty good, I thought I would try this one. Nope. I can go 3 to 4 days without charging my Huawei watch, but this one is right here. Nope! Not worth it."
"The watch needs to be charged every other day. It takes 2+ minutes to load from a cold start, so if you forget and let the battery drain, it's a small inconvenience."
"Great quality of course and  beautiful design,  only problem was that I had gone through a whole habit hole trying to figure out why it would not pair to my completly updated samsung s23, had gotten a refund on it and bought another one  and that one would not work either,  ended up giving to my friend who so far loves it and connects well with his,  a good buy but please be sure your phone will allow it to connect! Service was helpful the best they could be as well and very considerate and kind."
"Easy to set-up, nice watch. I would have given 5 stars except you have to charge it every day, and it takes just shy of 2 hours to recharge. If I charge it at night, I lose sleep data. If I charge it during the day, my chances of walking off and leaving it at home are very good. My old Fitbit held a charge for a minimum of 2 days and recharged in 35 minutes. So frustrating. It's a nice watch with a big inconvenience!"
"Description says Gold, but it's silver. I would've bought black instead. Overall it's a decent watch"
"Just received it yesterday.  Beautiful.  If only I could figure out how to attach the watch band!  The instructions are so small that I needed a magnifying glass and STILL couldn't get it to attach.  Chipped my brand new nail polish too.  If I can't attach the band by myself by the end of tomorrow, it's going back.  Why can't the band be attached???????  Why do the instructions have to be so dang small????  Why can't instructions be more than just an illegable picture?????  For the price?  Do better Samsung!!!"
"How is my 4 year old smart watch better than this 3 generations newer watch?First, I will start with the pros:- The screen resolution is noticeably sharper.- There are two new censors, but only one is worthwhile, the BMI scanner. Not sure how accurate it is though. The body temp gauge doesn't have any benefit for men, but can track mensuration for women.... i think.- It charges very quickly, less than an hour.Cons- First, the bezel doesn't work as well as the 3, nor the touch screen. Many times when you turn the bezel, it doesn't match up to the motion of the screen. The bezel was my favorite feature on the 3.- The battery life. This 1 month old watch has less battery life than my 4 year old watch. Currently the 6 classic last's just under two days with all of the same settings.- There are some new software features, but I don't understand why they couldnt just update the 3 with these. They're not that great anyways. The sleep coach just tells you to meditate before bed time.- The pedometer doesn't seem to count as many steps. I used to hit 10,000 every day, now I hit that maybe once every few weeks, and that's with the 1 mile I run 4 days a week.It seems that Samsung just cashed out on this one. 3 generations newer, and it's not as good. That sucks."
"I love all the apps it can have on it. Love the step counter, weather app etc. The only bad thing so far, is that the battery life last maybe 2 days if you don't use it much at all. It could also do with more than 16gb of space, since after updates you're only left with 5gb for apps and whatnot."
"Looks nice and great features but dang....only 24 hrs of battery life? My active lasted days without charging. Every single night I have to charge this watch...I really really regret this purchase. They can really do better. For a company with so much technology this is what they release to customers? Really?They really think this is value for money? Do they even quality tests these products before release? Come on now. StuupseeeeUPDATEI only purchased this watch in MARCH 2024 and for my safety.....will NEVER EVER wear it again!!! This watch injured me. I finished work as as usual I remove my watch. Next thing I know my wrist is on fire with intense itching that kept getting worse and worse. I applied alcohol and lots of Benadryl anti-itch to try and calm the itching down.Next thing I notice my wrist starting swelling. It swelled to the EXACT out line  that matches the back if the watch. Look at my pics. It was one big inflamed lump on my wrist. So darn scary!! Finally the anti-itch kicked in.By the morning, the swelling subsided BUT I was now left with this weird red rashy burn looking thing in-place of the swelling. Look closely, it matches the smaller circular plate to the back of the watch where that sensor is positioned.  That red area I could not touch for a few days or the itching would start. I've been using ointment to help with healing.Look..I wore an older Samsung active for three years. No issues. I upgrade to this watch and it injured me. Searched online to see if its only me. IT'S NOT!!! There are other people experiencing this and some are worse!! There are many complaints to Samsung with pics. Check for yourself. Had I known I would have NEVER EVER EVER purchased this watch. How could I have known to search for Samsung Galaxy swelling and burn injuries??!!!I have no idea what these companies are using to make their products but its nothing good!!! We as consumers need to be sooo careful what we buy today.I really WANT MY HARD EARNED MONEY BACK!!!.What reasonable vendor would think this is acceptable? I cannot use this watch. All this money spent and I cannot use it.!!!Amazon's NON customer service team is taking me in circles. With all the photos I provided they are stone walling and keep asking for evidence. I am very very very disappointed!!!! I see no example of the ""Customer Obsession"" they claim to hold dear as a ""Leadership Principle"".  Not an ounce of it!!!I'm SOOOO DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!....Out of my money...out of a new watch!!!! Hoping this weird burn mark  on my wrist gets no worse!!!!Further Update July 22nd 2024Finally finallyyyy reached a satisfactory resolution."
"I just bought this watch. I wanted it for the heart monitor and a few of the other health apps.  First day I charged the watch up to 100% set it up. Played around with the various options, via my phone. By that evening the battery was dead. Next day I wore it from late morning until around 1 AM. The battery was dead. How do you use a sleep app if it's off? Samsung website has ideas on how to save the battery all of them involve shutting off apps. I've taken it out of always on, I have to tap it to read the time. It is not monitoring anything while off. I've turned off all the notifications, basically turned off anything I could that was not the apps I needed. I tried to contact help on the website. I waited about ten minutes before I had to go.  I don't know if this is a design failure, why build a smartphone that only works with minimal apps on? Or if this is just my battery. Oh it has a find my watch app. If the watch is off, it can not be found. So if I misplace it I've got only a few minutes to find it. Useless. If you see more reviews about this, don't buy."
"Addendum: Please can you put real people in the videos and tips you offer? A toothpick thincgi enhanced young boy trying to give me tips on exercising is just silly. He doesn't need fitness coaching he needs to just enjoy his childhood and maybe eat more! Another overpriced gadget. It is kinda neat to use to monitor heart and saturation info. The ecg is pretty much for show, it only reads one lead, and so as indicated can't be used to gather any pertinent health info. The workout function is abysmal. It doesn't detect my main thing-walking- very well at all. If you manually turn on walking workout it constantly says ""workout paused"" ""work out resumed"". You can't even lift your arm for half a second to scratch your nose or check your mileage without it pausing. (I guess I have a rare unusual talent that I can walk, chew gum and look at my watch at the same time.) The auto tracking is unreliable. My trusty old analog brunton pedometer ($24) accurately ticked off a half a mile compared the the bells and whistles galore g6 which said I walked 0.1 mile (because it kept pausing). Also you can't manually input a workout on the app. The watch drove me insane during my walk with 10 bazillion ""workout paused"" notices (In the most annoying female voice I've ever heard) but conversely you can set it for swimming and lay it on the counter and it will cheerfully and silently track your nonexistant wrist during your nonexistant swim. The app is not terrible. The food journal is very cumbersome. Ok. For the record spaghetti squash and other fruits/veggies etc do not need to be branded! Presh Express and Trader Moes squash have the same calories! I'm not sorry I bought it- the bells and whistles are entertaining at least. But for serious walking/hiking the G6  getting turned off and my trusty no nonsense, no batteries, hassle free analog pedometer is going in it's place.It is not that smart either. I deleted the medications because the alarm kept waking me up. I sleep at different times due to my job. I deleted the period tracker because heaven forbid you are irregular. The poor dumb watch just starts randomly telling me my period will start in 2 days. Any more annoying stuff getting deleted and I'll be able to go back to my old wind up watch!"
I purchased this watch because my old Samsung watch was not working properly. My old watch a charge would last almost two full days. This watch my charge only lasts barely one full day.  I'm very disappointed in this fact. I adored my old watch and wish I could have that battery life with this new one.
"Connects seamlessly with my galaxy S24. Love the features on the watch, and have been using it everyday. The biggest problems are with the battery life which sometimes doesn't last all day even when I don't use the watch. The battery wouldn't charge no matter what I tried. Had to restart the watch for it to start charging. I would recommend purchasing the watch, but lookout for potential tech problems."
I do not like that the battery life is low.  For me this watch has not held a charge.  It is less than 18 hour.  It has a sleep mode which I was hoping to us but then I can charge it.  This is a must charge every night watch..
"I bought this watch because my cardiologist recommended I get a watch that can notify me of arrhythmias. I own a Google Pixel phone and I did not know that function on the watch would not work my phone. I figured an android device should work with another android device. But no, Samsung wants you to own a Samsung phone to use that important medical feature and I have no desire to own a Samsung phone. At the time I purchased the watch the listing indicated I would be charged a restocking fee if I returned the watch. I decided to just keep the watch because the restocking fee was a hefty amount. Now, 7 months later, the same listing states there's a 30 day refund/replacement with no restocking fee mentioned.In general, it really is a nice watch. There are many useful fuctions to choose and you can change its face on a whim to match your look or mood. There also are many options available for watch bands for this watch."
"There's always a learning curve with a new device, but this one wasn't too bad. The only problem is that the battery only lasts about a day and a half, so it's difficult when your goal is steps and checking sleeping, because you are always charging it."
"Traded my Galaxy Frontier 3 watch for this because the old watch's app store support was waning.The gorgeous screen and the app store / watch faces selection are strong.The step counter is massively inaccurate compared to the Apple Watch and FitBit—it counts far more steps than I've taken. A 12.5-mile hike shows at around 15 miles.  And the reminders are a joke. Four hours into a seven-hour hike, it will say, ""You've been walking 10 minutes!""  And when I've sat at my desk for hours and reached up to scratch my head, it says, 'Great!  Keep up the activity""I'm so glad Smarthings is supported. I cannot believe Samsung just stopped supporting it in the old Samsung watch store—it's their own ecosystem."
This model of smartwatch (Samsung Galaxy 6 40mm) does not have the blood pressure nor thermometer feature. I've seen YouTube videos showing those features should be available on this model. The batter is not good and the most you can get with Bluetooth on is 30 hrs.
"Bought this to replace my Galaxy 4 Bluetooth watch. If you want to use Samsung Health with any other android phone, do NOT get any Samsung watch. Samsung health and pay will not work! Spent days in the phone with Samsung support."
"When buting the item watch tge ad said that the purchase included a charger. However, it dies not include a Type C charger to attach it to the wall outlet. The connector dies not fit a USB Port."
I really needed a watch before I went back to work for emails and texts because I work in a school and don't want my phone going off and I also need it for the alarms to wake me up in the morning. I was really hoping to love this because I only have samsung phones and tablets and always have but the battery does not last long on it at all. This is the first samsung watch I've ever bought. I need to sleep with it on for the alarms to wake me up but even when I go to bed with a fully charged battery it has about 55 percent left in the morning so then I have to charge it again while I'm getting ready for work because I need it to use and to last for the day. Then when I get home I have to charge it again before I go to bed or it won't last through the night. I was really hoping it would work out great so I wouldn't have to go through the process of returning it. I really wasn't happy with Amazon when I bought this because I got it during the prime day sale and I really wanted the 44mm because it's getting harder for me to see so I need a larger screen. Well the 40mm when on sale the 16th and it was for about 160 so I got it. But then on the 17th the 44mm went on sale for 190.00 and I was so mad that I already spent my money on the 40mm. I called Amazon to see if I could exchange it and get the 44mm for 190.00 but they wouldn't work with me because it would of been after the sale was over since I would have to go through the process of returning mine and then waiting for the refund. I'm really disappointed in this whole thing. Too bad the battery doesn't last long. This is all such a big hassle.
"This is my fourth and final Samsung wristwatch. The batteries just don't last very long. Eventually, they get so bad the battery has to be replaced, which is almost impossible. They should design it so that the batteries can slide into the side of the watch so that you don't have to disassemble it. My first watch is in pieces now.  The tiny screw threads stripped out after a few battery swaps. The batteries here on Amazon are not factory grades. They seem like reject batteries. Don't buy a refurbished watch. The batteries are already half dead before you receive it. Aside from the rotten batteries, I like the watch.I wish I could have a watch that's always on. I hate to have to shake my wrist to make the display turn on. Frequently, I have to press one of the side buttons to make the display come on. It's like the red LED watches from Texas Instruments in the early 1970s. I had to press the side button to see what time it was. Now it's over fifty years later and I still have to press a button to see what time it is."
I love that this watch connects to my phone. Samsung is innovative in a lot of things but the battery life is not one of them. At max the battery last for 2 days
"This is a piece of junk in terms of battery... It doesnt charge fast enough to take it out, charge it and put it back on to track my sleep. It defeats the purpose. I would not buy it again if I had the chance. Mine does not last a day. I mean, I can turn off many features to make it last longer BUT AGAIN! It defeats the purpose to have so many features if you can barely use them if you will fear to be stranded without battery. I have looked online and it appears to be a software issue that surprisingly Samsung hasn't figured it out. So mad I can't return it anymore because the return window expired (return window really small to really have an opinion on the product."
The only reason I returned this was because it is not compatible with Alexa.Other than that it is a great watch
"Loved the watch but I had to unfortunately return it because I could not independently use the watch apart from my A54 android phone with the carrier I have presently. My goal was to leave the phone at home if needed and be able to use the watch as a separate device. It turns out my carrier does not allow watches to work independently of the phone. The major carriers with dedicated networks allow watches to work separate and apart from the phone. So in 5 more months, I will be switching to another carrier. I am on a month to month plan.Edit: Today is 10/27/23. I started the return process with Amazon on 10/08/2023. Packed up the item and dropped off at the UPS store in my town. UPS verified in route to Amazon with return receipt. Amazon received the item on 10/16/2023. As of today, 10/27/2023, Amazon has not processed the refund yet. I conveniently purchased this item through Affirm. Meanwhile, Affirm is demanding payment on an item I no longer have, has restricted my account because Amazon did not properly inspect my package when they opened it despite the packing slip and item clearly inside. So it appears they threw my item in a discarded bin! Amazon supervisor said the refund may not be issued until mid November because with the new refund policy (15-30 days) and the return center it went to. In this case, the item has to be hand scanned instead of auto scanned, which takes longer. Not a very efficient way of handling returns. I returned another version of the same watch less than a month earlier because it was the wrong version. It was processed and refunded immediately upon receipt and Affirm got their money from Amazon. So because of the unreasonable delay in receipt and processing of my refund,  Affirm has restricted my account due to non payment of this returned item I no longer have. I am downgrading my rating on this item to poor because of the way my refund has not been handled with no clear reason why and no sense of urgency on the part of Amazon to resolve it expeditiously. Buy Samsung high ticket items directly through the manufacturer not a third party like Amazon. From a very disappointed and unsatisfied customer."
"UPDATE: Worst sleep tracker ever. Pokemon Sleep is more accurate. It says I fell asleep last night roughly 4 hours before I actually did. I have messages sent to people at the exact time I supposedly fell asleep. I wasn't even lying down.Original:I got this watch to replace a Fitbit that lasted me ~5 years because the battery was starting to go and it was dying too quickly.Well, this thing has worse battery life than my 5 year old Fitbit. It doesn't even last 48 hours. If I don't charge it every single day, it dies. I hate it.I had to turn off ""touch screen to turn on"" because it's so sensitive, it would wake up the screen constantly because of stupid things like the watch brushing against my leg.The sleep tracker isn't accurate, and the main value it gives you isn't even how long you were asleep... There's a second ""actual sleep time"" value you have to open the app and navigate to to see. Why would I want how long I was lying in bed for instead of the time I was actually asleep????It is significantly more comfortable than my old Fitbit, but that's pretty much the only thing it's got going for it. The battery life drives me nuts, I don't understand how this stupid thing dies so quickly even with so many features disabled. It's also way more prone to scratching -- the metal / around the screen, etc, for my Fitbit never took any damage in 5+ years, whereas this thing already has a noticable ding on the aluminum...It also takes way more time and effort to set up. I'm still struggling to get the notifications and other settings how I want them. There's too many screens to navigate through, too many ""need to change this from the phone app""/""change this from your watch"" things, and half the basic settings are under ""advanced"" settings for some reason.I would be returning it if I hadn't gotten rid of the stupid box. This thing is NOT worth the money it costs."
The product is very good but for some idiotic reason they do not supply the charger. It is optional. It is not a standard usb charger but a type c charger. For what this watch costs the least they could do is give you a charger. The watch was useless out of the package and I had to run to the store which is quite a bit away just to get the watch to function. Won't be buying another watch from them
Lasts maybe a day and a half charge. Kinda disappointed when my husband's watch is 3-4 day charge.
I changed the cover and band and I like it but battery life sucks..doesn't even last 2 days
"Ipurchased this watch despite reading the reviewed about the poor battery life. I loved the watch and it's interface. It had all the features that I wanted. After using it for about a week, I realized that I could not keep it. The battery had to be charged every day! This watch is fine if you turn off the notifications but if you need the watch to be productive, this ain't it. Unfortunately I had to return it. It was disappointing."
"Have had Fitbits for years. Styling wise and ergonomics they haven't kept up. But their stuff works, they don't nickel and dime you with what I'll call ""paid plugins"" to get your full sleep metrics etc. Basically, a freemium business model. And the actual tech sucks. It does read my steps at close to what appears right but doesn't get my oxygen reliablly, heart rate or sleep.I wi be buying another fitbit and putting this in the drawer."
"I've owned many smart watches.  I usually buy much cheaper brands/models but really wanted a Galaxy, so when my last cheapo watch stopped charging after 2yrs, I spent the extra money on this one.  I love the large display, and many of the features my other watches didn't have.  However,  that's all useless when I can't keep the dang thing connected to my phone! If I walk into the next room of my house, get up from my desk at work and walk to another room, run back into the house from my vehicle to grab something I forgot,  without my phone it disconnects. That wouldn't be such a big deal if it would reconnect when back in range, but it won't.  Even when I manually go into the Galaxy Wearable app to Reconnect,  it just spins forever trying, then tells me ""can't connect"". I have to shut down the watch and restart to connect again.  Sooooo annoying!! I might as well have my phone strapped to my other wrist because I can never leave my phone even for a few steps! If I were still in the return window I would definitely return this useless thing.  I'm Type 1 diabetic and wear a continuous blood glucose monitor. My watch is very important to me because WHEN CONNECTED I can always see my blood sugar readings on my watch.  I've only had this watch for 4 months.  I bought all the accessories for it,  including a watch band that also serves as a medical alert bracelet.  Replacing the watch is more than just the cost of the actual watch.  I'm so disappointed in this thing.  I'll just try to do better to always keep my phone in a pocket and restart it when I forget until I can stomach dropping money on a new watch.  Definitely NOT a Samsung!"
Watch features are great but the battery only lasts about 24 hours.
"bought it few days ago. finding it good.  could connect my hearing aids too to it.I registered it with Samsung product registration.but I try buying Samsung Care+ warranty , I put my Serial number but it says invalid serial number. Chat with Samsung sales, says though bought in Amazon in USA yet it might be a third party sold and hence might not be US version and Samsung Care+ is not available.but I look back at Amazon site it says;US versionSold-by AmazonShipped by AmazonI am confused. anyone can solve this riddle ? appreciate!!"
"A lot of good features, easy to read, good stats. BUT battery life is bad. sometimes needs to be charged during day.  And ever since I downloaded 3 apps for Samsung watch, it has been shortening my phone battery a lot as well (although somewhat mitigated by using it's battery saver feature). I am seriously considering returning it."
"It may have strong rating but there are some mind-boggling bugs that have been around for all generations of the watch and Samsung ignores all user feedback.Sleep tracking inexplicably ignores some sleep for no reason. Lots of complaints, no fixesBrain dead decision: Fluid tracking can only be incremented in 8 1/2 oz steps. No, really, there is no way to change it despite years of feedback. This is incompetent program design pure and simple.There are others that drive people nuts too, concerning exercise tracking. I wish I had returned within the warranty period, but I didn't really test those features until it was too late."
Came from a Versa4. This does a lot more. Two major faults! Very poor battery life and its near impossible to change the bands.  I alsi wish it was a usb connection and not a C type to charge it. I cant say I'd recommend it or not. You have to pick what works for you.  Not fully satisfied.
"The watch has some great features, but those features drain the battery. Even turning many features of, I have to charge it at least twice a day if I wear it to track sleep. Nice watch, but considering going back to a Fitbit so I'm not tied to a charger."
"Bought this to track my workouts. Specifically my daily run, but thought it would be useful for other workouts as well. Definitely was I wrong.If you're on a run, even if you're keeping an even pace, it will ask you multiple times per workout if you are finished with your exercise. I run daily with my dogs,  3.2 mi. Best case scenario I get notified three times that the watch ""seems like I finished my workout, would I like to resume or end "" worst case scenario it will ask you this 10 to 15 times all within a 30 to 35 minute span. Even if you keep an exact pace it doesn't matter.For example I will run 3.2 mi in the morning takes me about 30 minutes a pace of about 10 minutes a mile, without stopping, pausing, anything at all, it will randomly ask that notification, no rhyme or reason. It's extremely frustrating.I've been a lifelong Samsung supporter, I've always had everything Samsung, and this is the first item that I absolutely would never buy again. I contacted customer support online and they told me they didn't know what was wrong with my watch and to bring it into a store, I went into a store, they also said they didn't know what was wrong and they tried a hard reset on the watch, which did nothing.A quick Google search will let you know that this is an issue that Samsung has known about for at least a year, and is doing nothing to fix. At least just give me the option to turn that setting off. Very frustrating. Do not recommendEdited to add: if you get this notification the watch completely stops recording all data. So if you don't notice it for a while it won't record distance, steps, heart rate, workout time, or anything."
"After 2 weeks use, I am thinking of returning. I have to recharge 3x a day with location settings precise set to off, display always on set to off, etc. but auto tracking for walk cycle, on. It looses 35% charge overnight. This will not work for bike trips or camping. This may just be a defective unit or an app running in the background that I can not find.I was hoping this would be a significant upgrade to my Garmin 645, especially for sleep tracking w O2 sensing etc for my sleep apnea. It does gives me more sleep data but the O2 sensor and snoring data is a bit buggy. Nice but not worth the $$ for sleep yet.Set up was not too difficult but it was hard to go back and correct settings once set.Watch faces choices are so so. A bit limited but will grow I'm sure. I like traditional analog with date, data - steps, heart rate.The 43 mm size is surprisingly easy to read. Perfect.UI is so so. Good thing the rotating bezel makes navigating it easier. Exercise goals are easy to set up and monitor but daily summary totals are not available (Just monthly).. For example, auto cycle recording may break my ride up up into 5 segments but I can't find a total mileage for the day. annoying. I may be missing something but I have searched the manual and online too many hours.Hoping  software updates will improve UI ease of use.Overall a beautiful watch, with crystal clear bright sharp display.  Mine does not live up to some of the glowing tech trade reviews, Also as stated this may be a defective unit. Will try to update if I find a fix other than turning on max power saving mode which defeats the purpose for me for tracking exercise goals etc."
"They updated the watch software and the two most important features stopped working; afib alert, and the sleep app. Those are the two features I bought this watch for. I spent an entire day trying to get tech support - the only thing available was a chat bot - that did not know the product - it kept telling me to press buttons that did not exist. Finally, it asked me to install a remote manager, which I did. The bot then went through a bunch of hoops on my watch. Finally, it said the watch was fixed, and told me I could test it out later today. I waited until the next morning to test it. It worked, once, then failed again. Two days later I tested it again - that was this morning. It worked, again; I have no idea for how long.."
"I can not keep this thing on my wrist.  It worked for about 3 weeks then it fell off.  I put it back together making sure it was attached securely by pulling it to the right, left, forward and backwards.  It did not come apart.  put it back on my wrist.A day later it came apart again.  This has been ongoing since I purchased the watch.  I like the actual watch.  I like the concept of the easy button on the band but I can not keep this watch on my wrist.I should have returned it right away but I thought I had it fixed as it lasted for a while after the third or fourth time it fell off but it is happening more and more again.I don't know if this is a common issue with this band or not but this morning It fell off my arm while I was just walking into my office.  I was not even touching it.  luckily I had a sweatshirt on because it fell into the sleeve and not onto the floor."
"I want to love this watch, but it's strange that since I've been wearing it, my wrist starts to hurt a lot during the middle of the day. Yesterday I took it off when it started to hurt and the pain went away within a couple of hours and it's not because of the tightness of the straps. It's felt like maybe because of the heart monitor or another sensor in there? Maybe with it being continually on it does affect your bone or skin tissue? I don't know. I will be looking it up online though to see if other people have mentioned it."
"I was looking forward to trying the watch. It was nice, but a round face that large made it too clunky and unflattering. Though, if large round face is your thing, you'll like it. It wants you to sign away a kidney (not literally, but you get my point) on permissions for your personal data, and i am not ok with that. If that's what smart watches require, no thanks.I returned it, but has taken over a month so far and no refund yet."
"Absolutely love this watch. My husband has used almost every function in the short time he has had it. Major issue I have it one side of the band won’t stay attached to the watch. It has now randomly unpinned from the watch face and fallen off 6 times and in doing so has scratched and scuffed up his brand new watch. 3 days having it and he can’t fully wear it all day without it randomly unhooking from the watch and falling. I’m not sure if this “pin and tuck” or whatever it’s called thing is new, but so far for us, it has been awful. It could be a faulty band but it’s rather annoying."
Wish it was more clear certain apps are not available on the watch. My family uses Google chat to talk to me and i got a smart watch so i can stay in contact more easily but the app isn't even available on the watch. Super frustrating as pretty much all other Google apps are available but not this one. Overall I'll keep the watch as it's easy to set up and charge and seems easy to use. Just disappointed that the one app i wanted it for is not even an option.
"I did my pre-purchase homework, but failed to find any information to suggest I can't even set up the watch because my Samsung Android phone is too old. So this thing is costing me well over $1000, once I purchase the newer phone so I can use the watch. (I could have returned the watch within 14 days for reimbursement, but then I would once again be without a fitness tracker, which I depend upon because sleep disturbance is my primary migraine trigger.) Something to think about."
"S24 ultra user here with AT&T.No notifications work.Enabled in app, on phone, on watch.Watched Tiktok videos to see what others did.Reddit.All of Google. Restart, factory reset (phone and watch). Used different apps for messaging. Simply will not work. Spent hours."
"I don't know how these same watches from different far eastern web sellers get 60% then others 80%, then this one 100%. Perhaps Amazon bundles other sales inside the review. This watch comes of box feeling cheap. It is definitely not going to last as there is not a single bit of metal. The strap feels rubber and spindly. The features although packed on advert needs a sub standard app. Further apps can't be downloaded just switch on other app reni ders for watch to vibrate (untested if works) Blood oxygen has no units just % of an arbitrary max. Camera image sent to phone not working. No instructions. No way to know how to add apps or feature pages as hinted in watch itself. Total toy you'll get bored of and add hassle to your day."
"I love this watch,  completely comfortable to wear . Only issue I have found is when I worked night shift and slept during the day it didn't track my sleep. It should be able to track sleep no matter what time day or night it is. But for the price it's definitely worth it ."
"This watch counted almost 600 steps from the time I got out of bed, walked down one flight of steps, made coffee and let my dogs out. That's guaranteed not even 100 steps. The watch itself is bulky and uncomfortable, it keeps alerting me that my heart rate is above 160 (it's not, I have a pulse ox and a blood pressure cuff, or just take your own HR the old school way). Can't text back, it keeps sending me texts that aren't showing up on my phone, and actual texts aren't showing up correctly on the watch.This is a child's toy. Don't waste your money. It's just another foreign piece of junk for the seller to make a quick buck. Don't waste your money. Just get an actual step tracker that clips to your clothing, the all of the functions are worthless..."
It took me a bit to figure out how to connect to my Android phone. Gotta go to Google Play and download the app.
Initial review shows the app for the watch to be difficult to navigate. Spend a little more and get a better watch
This Device is way to complex to set up.
"This watch has a nice sized and bright display. For the most part I like the functions that it provides. The watch band is plenty long for my larger wrist and is comfortably wide. The phone answer and call feature works well. I am disappointed with a couple of things in particular. The device does not allow for forcing the display to stay on longer than 5 seconds. I am receiving some texts, but not all. The raised hand to turn on display seems to work sporadically. I get a notification entitled reach the goal with a little gold trophy as an icon. I do not want this notification; it is aggravating. I cannot find out how to turn it off. I have contacted the seller through my Amazon account with no response. I have a few more weeks to decide whether to return the watch."
This item is very difficult to figure out how to operate it.  The instructions that were sent with it were very small and hard to read and also was missing important information.  I have written to the email address supplied but have not heard anything and probably won't.
"Battery life lasts 2 weeks which is great but charging is always finnicky (the cable has always needed to be in a very specific position for it to work, even right out of the box. I’ve had it for 9 months now and as I was charging it, it completely died and won’t turn on. Hopefully I can get it fixed with the warranty but for only 9 months of use it feels like I wasted my money"
"My beloved Garmin Vivofit 2 failed and I would have bought another, but it is discontinued. Vivofit 2 had everything I want: 1-year battery life, step tracking, sleep tracking, very light and unobtrusive, comfortable band, easily readable display, and waterproof to 100ft.The Vivofit 4 that replaced it is terrible. It has a new band that is much less comfortable and has ridiculously small numbers that are less than half the size of the Vivofit 2. The numbers are too small to glance at it while running or biking.So I went back to market to find a replacement. I looked at virtually every available model and found only 3 that came close: The Garmin Venu SQ, The Coros Pace 2, and the Polar Ignite 3.The Venu has a great display that is easily readable. It has great features, and it is compatible with Garmin Connect app, which is also great.After a few days trying them out, I ended up picking the Coros Pace 2. Feature-wise the Pace and Venu are very similar. I think the Garmin Connect app is a lot better than the Coros app.  And if it was just for that I would have picked the Venu. But the factor that won me over was battery life in Watch Mode. Pace 2 battery life is almost double that of the Venu SQ2. I think that is probably because the Pace uses a transflective screen that is always on but still uses very little power. The Venu display is LED, whcih is brighter but is not always on. The Venu is definitely easier to read than the Pace, but for me, batter life is more important."
"I’ve been using for almost a year. I enjoy it a lot for its biometrics features for workouts and cardio. It’s pretty accurate. Sometimes the heart rate is clearly wrong if it’s indicating a resting rate while I’m at the gym, but that’s only sometimes. The stock wristband broke after about 3 months, and I have some stretchy fabric bands that are great compared to the rubber stock band. I use the vibrating alarm feature as a quiet way to wake up on work days so I don’t disturb my wife. The backgrounds and display features aren’t flashy nor exciting and the watch itself is understated, but it’s definitely better than Fitbit if you ask me. The battery can last up to 5 days with normal functionality. Overall I’d recommend if you want something like an Apple Watch but don’t mind less flash and prefer a much better battery life and a more fitness focused type of product. The connect app from Garmin is also acceptable, nothing super special."
"If you buy this watch, or any fitness watch, also buy an extended warranty (not something I normally do for anything!) I got sick of my fitbits dying shortly after their warranties expired. I heard great things about Garmin and gave them a try. Watch worked great for me during workouts, step tracking, and heart rate. Held its charge for a really long time, would fully recharge while I showered. Shortly after the warranty expired, I charged it per usual to 100%, it worked fine for a few hours, went to sleep and woke up to a fully dead watch. Won’t charge or wake up. Incredibly disappointed in the fitness watch racket these complies are running."
"The face of the clock is multi-colored, so the numbers are VERY hard to read!! WHY? oh WHY isn't the clock face ONE color- like white? Each number of the time on the clock is multi-colored and no number looks the same!! I loved the watch, but after one week, I gave up trying to just read the time. Returned it and will look for another Garmin that has the same features but NOT the multi-colored numbers on the face of the clock."
"Because it's Garmin, I thought I'd give this watch a try. Previously I'd been an Apple watch user but I switched to Android. I don't like the additional apps Samsung makes you download to Make their watch fully functional, nor do I like the intrusive permissions you have to give them in order for the watch to be fully functional.I tried a little cheap $40 watch I found on Amazon. The main reason I didn't keep it is because it didn't offer alternative watch bands.Because this watch interfaces with my phone and I was able to find different watch band options, I thought it was going to be the perfect solution. While you can answer or decline a phone call on the watch, you can't actually use the watch to answer the phone. So if you answer a phone call on your watch, you need to know where your phone is so you can actually talk on it. Otherwise, the caller just knows the phone stopped ringing and can hear background noise but nothing else.You can respond to text messages from a very limited set of auto replies, but you cannot freely text nor can you customize the response options.Why would they design a watch with such limited options?! If a $40 foreign watch can be used to make/receive phone calls, then why would a watch at this price point be purposefully designed not to do that?!Regarding the exercise options, you can play and you can stop but there is no pause, which is a minor inconvenience at times.I'm stuck with this stupid thing, but this is my first and likely last Garmin purchase."
"My husband has a Garmin and loves the Body Battery so I made the switch. I didn't jump right into all the settings on the watch so it took me a few days to realize it didn't track stairs. My job often has wellness activities, stairs being one so I decided to return this and try the Vivoactive 4s. If that doesn't meet my need I'll go back to the Fitbit Versa line."
"Heart rate measurements are inaccurate constantly.  It is frustrating, especially when it happens during an activity.  Literally, the measurements can drop drastically during various minutes or even during the entire activity.  Unfortunately, Garmin knows about this problem, and they have an article trying to explain why it happens, but it looks like a poor intention to justify the problem.  Basically, you can't claim the warranty because of this issue, even if the causes covered in the article don't apply to you.  Also,  sometimes, steps count doesn't match between the watch and the app, even after syncing them several times."
Touch screen not workin.. Tap or swap nothing move on display!!
"I think I have purchased a defective Venu 2 SQ - I have tried everything in the instructions and cannot get ""menu"" on the watch screen, so I cannot ""pair"" with my phone...What to do?"
Does not track daily active zone minutes and instead lumps all activity into one weekly goal.  To break it down you to do cumbersome math. Would not buy again as this is a big drawback for me.
"I have always loved garmin. I continuously choose it over Fitbit, Apple Watch, Samsung, etc. I was excited to get this watch in April and had no issues with it up until this past month. During the past month it will not hold a battery charge. It goes from 100% to 0% within 18 hours with no recorded exercise, no notifications or tracking on, and Bluetooth turned off. The charge use to hold for almost a week with regular exercise and all other features on, so I’m extremely disappointed that it is doing this less than 6 months after purchasing."
I am on my third Garmen. This one has lasted half the time the other two did….6 months. It has stopped or under recorded my step now for two months. I track my steps with two other device. They always match. Garmen is 2-3 thousand steps behind my other devices.Probably switching to Fitbit.
"So far, I like the product. It has a lot of features I was looking for and doesn't feel too big for me. I'm a 5'2"" female with a small wrist, for reference. My only complaint is that despite advertising that it has gorilla glass and is hard to scratch, mine ended up with a pretty good, noticable scratch within the first week of use. I can't think of anything I was doing where it could have gotten scratched, so now it happened is a mystery. But I was pretty disappointed and quickly needed to spend more money on a screen protector."
"I purchased this to replace my Fitbit. I have not been happy with the Google changes. I had a Garmin tracker watch about 35 years ago ,so I assumed this would be a good replacement for the Fitbit. First of all, there were few directions..just a “quick start” guide.  While trying to explore the functions, the watch froze and I never could get it to do anything. I scanned the QR code on the quick start guide, thinking I’d get some help but all that showed up was someone’s blog. My guess is that this watch had been returned. Well, in any case, it was returned again. Best of luck to anyone who buys this watch!"
The screen is very complex
"I only purchased a smartwatch to simplify my access to blood glucose reading from my Dexcom G6 sensor and android phone.  The initial setup was frustrating, requiring multiple attempts to see readings.Garmin and Dexcom support were equally useless at providing any assistance.  After finally getting it to work for a couple of months in a glance screen, it just stopped showing readings.  The final suggestion was...""sorry...not sure what is the issue.  Probably just have to uninstall/reinstall dexcom widget"".  I'm a retired software/database developer, so I interpret that response as ""I'm tired of talking to you on the phone so do this and my script doesn't tell me what to do now"".I guess I'll just have to write this off as lesson learned."
"It is very bad, inaccurate, and the battery does not last as long as they assume it does."
I lift weights 5 to 6 days a week and it does not track your intensity minutes good whatsoever. Contacted the company and they Don't really have anybody that knows how to help you. I should have waited a few more years until they have better technology. On the plus side it tracks your sleep quality pretty good.
"It has great battery life over the Apple Watch which is what I had prior to this watch. However, it isn’t the most user friendly in my opinion. I don’t feel that it’s super accurate with measuring distance and pace, especially when indoors. When you are doing an activity you can’t see the current time. You also have to swivel your wrist many times to get it to light up, but if you touch certain buttons it’ll stop the workout.Update: I’ve only had it since April and it doesn’t give my notifications anymore except for calls every now and again, and the touch screen isn’t working well anymore."
It does not give any language options in settings on the watch and the app says to change the language on the watch!! I can't use it!!
Not user friendly when it comes to setup!! Bottom line I thought it would be cool to have the settings and music but there are things I still haven't setup or used and it's very frustrating!!
What can I say. The watch is great. It has a great community and a great app. But one big problem. Something about the watch irritated my skin. It felt like it was burning. I had to return it. I've heard that it could be they are using metals like nickel in them and some people have a issue with that. I tried wearing it a week and gave up. Its a shame really. I really liked the watch and I have no idea what I'm going to do to replace it.
This feels a little cheap when coming from an Apple watch.  I REALLY wanted this to replace my apple watch but it just falls a little short in polish.  Screen is small with large bezels and is not as smooth as the apple watch.
"The app only counts the last continuous sleep. If you sleep for 5 hours, get up to go to the bathroom , go back to bed and sleep for 3 more hours the app shows 3 hours sleep.  Useless information.  Step count doesnot include steps and from 3.4 mile activity.  Active calories are less than the calories burned from Activity."
"Had serious issues with the heart rate monitor not working 80% of the time. Constantly going blank.At the same price point as an Apple Watch SE, I was shocked by how clunky the interface was, how easy it was to accidentally end workouts without confirmation and so more. Another major issue was how stubborn it was about syncing to my Garmin Connect app. I'm glad I kept my Forerunner 35 honestly, less is more. Really disappointed... I thought this would be a great upgrade.The watch face options are absolutely atrocious too."
"I've got a couple friends that RAVE about Garmin watches so I decided to try one out.  This feels very cheap and lightweight, like a toy.  The UI is ugly and navigating through the apps felt clumsy and non-intuitive.  After I complained to my Garmin using friends they said, ""Oh you need to get one of the top of the line models if you want a good one""I returned this and bought a Pixel watch instead, which I am much happier with."
"What this metaphore tries to do is take the data collected by the watch and formulate that into something useful. But those formulations mean nothing to me. Average breath rate? In a week's time it varied by 1, from 13 all the way to 14 then back to 13. Where's the value in that? Last week I played tennis for about 9 hard hours. What does the weekly summary say? Absolutely nothing. I had about 45 minutes or so of heart rate at target. Garmin says ""say you"". So get the watch because it has great battery life, Take up running and golf otherwise, look elsewhere. The Fitbit devices are crap, but at least the data is collected, arranged and presented in a valuable way."
"Great watch; however, I returned it for the round case version."
Would not connect to my Samsung like it's supposed to. Tech support couldn't help. Fitness stuff was good. Connection to my cell = not so good. Returned.
"After 3.5 weeks, this watch was still inaccurate every day. Whether I slept well or not, it always reported poor sleep. For ""fitness age,"" I changed my weight by 1lb and Garmin decided I was 3yrs younger.I finally found the Garmin forum and inaccuracy seems to have been a problem for years now so, I sent it back. I expected a much better product from Garmin."
"I have a problem with the blood pressure, inaccurate I want to return it, please elp me with the transaction.I am I where are 30 days return policy has been expired."
"It's not a bad fitness watch great battery life, but absolutely sucks at sleep tracking so I wouldn't recommend this watch. Garmin in general needs to do way better in this area their watches suck. Not really worth what you pay for this watch."
It barely worked and was such as disappointment after reading how amazing it was. It's not worth the money I spent on it.
"Heart rate monitor is terribly inconsistent, sometimes for the same activity it will tell me 170ish BPM, other times 120ish. I accept reasonable fluctuations but this is kind of an expensive item for something that isn't helpful beyond tracking steps and time."
Screen doesn't work in water AT ALL and screen is already scratched despite being impossible to scratch!!
This was a gift for my husband.  We had to return it because it would not pair with his phone and then just stopped working
"Stopped working this morning. No display, will not recharge... nothing. Neither Garmin Express nor Garmin Connect recognize that the watch is connected. Very disappointing."
"Less than a year after purchasing, the watch likes to tell me during my workouts that my heart rate is 75-80. I have to power it on and off every couple of hours if I want to measure anything with 70-80% accuracy. Don't waste your money like I did. Go elsewhere for a better smart watch you can get your monies worth from."
I bought it from. Best buy.I have  difficulty in using it.  The watch controls are very difficult to use.  The manual didn't help either as it is very poorly written.I will not recommend purchase.
"While in several respects a competent smartwatch--particularly regarding music, storage, and battery life during music playback--the Garmin 2 Venu Music unfortunately fails in its most essential function: heart-rate tracking.I climb a long, steep hill on my property a few times a day for cardio. From years of experience with various trackers, I know for a fact that this hill is a 140-160 BPM climb for me.Half the time (no matter where or how I'm wearing the watch), the Venu 2 registers a heart rate in this zone, on this hill. The other half of the time (no matter where or how I'm wearing the watch), the Venu 2 gets stuck in the 89-91 BPM range and won't budge, no matter how out-of-breath I am.And now, as I sit calmly typing this without pain or anxiety, breathing slowly, the watch is registering 104 BPM. Its tracking is *all over the place*.Given how critical heart rate accuracy is to the watch's other extrapolated metrics, this really puts low limits on fidelity for any data coming out of this tracker. It is essentially useless for the one thing it should do *best*.And given the watch's price, I'd certainly expect better.This was my first Garmin, and will probably be my last."
"This is a very good watch.  Great features for the money. Good size for smaller wrists.BUT, there is currently a serious bug where you can't download any new watch faces or apps from the Garmin IQ Store for this watch. Many posts about this problem on the Garmin Forum. It's been going on for a month now..."
"I'm so glad that I kept my old Vivoactive watch.  This Venu model was a waste of money.  The battery life is non-existent (even with everything unlinked and powered down as much as possible), the touch screen doesn't work half the time, and just overall, the watch is clunky and pretty much unusable."
"Everything is fine, except the garmin pay is the most problematic because only selected bank only and in Singapore only OCBC bank can be used, some how I have regretted to buy garmin smart watch, unless garmin can use goggles pay too."
Battery good. Screen surprisingly scratch resistant. For this price it's a damn good watch.and the Grey is cheaper than the black same watch
I love how this product looks on my wrist. There are so many amazing functions to use but over half the time it cannot find my heartrate etc.  The band is nice and the color is very pretty.
"yes you can get the get the music onto it and the info off this by directly connecting to your pc and you don't have to have the garmin app spying on you or sign your life away for an account.  the watch is not very user friendly at all in operation. very few options for built in watch faces but then they charge for most new ones. why they thought 2 buttons was all it needed is beyond me, maybe they were just maxing out the profits. but for an entry level GPS watch with 4gb space for music over bluetooth i cannot complain for the sale price i paid."
This watch is not great at basic functions. It doesn't track sleep properly. It doesn't track activities until you've been going for at least 5 minutes. Every function on this watch is overly complex and many steps. I don't like it at all. It has hydration but doesn't track that either. I would buy something else. My $40 knockoff was better tbh.
"Watch is not able to stop from continue scanning all setting & never stops until battery goes dead (24 hours) cant stop or shut it off, Worked OK from Oct until Nov 14. Would like to return it. Does not show time or able to access any activity settings etc. I had Geek Squad from Best Buy check it & they could not get it to operate or change from the locked up scanning."
I like the watch but unfortunately doesn’t really meet my expectations. I wanted it to record my water aerobics but i didn’t do enough research. This watch can’t do that. I’m contemplating returning it. It’s comfortable enough but I can’t customize the watch face like I wanted too and I feel just overall disappointed that it won’t do what I want it too
"I loved my watch, it was fantastic...but just recently it stopped working and when I called Garmin, they said it out of warranty and now you'll have to pay additional 160 to get it replaced. I mean I paid 400 for the watch, I hope it works for at least 5 years!!! And I would have appreciated a little more understanding from Garmin to take responsibility and replace my watch. Garmin was my first choice in watches, always, but now this is a sudden expense and I dont know if I am going back to GARMIN. 😢"
"I decided on this watch due to the fact it displays your energy level, which most other watches don’t. The battery life is amazing, almost 2/3 weeks. I am 13 days past the return date and after fully charging it yesterday, it completely stopped functioning. The face won’t light up, it won’t display anything. I am so disappointed as I really like this watch. I tried returning it but seeing I am out of my return window, Amazon won’t do anything for me. Very disappointing."
"I spent a lot of time reviewing and researching all of the smartwatches in this price bracket. I had a previous Garmin watch, and my husband also had one so thought it was a fail safe purchase. I was very happy with the look, style and color of the watch I bought, and was really excited for the features.2 months into owning the watch I started to experience issues with the heart rate sensor. Over and over and over again it would kick off, I would adjust and readjust the watch fit; made it looser, made it tighter, purchased multiple different styles of bands to try to ensure a better or more effective fit to no avail. It would pick up my heart rate momentarily and then kick off. I would be in the middle of a workout and my heart is pounding at 150bpm and then It would kick off and sense my heart rate at 72bpm seconds later when I know my heart is racing….. I can’t even get a good consistent stress reading or a good sleep reading because of this faulty POS.I sunk over $600 into this purchase and now the heart rate sensor doesn’t even work. The green light in the back is never on, I take it off clean it move it around and it doesn’t kick on. I swapped wrists, swapped bands, adjusted the location on my wrist and nothing works. It’s absolutely garbage and if I could return it I would.Do not waste your money. You’re better off taking it and throwing it in the trash."
This watch is good. But if you want the ECG APP in Canada you will have to het a fitbit or apple watch. I chatted with customer service and they don't have intentions of getting fir canada.
"What a piece of junk. The sleep tracking is a complete joke and is wildly inaccurate. The heart beat monitor just turns off whenever it wants, even in the middle of a cardio session which skews all the stats. Really wish I hadn’t bought this. Do yourself a favor and buy something else."
Well I have had the Watch for a week now and it’s ok take along time for stuff to go on the app and the step counter is off
"The screen is not good. the worst things, it can not install any watch face or apps, I have reached out to Garmin support center, they said a lot Venu sq2 users have reported the same issue and they are working on it.., but I don’t want to wait."
"I was excited to purchase this after reading so many good reviews and I am beyond disappointed. I would return if it was an option. Unfortunately the casing scratched within the first week so I'm stuck with it. Doesn't track my sleep accurately at all. Doesn't register ""awake"" moments, says I go to bed later than I do, and I'm up earlier than I am. The one night it tracked maybe 3 hours of sleep when I had at least a solid 7. I don't feel like it tracks steps accurately unless you're in continuous motion. Outside on a walk for example. I have a lot of stopping/starting walking with my job and I feel like it's not registering steps at all half the time. I have yet to hit 10,000 steps on any given day and my other tracker was registering 15-20,000 (I know this other brand over counts but it's a HUGE discrepancy, and I feel Garmin is under counting.) I cant use the Garmin pay, because my bank isnt registered with them, and while not the only reason I purchased, it is aggravating. For 400$ I expected to be pleased, but personally I wouldn't recommend this when there are less expensive options with much of the same features."
I’ve only had this watch for 5 months and it’s worked maybe 3 of those months. I’ve spent numerous hours online with support to try to fix the endless issues such as the heart rate monitor suddenly no longer working and no longer getting notifications from my phone. I’ve followed every tech step and still no help. Even after a factory reset (twice) the issues remain. Would avoid purchasing.
"I purchased this watch so I could have golf gps on the same watch as my steps counter.  Unfortunately, the Garmin does not record my steps while I am walking on the golf course pushing my golf cart.  My guess is that you have to be swinging your arms for your steps to register.  So - a big waste of money."
"I ordered this watch in October 2023.  It worked for a few months.  When it didn't, I spent an inordinate amount of time with the User Manual and Garmin humans. The second Garmin person got it fixed after 40 minutes on the phone.  When I had to re-charge it, the fix was lost and I now cannot make it work again.Because it supposedly has a one year warranty, I tried to return it to Garmin (too late to return it to Amazon) but could not get this done. I give up."
Very Disappointed- not easy read heartbeat scale and  exercise results are hard to set - I have unfortunately clicked a bike one and it comes up and wont shut off - I haven’t even been able to set  any other sports - frustrating - not nearly as easy as I hoped - only plus is the face is large
"I was so happy with this watch until it stopped being able to receive a charge and won't turn on only 30 days after it was delivered. Trying to get anyone to assist me to exchange it has been impossible. It would be amazing if this was easy. You took my money easily, but you won't deal with a defective product easily. Please respond to my request for assistance and I'd gladly improve my review rating."
Too late for me to get a refund? The time is defective and stopped working! Scam. Do not buy!!
This watch is fine but I am unhappy because the price dropped from $260 to $200 just a few days after I bought it.
This product is perfectly suited to my needs. I received a product without a charging cable. BUYER BEWARE. I was able to order a replacement from Garmin but it will take a couple of weeks to get here. The watch will have powered down by then. NOT good.
"dont buy this, it never stay connecter and doesnt work."
Watch came opened and repackaged poorly.  this was supposed to be a new watch.
"As you would expect there are several improvements from these earlier watches. The biggest one is much faster GPS locking. Before my runs I would hold my Vivoactive 4 or Forerunner 245 up to the open sky and have to wait for a minute or two before it would finally find the satellites. The Vivoactive 5 usually locks with a few seconds indoors before I've even left the house.The battery life is excellent and I can get two or three runs on one charge (that's five hours of running over a week). There are new cute animations when you reach a goal (if you like that stuff) and new features to make your watch seem like your buddy, like summaries of your day and something called a Morning Report to tell you how you slept. I have found the Morning Report to be wildly inaccurate. Nights when I've tossed and turned are described as ""Continuous sleep"" and ones when I've slept like a baby were ""Not enough REM sleep"".It can play MP3s through Bluetooth but it has significantly less storage than the Vivoactive 4 and the Forerunner 245. This reduced my play list down to around 175 songs but that's long enough for a marathon. Like previous watch models the player will crash on some perfectly legitimate MP3 files bought straight from Amazon.One problem they've slightly improved is making it more difficult to accidentally wipe out your run. On previous watches it took two taps to discard your run but a sweaty wet sleeve cuff could actually do that. Now you have to press a button to confirm discard which is much safer. Unfortunately a sweaty sleeve cuff or a drop of rain can still accidentally SAVE your run. Were you going for a distance record today? Sorry, you should have covered your watch from the rain while the activity was stopped.My main gripe is the LED display. Back in the 1970s the new LED watches were annoying because you had to press a button to see what time it was. Then LCD watches came out you no longer had to push a button. This AMOLED display is a return to the 1970s. If you turn your wrist and raise your arm JUST SO then the display will turn on, maybe sometimes. If not then you have to tap the screen just like that ancient LED watch that you threw out fifty years ago when you got an LCD watch. If my hands are full I have to hit the watch with my face to see what time it is. Yes, the AMOLED display is beautiful but I miss my LCD watches almost every day because I could always see what time it was."
"So starting out I loved my Garmin. The health tracking, being able to have notifications on my wrist without being by my phone, the battery lasted several days at a time. All that was awesome. The watch said it needed 30-60 days of tracking to be able to properly give data so I kept the watch for close to 3 months.My first thing I realized with the watch that made me question my purchase was inaccuracy of the heart rate monitor. I didn't realize it at first because I got the watch specifically for keeping track of my heart rate and sleep (with heart rate being a concern), but I noticed that it was frequently telling me my heart rate was pretty high compared to what I was use to seeing. Eventually, I started measuring my heart rate with a separate device when I noticed my watch seemed off and confirmed that it was saying my heart rate was 7-10 bpm higher than it actually was. This was while wearing the watch at what I considered to be a comfortable tightness. I tightened the watch more and from there, although a bit tight, it did read correctly. Unfortunately, leaving the watch this tight caused my skin to become irritated and start becoming red and scarring under the watch since I wore it to bed and full time every day.The second thing I realized is that there's very little customization in regards to the smart watch features. The app has the ability to set in watch alarms, but you can't name the alarms yourself. You are only able to select from a drop down list that includes things like ""wake up, bed time, reminder"" etc. This isn't helpful if you're like me and need several different alarms reminders throughout the day because just saying ""reminder"" will not cut it.If setting an alarm from my phone, the watch only says ""clock"" as a notification alert and not an actual alarm on the watch itself.The third and final straw was when I began questioning the accuracy of the sleep tracking and suggestions in the app based on my sleep. This concern was confirmed when one night I left my watch on my desk for the night to give my irritated wrist a break and got up to find that the watch had recorded 4 hours of sleep data including different phases of the sleep cycle while I was not wearing it. The watch is supposed to be using your body to tell when you sleep and what phase of sleep your in so I'm not sure what it would have been tracking while sitting on my desk all night.I originally chose the Garmin because I believed that it would have more accurate health tracking than other smart watches since that's what Garmin is known for. Health tracking is a very important feature to me, so my results with this device were disappointing, but the smartwatch features lacking turned out to be a major issue for me as well. I didn't expect it to be as fancy as other watches, but at a bare minimum I need alarm customization.That being said, the cost of the watch is not worth the features it provides. I ended up returning and getting a Samsung watch 6 for less and have had a much better experience with it overall both in regards to health tracking and customization. If the Garmin watch were $150 I would consider that a fair price for the device, but not more than that considering the advancements of other watches at this time that have price points under $300."
"Although the display is bright and surprisingly easy to read in daylight the older reflective display on the version 4 that could be always on was, in my opinion better.. Having to touch the display or flip your wrist to see the display was annoying and with the setting on gesture it came on at night a lot. I prefer the slightly less visible older display even though its nice the amount of data you can get on the new one.Having had my old one replaced now I can't find the watch face I had downloaded for it and liked and the new face-it programmable face is more customizable on the 5 - I don't see why thats not possible on the 4.Next, the golf app is messed up , the display of how far you hit the last shot always returns on the version 4 software but you have to jump through hoops to get it back on the 5 if you change the view - plus when you get to the green it automatically prompts for the score and the last shot distance is gone !! Dumb programming."
"Having just received my Garmin Vivoactive 5 on 6/23/24, the jury is still out.I haven't decided yet how well I like it.  Much  to like over Fitbit, but the set up was difficult and took quite a while, even with You Tube videos.I have noticed today that the accuracy of my steps is not what it should be.  I went shopping this morning, pushing a cart, only to find that it only recorded 1400 steps after walking around the entire Meijer, Bath & Body Works, Joann Fabrics & Michaels.  I should have had at least 4500+ steps or more, after walking for 2+ hours.  So, I'm guessing that if your arms are not at your sides swinging and pushing a cart, it doesn't accurately measure your total steps.  Very disappointing.  I even got notifications that it was time to get moving, even though I was walking.Garmin never mentioned that in order to charge your watch, you need a charging block to plug the charging cord in to or charge via my Samsung S21fe port or get an adapter, since it is not the usual USB plug in.There are more things on this watch than I may ever use.Pros:  There are features that are nice, like the ability to upload pictures from your phone, it sleeps at night, not waking up until you manually wake it up in the morning.Con's: Very few watchband options available.  I'm one that like to change mine frequently.  There are no dressy bands that I can find anywhere.I had previously had a Fitbit Sense (a free replacement for my defunct Ionic) and an Ionic.  Due to the fact that neither of these lasted very long, for the price, I opted to try the Garmin after doing lots of homework.  Don't have Apple products, this was not an option.Like I started at the beginning, my final review will need to wait until I have this watch for a while longer."
"I have several different devices from many manufacturers;GarminPolarFitbitHuaweiThe Fitbit is my least favorite, however I'm here to review this Vivo5 the intent is good but the accuracy is off.  From sleep logging, to step counter, to the UI.  My biggest beef was the step counter all of the aforementioned devices work well and consistently.  This Garmin was 1600 to 2000 steps off of those on the lesser side.  I tried to mess with it but the UI was just to simplistic for me.  It is a very attractive device but for the price not worth it.  Out of all the products I have Huawei is the best, followed closely by polar, and then the Garmin, followed in last place was Fitbit.  The silicone wrist bands on every device except Huawei left me with serious irritation.  I'm not sure why as I followed instructions to the T, however thats a problem for me, with most all.Garmin does seem to be fairly durable, but the price ranges on all of them are off the charts, the reality is to place an accelerometer in a device is not rocket science the algorithms should be fairly close, you are paying premium prices for very ""meh"" tech.I didn't hate it, I just don't want it and have started my return.  Just my opinion..."
"I've been an avid user of all things Garmin.  I had the Vivo3 and loved it but it was older and not keeping a charge.  While the 5 has great features and hopefully a longer battery life, the raised face might be an issue. The watch itself feels flimsy and the band is awful!  Thin, plastic clasp where the 3 was solid and thicker with a metal clasp.  I know they switched to aluminum to maybe save money but why'd they make the band so crappy?  Thankfully I just swapped out my old band but still disappointing they tried to cut corners on the part that wears out the most."
"This opened in a foreign language with no way to reset during startup. Starting the watch was very difficult. No owners manual or quick start guide is provided. AI is your only help source. Packaging contains no trouble shooting guide or help or phone number to call for tech support. Very tempted to return, but after 2 hours perseverance was able to get up and running. These companies need to do better!"
"After many years of using a fitbit, this ""upgrade"" to Garmin is disappointing.  It significantly undercounts my steps. (Evidently it relies significantly on the swing of the arm?).  I can be an hour into cutting the lawn, and the watch will buzz me with a ""let's move alert.""  Really?  It did not recognize that I was moving for the whole hour.  Often, it will recognize ""my hands not swinging"" with an elevated heart rate (i.e. as in grasscutting), and later advise me that I must of had a ""stressful day,"" and that I should find ways to destress.  I have learned to ignore this advice, and realize that it is underreporting my activity.  NOT MOTIVATING. ALSO, it is not as good as fitbit reporting sleep. Fitbit gives more information, such as the TIME & length of time one slips into the various sleep stages.  The Garmin only tells start and end times, and the length of time of each sleep phase in total.  AND, you need to decide you are ""wake"" before it will assess this information, but the fitbit will give you this information throughout the night (as long as it is at least an hour long AND there is not a wake period longer than an hour.)  The main reason I tried Garmin is to get away from Google.  Sigh"
The original watch band of my 4S lasted for as long as I owned the watch (5+ years) and I had zero issues with it falling off or breaking. Contrast that to this model where the clasp fell off after 5 weeks. I can't say that I'm super impressed with the quality when I need to buy a replacement band almost immediately.
"I have owned this Smartwatch for 6 months now.  For the price, it's a decent smartwatch with lots of built in workouts.  Its sleep monitor function is very accurate but the nap detection, not so much.  When I first got it, I would need to charge it about twice a week without battery saver mode selected.  Unfortunately, I had a fall and the Garmin hit the pavement quite hard and now at 6 months old, it barely holds battery power for a day.  I am very disappointed but it's not really Garmin's fault as I obviously damaged the battery.  Still I feel I must warn that it's fragile with its all-plastic construction, but for the first six months, it did work great."
"Everything works great, features and all BUT this disconmects if I walk away from my phone while my cheap earbuds stay connected to my phone farther."
"First the good:  In general, this watch does what you think it does. It tracks all the advertised biomarkers it says it tracks.Now the not so good: The watch constantly loses pairing with your phone. The longest I've gone without losing pairing is 10 days.  The shortest is half a day.  It will lose pairing at the worst time imaginable. If you've changed from the default watch face to one of the hundreds of watch faces available, the watch face disappears and you just get a an ""IQ"" logo. This makes it totally unusable.  If you do a little searching, you will find this bug seems to have been around for this watch and many, many other Garmin watches for years.  You'll find all sorts of ""fixes"" suggested by Garmin.  None work for more than a few days.A new issue that seems to have popped up on mine... (It's only a couple of months old).  The display goes black.  Nothing you do can bring it back.  The watch is still operational.  You can sync it from the phone. You still get buzz notifications when things happen, but it is hopelessly blank.  The only way I've been able to get past this is a hard reset.Overall: not really happy with the watch. I'd probably buy another brand if I were doing this again."
"i love this watch. used it for half marathon training. battery life is great. its lightweight and durable.but the run ""pause"" screen is driving me insane.idk what they were thinking when they decided to put discard and complete buttons at the edges of the screen. i have accidentally completed or discarded my runs at least 15 times. the location of them are so close to the ""continue"" button on the right top corner. anytime i would pause and restart my run, high chance i will either discard or complete my run unintentionally.in the winter when my long sleeves would swipe on it, it would react and finish the run while im still in the middle of the run.i recently made it less reactive to touch screen so that helped a little.i opened tickets with garmin software team but they've been unresponsive. please improve this screen!!"
"This is a replacement for my Vivoactive 4S due to that watch's slowly diminishing battery life. However, the improvements between the Vivoactive 3 and 4 are much more than between the 4 and 5. The definite highlight of the 5 is the screen is much better for daylight viewing.For running, which is all I used this for besides step counting, there's very little to any noticeable difference from the 4S. I would give it another star if Garmin can fix the Bluetooth via update.Connecting headphones only to listen to music is fine and works great. During any workout requiring GPS tracking, however, and the music is like listening to a skipping CD player. I had to wear my 4S for music and my 5 for activity tracking during a half marathon because I couldn't take 2 hours of music skipping/dropping in my ears."
"Totally disappointed, at best the battery will last about a day.  Do NOT buy for the battery life.I have never left a review so this speaks to how strongly I feel about this product.  For background I have been a loyal Garmin user for decades, I have never owned an apple watch but love the Garmin.  So when I needed a new watch to replace the prior Garmin it was a foregone conclusion it would be another.  I did an inordinate amount of research and decided on the Vivoactive 5 for many reasons but the most important was battery life.Do NOT but this watch if you, like me, read the reviews and description and sadly belive the 11 day life of the battery.  That is wholly misrepresented and perhaps flat out false.  I am moderately active but have had this watch for one week.  I LOVE the watch BUT the battery while fully charged has not made it through more than a day without being almost totally depleted.  I fully charged yesterday about 11 am and here I am the next day at 7:30 pm with 19% charge.  In 24 hours I did 1 5 mile hike for approx. 1.5 hours (generous timing) and nothing else that required GPS or extra battery and yet it is dead.I can NOT recommend this watch and am seriously considering returning it.  My old Garmin got sometimes about a month, this is either totally false advertising or a defective product.  Either way, do NOT buy for the battery life, there is none!"
"Got this watch to start tracking my steps and my sleep. Worked amazing at tracking my sleep but when it came to steps it was surprisingly inconsistent. I have 2 apps on my phone that track my steps and while I was getting around 11,000 steps on my phones fitness apps my watch only counted around 3000 steps so for this reason I will be returning. However if your are not looking into the watch for the step tracking I would say it’s a pretty good watch."
"I like the size and display of the watch. It’s very light weight. I had a Fitbit before and so that is the only comparison I have. Cons: battery is not as great as it advertises. I’m on day 4 and my battery is at 24%. I walk around 12k steps a day and the first day I relied on the watches music (Spotify). So that could be the reason. Also I noticed today that the watch said I was on an elliptical for 16 minutes during my walk, which I was not. The watch often loses Bluetooth connection with the connect iq app, not as much with the main app. I do get notifications of text and calls but cannot respond with the iPhone, which is not a big deal. I think for the price its lacks a lot. I’m debating on whether or not I should return it."
"I bought this watch for my wife and it's nice, but there's a constant issue of the watch not syncing or losing connection to her Pixel 8 phone. We've gone through resets and software upgrades, but we've only seen marginal improvements.Update: we had to return the watch. There was too much Bluetooth inconsistency for such a high price tag."
This is the best fitness tracker I have owned to date. But they lose 2 stars for not including a charger. I'm tired of tech companies doing this. I had to go out and spend more money just the complete package and I don't think that is a fair thing after what I paid for this watch. My only other issue is the band seems super cheap for a watch that costs this much money. However it is a really good product.
"The downside that I've noticed is that the battery actually drains too quickly, you have to put it on sleep mode and do not disturb to avoid wasting battery.It got frozen one time and when I do connected to the power cord it did not show the charging sign.Just a few downsides and considering the price I will give it 3 starsBesides that's, So far so good I hope that it can last for a long time."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            I used to love Garmin and got this to help track my health. After 6 months the screen went blank. I tried reaching out to them but no answers. The sensors still work but no screen. I had the vivoactive music 3 for years... so sad. Also, it doesn't really hold a charge for a day anymore let alone 5 days to over week like it did the first couple months."
I love the device.  Unfortunately I'm having issues with BT.  It's a known issue with Google Pixel phones. I've been waiting months for them to fix it  I did open a support ticket.
"Had high hopes but was disappointed. Do your homework on the VO2Max formula on this watch. It's formula seems to be based on outside GPS and distance. So treadmill,elliptical, aerobics seems to be factored as not going anywhere which pulls any stats down. I will probably return it because I will never get an accurate reading"
"One week for delivery, already long, turned into two. There is a charging cable with a USB C plug. Every charging port I have in three cars, two computers, and several plugs has a USB A opening. There is no wall plug in the box. That's a bit cheap. I'm not impressed."
"I had a Garmin in the past and it was fantastic. The user interface of the apps were amazing. Unfortunately the The Garmin vivoactive 5 is pretty rough.For no reason it just goes black and you have to hard reset it. If you go online you'll notice that's a pretty common occurrence for other people as well. Additionally the Connect app has really poor UI UX and ei end up using multiple apps to collect all the data that I need. (MapMyFitness)If I was an iPhone user I would go with an Apple watch. I probably should have gone with the Samsung watch. I definitely don't recommend this watchThe pros:  itself is comfortable, it is easy to wear.... But when you're getting ready to go for a run and you have to completely reset it and hope that it comes back on, it's more of a disruption then a proper tool.So if anyone's still looking for a Garmin vivoactive 5, slightly used, let me know"
I bought this in March and it’s sept and no longer holds a charge for more than a day and takes hours to charge.  I should have bought through the garmin page so I could get a refund but 300 dollars for a watch for a few months is not okay. It was excellent when it worked but now I’m sure won’t make it the year as I can barely get it to charge I’ve changes charges and outlets
"The title says it all.  The device is absolutory great as a hardware.  At least 7 days of battery (with no GPS). Compact, ergonomic.Software and UI -- a different story altogether.  Have you heard of the 20/80 Pareto rule?  That 20% of something is useful 80% of the time?  Well, here it's more like 1/99.The device is FULL of flashy looking but useless apps. Which means that getting to the right app is always a hassle.  Configuring the watch is a pain -- I can count at least FOUR different ways to access various settings, and you never know where a particular setting is.The watch has one nice functionality -- it can store music, which means that when you exercise you can leave the phone at home.  Great, right?  Except that when you are using the Run app you can't access the music controls!  Some evil manager must have read Catch-22 or something.The watch has NFC, allowing you , allegedly, to pay at points of sale using the watch.  I followed all the instructions to set up my credit card, and it doesn't work.  I am sure there is some obscure setting somewhere in the watch that needs to be changed...but is it documented?  No. Because that would make things too easy.Great engineers, terrible managers and UI specialists."
My $200 Fitbit Versa 2 finally died after 3 plus years. I thought I could invest in a nicer watch that costs more but I found out this $300 Garmin has less smart features. It doesn't have a microphone to speech to text respond to text messages or answer calls when connected to Bluetooth. I returned it the next day and got the Garmin Venu 3 which has a microphone only to find out it doesn't support speech to text replies either. I'll be returning this as well and switching back to Fitbit
"I bought this watch after a lot of research and content watching. And here is my honest review after 3 consecutive days of use.The only great thing about the watch is the battery life.The touch screen is smooth but nothing compared to the Apple watch.The worst thing about this watch is its lack of app connection with iPhones. If you have an iPhone this watch is not for you. You practically can not use this watch to access any apps on the iPhone. You can view messages but can't do anything past that.Also if you sleep wearing it for the sleep tracking features, you most likely will wake up with few active apps on the watch.To sum up. Its useful to an extend but its not worth the price. You are better off buying an apple watch or a galaxy watch based on whichever phone you got."
"When I got this watch in mid-March, it was such a wonderful product. The battery life from the new package was 84%, so I used it for almost a week. Then, I found out that the charging cable did not work, so I called product support to get a replacement cable. That took another week, so finally, at the beginning of April, I am using Vivoactive5 again! But! The replacement cable stopped working after a week. So I have to contact the product support AGAIN! BTW, the customer service is amazingly helpful, and I got the entire product replacement coming to me. So, again, finally by the end of April, I am using vivoactive5! But! I received the product on Friday, and it is only Monday today; I have charged it three times already! I am so tired of this back-and-forth now, regardless of how wonderful all the customer services are. Can I just return it once and for all and find another Garmin? I mean I have used several Garmin watches now, always reliable and made my life much better. What is going on this time?!"
"It has a lot of features for exercise which is awesome. I would like more watch faces. It doesn't track sleep that well, if you take a nap it doesn't track it. One time the screen just went black for no reason, the next day worked well again. Battery life is like one week. The mobile app is really good. If I have the money back I think I would try a different option, I expected more from this product, anyway it is really good."
"I have a Garmin Vivoactive 4s and love it.  I love to use the Vivoactive 4s with the Garmin Connect App. I just bought the Vivoactive 5 and am amazed to find out that it does not track stairs. Thus, instead of updating I feel that I downgraded with the newer version. Now I will not be able to use the app as I used to and I will not be able to participate in any of the challenges in the app that depend on altitude. Thus, as of today, I feel that the Vivoactive 4s is better.Update: I returned the watch. I used it for 3 days and also found out that the step tracker is not as good as the one in the vivoactive 4s. The vivoactive 5 looks better and has better graphics than the vivoactive 4s, but all and all, I feel that the 4s is better where it counts (steps tracker and altitude tracker)."
"Overall it’s a good watch for functionality and aesthetic at first. The screen will go black after swimming in the lap pool for an hour and the band is starting to show discoloration after less than a year. I expected som glitching given the model had just come out, but there is something weird happening to the watch every few weeks before it goes away with a software update."
"Bought this as a gift, and when working properly, my wife loves it. It's a great little feature packed watch.Sadly, the screen is very glitchy and just shuts off for 5 minutes to an hour, completely unresponsive. The watch is still working, the screen just won't turn on.  We are in the middle of the exchange process with Garmin, which due to backorders and other delays (Garmin makes you mail your watch back first before they will send a replacement) it will take at least a month to get it exchanged."
"Wish battery life was better.  Seems I have to recharge very often.  For me, think SW is clunky.  For what you get, I think it is overpriced."
"I can’t write about the functionality of the tracker because I put it immediately back into the box. First impression: it’s really flimsy. If this was $30 I could see this but for $300 I’d expect a lot better. Next the wrist band is very short. If you got large wrists you may need a different watch band from the start, if that’s even possible.  Also the charge connector is proprietary. I don’t like that because it’s impossible to replace when traveling, and who hasn’t lost or broken a charge cable?  Now to the alternative:  if you search this site you’ll find that for the same price you can have a current model Apple Watch refurbished.  The previous generation is even less.  I’m no Apple evangelist but it seems that’s a better $300 (or even lower for previous gen.) investment.  The fitness tracker app will do everything this thing promises to do and then some, even if you choose one a couple generations down. This means you can get a better tracker with way more functions for $100 less and you can choose tons of different wrist bands for it too!"
Could have been great but the main issue is the lack of control with the music app. One of the reasons I bought this model was so I could control my music on the phone and know what was playing. Doesn't work.
Poor battery charge. Watch doesn't always connect with charger or it moves and will stop charging. HR sensor quits working alot and have to consistently reset the watch to get it back working. Disconnects from your phone quite often.
Nice looking but difficult on connectivity
"Bought March of 24. Before that, I went through two Fitbits each lasting a year. I thought I'd try something different. Something higher end... It lasted 9 months. Just a few days ago, it was at 7% battery life, so I plugged it in to charge. It never charged. It won't charge. I tried doing some of the things that were recommended for a fix, including cleaning the contacts on both the watch and the charging cable with alcohol. Nothing. Watch is trash. Does anyone know of a smart watch that actually lasts longer than a year? I mean, this is ridiculous ."
I'm not happy with it. The battery doesn't last long. It's very disruptive to my sleep when it keeps connecting to my phone. Hard to connect wireless and it's not intuitive how to manually set up your own workouts on the device. This is the first time I've used a Garmin smartwatch and probably will be the last. I do like the accuracy of the readings. The touch screen is easy to tap and the text size is readable.
"Not only does it mix up the save and delete function on an activity on the same button, it randomly switches where you can do the save.  And it is a known issue.  Why haven't they fixed it?  For a watch that's so great I am not impressed at all.  And if you want to find the deleted activity and restore it, I've yet to find a way to do it with a mac. I would never buy another Garmin watch!"
"I bought it to help me focus on getting better sleep and to see if the metrics would help, but that was a no. I went to sleep around 10:30 last night and woke up around 2:15/2:30, but I couldn’t go back to sleep. I moved around opened my phone after a while then decided to check my watch half an hour later, it had still showed that I was asleep till that point. I finally fell asleep again around 5:30 and woke up around 9:40 ish. The watch showed a combined sleep of 10 hours, but now that I’ve opened the phone app it’s changed it to 5hrs 14 min completely removing my first sleep cycle from 10-2:30 and my awake time from then till 5:30 it even says that I went to sleep at 4:07 when I know I didn’t. Point is results may vary but my expectations weren’t met."
I liked the watch but it stopped resetting my steps at midnight & then did not count them at all. For the amount of money this watch cost it should be this buggy after a week. I had a Garmin band back in 2018 and I like it but wouldn't charge anymore. So I am returning and going back to Samsung.
"I am still trying to figure out how to get the optimal watch face for my watch.  I did the custom, but it is very limited.  I still dont have as good of a watch face as I had with my Garmin Instinct.  I think they designed it to be needlessly difficult so they have a market for you to purchase watch faces.  I wouldn't even mind buying a watch face, but I didn't find one that met my needs.  I don't want features that burn up battery unnecessarily, but the ones I do choose I want to be visible.  Also, I have to push a button every single time in order to see what time it is.  Sometimes that is not convenient.  I liked the instinct much better where the watch face is always visible night and day.2nd update months later - I absolutely hate this watch.  I have been too busy to mess with researching new watch faces and it sends me notifications and changes features on me with no warning.  It sends ridiculous reminders and ignores when I am working out!!  I have to push a button every time to view which in some situations is extremely inconvenient.  I may as well use my phone for date and time!!!"
Not an all day watch. Triggers in shower. Never know what might be deleted. Don’t like the touch screen. Triggers at night. Need to be capacitive like phones. Should be able to turn off touch. This is really not as useful as the Fenix 6. Even a jacket sleeve will turn it on. Battery life does suffer due to this.
"the watch is good, low cost but looks cheap and filmsy."
"Bought this watch back in July. Now November and the battery life on this is absolute garbage. If I charge it all night,I can wear it all day and one night but by morning it's at 2% battery charge. I used to own fitbits that I only had to charge once a week. I stopped buying fitbts because they stop working. If you're going to buy the Garmin, charge it every night, which defeats the purpose if you're trying to track your sleep. These watched at expensive so I expected more, but nope. I'm very disappointed"
I absolutely loved it for the week that it worked. And then it froze and could only be unfrozen by a hard restart. Looked it up and it is a known issue only resolved by replacing it. Didn't want to risk it and downgraded to the 4.
"Got this in March 2024, and it seemed fine at the time. Held a charge for days if not a week. As of writing, in August 2024, it has to be charged every single day. Really expected more from Garmin."
"I tried upgrading from a Vivoactive 4s to the new Vivoactive 5 but there are so many problems with the new watch.- Quality of watch case and band is significantly lower. Everything feels and looks cheap- Sensors do not work well, heart beat is way off, sleep only shows an hour or two- When you tilt the watch the display doesn't always come on automatically- Storage is the same (4gb) but the new watch is already using 1.5gb of spaceThe display is the only good thing about the new 5 version, everything else is garbage. I returned the 5 watch and bought a new 4s off Ebay"
a known bug will not let me set my step stride- it is stuck in wheel chair mode. 😡
"Overall very disappointed with this product. Sleep tracking doesn’t work. The gps during runs is flimsy, the heart rate option isn’t great. I’d say get an oura ring or any other tracker over garmin bc currently it’s just an overpriced digital watch. Forgot to mention that even after turning off notifications I’m still getting them which is quite annoying"
The Garmin  vivoactive 5 is not any better than the Garmin 4s . Most nights it will not track my sleep even though I wear it all night. It also tells me I slept only 3 hours. Don’t waste your money on these Garmin watches . I have bought 2 and the 5 was almost $300’00
"I wanted a health and sleep watch. Health wise it was good, heart/steps were good but when it came to tracking sleep it struggled. Never once recorded a nap for me. I am returning this."
"Very disappointed with this watch, very difficult to navigate,  can't find all the wonderful things it does. Contacted Amazon support and they said send it back.  Really?  Use it until I get my new fitbit,  then sending it back"
This watch does not provide an accurate heart rate throughout the day. I was told by customer service if you want an accurate reading you'll need to start a activity which means you have to go out of your way to press a button start an activity just to check your heart rate.If you have a heart condition I do not recommend this watch
"I am extremely disappointed with my Garmin experience. After only one month of using my watch, the screen broke without any misuse or accident. This alone was frustrating, but the real issue came when I tried to resolve it through Garmin's customer support. The support team was unhelpful, dismissive, and offered no reasonable solutions. Instead of owning up to the faulty product and providing assistance, they shifted the blame and refused to honor any warranty in a meaningful way. I expected much better from a brand like Garmin, but this entire experience has left me regretting my purchase. Avoid this product and this company's customer service at all costs!"
"Heart rate monitor cuts out all the time during my workouts. So then all of my stats are inaccurate because it’s usually when it’s at its highest. For example it will say 180, then cut off completely, then start saying 70 when really my heart rate is still definitely around 180. This goes on my entire workout and my watch is snug. I’ve tried every watch fit option snug super snug not too snug nothing keeps the heart rate monitor on for a full workout. Also inaccurate sleep stats. It will say I fell asleep at 12am when really I was dead asleep at 10pm. So all the purposes I got this watch for are useless. Just get a cheap fit bit or something it will track just as good as this thing"
"I had a Garim 3 for years and it was a great watch, I got the 5 and within a few months it just up and died. I was just laying in bed and it just died. I've been on hold with their support for over an hour and can't get through to anyone. if you want to throw a few hundred dollar out the window than go for it. I've kept it plugged in all day, have it connected to my laptop, nothing. I will never buy another Garmin product again. The worst!!"
"Accuracy is good, liked the color, HR tracking is good, performance is okay but price is expensive, not comfortable to wear, leaves mark on the skin."
"This watch gave my arm a crazy reaction to the point that my skin was peeling off.  The battery life is so terrible you'll have to charge it nightly which defeats the purpose of tracking sleep.  I tried to return this watch for a refund almost immediately but the Amazon lockers were unaccessable.  I contacted Amazon a few times and their solution was to have it picked up from my home but nobody ever showed up.  Now I'm stuck with this literal piece of trash since I can't wear it without my skin falling off, and I don't typically have sensitive skin this is the first time I've ever had this issue."
My watch came without a charger.
"I have the watch set up the way I want it (first picture), and it keeps putting itself to sleep (second picture).  I looked on Garmin Forums, and everyone is complaining about the same problem.  There is no way to disable SLEEP.  I take it off of sleep, but it puts itself back on.  It has not tracked one night of my sleep, either.  I checked every consumer guide before I bought this watch, so that was wasted time.  My Garmin Vivoactive 3 did NOT do this."
I had a Forerunner before this watch and should have stuck with the Forerunner.  The heart rate monitor sucks on this watch compared to the Forerunner.  1/2 the time I’m running my heart is under 100.  I’ve cleaned the sensor still sucks.
"The watch has good features, like an amazing battery and great morning reports. However, the major issue is the quality, which feels cheap. A week after I started using it, the watch began turning off by itself and wouldn't work until the next day even if the battery was fully charged. The screen also froze frequently, and when I pressed the button on the watch, my phone would react and display a number like 170 or similar. The watch still has many glitches. Therefore, I don't think it's worth paying more than $300 for a watch that stops working properly after just a few months. That's why I'm returning it."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            The gesture wake up on the watch doesn't work. I have tried everything - turn the gesture on, turn of DnD mode, turn off and turn on, system update, fill reset. The display will also turn off automatically regardless of how much I move my wrist. This is a bummer because I was really looking forward to using the watch"
The buttons to change function or activity do not work. I had to push them several times to get any response and it kept taking me to the wrong menu. And yes I read the manual and watched the videos.
"I purchased this watch for my wife for Christmas. Unfortunately, because I bought it so early, by the time that we realized that it was glitchy, it was too late to return it. I recommend not purchasing this particular watch"
Step tracker was measuring high. Clearly a faulty itemTHIS ITEM WAS A NIGHTMARE TO RETURN...HAD TO BE PICKED UP AT HOME WITH AN ADULT THERE TO SIGN.
"Item over priced. Enclosed charging cable has no wall plug, and not compatible with my laptop charging ports. ANOTHER charging cable has to be bought separately. Does not come with an instruction manual.  You have to download one from the internet. Not worth my time or effort.  I am returning to Apple iwatch!"
I hate this watch. Not intuitive. I went through the full setup with all of the apps. There's no way that I can find to make a phone call. I.Had somebody call me and it didn't come up on my watch. Text messages aren't coming through. I downloaded the music app but there's no way to add music. The twenty five dollar watch I had was much better than this
"When I upgraded from the vivoactive 3 to the 5 I did not expect to LOSE functionality. They removed the altimeter so elevation is calculated on gps. For example, there is no longer an elevation ascend and descend data point when hiking. The number of ski runs can also no longer be calculated"
I bought my garmin vivoactive 5 in April 2024 now in May 2024 the battery started failing. I am very disappointed.
"The watch frequently struggles to sync with my phone, making it frustrating to track workouts. Software updates didn’t help much."
"Very much a hassle to connect to Samsung phone, once accomplished, stays for about a week, then loses iself, and its step counter. May be alright for telling time, otherwise pretty useless. No phone connection, no way. Phone sees it, but says an app is needed. Have app, it sees phone, but WILL NOT CONNECT."
GPS struggles to work for like a mile into a run. Music does not work as it should and has extreme trouble loading. Battery life is ok. I do think the Vivo active 4s was better than this one.
The watch won't turn on so I had to return it to the sender
Battery died less than a year later under regular use.
"Received a used Vivoactive 5 when I ordered a new one. It not being new yielded a frustrating experience as the watch was still registered to the person who bought it 6 weeks earlier and wasn't in English. Returning this as I don't know why the watch was returned by the original user and there is no means to ensure it is sound. I'm buying my replacement from Garmin's website for the same price as here, as they guarantee they don't see used devices unless labeled and refurbished."
"I am so disappointed with my purchase. This is not my first garmin or fitness focused watch for that matter. I tried everything and could not get the watch to connect to my phone. Maybe it was user error but I'm leaning more toward possibly an issue with the watch itself. I did some digging to see if anyone else had this issue and found people saying it started having connectivity issues a couple weeks to a month or so in. Maybe there are some lemons out there and I was lucky enough to get one. I love garmin and always trust their products but am so disappointed in my experience. Beautiful watch, I just wish I could use it. I am sending it back :/"
I hate the new update and way the data is displayed. I would return this if I could.
Watch stopped stopped working after 2 months. Amazon charged a $50 restocking fee even though it was a defective watch and not that I changed my mind. Ridiculous!
"The watch seemed so promising and then after a few weeks, it stopped measuring my HR and oxygen and hardly measured my sleep patterns. All the things that were important to me as I track all of my workouts, physical activity, and recovery."
"The watch itself is awesome & has really great features. However, it doesn’t charge. I bought one & it charged slightly, so I returned it and got a new one. My current one doesn’t charge at all, and plugging it in actually drains the battery. I plugged it in before bed at 20%, and I woke up to 2%."
As I write this I purchased this July 6th and the heart rate sensor broke on August 14th. Tried everything but apparently this very expensive watch is dead after 6 weeks. Complete waste of money.
"Watch was lightweight but features of sleep and activity were highly inaccurate. Also did not receive a charger for the watch, returning."
"I wanted to love this watch. The first week I had it, it worked fine. Out of nowhere it started giving me way too low heart rate. I started wearing my old Fitbit on other arm it will say 200 vivo active Wll say 106. You can't possibly lose weight or maintain without accurate numbers. Past the return date now I'm stuck with a watch I hate and can't exchange for something else. Don't buy this model. I'm pissed off."
This watch is highly inaccurate and would not recommend it . My fitbit was way better at tracking my activity.  Very disappointed I had heard good things about Garmin .
After one week watch would turn off by itself and pulse ox didn't work.  love the display and features.  waiting for Garmin to mail me a new replacement.
"I bought the Garmin Fitness watch back around February 1, 2024 and after 3 1/2 months it won't charge anymore.  I noticed over the last month the battery life drained faster and it took longer to charge.I used it as long as I could."
"Unfortunately, it felt a little cheap. The buttons felt very cheap"
"This felt like a toy compared to the Samsung Watch 6. I bought myself the Samsung and my mom this watch. I got this watch for my mom because I thought thr battery would last longer and they watches were comparable. But they are not. This thing felt like a toy. The menus were confusing. The options felt limited. Within a day I was packaging this up and going to buy another Samsung Watch 6 after dropping this off at UPS. 1/10, would not recommend."
"Had problems with the watch right out of the box... setting it up was one error after another... after watching all the videos on how to set it up, my watch simply wouldn't... sadly, it's going back. I did a lot of research and hoped for a better outcome."
"I own an instinct as well and this watch does not compare. Battery life is poor, screen scratches easily, don’t recommend"
"This was a Christmas present, and it malfunctioned the day after the window closed for returns. It's a great watch when it works. It vibrates on a regular basis, and the screen often goes black before ultimately shutting down. We have watched multiple video instructions, but unfortunately, nothing has corrected the multiple issues. So frustrating."
The watch came without a charging cable so I am unable to use it
"They sent me the watch with a micro USB cable, when it is well known that the GARMIN connector is of its own design"
Item came with a power cord but the cord did not have usb connector.  Have to purchase a suitable cord separately.  The watch battery died before completion of sync.  The user manual was hard to read and not very helpful
"The watch is nice but ut come with a band that is rubber & can come undone pretty easily.  I don't think it is very accurate on some of the readings, especially the weather. I would send it back but for the price I paid I can't expect anymore than what I got."
"This is a nice alternative to name brand smart watches but many of the features that are listed in the description require costly subscriptions. If you’re simply looking for a watch that tells the date/time and allows you to call/text, easily, this is the watch for you. (As long as you aren’t paying the regular price. I paid around $25 and it’s totally worth that)"
"After wearing for a couple of days, this is not a very accurate watch.Step counting - When it does count it seems to be accurate, the problem is that it takes it too long to recognize that you are walking.  At the end of the day I am missing 1500 to 2000 steps compared to a Fitbit.Calories - 100 to 200 calories burnt after an active day including a 50 minute work out?  Don't know what else to say.Heart rate - seems to be somewhat accurate but is slow to catch changes.It is a nice size, the screen looks nice, it was easy to set up and connect.  After three days it still had 85% of the charge left.  It would be a good watch for a kid getting their first smartwatch."
Pros: I liked the watch. It fit just right on my small wrist.  I was able to hear the caller. I didn't text on the watch.Con: I returned the watch for a refund because I did not like the dial choices. There number of dial choices are small. Choices matters.
"Accurate oxygen readings. Good battery life. However, the steps readings are way off"
"I am 88. I want to track my heart rate. This feature is so inaccurate that I am sorely tempted to return it soon. One gets what he pays for, yes. The price was tempting. But it is a toy; the watch faces are mostly cartoons.I guess all of this type of watch come with a rubber band. I have to struggle a bit to put the watch on and take it off. My old Fit Bit had an easily replacable band (that is available at Amazon) that easily slipped on and off my wrist. The band on this watch could be replaced with any standard watch strap. The display is bright and visible in sunlight. I like the calling and message features. Other features are nice and easy to select."
"I bought this and was sorely disappointed. It does not turn on when I raise my hand. The battery did not last very long. It lasted about 2-3 days. When it started to die, the watch face began to glitch badly. It would flicker on and off and start buzzing randomly. I am returning it today."
"Just as the title says, wouldn't stay connected to my phone. If I walked out of the room, it would immediately lose connection because as soon as I would walk back in, the watch would vibrate and display ""Connection Successful"". Would also do it multiple times overnight, waking me. Extremely annoying. Looks like I will be returning yet another item to Amazon. Not surprised as of here lately."
I've had less expensive watches in the past and the batteries last from 5 to 7 days depending on use. BUT this lasted only 2 days.  I returned it because its a pain to rechange it so often.
Don't waste your money just go get a real one
"Doesn't work well with android phones  Difficult, maybe impossible to set up  Very cheap and if you can get it to work a real bargain at black Friday $25"
Will have to charge every 48 hours. I got 1000 steps sitting on the couch changing the channel.
"The delivery was astoundingly quick: Same day. The charge and set up were ok. Initially the heart rate monitor seemed ok but it quickly was apparent that it was not. I checked the accuracy three ways: counting my own pulse, a medical finger counter and a gym cycle machine which has the facility built in.Sometimes the watch was accurate but it could be forty or fifty beats out. It woke me up at night to tell me my rate had reached 169 bpm. My resting rate is about 60bpm. I was just asleep not running a marathon.The product itself is a good quality. It does annoyingly keep on telling you it has succeeded in connecting via Bluetooth to the phone app. So if you walk away from your phone and then back again you will get a sound and a message.I also never found how to turn down the brightness for wearing it in bed. It is very bright and often lights up when you move your armI wanted a monitor for my heart rate whilst mountain biking and at the gym. This was not the product for me.This is unfortunate as otherwise it is an impressive product."
Weather doesn't get updated automatically...no complain as such..but nothing special.
"Bought around £22 in black Friday sale down from £99, funny it's £14 and you'll see why. Battery lasts 2-3 days, the heart rate goes from 70-100 o more while you're doing absolutely nothing, disappears all together. My phone I already had has better health monitoring Good points, it saves your phone contacts for calls and the sounds pretty good."
"Had this watch a few weeks. Was really pleased with it at first but now won't turn on, app showing fully charged. Returning it to amazon."
"Disappointed with the battery life on this watch. Supposed to last 7 days of use. Only lasted 2 days on a full charge, therefore, returned watch. A little puzzled by all the good reviews posted for this watch."
"The 'Glory Fit' app crashed repeatedly, so I never got to try the watch.Returned, pending a refund."
"Value but not suitable , reason being no BP tracker"
Sent back
I had to edit my original review as it did not meet 'community guidelines'.
"I am an Apple/Mac user and have always been spoiled by their ""plug-and-play"" aspects and philosophy. Thus, setup and learning curve time is important to me, and I am impatient with anything that takes too much time to learn and set up. This watch isn't worth the $30 I paid for it, but I am poor, and $30 is equal to $100 for me. The first issue is it seems to have more features than I can access. For instance, with Bluetooth, I should be able to answer a call. I can't even get it to ring. I can't seem to set it up correctly. The biggest problem is the screen stays on for 1 second, and then I have to start all over again. The software that you have to download (Gloryfit) is terrible. All-in-all, frustrating. The things that it does automatically and well are heart rate, calories(?), steps, and time. I have also learned how to set alarms. It works great for reminding me to take my meds. Now, I don't need to have a cell phone on just for that. Also, as advertised, the battery stays on for a couple of days before needing a recharge. Also, it has a nice big screen. I'm sure there is more, but I haven't been able to find a manual. Also, it is IMPOSSIBLE to do anything with a screen that only stays on for a second or two. I would not buy this again."
"Most features work just fine. The only issue that seems to be an issue, is the fact that my contacts aren't loading onto the watch for some reason, from my phone. I also can't see any text messages. Every other feature seems to be working fine, I can make and receive calls, but I just can't save the number on my watch."
"The watch was easy to pair with my phone, but my bed for a smart watch was basically just for texting when my phone wasn't readily available. Though the watch does show you your text messages and notifications, it doesn't let you respond. It is a good quality, the features are nice for fitness and health monitoring."
"The phone app needs improvement and band is very hard for me to put on. The watch itself is does work for me, it gives me notifications of low/high heart rate and when I need to get up and move. So far the battery life is great."
"It's a decent fitness tracker and smartwatch for everyday use, but there's room for improvement in terms of performance and battery longevity."
"The pedometer was stuck on 13,600 steps when I was on the treadmill for an hour.  Sometimes, it reads one number then after synching goes back 1000+ steps.  Great value, but if it's not accurate, what's the point?"
I actually really liked the way the watch worked. It fit nice and the battery lasted a long time! Unfortunately it doesn't charge. I even ordered a replacement to see if it was just a fluke and maybe I got a bad one. Nope. The second one I got also didn't charge as well. I'm returning it and getting a refund now due to this issue.If the charging issue was fixed maybe I would buy again but I will not because of it.
"I purchased this for my aging mother. I was hoping it would be a safeguard in case she fell and didn't have her phone on her. While it will allow her to call out, it does not stay connected to her phone on a consistent basis, which means it might not work for her in an emergency. I'm returning this smart watch."
"1) it doesn't track steps . The numbers bounce all around , way up , then down . 2) the clock time jumps all around3) the instructions read to download an app , but doesn't say which app, and couldn't find an app on app store"
"The sleep feature doesn’t work, along with couple more features."
"Screen keeps going back to the main or second page, I set the screen to 60 for the screen to stay on and it doesn't stay,,, and as I read the watch was supposed to have blood pressure on it and it doesn't- the is a major reason why I got the watch--- extremely disappointed, to me a waste of money. And just the other day it lost 40% overnight for no reason."
"I'm extremely technologically incapable, but trying to set up this watch only takes me to a series of scams and fraudulent sites. Unless I hear support or advice in the next day or 2, I plan on returning for a complete refund. If I could give thus negative stars, I would. Unfortunately, that is not given as an option."
I cant get it to connect to my cell phone.aldI just got the watch to work. The problem was that I have an older watch connected to Gloryfit. I disconnected the older watch from Gloryfit. Now the P99 watch can connect.
The app was useless and gave me more ads than attempts to log in and register. I didn't receive any automated emails when I tried to log in and it didn't accept my freshly submitted log in.
Watch is nice. But the glory fit web site to work the phone has a bug. It says wait until fix is added by mfg. Web connection worked for a day before becoming unusable with the app.
Can’t get the watch to pair up with my iPhone so can’t get the correct time on watch so it is worthless. Just a bad purchase.
Value for money  i also  got another 1 for a Christmas gift for someone  else
"Can't get the functions set right. App is not helpfull, neither is the manual. The reviews were all raving and 5 stars. For me even 1 star is too highly rated."
Update 12/4  Offer ed incent ive 4 updated five * RBattery life was good but tracking was way off.  Returned
"Doesn't work at all, won't download my contacts 😒"
I Love my new smart watch for keeping track of my daily steps and my blood pressure monitoring.
Not holding  charge.
"Hi! So I bought this watch like 3 weeks, and it is My first fitness watch, and I wanna talk about itLet's first list all the good things about it.Battery - The Battery is fine, it can last about 3-5 on a full charge and if you got your brightness all the way down. Charging it and waiting for it to hit 100% isn't that long.Watch Screen - in terms of screen and the quality of it, it is decent, it did got me more impress then I would think so. You can set custom watch face on this fitness watch BUT you can't not adjust where to put the time and you lose on features like your step counter and all that on the watch face if you use a customized watch face over a present that they give you.Comfortably - For the most part, it is comfortable as long as you don't really tighten it up, I know since I made this mistake and end up drying my wrist.Tracking Health - Seems to be accurate when it comes to tracking sleep and health rateEase of use - for the most part, yes, it is easily to set up but it is also frustrating to deal with this product. More in deep in the negative side---Now time for the bad part.Functionality - in terms of counting steps and all that, it's kinda bad, you have to walk like 3-5 seconds of walking before it stays cltining your steps and when you walk faster, it didn't really adjust it's counting faster but just go by 2, and sometimes you will be walking more then 2 steps, it has a set like tracking one step at a time or 2 at a time.It isn't accurate, it usually off by 1-2l steps compare to an step counter app on your mobile if you got it set up correctly. It really bugs me that it takes a few seconds of walking so it can start counting (it didn't like count your preview steps before it start counting).There is also a schedule alarm where you can set a time to wake up, and it only vibrate 3 times before stopping, what is the point of it just vibrating 3 times and stop?? It should vibrate until you turn it off, just like a smartphone would.But also not only that, I don't know if I got a bad one but... You know how the button can spin? It didn't do jack shit at all, yes you can press it to turn it on but you can't scroll with it  by spinning the button. What is the point of having a button that can press and spin when your product scrolling didn't work with the button spin.Sound and on Call - I don't like how badly the sound and on Call sound is. Yes the mic is meh, hearable but in terms of hearing the person back, it's really bad, you can't barely even hear then and there is no way of turning up the sound, at this point, just talk from your phone speaker.That is my review of this watch, it's kinda over hype product and it didn't deserve the praise and 5 Star review. I would not recommend this watch to anyone.Just save up your money and buy a better higher quality watch instead of this."
"This watch is only okay at best. the sleep tracking is way, way off. Also, the step counting doesn't seem to be close to accurate either."
"Everything looked positive. I had a similar watch before and this one was working well for a day. Now I have no display at all even though there is almost a full charge. I've tried holding the button down, had a look at the app to see if there are any options on there. It will be being sent back"
My son was really happy with the watch but one week later it wasn't working the same so disappointed
The company who sell this Smart Watch does not sell spare cable for charging his watch.According to MY-EU company you cannot buy it anywhere!…..you can get a spare cable for charging only buying a new watch!
"Battery Life is poor, it needs charging every 2days or less. Active screen stays on in less than 10 seconds which makes it annoying ."
"Worked fine for first few days, then only recorded data intermittently. Then stopped altogether. Rubbish"
"This is a warning to anyone who is considering purchasing this Fitbit model now - November 2024. DON'T DO IT! I bought this in April of 2023. When I got it, it seemed to be working fine. However, as the months have gone on - and as Google is slowly eliminating Fitbit altogether - my Versa 4 has started to malfunction more and more. Not only that, but the Fitbit app - for $10 per month - is no longer what it was at one point. Google is slowly taking away features of the app - and the watch itself. This company now, owned by Google, is being eliminated - do not waste your money. Go with an Apple Watch - or better yet, Garmin.Since my purchase of this watch, I've noticed a ton of odd incidents with it. First off, the GPS no longer works - so it doesn't track mileage, or speed or any of those types of things on runs, walks, hikes, bike rides, none of them. The sleep tracker is awful - and has always been awful. It can't tell when I'm asleep or awake. The heart rate data is wrong much of the time - showing higher heart rates than reality, especially if it is wet with sweat, pool water or the shower. My heart rate could be 70 - but the Fitbit is showing that it's 150. That is a daily occurrence. When I measure the ""stats"" with my Strava app on my iPhone, the Fitbit is always off.....sometimes by large amounts. The app features are slowly being changed and diminished as well - so it's not as useful as it was at one point in time. And, bugs - I've noticed lately that my Fitbit won't turn on sometimes. It just stops working. The wrist movement to turn the face of the watch on - that broke in the first month. Hasn't worked since. And as much as I want to like Active Zone Minutes, it's just not accurate. My heart rate will be 70, but my Fitbit will show 140 in the shower or sitting in the pool......so I'll get Active Zone Minutes for those ""activities"". LOLAnd one of the most frustrating parts for me is Google's elimination of Strava uploads from their Fitbits. When I bought it, Google allowed automatic uploads to Strava to see your rides, runs, walks, hikes, workouts, etc. Within a month after purchase of my Fitbit, Google eliminated that feature - and you can't even manually upload activities from a file.....it just shows it being empty. Fitbit covered for them by saying something must be wrong - but I found out through Google that they shut that feature down in order to drive Google Pixel sales(which don't work with iPhones, apparently).Today, Fitbit is ridiculous. It should be gone heading into 2025.....after Christmas sales. Do yourself a favor - spend the extra money on an Apple Watch or better, a Garmin. Garmin has every feature you could need or want - and then some. Yes, it cost more - but they work too! And Garmin isn't shutting down - that's why they're making the products they do. More accurate, more features, auto uploads to Strava, plus advanced features for fitness and training. All you could want or need. Even an Apple Watch has WAY more features than a Fitbit. Treat yourself right - and get one of those two instead."
"If someone asked me whether I like this watch or not, I would say that I like it. It is simple and the interface is decent. I do not want a watch that attempts to replace my phone, but rather one that complements it. I think that the Fitbit Versa is a good choice for this. It tells me notifications, tracks sensor telemetry, tracks my physical state, and has decent battery life. These are things that my phone cannot easily do.Other smart watches such as the Samsung Galaxy Watch do too much. I don't really care that I can reply to texts, browse the web, or essentially replace my phone. I always have my phone on or near me. If I am too busy to reply on my phone then I also wouldn't reply on my watch, an only worse experience because they try to cram a full QWERTY keyboard on it.I bought the Fitbit Versa 4 because one of my requirements is that the watch I use has Google Pay on it. It does not at release, but I'm fine with it coming later as it is not an immediate requirement. I also assumed that the fitness tracking on Fitbit would be good because Fitbit is basically the oldest consumer tracker company I know of, so I guessed it probably works well.Comfort - 9/10The strap that it came with is quite comfortable. I do not wear watches, primarily because the ones I have tried were not very comfortable.  This watch and strap is pretty good. I've only had one day tuning the tightness and position where it was uncomfortable and that was my fault as it was too tight. I also like that it is small and light. I mostly forget it is there, and am comfortable sleeping it with.Update Nov. 5th 2022: After about a month of wearing it almost 24/7 I have some irritation. Also if I sleep with it and put weight upon the watch band (the watch face going down in to the bed) I will wake up with a lot of irritation.Interface  - 7/10The interface is mostly intuitive. It is not that clunky as some smart watches I have seen in the past. The main thing I do not like and I didn't quite get at first was that the apps list is found by pressing the button. I didn't know how to use the alarm the first night because of this. But overall it works. It is mostly responsive, but sometimes not if it is rendering many things in the interface. I can forgive this as it is not a super powerful watch. I am happy with this.Battery life- 8/10One of the primary things that I want in a smart watch is a longish battery life. The more general smart watches' battery life is not that great. This one lasts about 3 days with the always on display turned on, which I am happy with. I will try it with the always on display off to see how it lasts. With sleep mode on it drains about 10% battery over 8 hours.Update Nov. 5th 2022: With display not on always-on, then it lasts about 7-9 days depending on how much I exercise.Sleep Tracking - 10/10I am quite impressed with the sleep tracking. I don't have to tell it anything. It just knows that I am sleeping and tracks it. Even random naps that I take in the evening. I do not know the times I fall asleep, but it is always on the exact minute I wake up. Good job on this, and I quite like it. As for the oxygen saturation tracking, I have nothing to compare it against so who knows, it could be made up for all I know.Heart rate - 3/10Oof, this is not good and I am quite disappointed with. During the day at work and home it seems to be fine. This is good for capturing my resting heart rate which I am interested in. But during workouts it is basically useless. I have worked out 3 times with it since I got it, and it is just wildly inaccurate. The only thing it is good for is using the workout timer to count my pulse manually. While doing some spinning in the gym I consistently measure my pulse at 170-180 BPM, but this thing is measuring as low as 90 BPM to 160 BPM, usually ranging in 130-150. I can forgive being off by 10 or so BPM, but this is just wild. Once my heart rate goes about 140 or 150 it just becomes useless. It will vary by 10 BPM each measurement, vibrate warning my heart rate is not in ""the zone."" Well that sucks. I bought this thing specifically so that I could track my workout, hoping because Fitbit is a well known brand that it would do this specific thing well, and it does not.Other -I like the alarm, but I think all watches do something like that. I use the weather occasionally, and the timer is fine. I would prefer that it sets the timer, and allows me to actually start it rather than automatically starting when I lock-in a time, but that a minor gripe. The phone interface is good, and I think that it summarizes the telemetry pretty well. I also like the default watchface, and have not changed it.Update Nov. 5th 2022: I did not realize this before, but the alarm only alarms for like 20 or 30 seconds before turning off. This is fine some times, but other times I need way more effort to wake up. I have no seen a way to configure this. I would prefer that it alarms until I turn it off.ConclusionIf I can find a smart watch that is similar size, as I do like that this one is small and light, I may replace it. Mainly because of the heart rate tracking. But I am very impressed with the sleep tracking, and i like the battery life and comfort so I am going to stick with it for now. I hope that heart rate tracking can be fixed with a software update, because I do want to like this watch."
"Even at the sales price I think this watch is way overpriced.  I have bought a comparable watch for around $40 which has all the features of the Fitbit plus more.  The clock face is confusing and difficult to bring up the information that you want.  The strap is made of very smooth but slippery rubber making it difficult to put on.  In addition, the strap does not have the traditional hook with holes but instead the band itself has hole in it that you must push the upper strap into - also difficult to do since the band is slippery.  Higher quality straps are available but also way overpriced.  The battery lasts around 5 days, depending on usage which is very good."
"The versa4 is a very capable smart watch - or would have been if Google hadn't crippled it completely.  Sometime back Fitbit bought out Pebble, the original android smartwatch, to get their excellent engineering and designs. The result was significantly improved battery life an some very good watches.The Google stepped in and bought Fitbit. Now google has it's own capable and quite expensive smart watches and does not apparently want a lower cost device competing with it. So they've gutted/brain damaged the apps the watch comes with (for example: the timer can only count 99 minutes) and with no warning banned third party commercial & hobbyist programmers from developing apps for the watch (with the exception of an endless assortment of twee watchfaces). This is an incredibly selfish and shortsighted  decision since a vibrant developer community makes devices like this valuable. For example, there's still Pebble development going on and the people still love the pebble watches ten years on.So, if all you're looking for is a pedometer/watch this is overpriced and overpowered. If you want a smart watch, move on because Google will not let this device succeed.The previous generation (versa3) still has some developer permissions available, if you can find one.Google clearly wants this product dead. Take the hint."
"I've been an avid Fitbit consumer for 7 years. For the past 4, I've been wearing the Versa 3. When my Versa 3 started to quit-out (after a long life) I upgraded to the Versa 4. I've noticed some issues in the first month. First, the heart rate monitor seems less functional. I often finish steady-state cardio sessions only to find that it wasn't tracking my heart rate during much of the time. This is frustrating as it's one of the primary reasons I use my Fitbit. Secondly, I've also noticed the tracker not counting steps even while I'm actively walking. Given this is the primary function of the watch, it feels like the Versa 4 is a downgrade from the Versa 3. I'm not sure if the Google acquisition has anything to do with this, but I will likely be looking into other smart-watches with similar features in the future."
"I like the clasp on this and I like the ability to change the clock face (although figuring out how to do so was a challenge). After a fairly brief learning curve, it is easy to change the settings using the watch itself. It is convenient to be able to set timers and start/stop exercise sessions using the watch.One consistent problem that I notice is a very sluggish sync mode. It takes quite a while for the watch to catch up to reality. And this morning, I manually entered my weight on the app six times and so far it hasn't saved although it claims to have done so.Since transitioning to Google, the quality of customer support has plummetted and I definitely miss being able to access the dashboard with historical info online."
"The estimated calorie burn for exercises seems to be okay, understanding that these trackers aren’t super accurate. However - this thing county “steps” when I’m brushing my teeth, chopping food, wiping the counter off… it’s ridiculous. Fitbit’s website talks about the highly sophisticated algorithm it supposedly uses, but nah. Doesn’t seem too sophisticated to me. Just my opinion. Personally, I’m returning it and giving another fitness tracker a try. It’s a shame because I had an older Versa that didn’t seem to have this problem, and I loved it. Used it to lose 40+ lbs. I don’t trust this one."
"Bought this for my wife.She really loves it and if it were compatible with her Amazon Fire tablet I would have given this a 5 Star, but unfortunately their is no Fitbit app in the Amazon Appstore.After doing some research (After purchase), I found that only Android and Apple products have the Fitbit app in their stores but Amazon was left out.There is a way to put the Android Fitbit app onto your Amazon Tablet, but it requires a lengthy setup using a 3rd party app that pretty much tells the Fitbit app your Amazon Tablet is a Android device, but I do not feel comfortable doing that so wife ended up using her cell phone that has a small screen.Amazon should have placed a ""Not Compatible with Amazon Tablets"" warning on the product page.Also in order for the Fitbit to work, you MUST/NEED to have an Android or Apple device to sync with the Fitbit as a controller for settings among other things and to be able to see full reports of your data.It is not just an optional choice to pair a Fitbit with a device, it is a must need to pair together.But wife is still happy with her Fitbit despite having to use a small screen on her phone to see her data.But that is why I gave the 3 Star's, still works as described, but product description also lacked what I would like to consider crucial information such as the Need to Pair it with a compatible device and that Amazon Tablets are not compatible at all and yet wife is still happy."
"If you’re thinking about ordering the versa 4 as a returning customer looking to upgrade your previous fitbit versa device, then you should know that this device is not it. Stick with the versa 3 if you have it, or order another brand of smartwatch/fitness tracker. Google bought out their competitors to sell more pixel watches and now they’re not taking care of the company. it’s a shame.Tldr: versa 4 doesn’t have any apps, and it can’t play music. sure, it’s sleek and new looking, but you’re better off getting a pure fitbit product pre-google. get the versa 3. it does everything the 4 does and more. no wonder this one costs less."
"I’m retired and have used my Fitbit for about 10 months. It just quit working. Tried everything that was recommended but couldn’t get it to start working. Fitbit is going to issue a refund. So I’m delighted with that. When it did work, it was great!  This was my second Fitbit watch and both of them lasted about the same time."
"I loved my Charge 5 but it would seem they don’t make them anymore. Disappointing and predictable as it lasted me longer than my first Fitbit.The transition to the Versa 4 has been a bit frustrating. I finally figured out my preferred settings, which made things more manageable, like being able to look down and see my stats while I’m exercising. Tapping/beating the watch multiple times to see my stats whilst mid-stride was not cutting it for me. I’m glad there was the “lifting my arm to view” option. Also touching the side button moves the watch too much and then my heart rate isn’t being shown or monitored for a second or two which is very annoying when you’re trying to check your heart rate in mid-stride. My Charge 5 did not blank out in me like this.Another annoyance is setting it to running or walking mode and looking down to check my activity and it’s asking me if I want to stop. WTH? No, I’ve just started! No, I’m still obviously moving, my heart rate is climbing, and the GPS knows I’m on the move. No!! Why is it constantly asking me if I want to quit the exercise?!I guess I’ll have to get used to these minor annoyances and/or features but the last one that I discussed definitely is not in anyone’s best interest As far as a feature of the Fitbit.Obviously, I like them enough that I have to keep buying them - - or that I keep buying them. Oops there I said it."
"I wanted to like this watch but I just can't. It was made and designed for specific purposes but sucks at some of them. I am going to return this and go with an Amazfit Bip 3. It has the same and more features without a subscription.Hardware Design:It looks good and feels good to wear. My arms are on the larger side so it looks a bit small but not too bad. The screen is bright and easy to see. The button is on the left side and there is no way to change the orientation for some reason. The bands are proprietary.Watch Software:It works but not very well. Buttons are hard to press and tend to scroll instead of pressing the button. If a tap is detected on a button scrolling should be locked. Notification are difficult to swipe away. Scrolling horizontally through the pages is a bit laggy at times. The most annoying thing is that there are a lot of unnecessary animations that take forever when going through menus. The worst are the animations for the app notifications. It first takes a few seconds to fade in the icon of the app an subject/title of the notification, then fades it out and fades in the actual notification/message content. It takes 3-4 seconds to see the actual content that you need to see. There is no way to customize or turn this off. I want to see the content right away. That is one of the main points of having a watch that shows you notifications.App (Android):The app is good at showing you your data. It has nice graphs and shows useful and insightful info. It does occasionally get annoying. It tries to sell you their subscription, or a warranty, and a bunch of additional features are paywalled by the subscription. Why? Why would I ever need a subscription? The watch and/or the phone app should be able to do all measurements and analytics locally without having to send them to a server. It does not take much computing power! The app also doesn't support global/generic app notification which means that if you have a work profile on your Android device, you will not see notifications from work profile apps. The work around for this is to install the same apps you have on your personal profile as you do on your work profile and just not use them. This is also true for the Samsung watches and many others. Why? I have a Pebble Time from 2015 and use GadgetBridge (open source and free) to get notifications and it works perfectly fine. When I called support to ask them about work profile notifications they had no clue. Didn't even know about the workaround.Fitness/Activity/Sleep Tracking:It seems to work well and seems to be accurate. You can connect other apps and services and see your activity there. One drawback is that some tracking/features are paywalled behind the subscription.Pros:- Great battery life.- Lightweight and comfortable.- Nice graphs and info in the app.Cons:- Watch App notification animations are annoyingly slow and don't show you the content fast enough.- Watch bands are proprietary.- Watch button orientation cannot be changed on the app.- Touch controls are finicky and don't always work well.- Animations and screen refresh aren't always smooth.- App has some features paywalled behind their subscription (other less expensive watches have them for free)- No support for work profile notifications (Android - work around is to install the app on your personal profile and not use it)."
"I really liked the Versa 4 but I just purchased it October 15, 2024 and now the battery is having to be charged every other day. I believe there is a one year warranty so will have to check that out because this is very annoying."
"I've had this watch for a while and although I'm glad they made the side button an actual button again unlike the last version where the button was horrible. The watch overall is just meh from the earlier versions which I really liked.There are a few main things that are ""new"" in this version I don't like. If you do an exercise, this watch will vibrate pretty much nonstop with notifications...at that point you might as well just vibrate every time my heart beats. This was incredibly hard to find in order to turn off but I did eventually find a way to turn off most of the notifications, but there were still some I couldn't find.I also don't like how it starts workouts for you without asking to, because then I can no longer just look at the time I have to exit the exercise and then look at the time. Really annoying.Last but not least, after a while of using the watch, maybe a few months, now it's battery life is just all over the place.  It'll be 80%, and then I'll look at it an hour later and it'll have a warning saying it's going to go into low power mode, which is also an annoying notification because you have to dismiss it to use the watch again, and at least for my watch there isn't even much time left after you get that message, the watch is pretty much dead at that point in time, and I can only look at it like one more time before it's unresponsive. So yeah it's battery has been lasting between 1 and 2 days lately and it's pretty much more of an annoyance than a watch now. I'm not sure if I'll buy another one since the quality has been declining so much since google took over."
"Battery would not charge watch .  The first time it did, the second time it would not and the device continued to have a blank screen.  I’ve owned several fit bits before and this has never happened."
"I’ve had this Fitbit for a year and a half. I’ve been very happy with it and it would hold a charge several days. All of a sudden now, it won’t hold a charge longer than a day. I feel like a $200 watch should last longer than a year and a half 😢"
i like all the updated features on this one but the battery life doesnt last as long as my versa 2.
"This is my first Fitbit or any smart wearable product. I got interested on Fitbits from my mum, who loves her Charge 2 and now her Charge 5, so i decided to get a more ""advanced"" version. Oh boy, how wrong i was...For starters, i'm not a fit guy. I do make light exercise, but i am not into gyms or anything truly calorie-burning. I did intend to change that with this watch, and while i still believe its measurements and will definitely ""take it with me"", it definitely kicked me in the more ""advanced"" features it promised.On the positive features, the battery lasts longer than the 6 advertised days for me, maybe because how little real use i give it, but for now i consider that a win. All the sensors and new data have definitely been a positive learning experience for me, especially the sleep score and profiling. Heart rate measuring has also been another really interesting data to track, and while i wish the SpO2 sensor data was available at any time, it's also been another positive addition on the data i can see and track.On the mediocre side... honestly i'm not sure how worthwhile is a Premium subscription. All it gets you is longer historical data retention (free is a week IIRC) and some vague metrics like ""stress management"" that i don't feel that useful, mainly because those numbers need other sensors that this specific model lacks like the ECG. I'm glad i still have 5 more months or so to try it out before paying, but i don't see my mind changing this month, nor on the remaining months.On the terribad, i do kinda regret buying this model, i should've picked the Charge 3. I wanted a light smartwatch, i didn't feel like getting Samsung, and while i would've loved to get the Pixel Watch, the lukewarm reviews and (still) high cost kept me away from it. So, while i do get my fix of body data, i want apps like Spotify and Maps. At least they're still promising Google Apps sometime Soon™, but i don't see 3rd party apps coming soon, and so do a lot of people over at the Fitbit forums. And to me, that definitely is a turn off that i wasn't expecting.Overall, for the price, considering i did not pay full price for it and that i like it as a fitness tracker, doesn't make me return it, but i will definitely explore my options a bit more widely whenever i'm ready to update from this one."
"I bought this because  I had the Versa 2 and 3 before it. This set up was easy,  as I hoped. But things have changed. Google bought the company. They have changed the operation of some features.  I still don't know why.  And abandoned some features.  I miss the bar code feature the most. And the assortment of faces.  I should have just changed over.  Bummer."
"At first I really like this watch it alerted me when I had a phone call and a text because my phone is always on silent, but the data information is not correct. I walked for 25 minutes on my treadmill and it only showed that I had walked 90 steps"
Overall I really like this watch. It’s far more accurate tracking steps. It has its quirks but overall I am very happy. I do wish there was a better minimalist face. The one I really like doesn’t work on this model.Update: Now it has stopped synching with my IPhone. It still pairs with my IPad but that is it. For a watch that costs over $200 I expect much better. This will be my last Fitbit. For a little more I could have bought an Apple Watch I bet it would pair.
"Battery life is amazing, but the timer suck only because I can't delete nor replace the pre-installed timers there's 2 just taking up space because I don't use/need them. Also a negative thing is you can only make 1 custom timer. Tracks heart rate,steps,sleep, weather, and distance. Although there's complaints about the band I have no problems with it. The band stays locked and the watch stays reliably in place unless you physically move it. It's light and unbulky, however I do find myself having to move the wrist band up a bit so I can do push ups."
"Second day of having this watch.  A+ for simplicity, speed, and common sense layout.  F- for the step counter.I was laying on my couch drinking coffee and it tracked that I had taken 480 steps and walked up one flight of stairs. I was only half way through my first cup. Umm..huh?We'll see how it goes. Feeling cautiously optimistic.  Might just have to ignore the step counter when I'm not exercising."
"I was very happy with my Versa 3, it lasted about 3 years and was fairly accurate. I have had the Versa 4 about 2 months now and am finding that it does a very poor job of tracking my sleep. Sometimes it misses my bed time by as much as 3 hours giving me a very low score when I feel like I had a good night of sleep. And recently it stopped tracking it completely, showing ""No Data"" on the app. After restarting it and my phone, it started tracking again but inaccurately. I have tried all the suggestions given on websites. Also it came set to automatically sense exercises such as walking or running, and when I wanted to check the time or my step count, the display showed a pace measurement that I never understood and could not find the explanation. After hours of research finally learned how to disable it. I wish I had bought another Versa 3."
"Like most smartwatchs, this one does track all my steps. Under counts them. Grossly inaccurate.It is also inaccurate when it comes to my sleep. I went to bed at 10:30 but and probably watched tv for15min. The app states I fell asleep at 9:16???? I was up at that time. Why so off?"
"The watch itself is fine.  I will never stop complaining about the charger on these newer Fitbit models.My original Fitbit Versa 2 had a little charging dock with four substantial copper points built into the back of the watch.  It was simple, easy, and durable.  That watch lasted for four years or more, even swimming, going in the ocean, and everything else.My first Fitbit Versa 4 died after maybe a year, and a half-dozen attempts to find replacement charging cables that would keep contact long enough to charge it.  The new style has four stupidly small spring-loaded pins that are easily broken.  Having done a lot of research, I decided to stay with Fitbit.  But I am super annoyed that the horrible charging design is rampant throughout their product line.If you too have been burned by this poor design, I encourage you to complain to Fitbit.  Maybe if enough of us scream, they will fix what is obviously a flawed and inferior charging connector."
"I find the device tracks steps well.I find the device has decent battery life with a fair amount of usage.I find the device fairly easy to read without my glasses.now for the not so good.The Mobile App does not resolve on my mobile phone wellThere are fields that overlap making it hard to read (see the attached pic)I find the sleep tracking part of the device fails to capture the fact that I FREQUENTLY wake up at 2AM for 1 hour each nite. I get out of bed and I read until I get tired.  The app does not always catch that. Sometimes it shows sleep from 2-6AM, sometimes it shows me awake for small chunks of time within the hour I am actually up.The band is made of plastic, it creates irritation if I start sweating.I also find I spend a lot more time putting the band on then I think I should, they could come up with a better clasp.This is my first Fitbit and my first health tracker.  I will be looking at others now that I have used this one for about 3 to 4 weeks."
"I purchased this watch on June 2, 2024.  It has been working great and I like it because it keeps me moving and I set it to get 10,000 steps per day. Also tracks my sleep so I know I'm getting enough. It stopped working on November 24, 2024. The screen is black, it will vibrate but nothing else and lost connection to the app on my phone. Contact Fitbit support and tired a few things but not able to get it working. Provided them my purchase information as well as selling company. They informed me that since I did not purchase it from a Fitbit Authorized Retailer, there is no 1 year warranty. I will buy another but not unless it is from a Fitbit Authorized Retailer. Gave it a 2 star rating because it is a great watch (second one I have owned) but disappointed to learn I have no warranty because it was not purchased from a Fitbit Authorized Retailer."
"UPDATE 1/27:  Still don’t like as much as my Versa 2 and no matter how tight I have the band on my wrist or how high I have the vibration set, cannot feel it when I get a text or other notification.  However, the on-wrist call answering is a nice feature and sound it very clear both ways.  Hoping I will love it but for now it’s not looking promising.  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  This is my 3rd Fitbit in 8 years. Hoping this one lasts longer than the others have. The watch is nice and everything seems to work okay. I like the heart rate and O2 monitoring but, even though I have the vibration set to high, I still never feel it vibrate on my arm when I get a notification of any kind (and I do have the band secured pretty tight on my wrist).  Also, miss being able to add apps like I had on my Versa 2. Added a credit card to Google Pay but haven’t tried to use it yet although I don’t see it anywhere on the watch (like I used to in the Starbucks app downloaded on my Versa 2).  With the limited color choice of bands available had to purchase a band I liked instead of the ugly colored rubber one that cones with it.  Still hopeful it will do everything I need and more.  That said, I ordered it in the evening and it was delivered before 8:00am the following day!"
"Update 10/02/2024:  I got my Versa 4 in June 2024.  I now have to stop the app almost every day to get it to sync.  I also have to ""manually"" sync my Fitbit with the app every day.As of the last Fitbit update, Alexa cannot find my watch.  So now I cannot use Alexa on my watch.  Amazon can't help me and neither can Fitbit support.  I have tried every fix that I have found on the Internet.This is my last Fitbit.  My husband has a $49.95 watch that can even make phone calls."
"Decent Fitbit but it took more than a day to fully charge initially.  It tracks and displays everything it says it will but for the price, the older version of Versa works just as well. It was a gift; I wouldn't buy it again."
"First time trying to write a concise review, and firts language not english so let's try:- Battery Life: Nothing to say, it's amazing how long it lasts (and more if you try to keep screen time at minimum).- Assistant (alexa): It's bad, don't buy it if you are trying to get an assistant.- Heart Rate: I feel it's good for excercise and what not, but I don't feel is reliable. I can put it over a table and it will mark a heartbeat, so it's odd.-The wrist straps are terrible. I used it pretty much all of the day (you have to if you want readiness score) and it made me get a rash. My skin is generally not that sensible but it happened with this watch.- The software itself: I don't like that I have to wear it so much to get readiness score. I don't understand why there is no integration with Apple iPhone Rings. Why is readiness score and other measures behind a paywall? After the 6 months trial I'm definitely giving away this watch to someone who's not interested in the other part of the software. Also, this watch doesn't connect to all notifications, just a set of them.Personally I checked what my pattern is for Readiness based in Sleep/Minutes in Zone and estimate it myself. Not perfect but gives me a general idea.I personally would advice to wait a little bit more for more watches to become available in the market or decide on what's more important for you and buy a watch that is focus on that niche. That or buy a flagship smartwatch.Sorry if something is not clear."
"While the UI is nice and clean with more modern colours, it is missing features that I regularly used on the 3.The big one for me is the Google Assistant. The fact that fitbit is owned by Google and yet they left out the assistant blows my mind. The Alexa assistant is garbage in comparison especially when you use a Google Pixel phone like I do.It's missing a ton of apps that I regularly used on the 3 like DISE, Notifications get messed up if you receive more than one in succession, also you cannot check notifications during a workout on the 4 like you can on the 3 unless you catch the notification as it arrives. If you receive a text message mid-set then you aren't able to check it from the watch without ending your workout.While the lack of Google Assistant was HUGE for me, the fact that I was missing features in every way in which I normally use my smartwatch made this device a no-go for me.I ended up returning the watch and instead paying money to repair my Versa 3. I genuinely don't know what I'll do when my Versa 3 is gone for good if this is the direction modern FitBits are heading"
"I replaced an old Versa 2 (screen went to black) with this model, based on the high Amazon rating.  I've had it 11 days and the clock face with its info has disappeared.  It was only after this problem that I researched the model and learned many are having issues with the operation of the watch, often soon after purchase, like myself.  Today I went and set it back to Factory Settings and downloaded the app again.  The clock face is back now, but I wonder for how long.  I do not want to be ""servicing"" it several times a month like that.  This is not the quality I expected of Fitbit.  I will be returning it and searching for another brand to replace it.  Very disappointed as my old Fitbit was great and gave me 5 years of service."
To many things to do with it and half of them work.
"Google in their infinite wisdom requires a Google account to use Fitbit.  Users under 13 can only use the kid's fitbits, but once they turn 13 they can upgrade their account and use an adult watch, or so they would lead you to believe.  The problem is that if parents keep supervision of any kind on their Google account or phone, fitbit will not allow them to sign in saying that supervised accounts or devices can not be used.  So as a parent the options are don't link their watch (which means you can't set it up/update it/etc) or allow kids as young as 13 completely free reign on the internet and their phones.  Will be returning."
"I love the watch but hate the bands. The bands easily pop off. I just bought another Versa 4, but if I lose the watch again because the watch bands pop off, I'm going to an Apple Watch and so long to  the Fitbit brand."
"My 1st fitbit quit working, and I came here to find 'something' as I don't particularly do any of the exercises in it.  My main interest was tracking my heartbeat and the 'get up and move' reminder.  The off brand was a struggle and just plain didn't do the real time heartbeat like my fitbit did, even tho it was supposed to.  I picked this one just for the rose gold face, got rid of that rubbery band and replaced it with a new mesh band.  I had kept my old one, but wouldn't you know, they changed how the band attaches.  Oh well, in between the off brand and the new fit bit, I had it on my Timex, and I just left it on the Timex.  I prefer the mesh magnet band now as it's easier for me to operate with arthritic fingers, and I really like the rainbow mesh.  I don't think that was an option to come with the fitbit anywhere I looked.  Now, if fitbit would make a gardeners version, with calories burned or hoeing or weeding, watering, mowing, shoveling.... I'd get a lot more use out of this thing.Nov 2024 update:  I got this fitbit a year ago, and the change in the band is that it is now magnetic instead of held in with pins. One side would occasionally let loose and the watch falls off, every time at home, up until about a month ago.  I was cleaning the windows on my school bus when it decided to let loose.  I don't know if hitting the blacktop from a 5-6 foot drop, or if I stepped on it, but there is now a Crack down the middle of the screen.  It still works, but is no longer water resist.  It is not by fault of the band as I'd replaced it and the same side was letting loose.  I've spent most of the last year worried I'd break it, or loose it altogether, and here it is. 😓  not wanting to get another one with  a magnet band!"
"I was excited to upgrade from the versa 2 to the versa 4. The battery life on this watch is amazing. Setup with my phone was simple. One great new feature is that I can actually take a call on the watch! A dissapointment is that the lost phone feature has gone, there are third party apps but they come with dire warnings ⚠️ 🤔.  Another dissapointment, the kayak trip tracking feature has failed more than it works. The specific kayaking activity feature was a major reason for buying this watch. So, it's ok but a little dissapointing."
"Have had a Fitbit for years, like an embarrassing amount, but I hate this new version! Already had to download update because it wasn’t updating between watch and app! The mist frustrating thing is during my run, it just stops and says are you done with this exercise! If I don’t see it, o miss out on tons of data. It’s also very difficult to hit end after exercise! I have to hit it about 7 times before it ends! Sadly this might be my last Fitbit, very frustrated with the fancy, unnecessary technology!! I don’t have an Apple Watch because I do not jeed that much input!Go back to double click to end exercise, take off all the ridiculous apps!! And focus on fitness!"
"I'm updating my review for my Versa 4. After eleven days, Google tech finally succeeded in formatting its app so my Android phone could sync with my watch. That's quite a stretch which makes me question their overall product's reliability.Previous review:  I've had this Versa 4 for ten weeks, and it worked. However, for the past ten days, this smart watch has been inoperable because of some glitch involving the Fitbit app and certain android phones. Amazon won't take it back because its been psst thirty days, and Google keeps putting off my demand for a refund saying it's not the watch, it's the app. What difference does it make? You sold me smartwatch you can't get to work. Won't buy Fitbit products again."
"Acceptable performance.  Distance tracker, not accurate from the very beginning. Compared to my friends garments, apple watches and all trails app.Now, at three months old, the distance tracker doesn't even work.  Still, struggling with fitbit support for a resolution.I wish I had just bought the assurian insurance instead of counting on the one year warranty.At this point I don't plan on buying another fitbit ever."
"Fitness tracking for 2 weeks, until it stopped working. Came back to life after dying working fine"
"I have had a number of Fitbits and they are very good, but the GPS on the Versa 4 really sucks.  It will many times not connect at all or it will connect but be totally inaccurate.  I went on a 24 mile bike ride and the Fitbit had the distance at 11.11 miles.  So far no help from Fitbit, just there standard list of things to try, and I have tried them all,  If you want a watch with GPS, don’t buy this one but if you don’t need the GPS then this might be a good tracker for you."
"Watch will not immediately turn on after charging.  I need to mess around with it, turn on the Fitbit app, sync the watch and try to get the watch face to come on -- you can feel it turning on but nothing is showing on the watch face - very frustrating!  After having this issue for two months, this time after charging, the watch would not turn on at all and the app would not sync. I called customer service, they were very helpful but it was a long process of deleting all data, removal of the device etc.Also, when I touch the watch screen it does not appear, I need to push the side button."
"I’ve had this Fitbit about two weeks now. I felt like my step count was really low so I started walking more. I decided to try to test it to see if it was accurate. Today I walked 1 mile in about 25 minutes and my Fitbit says it was only 500 steps. Usually for me that’s closer to 1,800-2,000. I’ve had multiple fitbits but this one is by far the least trustworthy. It also says I got 5 hours of sleep last night, when in reality I went to bed at 8:30 and didn’t get up until 6. I slept like a baby, despite what Fitbit says. I am very disappointed in my Versa."
"Versa used to be a competitively-priced device that delivered the perfect blend of smart+fitness. It found that nice middle ground and boasted features that punched above its price range. However, after Versa 2 and the Google acquisition, things dropped off a steep cliff, and Versa 3 and Versa 4 have been barely limping along as marketable at all.THE GOOD:GPS - Versa 4 finally got GPS and it greatly enhanced its use case. This is the only reason to get a Versa 4 over any other Versa.Watch Faces - Custom watch faces have always been somewhat glitchy in previous Versa lines. Versa 4 seems to have fixed most of those and most watch faces respond well with minimal problems.THE BAD:Sleep tracking - FitFit had the best sleep tracking technology on the planet and pioneered how wearables track sleep. Over the past 4 years, their tech has been eclipsed by virtually every other wearable due to lack of R&D post-acquisition. Google continues to lock sleep tracking features behind a paywall, and any enhancement or improvement requires a Premium subscription.Heart Rate - Heart rate tracking is absolutely dismal. It lags behind about 3-4 minutes of live heart rate. This makes the wearable virtually useless during workouts combining aerobic & anaerobic exercise, such as HIIT. It'll say I'm at 80% heart-rate well after my workout is over and I'm rested. I can't trust it at any given point.Value - This wearable simply isn't competitive anymore. Other companies put out similar products that do better in testing and in practice.Apps - Versa 2 & 3 had many connected apps options, such as Spotify. Spotify and many others are now absent from Versa 4.Conclusion:IMO, check out Garmin."
"I do like the watch because it helps me stay in communication with work/family; however, the Bluetooth doesn't stay connected half the time (I hardly have Bluetooth issues- I use other items that are Bluetooth), the heartbeats/minutes are inaccurate (this will show ( have 94 beats/minute when I am not even wearing it). The steps are close to being accurate. The watch has restarted on its own several times for no reason. When I can get another one, I will probably try another brand. If you want a cheap one to stay connected to your phone, this is it. You can send text messages by speaking into your watch; however, it has errored out several times, saying that it will not connect to your phone, even though it is in my back pocket. The alarm clock allows you to set multiple alarms, but you cannot assign them certain names- all of them will say, ""Look alive."" I haven't tried the exercising feature out yet since I normally wear it to work. The app is easy to download on your phone, as well. Just my thoughts since I've worn it"
"Let me preface this by saying that I've had different fitbits for 8 years now so I'm comparing with my own data. I always had Charge fitbits (which are very accurate) but I got bored of how they look so I thought of upgrading to the versa 4. You may think that as a more expensive device it will have better quality sensors but that is not the case. Ever since I made the switch to Versa 4 my active minutes dropped significantly, doing the same workout routine (went from 300 weekly active minutes to 160), which is really disappointing. Having known this I wouldn't have bought it.Aside from that the watch is very nice looking, the battery lasts me 10 days and tracks my sleep quite well. The band as everybody mentioned is a nightmare, if you plan to buy this watch order a compatible elastic band, those are much more comfortable.Overall I'm disappointed, tracking my workouts is very important to me and I feel that I can't compare my actual data with my old data because this device is too inaccurate :(If tracking your workouts is important to you get a fitbit charge instead."
"I'm giving 2 stars because I love the design of this watch so that gets an extra star. I'd give 0 stars (-5???) based on the new app.Ok, this is my 4th Fitbit.I've loved my Fitbits since the first one, each new one was better than the one beforeBut when they rolled out the new app they lost me.I can't even list all the way this new app failsI HATE it. I could get over the fact that instead of light/bright text/icons on a dark background (my vision is impaired and white backgrounds fatigue me). But the worst part is the sleep chart...WTF??? I need to track my sleep stages and my Fitbit is critical. My work schedule requires me to have a diverse sleep routine, the old app allowed me to track multiple cycles on a 24 hr period as long as they were over an hour long. No more!!!I've given it a few months, but now doneThis watch is practically new, but I'm giving up and going to an Oura ring.I've never used one, but it can't be worse than a Fitbit device using this new app."
"I do like the exercise and step tracker. However,  I just purchased in July and I now have to charge battery daily. This watch doesn't hold a long charge as started. Battery would die if I wanted to wear overnight to track sleep. Very disappointed and too late to return."
It doesn't hold a charge as long as my previous fitbit did.
"I had an original Versa, then a Versa 2, and now the Versa 4. They last a couple of years,  slowly losing functions over time, but I hate to keep replacing and setting up new technology,  so I wear them until the final death. For this one,  I expect that final time to be sooner rather than later, since it's only a month old and the band already self-disconnected from the watch while I was walking.  I just happened to hear it hit the ground and retrieved  the watch.The Versa 4 works just like the old ones; you can wear it in the water, receive messages on it,  count your steps, see your heart rate, check the date,  set a timer or stop watch, and see your sleep patterns.  I had more trouble setting this up than I did the previous one,  but finally got the clock face I wanted.The bands and chargers are more cheaply made with each new model, but it does recharge quickly."
"Yes.  It's beautiful. gorgeous idea, countless functions.  However they discontinued PC apps.  If you want to program this masterpiece, you do it on your phone,  No thanks!  I was shocked to learn that Fitbit was purchased by Google and Google wants to measure you pupillary distance every day, for hours a day.  It's even waterproof!  All you need is  patience to stare into a box a little longer (?) and less wide than a pack of Camel ciggies to measure all your bodily functions.  Not for everybody."
"This is my first ever fitbit product and I was hyped to get the latest version of the versa watch: the versa 4, which seemed to be a great value smart watch and the evolutionary successor to the versa 3.Alas, am I disappointed: it seems the business strategy of Google (the new owner of fitbit) is to ""nerf"" this product and remove functions, I'm guessing to force sales of higher priced products.What's to dislike? This new model for 2022 has (as of December 2022) very few supported apps, a handful of free clock faces and no ability to control the music on the phone (available in previous models). Clock faces can't be changed from the watch, only through the app on the phone. There's no media capabilities: no music storage or playback...And, since I use an iphone, data from the sensors are usable only in the fitbit app which has limited reports if you don't want to pay a premium subscription. Syncing to the apple health app requires using third party apps on my iphone, except that the heart rate is just impossible to sync and I only get to sync step count... which the phone already does.Maybe I'm too new to the fitbit ecosystem and just haven't learned to use the versa 4 to it's potential. But right now I'm just wondering: What's the point or this product?Based on the current limited functionality, I could probably have gone for a cheaper fitness tracker. And it seems that if I want more functions, then I need to see other smart watch options."
"I began using this device about two months ago.  On October 22, 2024, it stopped syncing.  I got the same results with another fitbit product I own.  I went through all of the steps on the Fitbit website to get the device synced and/or paired.  It would not pair.  Fitbit's customer support informed me that it is an issue with the program update to the app, and that all fitbit devices will not pair.  They assured me that the problem will be resolved.  I am still waiting.  In the meantime, I am, as a temporary solution, using a borrowed Ipad to sync my fitbit devices.  My advice is to proceed with caution and to act before return windows have expired."
"There are features that I like about the watch but find the readings inconsistent & inaccurate at times. For instance, I wear it to bed to track sleep but the amount of sleep I get shows significantly lower than my actual sleep time.I also don’t like that I have to Sync it several times a day. Once synced it often appears that data wasn’t collected during the “not synced” time. For the price I expected more."
"Fitbit decided to move completely away from their website support dashboard which has a FAR more friendly user interface for tracking total steps/distance.  Now they are going to ONLY app support which has many less features (too many to list but you can look it up). Therefore, I returned this watch and went with Garmin, which intends to maintain both their website and app like 99% of the industry."
"Decided to upgrade from my Versa 3 to the Versa 4. BAD DECISION! That dang active zone notification was the deal breaker. For the life of me, I couldn't cut the stupid reminder off even after a reboot/restart. The watch kept freezing up on the beginning we trying to set up. I did like the more options for exercise though. It will be returned and I'll just stick with my Versa 3. Sometimes another version ain't always better."
"I like the Fitbit Versa, on my 4th generation I think. This particular model is disappointing and I wish I had returned it during the window. I am not sure if this is just a bad battery or if this version has this issue. I like the band easy to work with, I like the display and at least it charges pretty fast. The other Versa’s I’ve had have at a minimum lasted 2.5 days before needing a charge. This one needs charged on a daily basis and doesn’t always make it a full day! Not happy with this issue and may have to shop for something else! This rating is based solely on the battery issue."
"I am a loyal fitbit owner, having bought the original Fitbit Versa when it first came out about 5 or so years ago. I absolutely loved it, especially the sleep tracking on the app and the week-long battery life. I even convinced 4 members of my family to get the Versa. My text messages and select app notifications would show up, and my nightly alarms were reliable. I decided to replace it with the fitbit Versa 4 after the battery life eventually faded. The Fitbit Versa is a big downgrade. I am extremely disappointed in this product. There are no longer 3 buttons, only 1, so now I need to turn off my nightly alarm my touching the screen, I can’t press a button. I am a dentist, so by day I often have gloves and a gown on and can’t touch the watch or even seen the touch screen. For phone calls and alarms, I have to just wait it out which is very irritating, especially when I’m holding a drill in someone’s mouth. To read a text, you now have to wait 2-3 seconds for it to first flash the sender, and then the message will pop up. They still haven’t figured out how to show an actual image on the screen, so if someone sends you an image, it still says “image” instead of showing it. in understood this 5 years ago with the Versa 1,but it’s 2023 so I figured fitbit wouldn’t been able to figure this out. Apple watches have been able to do this for years, so I am shocked that at the 4th iteration, this still hasn’t been resolved. The most irritating feature is that fact the the Bluetooth disconnects 2-3x/week so I consistently don’t get notifications and have to restart it over and over again. The only plus is the battery life, but I have to say it doesn’t even matter because this thing is basically just a regular watch and only keeps time at this point. Even loading my sleep tracking on the app only works once a week and I end up having to restart it or reconnect the Bluetooth just to get it to sync. Not to mention fitbit claims that my old bands should be compatible, but they are not at all. The band it came with gives me severe rashes so I have to keep bandaids on the wrist to cover the skin it touches.Absolutely regret this purchase, and am extremely disappointed in this product. I’ll probably get an Apple Watch in the next few month. Wish I could return. The end of a Fitbit era."
"I have purchased many fitness watches over time. I am very interested in the steps taken, pulse and sleep tracking. None would track sleep properly so I decided to spend more money on a better quality watch.At first the Vista 4 was pretty accurate but now it only records after midnight for the nights sleep pattern. This is very frustrating for me and I wonder what has changed since I first purchased it. Maybe it’s a software update that ruined it or are they trying to get me to pay for a premium membership? I don’t know what to think anymore."
Very stubborn about syncing with my I phone. Doesn't keep track of my heart rate very well so I don't get as many zone minutes as I did before. If I reset the watch -that feature works better sometimes but I have lost several hundred steps sometimes. I have not had it that long but I may be switching to an Apple watch soon. Seems like all this started when Google got involved.
It wasn't what I wanted so I returned it. Not as good as the Versa 3.
"I purchased this watch to replace my Versa Lite which I loved. I have been using this watch now for almost 4 months. It has been a great disappointment. The autorecognize feature does not always work properly. Today I walked for an hour and it only recognized 20 minutes. Now I am actually using the Exercise feature to track my workouts and not depend on the autorecognize feature.  When you open the app, it does not always sync automatically.  I have had to Google many times to understand where to find certain information such as the battery life, or how to delete the extra alarms. I am very computer literate, but this is not the Fitbit I knew and loved. May be next time, I will spring for an Apple Watch."
"Loved the Versa 3 till it quit on me. I got the Versa 4 thinking it's gonna be just as good, but no. Battery doesn't last as long, and it will die on me while I'm out running. The screen changes and I have to tap to get it back to the time.Using the exercise option is not as convenient. You have to tap twice to get started, and twice to end an exercise. The update also changed the fitbit app, and the way it shows displays on my phone isn't as visually appealing as before. It's also not as user friendly.If I had the option to go back to the Versa 3, I would.3/30/24 - Looks like the Versa 4 is more trouble than it's worth. It's not charging like it should. It will be on the charger all night, and still at 0 in the morning. Now it's not registering my steps or calories.  Frustrated cuz I've only had it 6 months. Waste of money."
"It’s an OK smartwatch: it has good battery life, is lightweight, has a comfortable band, and looks nice.However, it’s a BAD activity tracker: there’s nothing like going on a jog, looking down at your Fitbit, and seeing that it thinks your heart rate is extraordinarily different than it is. Then I have to take it off, clear the sweat, reattach it, and then boom, magically my heart rate is +50bpm… It’s so frustrating, it’s difficult to write.I would HIGHLY DISCOURAGE purchasing this. Go with an Apple Watch or other brand. Plus Fitbit is now owned by google so better believe they’re mining the data."
"Very disappointed with this purchase.It is a major step down in quality and reliability vs the older generation Fitbit devices like the Blaze HD.  It generally works but the software defined watch face I'm using will occasionally become frozen and not respond to taps which requires me to change the watch face to another one and switch back or reboot in order to restore functionality.  It also fails to record my sleep data much more often than my Blaze did.The glass face is not made from scratch resistant sapphire/gorilla/etc glass like you would expect.  Within a few days of wearing this it had developed permanent scratches across the face of the device from normal use (no hard impacts, no abrasive materials coming into contact with the face, etc).  I take care of all my devices and I can't tell you how upset it made me to see a $300 device develop scratches like that.  My Blaze HD that I've worn for 5 years solid has zero scratches on the face.  If you purchase this thing - a protective cover is absolutely a must have."
"Numerous times the watch has lost (or gained time), now it's gaining days. I have contacted tec support which helped with the time, but the days no luck! I was getting pretty good at keeping up, figuring the correct time & date until...it jumped 2 days, which made it Sunday-day to set clocks back an hour :-( . My watch is now 2 days ahead & 64 minutes behind, I'm giving up!The watch did last (even though I had issues with time) for a little less than a year, not long enough for a $200 watch if you ask me."
"When I purchased the watch, the charge would last 6-7 days, now 6 months later it only holds a charge for 2-3 days.  I only use the basic functions on the phone, nothing that should use up the battery.  It does not sync automatically when near your phone.  My previous Fitbit stayed charged longer and would sync easier."
"At first, this fitbit was great. I absolutely loved using it and keeping track of my sleep, heart rate, steps, etc.Just under 6 months of using it, the sensors on the back completly stopped working and no longer tracks anything but my steps.I've tried everything including updates and manufacture reset and it still doesn't work.I tried contacting Fitbit about it since it's still under warranty, however they were no help since I bought it on Amazon. I also purchased the 3 year protection plan offered at the time of purchase. I got no where with them either, because the protection plan offered was for an amount less than what I paid for through Amazon. So, now I'm stuck with a fitbit that broke less than 6 months after purchase, with the warranty not being honored and the wrong protection plan offered through Amazon, so it won't be valid either to file a claim."
I like the Fitbit but hate the band. The clasp is terrible.  It is cumbersome to use.  I have ended up replacing the band on my old Fitbit Charge 5 and my current Fitbit Versa 4.
Watchband was inconvenient and uncomfortable.
"I bought this in December 2022. By March 2023, the battery wouldn’t hold a charge and I received a replacement (the warranty is only one year).  It working okay, however, I wasn’t able to see my text messages on it like I was able to for a short time on my original one.  But I wanted it for my steps and to track my sleep.  It is now September of 2024.  Google (who now owns Fitbit) did an ‘update’ (I would call it a virus) which has infected hundreds, if not thousands, of Fitbits.  Customer Support (and I use that term loosely), is of no help and just tells you they will give you a discount to purchase a new one.  The ‘discount’ is garbage.  They are trying to ruin all Fitbits so that you will purchase their Google Pixel, which is more expensive.  I am upset beyond words.  I relied very heavily on my Fitbit to track my heart rate when I changed medications and to monitor my sleep patterns. This issue has consumed a large part of my time and brain energy, for the past week and an half.  I had been a loyal Fitbit user for over 10 years and a Google fan.  This experience has absolutely ruined that.  I will never purchase a Fitbit or Google product.  They absolutely do not care about the people.  DON’T BUY IT!!!"
"Having a Versa 3, I read the reviews which listed faster charging and the mechanical swith as the main improvements.I have to add that the removal  wrist band sensor was also a plus, my 3 was constantly starting exercise sessions because of wrist movement., or flopping around if I loosened it to prevent exercise starts.I must ask who at Fit-Bit decided that only one watch could be associated with 1 account and phone / app ?My Versa 3 I still want to wear for actual workouts and heavy work times. I bought the Versa 4 to have a better looking watch for walking around offices, casual outings....  Nope requires a new login and separate phone (it says). Not a fan. Google, fix this and while you are at it like it to one drop devices / apps !"
I've had to watch for awhile now and have really appreciated the app and all the data that it provides on the app.  Unfortunately the app and the watch have a hard time staying connected.  It has gotten so bad that the app hasnt synced in over 9 days with the watch.  I am currently only using the app to track my glucose as I was recently diagnosed type II diabetic.  I am currently shopping for a replacement.  It was really nice when it worked
"Can’t set up GPS or weather???  Directions very difficult to  understand, recipes in app should include nutrition specs. I guess you get what you pay for."
The device do not lock after you take it off. Anyone can steal your fitbit and factory reset. The money you pay for this watch it should have be more secured.  It have more features as GPS but I LOVED MY VERSA2 but it stopped working after wearing it at the beach.
"Versa 4 is okay as a fitness tracker generally speaking, but the sleep data tracking has been quite spotty and inconsistent.  I was trying to keep my watch on overnight for a week to see how the sleep metrics dimension of the smartwatch would do.  I spent an hour of research on the internet trying to figure out the problem and what I could I could do about it.  Turns out the parameters are excessively narrow.  One has to sleep at least three hours in a row before it begins to work.  Hey, I’m an old guy… say no more.  Also the watch is supposed to be worn 2-3 finger widths above the wrist bone.  That’s not going to work for me.  So, buyer beware.  It’s a decent smartwatch for time and fitness, just don’t buy it for the sleep tracking feature."
"I bought this watch back in November and I was teetering between getting a Fitbit or an Apple Watch. My husband is an apple guy and has an Apple Watch. I had the Fitbit Ionic and a charger previously. My charger didn’t last long, but I loved my Ionic. I thought maybe if I went for the higher end choice, I would like this watch as much as I liked the Ionic. I ultimately decided to go with the Fitbit because I had data going back to 2018.It’s not even a year later and this watch dies every day, so much for keeping a charge. It doesn’t record my steps properly and skips steps. It gets mileage is constantly wrong. Half the time I’m apparently dead because it doesn’t read my pulse. For being a $200+ watch, it’s a literal piece of crap. It’s completely unreliable. I get better reads on my fitness from my phone in my pocket than I do with this watch. I’m not just disappointed, I’m angry. I should have done with my gut, spent a little more, and got the Apple Watch.Plus the app has changed and it’s glitchy. I used it to track my cycle (I’m female) for years and it constantly glitches with that feature specifically. Doesn’t record cycles, recommends cycles that don’t make sense with my past history. It should have plenty of data… like I said been using Fitbit since 2018….Fitbit’s quality isn’t the same as it was pre-Covid. Stop scamming us and give us products than are actually worth our money. Do not buy this watch or any other Fitbit products. You will be throwing away your money."
"I have been a Fitbit user for over 10 years and though many of my friends have Apple Watches, I swore that I would ALWAYS wear a Fitbit.  That is until I got this Versa 4.  I had my Versa 2 for over 3 years and loved it.  I honestly did not want to upgrade, but the face on my Versa 2 came off and it was not worth the money to have it fixed.  I loved my Versa 2 so much that I considered just buying another Versa 2, but I decided that it did not make sense to buy the old model when I could get the latest model for a few dollars more.I have had this watch for 6 months and I am very disappointed with it for multiple reasons.1. The GPS tracking is horrible, even when I have my phone with me.  The watch is supposed to have built in GPS and you do not need your phone with you for it to work.  However I have found that the GPS accuracy is spotty at best whether I have my phone with me or not.2.  As you can see from the picture, the stair count is grossly inaccurate.  I had only walked up, at most, 6 flights of stairs, yet the Fitbit said I had walked up over 40.  Which doesn’t even make sense since I only had 3000 steps at the time.  I don’t trust the step count for that reason.3.  The battery life is horrible.  A fully charged battery may last me a day and half.  It is advertised to have a battery life of up to 6 days.  My old Versa had great battery life.  I only had to charge it once a week.Once again,  all I can say is that I truly regret this purchase and will NEVER buy another Fitbit watch."
"The media could not be loaded.                                                                                            Update 3:So, I was sent a refurbished fitbit in a paper envelope (no bubble wrap) nothing else. So I purchased a NEW and defective watch, 2 months ago, to now receive a refurbished one... Don't purchase a fitbit.Update 2:Device stopped working. After hours of customer support and attempts of resetting device, fitbit now said they'd replace the watch. A confirmation of the replacement was sent with a ""look out for the next email with tracking number"". Said email with tracking number never received. It has been nearly a week. I have ordered replacement bands, because the plastic on the original started to look worn after just 2 months. I also ordered a extra charging cable. I am now sitting here with new bands and 2 charging cables and a broken watch... I would not recommend fitbit to anyone anymore.Update 1:Well, it stopped working. About a week ago (2 months into having it) it just wouldn't turn on. I didn't hit it, got it wet or anything. Just went out of battery and wouldn't turn back on. I called customer support and talked to them for over 30 minutes. They walked me through a hard reset. MANY times. Turned bloototh on and off, tried everything. It's turning on now, however, in order to use the watch, it needs to be updated. All attempts to update have failed. Fitbit will replace the watch for me now and I hope to have better luck with the next one. I do really like the watch but connectivity is a pain, however, once connected, it stays connected and reconnects easily when out of reach. When it worked I couldn't make phonecalls, only accept and I couldn't write texts, only answer. I even signed up for fitbit premium (which I will probably opt out of). I really hope the replacement will work flawlessly, otherwise I may have to part with fitbit for good.This watch is amazing. Lightweight, great connection, easy to use, accurate measuring, awesome sleep measurements, I can take phonecalls but...I can only reply to texts, can't make (only answer) calls, it was hard to connect for the calls and alexa doesn't help at all. It keeps asking me for a pin that I can't seem to figure out....Other than that an amazing watch."
"This is a good watch, but the battery only lasts two days. I'd give it 5 stars if the battery actually lasted 6 days."
"My Versa 4's screen fell off randomly hanging by a wire, I reached out to Fitbit and they said that since it's servicing mostly out of the US in a country that doesn't have authorized sellers, I'm screwd, without considering the fact that I travel to the US often but they just plainly said no, not buying anything from them ever again and I'm already considering to buy a real smartwatch from Samsung and not this crap anymore"
The band / strap wore out at about 2 years old. You can buy replacements online.The non-replaceable battery started to hold a charge for much less run time (~2 days) by that point and the electronics seemed to lockup often then.It does not seem to be designed to last more than two years. It seems expensive for that length of a replacement cycle.
Charger i find is worse...the wrist band is worse. I lime my Versa 2 better. Havent tried yet but hoping my Versa 3 bands are compatible with versa 4. Charger is worse than my Versa 2. Still a good looking watch though I still love it. Just like the older style bands and charger.Set up...very easy
"I have had this Fitbit for a year now. The battery doesn’t last long all of sudden. Even the tracking I don’t feel it’s as accurate as when it was new. Often I’m sitting at my desk doing nothing rigorous, the active zone minute feature pops up, telling me how many active zone minutes I have just accomplished. I’m not sure I would buy this watch again if it is not accurate."
I received my package on time so thank you Amazon! Was really excited about the new interface but noted that recently has started having trouble recording heart rate and sleep as the green sensor turns off and I then need to restart to get it working again. Didn't have this issue with the older model so disappointing.
"I have had a Fitbit forever, most recently a Charge 5. Time to upgrade, tried this one. Worked great in some areas, but the heart rate monitor is off quite a bit. I tested it against my own counting while working out and it was under by about 40-50 bpm. Had to return it because that's one of the main functions we all want! I have had a Fitbit for years (as mentioned) but have had two really disappointing instances while trying to upgrade to the Charge 6 and then this one, so I shifted over to Garmin."
"amazing!! i didnt realize just how many things you could track until i turned this watch on. i love how versatile it is with bands as well, and for women how easy it is to track your menstrual cycle right on your wrist.the only thing i dont like is that it says its water proof I just washed my hands and it got wet a tiny bit and it died so fast after that."
"I upgraded to this Versa 4 because there were so many great, new features (I’ve had an Inspire!2 as a great starter). I’ve had my Versa 4 just over 2 months, and literally nothing works. The “Versa Calls” must be paired to your Bluetooth, but fails 9X out of 10. And the few times it did pair it disconnected immediately after closing my phone settings. Now it won’t pair at all.I set up The Alexa feature, but it only worked one time. Now it wants me to set it up again. No.It says you can answer calls from the device. I’ve set it up, but  I’ve never been able to answer a call on it. Again, it needs a different pairing on my phone, but fails to pair. UselessThe weather tile froze up the entire device from day one - so all i could do was force a restart. , So I just removed the tile to solve this issue - but I should be able to see weather, if that’s one of the features! But it was NEVER correct - it only showed weather from the time it was synced with the phone’s Fitbit app ~ usually in the morning. Anyway, if I want to see the current weather,  I’m already looking at my phone, so why do I need to see the same thing on my watch?? Totally Useless Feature.The Sleep Tracker worked sometimes, but the times were WAAY off from my actual sleep times. The last 2 days have shown no sleep activity at all… even tho I HAVE been sleeping.The settings don’t work. I set my screen brightness to NORMAL, and it immediately goes back to DIM. WTH??? WHY are these settings there to change - IF THEY’RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE???I’m so disappointed in this device! I’ve contacted Fitbit & they’re “Sorry” I’m having issues, but offer no solutions. This is a $200 dollar device!! I don’t have that kind of money to throw away on something that’s absolutely useless. I don’t think ANYONE wants to throw that kind of money away!!!I will NEVER invest in another FITBIT DEVICE! EVER!! I don’t care if they come out with the best device ever created! I’ll NEVER TRUST this company’s products again!If you don’t believe me, read their device forums. Don’t be a fool like I was. Don’t buy this device!"
"I've had a Fitbit for probably close to 10 yrs and loved it, but since Fitbit was bought out by a big tech company they have been dumbing down it's capabilities.  We are losing features on their phone app, not gaining them.  I bought this one to replace one I'd had about 6 yrs and it had finally died.  I didn't want to try to learn a new app at 70 yrs old.  Don't make the same mistake... They are not improving it, they are taking it backwards!"
"I liked the look, color, and size, but for the first time, this Fitbit wouldn't pair with my phone. It was frustrating because my last one Fitbit went bad after 15 months. I looked online and saw others are having the same problem. I thought I was upgrading. It's been difficult because when I tried to get troubleshooting, the tech guy left me hanging. I called back after a week of him not returning my follow-up, I called back. This tech guy was wonderful; he sent me the information I needed to return the product. It's very inconvenient though because it takes a long time for the return product to return and it will probably be a used one. Next time, I'll be buying a cheaper, different one from another company, so I can just buy another one. I have used Fitbits  for years, but I have lost confidence in them."
"My Fitbit Versa 4 started to develop issues where the screen would go blank and not go back on without forcing a reset.  At first this happened a few times each week and then got worse.  It was happening once or twice daily.  Fitbit support had me try a few things like factory resetting the device and changing watch faces to see if that would fix the issue.  It didn't.  They finally admitted that the Fitbit was defective and sent the request to their warranty team.  I submitted the receipt from Amazon showing when it was purchased.  They almost immediately rejected the warranty claim stating that it wasn't purchased from a legit seller.  The seller was Amazon.  I'm still fighting for them to support their product, but I doubt anything will be done.  This will be the last Fitbit I buy after using them for many years.Update: After weeks of back and forth, Fitbit admitted they made a mistake in denying the warranty claim and sent out a replacement device.  This one works without any issues."
"Had the first Versa since it came out. Great watch.  Purchased Versa 4 and received it the end of April. For the first months it worked fine. 4 months old and it’s totally a mess. Will sync occasionally, changes time and changes background.  No support has helped.  Might be time to try another brand.  The watch has not been physically damaged."
"I loved my Versa 4.  It helped me to know how much I have been sleeping, walking, all the things.  Then all of a sudden, BOOM!!! It won't charge anymore.  I only had it for 2 months.  Unfortunately I can't return it to Amazon.  I can't find any kind of warranty.  I don't know where to go for help."
"Battery life is great but it has had problems. First after 7 months the battery was draining after a couple of hours. I disconnected of gps and that stopped. Now a year and half later the screen went black and when I restarted it, I get a giant red x in the screen. I followed the help instructions and unpaired it with the phone and went to repair it and now the phone can’t find the watch and it still has an x. I will be searching for another watch, another brand. It’s a shame because Fitbit has the longest battery life."
"I was so excited to get a new upgraded Fitbit only to be so disappointed that , in spite of following the directions repeatedly, it would not pair with my iPhone, rendering it basically useless! I will be returning it."
"I advise anyone considering this watch to do some online research and see what other users think of this watch and the current state of Fitbit.I bought this watch in October 2023. It started having problems about 2 months later. Functionality such as stair flights tracking and sleep tracking started failing. I went through the usual trouble shooting steps, but the problems kept coming back. The problems have gotten worse until now the flight tracking and sleep tracking are all but unusable. Flights of stairs have been showing 50-100+ each day even when I actually get less than 10. Sleep data tracking is terrible and the latest app upgrade has made the data unreadable.I have contacted Fitbit about my Versa 4 and have received one email that asked me to do a factory reset. Nothing improved.Also, the GPS is not at all accurate. I walk a path that is just at .33 mi per lap. The Vera GPS shows nearly 1 mile for each lap.Heart rate monitoring is also suspect, but I have not been able to verify it’s accuracy.It does seem to count steps accurately."
"With most watches I wear mine all the time, except when the watch may get wet, i.e. shower, bath, etc...  The battery life lasts about a week.  I drops from 100% quite quickly.  The watch is constantly monitoring many things however I would have expected the watch batter to last longer than a week.  Everything else is fine.  The watch band clasp is a little wonky but thats probably a preference thing vs a defect."
I have absolutely no idea how anyone has anything good to say about this watch. I've been trying to set this thing up for 4 hours and it just doesn't work. The first step it says is to go into the settings of the app but that just doesn't exist. I literally payed 30 bucks to have something sent to my place that made me punch a hole in my wall. Absolute garbage.
"Perfect gadget to track my steps and to get notifications from my phone without having to dig for a phone in my purse. Super easy to set up, literally within the minutes from the box to functioning, connected to the phone. Measures heart rate too."
I'm fairly familiar with smartwatches & fitness trackers. And this one is no better than any generic $20 fitness tracker. Very cheap almost no options (even via the app) and can't add/remove sports activities from watch itself.
"The data on this watch isn't correct. It says 100% battery, yet the battery shows it is 50% .I will be returning."
No customer support number.This is useless to me at this point
"Can only be worn on left hand!! Health numbers it displays aren't real, thinks I'm asleep when I'm awake!! Doesn't receive messages no matter how you set it up!! Now spent 4 days trying to set up, it doesn't work!!! Spending a little more and buying a better watch is definitely recommended, mine is going in the bin!!"
"This item does not work. It changes activities as you go. You set it for walking and when you come home you have apparently played baseball, badminton, done situps etc. It counts wrong also so your steps are all wrong. So now off to buy a totally different brand. Do not buy this! :-("
"This watch was created to be used with a magnetic charger. My watch was sent with a charger that plugs into a port that does not exist on this watch. It’s unusable, as a result."
"I tested this watch for about a week.Given the price, it’s difficult to expect too much.  This watch does a great job as a basic smartwatch.  It receives notifications, you can answer calls on it, and it has basic apps.The heart rate monitor isn’t very accurate - it reports my overnight resting heart rate about 10bpm too high, and seems to read high during exercise. Most wrist-based monitors aren’t very good, but the monitor on the Garmin Vivoactive and Apple Watch are better, though I wouldn’t suggest using any wrist based HR for exercise, so this one is passable and at least repeatable for daily use.The two major flaws are sleep tracking and exercise tracking.The sleep tracking is very inconsistent - some nights it’s OK, while on others it says I sleep 1/3 to 1/2 as much as I actually did.  It’s unreliable compared to the Garmin, Apple Watch, and Oura ring I currently or previously used.The other major drawback is the GPS.  I’m not sure it actually has a GPS chip.  I used the watch to track two runs and one hike, while simultaneously recording vs my Garmin watch.  In all cases, the distance it reported was systemically about 30% low.  One run was in a challenging area for GPS, but the other was right along the Hong Kong promenade with open space above me, but the issue was present both times.  Same for the hike.  I’m not really sure what the issue is - hardware vs software.  The fact that the issue was consistent, and also that it read 0mi of distance when I was on the Star Ferry, makes me think it was estimating distance from stride length and not from GPS, but I’m not sure.So again, I think you can’t expect an Apple Watch for the price, and this watch does basic things just fine.  Could be a good first smartwatch for someone based on that.  But if you’re using it for sleep tracking or fitness, I wouldn’t recommend it."
"The device looks good and easy to set up. It looks small for the size of my hand.The quality of the material is excellent.I purchased it to use it to track my swimming, but out of the large list of sport modes, Swimming is not an available option in the app nor the watch."
"Capabilities are great, battery life is great but the fact that replacement bands are not available and you can't purchase commercially available bands due to the style of connector makes this not work for us. The silicone bands are problematic, they cause skin rashes. Give the watch a normal connector (peg) band or option to purchase non-silicone bands and we'd make this 5 stars in a heartbeat."
"Might have gotten a refurbished, rather than a new item, which wouldn't surprise me one bit considering it's Amazon. All the other Tozo products I have purchased are great and still working years later. The battery life on the product I received is merely a suggestion.. actually, it is abysmal. If you want to connect/sync it via Bluetooth to any remotely modern and decent smart phone like an S22 ultra or an iPhone Plus 14, just forget about it. You'll have better luck connecting it to your gran's 56kbps dial-up connection. The alarm function has it's own mind - decides to work on Saturday, but not before my Monday morning mandatory meeting. I hope anyone who orders this has much better luck than me, I think I was just unfortunate enough to receive a refurbished item (labeled as ""New"").. clearly someone returned it because it doesn't work like it's supposed to. But I have a friend who owns the exact same watch and loves it. Also, the company is great (both on my wallet and the products they make) and I've had no issues with any of their products. So please take my review with a grain of salt - because I do believe this product is good (at least for the price point) considering the numerous positive reviews."
"I bought it because it said it was highly customizable, but there are only 2 wallpapers for weather display (In app they call it dials) and both include a falling astronaut that is both annoying and useless for data. No option to keep display always on (max 15 secs). It does have a screensaver but you cannot customize it beyond one option analog and one option digital clock... the one thing i would expect a highly customizable watch to do. The one digital screensaver is annoying.When first received the watch, it is useless out of the box. it forces you to download an app for a name that doesn't exist (Tozo Health). I thought it was Tozo Wear (4.3 stars) because the only other option was Tozo Health for S3/S4 (3.5 stars). Welp, S7 uses the same as S3/S4 (android store).Common complaints in the app store include no notifications from FB WhatsApp emails & txt, lack of weather displays, unable to synch to google fit, not reliable in keeping connection (frequent resets), no reliable in measuring fitness, over measuring sleeping.An additional annoyance is that the app doesnt let you change some of the settings of the watch like screensaver, turn off delay (4 secs - 15 secs, and no option to keep on always), and impossible to customize stopwatch/timer.It is highly annoying navigating the long menu within the watch to get to stopwatch/timer. I was hoping the phone app will let you customize the menu of the watch for quick access... nope.For me it got too stressful not being able to have a watch I can look at to see the time (it is either an annoying screensaver that cannot be customized or nothing). To turn display on, you gotta shake wrist or press button... both are really annoying to do. Add the stress of finding out you cannot customize the display for weather. The little time i had it on got really annoying with notifications of pausing youtube videos, notifications for resuming youtube videos, and trying to navigate the user interface of the watch is a nightmare beacuse the watch will keep turning off.I'm betting the rubber arms of the watch wont last the daily use of taking them on and off for showers. At least they could have gone with magnets for locking the arms.Overall, not having the S7 is better for my health than having to deal with it."
"This S7 model does not have the swimming functionality like the S2 model, I bought this S7 model because it was supposed to be a modern version and they offer 100 sports but swimming is not included.I bought it for the complete swimming module that the S2 comes with, but I was not satisfied, because I already have the S2 and wanted to upgrade to the S7 but without the swimming module the watch does not offer anything different than the competition. I was disappointed and a little deceived because if the old model of S2 had the swimming module because this S7 which is more modern does not bring it, but if they say it has 100 more sport modules, it is a deception.Translated with DeepL.com (free version)"
"Watch kept saying ""turn off low power mode to monitor sleep"". Power saver was not on, we could not find a low power mode.  Sent FOUR emails, since there is no support line.  No answer from Tozo.  Would never buy a Tozo product again!"
"The device that arrived wouldnt power up. I charged it for hours, and it still wont turn on. Ive contacted customer service and havent heard back yet. I'll be returning this item for a refund."
The band came belroken. Stickers were put on indicating S7 but was not
Today is Sunday got it Saturday only worked for one night and doesn’t turn on anymore…
"Update: You can set your planned sleep time!  But if I get up to go potty, it stops counting sleep data.  Shows a couple hours of sleep and then it's purple for the rest of the night.Update:  I figured out the exercise mode issue.  Sort of.  The reason it didn't register is because I was using a standing desk & walking pad.  So my arms weren't moving.  I tested it by starting the indoor run on the watch and just moving my arm back & forth with it in my hand.  It only registered 9:24 minutes of a 15-minute test time but it did register on both the app and the watch.  And it did add steps to my daily total.  So, I upped the star rating to 3.  Overall, it's ok for the money.  We'll see if I get any sleep time tonight.  PS-Customer service is pretty good.  They will respond and try to help in a pretty timely manner.It is so hard to find one of these smart watches that actually works.  Mostly, it's the apps.  I think that's the case here.  I've had issue after issue with this one.  First, it wouldn't let me join Fitdock.  Kept saying the server was having problems.  So, I just continued thru setting it up.  When I tried to change the face, I got a blank gallery.  Turns out you need to join Fitdock and then you get a gallery of available faces.  The watch insisted I do a factory reset on day 2.  I tried everything but it would only work after a full factory reset.  So, I lost everything from day 1.  When I turned on Message notifications, I got a notification every few minutes on the watch telling me that my messages were available because I had paired a device.  Annoying as all get out.  Turns out that had something to do with my Google account but I'm not techy enough to explain it.  Then more issues this morning.  First, I did a 15-minute indoor run in exercise mode on the watch.  It didn't register on the app, no real info about it at all on the app.  Under Training, it says my workouts will appear there but there's nothing.  I did find a reference of 3:24 minutes in the exercise record on the watch.  But it didn't add anything to my steps for the day.  Seems like if you have a goal of say 5000 steps and you use the exercise mode to record a run, those steps should be added to your total goal for the day.  So now I'm not sure if it just didn't register the run, or if it will add to steps when you do a run.  I think it did show an elevated heart rate because of the run, tho not entirely sure about that.  No sleep record, either.  It registered the first night but not last night.  And finally, I tried to take my blood oxygen level and it just keeps telling me to confirm I'm wearing the watch.  One good thing is you can use your own picture as a face.  I have a picture of a cute drawing my granddaughter did when she was little.  That's drawing me in (no pun intended).  Cuz it's pretty cool to look at your watch and see your granddaughter's drawing.  But the bad thing is you can only put time and date on your own picture.  I want steps and a battery icon.  Which brings up another gripe.  A lot of the faces don't have the battery icon.  But that brings up another good thing.  The battery seems like it will last a good while.  With all the messing around I've been doing with it over the last couple days and it's still at 95%.  So, my decision is do I keep it as just a watch with my granddaughter's picture and take hit or miss on everything else.  Or do I return it and try another one."
I bought this watch in June 2024 and am happy with it for what I paid. I do not use a lot if the features and mostly needed a watch with step tracking. It is very sensitive and so sometimes the step count is not accurrate. When I cook or crochet it picks up a lot of steps despite me being in one spot. I also did not like the silicone strap so I swapped that out for adifferent one. However overall a decent watch so I decided to buy a second one for my daughter in September 2024. However it's not the same watch.  Nothing in the product page shows any change since I bought the first one so we thought we were getting the same thing. The face is bigger (not sure hiw well that shows up in the picture but it's very noticeable in person) and has a different charging connection and charger. The face is too big and uncomfortable on the new one if you have small wrists like her and I. Also the fact that they slightly changed the charger means we cannot share chargers.  We opted to return it and find her something else
"Let me start saying that I hate to wear any wrist accessory, including bracelets and watches….or even rings.  Possibly not being a good candidate for wearable monitors I expect more may be?I bought this smart watch only for one reason, I wanted to check my sleep pattern to see all the different phases of my night sleep. If you are looking for a review of a wellness device this is for you.I wore it asap I received it.I Downloaded the app and sync it.  I wore in on left side (that is where I measure my BP with a traditional cuff).  Although I expected not to be accurate as a blood pressure monitor…..I assumed at least the sleep pattern function had some accuracy.I wore the watch for 18 hrs and tested steps and all functions related to wellness.Lest say that none of the functions listed for wellness will be ever accurate enough in any of these devices for the time being.  Consider that an Oxymeter needs to read on finger not on top of the wrist and that a regular blood pressure wrist cuff lacks of accuracy as well.  So, you cannot expect this type of accuracy from any wearable monitors.  However based on movement and HR (heart rate) I thought it would give me some sleep pattern precision.  It did not even registered the 2 times I woke up at night to pee.  It just gave me a total of hrs sleep split in Light sleep and Deep sleep.  Not enough details for me on the app graph.  It also did not register my HR at night, or it failed to display it on the app screen on phone.Hearth Rate function overall sucked too.  It gave me a reading of same HR for resting, minimum and maximum.The timer and steps functions are useless to me…..I already use the sensor of my samsung phone. I cannot be bothered with the timer for the aerobics, I always used a traditional chronograph stop watch for training.Other functions such as music and messaging or phone calls I cannot write a review on those.In summary if you are using this as a wellness monitor, do not buy it because it will give you very inaccurate functions like O2, Blood Pressure, HR recording (through the night) and Sleep Pattern important details."
"Although this watch does exactly what it says it will do for you...The battery does last for several days, I believe it is a week, not all that sure... never tracked it. It does charge fairly quickly, but you need to clean the receptor on the watch before attaching the plug or it won't charge. If your sweats a little, skin does shed cells, this will hinder full contact to charge the watch battery.I HATE the watch band. It is more of a total pain than anything.It causes a rash if the arm sweats a little, so off it comes! If you wait too long a drash developsThe two bands that are supposed to hold the end of the strap from flopping around... well they DON'T!That is annoying!Would I buy it again, only if there is a different watch strap!"
"I bought two of these for my sister and I. Love the look and it was pretty easy to set up and use.  My strap broke  a few weeks after getting it when just doing a normak movement  It turned out to be where the metal spring snaps into the side, it was just rubber and the rubber chipped away so there was no way to put it back together.In good faith, and because I liked the watch...I bought the SAME watch again...this time it broke just putting it on and I was definitely  being careful. I only had it two weeks this time.!Not buying another one. Its a poor design."
I received it October 13 and loved it but last night it just stopped working the screen is black and it won't connect to my phone and yes it was charged when it stopped working still had over 50% on the battery.
"The watch itself was okay. But finding a replacement charger cord has proven to be more difficult than what I thought. I have reached out to the company, with no response. I've also purchased several universal watch chargers, and none of them work."
There are very few watch faces and to get a good one you have to buy it. There are comparative watches that offer better watch faces for free. The size is good but the overall is not
"I think the watch looks great. It has many options and features. However, the instructions are lacking. I can't seem to find out what I am looking at when I scroll up.I was only able to see my messages for a brief period? Did I press the wrong button? Don't know. Limited instructions"
Was doing great and wearing it every day to track fitness and it would connect to my bluetooth ear phones for music too. (Pause skip etc)But i changed the setting for screen to turn on whenever i raise my hand and throughout the day it changed itself to another language (asian but not sure what kind) so im not able to change it and it only really counts my steps now because thats the only thing i can understand on it since its numerical.
"Update: after leaving the positive review below the watch started giving erratic heart rate readings, stopped recording sleep and the step count went crazy.Too bad as I really liked the watch but with 3 of the most important metrics in my view not realistic I will be returning this watch and look for something else.Given the price of this watch I wasn’t expecting a high end watch functionality but so far have been pleasantly surprised.The following data I have compared with my garmin and Fitbit -Sleep data seems close in accuracyBattery life is consuming about 10%/day with heart rate, SPo2 and sleep sensors turned on.I am not using the drink/stand reminders so can’t speak to that.Fit and finish of the watch appear good, I did change out the band though as I found the one it came with to big and not aesthetically pleasing.I am not sure what they mean by “continuous” heart rate monitoring but it appears to be somewhere close to every 5 min., that would be the only downside so far if you are looking for something more frequent.Step accuracy is close for a watch that does not have built in gps, slightly higher by about 10%.Overall if you are looking for an economical smart/fitness watch this would be a good basic choice and I would recommend on that criteria.FitCloudPro app is not bad for details but it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of a higher priced garmin/Fitbit app."
Love the color of it and how it works . Only thing is that it’s hard to access the other features on the watch . It doesn’t swipe easy.
It is a decent watch. But it continually disconnects from my phone. I have to reconnect it everyday. Battery life is decent. There is a delay in notifications. Call wise the watch doesn't provide a notification until the caller has already hung up. And you can't respond to text messages via the watch. But it was cheap so I guess you get what you pay for.
"I bought this in hopes that I would love it and it was affordable.  It worked great for a couple of weeks and the. It broke, the wristband completely broke off.  My neighbor had bought the same watch and it did the same thing.  Just beware it’s a great watch but doesn’t have much life in it"
I got this watch to help me get in shape and track how many calories I burn throughout the day and during workouts. The step counter is completely off. I can walk for a couple minutes and take maybe 100 steps and it's telling me I've walked 300. That also throws off the calorie burning feature. About all I use it for is to track sleeping patterns and give me notifications from my phone.
Nice looking product I just don’t want it.
You must use app to be able to see your biometrics. Cannot see on watch. Also cannot control music through phone.
Day 2 - I walked from my bed to my bathroom and it said I walked 33 steps.  It is 7 at most.  So I'm wondering if the totals are accurate.
The oxygen level is way off.  It’s saying my levels are 96-98 when at Urgent Care it’s actually 89!! One reason I got this watch was for my 02 levels. I would not recommend
I've had this watch for 6 months and I need to get a new one. It works for the $20 I spent on it and will probably get one similar. The app is not entirely user friendly and the US doesn't come up on the app unless you're using androids version.
"i didnt have high expectations as this was pretty inexpensive. mine doesnt track sleep for some reason, miles walked/run arent accurate, but you get what you pay for and it gives me an idea of how far ive gone and the battery lasts well, its easy to setup n use. alot of the reviews say it is Not waterproof, so i'm not going to test it. all in all, im relatively happy with it."
"I was looking for a watch to help me train for a road race and not spend a lot of money.  This watch is perfect!  It has a set timer, counts steps, mileage, resting heart rate, etc.  Much more than I thought for the price.Highly recommend.Edit...after a couple of months 1/2 of my watch band popped out of the watch face and can not be repaired after numerous attempts.  Since the return window has expired, I ordered another watch to see if I have better luck.  I lowered my rating to 3 stars as well until I see if the replacement supports day-to-day living."
The app for this watch was easy to setup but the watch was defective when it arrived. It has these lines across the bottom of the screen that affects what you can see on the screen so it has to be returned.
The upload picture option works but it is cover with a black static tint over it which sucks. I don’t get notifications even though it connected. But I guess I can’t expect too much for a watch under $20
"I've had an Amazon $60 no name smart watch for 3 years. It's worked fine and I can't complain except I wanted a smaller watch since I have small wrists. I stumbled on this watch at 41mm and took a chance for $18. At first the watch was great, perfect size and bright solid display that is easy to read in sunlight (which my other watch is not). The band is too long and poorly designed. The end constantly flapping around became annoying. The software is nice and watch appeared to be accurate, even though with minimal functions. Unfortunately, the watch does not turn on when you turn your wrist towards you like my first watch. Very annoying to have to push the button each time to check time. Despite these annoyances, I decided to keep the watch until I started wearing both watches and monitoring my steps. This watch tabulated approximately 2,000 more steps each day than my old watch. I blamed the old watch for being inaccurate until one day I walked and looked at the watch display of this watch. It was counting 3-5 steps for everyone I took! That was the final nail in the coffin, I have to have an accurate step count. Watch was reluctantly returned and I continue to wear my 3 year old Kinnex smart watch. Now if I could just find a 41mm watch with all the functions and accuracy of my current watch, I would make the purchase. So sad to send this back, but the need to push the button to see the time, the extra long and ungainly strap and the step counter inaccuracy doomed this watch."
"There is no useful information about use and setup. There is no link to an on-line user manual. Phone says connected to watch, and yet the crappy app doesn't recognize phone. Wake gesture doesn't work. Can't get additional watch faces. App keeps asking about Alexa, but I don't care about Alexa. The list of problems goes on and on. I gave it 2 stars because I mainly wanted a watch with a large time display and I have that. The rest would be nice if it worked."
Too large for my wrist and I thought I could receive and make calls.
"This watch takes a long time to charge and I feel like I have to recharge it every 2 days.  My previous smart watch lasted over a week on one charge.  The steps are not accurate.  The watch shows way more steps than the health app on my phone.  I cannot find a way to change the step length.  Also, the app keeps telling me to save data but will not let me create or login into my account."
I should have read the description before I purchased.  This watch doesn't have half of the features of the tik tok watch that I purchased for less money.  It's a beautiful watch but I need more.  Returning.
The device has been working well. I do not that the purple color is much lighter than displayed online.I did not try to return because the light color band is already discolored.
"So what I like about this watch was one the price, it keeps track of my sleep, steps, stress, heart rate and oxygen levels.What I don't like is you cannot get the weather right with it, even with it hooked up and connected it still doesn't work right, I  should of went better and I got what I  paid for, that's my fault.People older who doesn't care too much about technology would be great for this watch, I need something better that will connect to my diabetes monitor."
"This is pretty much a fit bit. If that's all you're looking to keep track of them it's worth it for the price. However, the watch constantly un-syncs with my phone, will NOT show any kind of notifications from my phone on the watch, calls, texts etc. ANYTHING....it's just a health tracker 🤷🏼‍♀️"
"At the beginning the watch worked perfectly find for what I needed it for, then I started noticing the issues. One thing is the step counter is not as accurate. To get it down better then you have to switch the activity level to what you are doing at the time. That's cool but I would still like to get a better track just from everyday walking. The biggest issue now is the charge. It was good for 6 months and held a good charge but now I would charge to 100% in the morning and its dead by noon. Not cool."
"My daughter got for her birthday. She has not had good luck with it. She now needs a charger. How can we go about getting one? If not, I will have to buy another watch. Help!"
Watch was great. I got it less than a week ago and it stopped working. It keeps giving me an error. Is there someone to contact to get it resolved?
"Not very comfortable, band slips out all the time and is too long. Holds moisture under face, no breathing. Can't really complain for $20, just used to Fitbit"
"I’ve only had this less than 2 months, I loved it, however, even though it was paired to my Bluetooth, it lost time, weird.  I tried restarting it, I shut it down, nothing it was over a 20 minute time loss even though it stated it was paired.  I then tried resetting it, and now it doesn’t work at all."
"it's ok for what it is, however the green sensor light on mine won't stop blinking even when the watch is powered off"
"There isn't a lot of help or documentation with this device, making it difficult to get answers when you have questions. The app has what it says is ""AI"" customer service, but it's just a normal chatbot with extremely limited canned responses - in short, it too is no help at all.The watch band is uncomfortable and I can't see any way to swap it out with a fabric band that would breathe better. Much of the health data is completely indecipherable - i.e., what does ""avg. pace 6'56"" "" even mean? It's a complete mystery that's not answered anywhere. Here the lack of documentation really hurts the performance. Data is useless, if you don't know what it means.Other features seem to work well. The heart rate seems to be correct and the steps also seem to be right. It took a while to find the blood oxygen reading, which I think is probably off by 3-4% to the low side, which seems like a lot. I did create an account with the app, but when I try to log in to use it, it tells me it does not exist. Again, there's no customer service to help deal with these sorts of problems.All in all, it's probably better than an app you could download on your phone for free. But not much. I really wish I hadn't gone cheap on this thing."
Liked price. This device counted higher steps than previous device.
Didn't have as much stuff as my last one
"I ordered this for a reading of my heart, it does not read it right, my fitbit keep the right heart beat I need it for AFIB"
It was smaller and the face was small and it was not digital and hard to read and see the picture above is othing likeI received
I do like the watch and it’s functionsBut i really wanted the purple butterfly and it’s just coming up. That is so disappointing
"The pros - good battery life, nice bright displaythe cons - CANNOT link to phone.  it's good for a stand alone, but I miss the ability to see what I've done on my phone."
"It worked great for the first 3 months, it was a little buggy with the sleep tracker, and the silicone band was ok. It connects to your phone so it's super easy to set up. The only issue is after about 3 months it stops counting your steps, so it's a glorified heart rate reader. Because that's all that really works after that point."
I like the color and the fact that I can’t count my steps but it wasn’t about to connect it to my phone. I wear it everyday anyway!
Im very happy with the watch however have had it only one month and the wristband is broken after normal wear. The pin attachment on strap is of very poor quality.
The screen is small if you don't use one of their backgrounds you can't have your tracking information on the whole screen you have to literally go in the app into the device part to get your information
"I'm disappointed. This watch doesn't have a reminder to drink water. They have one for sedentary,  but it's every hour. You can't modify the time."
I mean I don’t k is why I expected more.  The text notifications don’t work. It does sync on its own the phone without me having to constantly do troubleshooting. It’s just until I get a new Apple Watch. But it’s barely counting steps accurate and reporting that the my health app on my iPhone.
This watch face is awful. It is too small and terrible to try to read. I’ve thought about returning it but I think ill donate it to a second hand store.
I was disapointed in the watch because it would add steps when you are driving in the car.  In one day it added over 5000 steps when I was in the car.  I did like the look and the band was comfortable.  It was easy to set up too.
I would need a cloth band. The plastic is sweaty. It was difficult to get readings from. I couldn't get it to read but one sleep.
Help! Is this any sort of warranty for this? I bought it and loved it and put it on for the fifth day in a row after buying it and the band snapped by watch face. I’m crushed. I really liked this watch. 🥲
"The color is SO off from it's representation! Not even close. When I paired it with my phone, it totally reset my phone."
Can't check text with it
Not the best. Good easy to us app. Great color wristband . Can customize watch face. But not sure it accurately records steps. And the screen cracked already.
"Okay so like I said in the title good watch but totally inaccurate step counter I say this because before I got this I had average 20 - 25k steps on my apple watch which I had before this and didn't feel like spending $100+ so got this. Now I have the same routine wake up do schoolwork, workout, and play basketball for 5 hours but in all that time I wind up getting 8 - 9k steps. Yeah so like I said if you aren't worried about the accuracy which I kinda don't but wanted to address for anyone I would recommend it good appearance, kinda worth your money, very easy to use, like a 7 day battery life, not that comfortable but can get replacement bands. Just search 22m band hope this is helpful"
"I bought this to replace a Yoyofit activity tracker that I've worn daily for over a year, but misplaced the charging cable for. In that time I must have whacked it on any number of things inadvertently and the crystal only recently started to show any damage. I've been wearing this new one for a little over a week and it's already scratched. I definitely would NOT buy this brand again."
